<p><bold>Background</bold>. The relationship of a primary care provider’s (PCP’s) colorectal cancer (CRC) screening strategies to completion of screening is poorly understood. <bold>Objective</bold>. To describe PCP test recommendation patterns and associated factors and their relationship to patient test completion. <bold>Design</bold>. This cross-sectional study used a PCP survey, in-depth PCP interviews, and electronic medical records. <bold>Setting</bold>. Kaiser Permanente Northwest health maintenance organization. <bold>Participants</bold>. Participants included 132 PCPs and 49,259 eligible patients aged 51 to 75. <bold>Measurements</bold>. The authors grouped PCPs by patterns of CRC screening recommendations based on reported frequency of recommending fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS), and colonoscopy. They then compared PCP demographics, reported CRC screening test influences, concerns, decision-making and counseling processes, and actual rates of patient CRC screening completion by PCP group. <bold>Results</bold>. The authors identified 4 CRC screening recommendation groups: a “balanced” group (<italic>n</italic> = 54; 40.9%) that recommended the tests nearly equally, an FOBT group (<italic>n</italic> = 31; 23.5%) that largely recommended FOBT, an FOBT + FS group (<italic>n</italic> = 25; 18.9%), and a colonoscopy + FOBT group (<italic>n</italic> = 22; 16.7%) that recommended these tests nearly equally. Internal medicine (v. family medicine) PCPs were more common in groups more frequently recommending endoscopy. The FOBT and FOBT + FS groups were most influenced by clinical guidelines. Groups recommending more endoscopy were most concerned that FOBT generates a relatively high number of false positives and FOBT can miss cancers. The FOBT and FOBT + FS groups were more likely to recommend a specific screening strategy compared to the colonoscopy + FOBT and balanced groups, which were more likely to let the patient decide. CRC screening rates were 63.9% balanced, 62.9% FOBT, 61.7% FOBT + FS, and 62.2% colonoscopy + FOBT; rates did not differ significantly by group. <bold>Limitations</bold>. Small numbers within PCP groups. <bold>Conclusions</bold>. Specialty, the influence of guidelines, test concerns, and the “jointness” of the test selection decision distinguished CRC screening recommendation patterns. All patterns were associated with similar overall screening rates.</p>

<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X11406285">1</xref></sup> Early detection of high-risk precancerous lesions and of early stage cancer through appropriate screening is associated with decreased incidence of and mortality from CRC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X11406285">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X11406285">3</xref></sup> The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that men and women of average risk begin screening for CRC at age 50.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X11406285">4</xref></sup> There is good direct evidence for the effectiveness of fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), good direct evidence for the effectiveness of sigmoidoscopy, and indirect evidence for the combined use of FOBT and sigmoidoscopy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X11406285">5</xref></sup> as well as colonoscopy alone,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X11406285">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X11406285">10</xref></sup> in reducing CRC mortality.

A recent survey of US physicians revealed that 99% routinely recommend CRC screening, with 95% routinely recommending colonoscopy, 80% recommending FOBT, and 26% recommending sigmoidoscopy; other strategies are rarely recommended<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X11406285">26</xref></sup>; a survey of physicians in Ontario produced similar results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272989X11406285">27</xref></sup> Just over half of primary care providers (PCPs) report recommending 2 screening modalities, with the remainder fairly evenly split between reporting recommending either 3 or 1 screening modalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X11406285">26</xref></sup> Even less is known about what factors influence physicians’ counseling strategies about CRC screening.

<p>The study design and procedures were approved by the study site’s institutional review board.</p>
<sec id="section2-0272989X11406285">
<title>Study Site and Data Sources</title>
<p>The study was conducted at Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW), a not-for-profit health maintenance organization (HMO) in the Pacific Northwest with about 485,000 members. KPNW’s membership is similar to the local insured community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0272989X11406285">28</xref></sup> Electronic records provided clinician and patient data.

<sec id="section3-0272989X11406285">
<title>Study Design and Participants</title>
<p>This cross-sectional study used a PCP survey, electronic health record data, and in-depth interviews with PCPs. We identified PCPs who had active patient panels from January 2007 to July 2009 and who had at least 20 patients eligible for CRC screening every 6 months during this period (<italic>n</italic> = 195). In August 2009, each PCP meeting the criteria received up to 2 electronic survey copies via e-mail, followed by up to 2 mailed paper questionnaires. The latter included an enclosed chocolate bar as a token of appreciation. In total, 144 PCPs (73.8%) returned the survey. Of those, 132 (91.6%) completed all questions about their frequency of recommending the various CRC screening tests and were included in the analyses.</p>

<title>Study Measures</title>
<sec id="section5-0272989X11406285">
<title>Patient panel outcomes</title>
<p>For the primary outcome, we assessed CRC screening rates for each PCP over 6 months among eligible paneled patients who were due or overdue for screening as of January 2009. First, we identified 122,661 patients aged 51 to 75 as of 1 January 2009 who had been HMO members for at least 12 months prior to and 6 months after this date. To the extent feasible, we then limited this group to those who were at average risk for CRC and therefore in whom any of the guideline-recommended CRC screening methods was appropriate. Therefore, we excluded those who had any of the following: 1) colonoscopy within 10 years (<italic>n</italic> = 35,067), 2) flexible sigmoidoscopy or double-contrast barium enema (DCBE) within 5 years (<italic>n</italic> = 26,063), or 3) FOBT screening within the past 12 months (<italic>n</italic> = 16,894), this left a total of (<italic>n</italic> = 44,637). We then excluded 4150 patients because of medical conditions/medications suggesting they were inappropriate for CRC screening (including through FOBT). These included 1) active CRC/gastrointestinal (GI) risk factors (<italic>n</italic> = 2835) in the previous 12 months (gastroenterology referral for chronic diarrhea, esophageal reflux, iron deficiency, or polyp follow-up/rectal surgery; diagnosis of prior CRC or adenomatous polyps; diagnosis of HIV/AIDS), 2) medical conditions (<italic>n</italic> = 192) for which routine screening was not indicated (end-stage renal disease, hospice care, receipt of total colectomy), and 3) use of medications (<italic>n</italic> = 1123) in the previous 4 months (clopidogrel bisulfate) that elevate risk of a false-positive FOBT (<italic>n</italic> = 40,487). Finally, we limited the population to those who were members of the 132 PCP patient panels (final <italic>N</italic> = 21,964; 166 ± 68). CRC screening as an outcome was defined as the receipt of any of FOBT (stool guaiac or fecal immunochemical test), flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS), colonoscopy, or DCBE from 1 January to 30 June 2009. We also assessed the incidence of screening by each procedure individually.</p>
<p>The secondary outcome was CRC screening among eligible patients, consistent with the Health Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) CRC screening quality measure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272989X11406285">29</xref></sup> This was defined as the receipt of any of FOBT during the measurement year (July 2008–June 2009), FS or DCBE during that year or the 4 years prior, and colonoscopy that year or the 9 years prior among the study PCPs’ 49,259 eligible patients (without a history of CRC or total colectomy and with 24 months of prior membership) aged 51 to 80 from July 2008 to June 2009 (373 ± 117 per PCP).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0272989X11406285">
<title>PCP survey and demographic variables</title>
<p>Our PCP variables are based on concepts identified in the diagnostic evaluation model of CRC screening—that is, that physician background and experience, cognitive and psychological representations, social support and influence, practice environment, and patient characteristics affect physician screening intention and that the latter 2 factors interact to directly affect screening behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272989X11406285">30</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0272989X11406285">
<title>Frequency of recommending CRC screening methods</title>
<p>We assessed these variables by asking providers about how often (on a scale of 1 = never to 5 = all the time) each possible CRC screening test or test combination (FOBT, FS, colonoscopy, FOBT + FS, other) was recommended to average-risk asymptomatic patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0272989X11406285">
<title>Influences on CRC screening method selection</title>
<p>These variables were assessed by a series of questions that elicited information about the degree to which (on a scale of 1 = no influence to 5 = strong influence) training/education, colleagues, personal experience with failed screening methods, trust in the recommendation and skill level of endoscopists, organizational guidelines and expectations, and experience working in the community influence PCP choice of a particular CRC screening exam.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0272989X11406285">
<title>Concerns about CRC screening methods</title>
<p>We assessed additional factors (concerns related to patient adherence, test performance, and associated complications) that might influence clinicians to recommend a specific CRC screening test. We asked PCPs for each of the FOBT, FS, and colonoscopy tests the following: To what degree do you agree (from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree) with the statements 1) “it is unclear whom to screen and how often to screen,” 2) “[the test] misses a lot of cancers,” and 3) “patients don’t tend to complete [this test]”? For the FS and colonoscopy tests, we also included a survey item reflective of agreement with the statement “patients often have complications.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0272989X11406285">
<title>Decision making about CRC screening</title>
<p>We asked questions about how often (on a scale of 1 = never to 5 = all the time) did certain aspects of PCP CRC screening communication occur with patients. Three questions related to the “jointness” of decision making were also included—that is, how often they 1) let the patient decide which screening method to use, 2) recommended a specific method, and 3) came to a joint decision.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0272989X11406285">
<title>CRC screening counseling</title>
<p>Seven questions assessed how PCPs address different elements of CRC screening counseling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272989X11406285">22</xref></sup> In factor analyses, 7 elements loaded on a single factor (60.6% of the variance explained), with loadings on all factors greater than .67: benefits of screening, screening frequency, information about discomfort, accuracy, complications, and checking for patient understanding/confirming patient agreement with the method selected. We created a single counseling score by taking the mean of the responses to the 7 questions (Cronbach’s α = .89).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0272989X11406285">
<title>PCP demographic variables</title>
<p>We collected data, by survey, on previous community practice experience (outside of KPNW, coded yes or no) and hours per week in clinical care (≥25 or &lt;25 hours per week). PCP gender, age, years in practice at KPNW, primary care specialty (internal medicine [IM] or family practice [FP]), and patient panel size were extracted from electronic databases.</p>
<p>Study PCPs were recruited for in-depth, semistructured interviews by electronic mail and follow-up phone calls. Interviews were conducted in person, using an interview guide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272989X11406285">31</xref></sup> and analyzed by a trained qualitative research specialist (JLS) blinded to PCP CRC screening recommendations or outcomes. All interviews were transcribed and content-analyzed using standard qualitative analysis techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272989X11406285">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272989X11406285">37</xref></sup> and aided by the use of a qualitative research software program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272989X11406285">37</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0272989X11406285">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>PCP-reported frequency of recommending FOBT, FS + FOBT, and colonoscopy was used in a cluster analysis to determine if groups of PCPs had similar patterns of recommending CRC screening methods. Responses to recommending FS only were not used in the cluster analysis because of the high degree of correlation with responses to recommending both FS and FOBT (<italic>r</italic> = .84). We extracted clusters using hierarchical cluster analysis with Ward’s method and squared Euclidean distances in SPSS 15.0 (SPSS, Inc., an IBM Company, Chicago, Illinois). We based our decision on the number of clusters to retain in the final solution on the agglomeration schedule and interpretability. We followed the hierarchical cluster analysis with a K-means cluster analysis, using the final cluster centers from Ward’s method and a discriminant analysis predicting cluster group membership from the frequency of recommending variables to assess the fit of the final cluster solution. To validate the interpretation of the clusters, we compared actual completed screening by each CRC screening method among the clusters using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc tests. We used ANOVA and chi-square tests to compare the clusters on PCP demographics and panel characteristics, screening influences, test concerns, CRC screening “jointness” of decision variables, CRC screening counseling content scale score, and PCP CRC screening rates. We considered <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 to be statistically significant.</p>

<p>There were significant differences among the 4 clusters in physician-reported CRC screening test choice influences, test-related concerns, and jointness of decision making, although groups were similar in their reported communication of information about test discomfort, accuracy, complications, and patient understanding of the recommended test (CRC counseling scale score) (significant results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272989X11406285">Table 3</xref>). Of the surveyed test choice influences (training/education, discussions with colleagues, personal experiences with failure of screening methods, trust in endoscopy specialists, organizational [KPNW] guidelines and expectations, and experience working in the community), only guidelines and expectations was a statistically significant influence. The FOBT cluster was most influenced by clinical guidelines, followed by the FOBT + FS cluster. The clusters did not differ in concerns about colonoscopy but did differ in concerns about FOBT and FS. The most strongly endorsed concerns were that “FOBT generates a lot of false positives” (in the balanced cluster) and that “FOBT misses a lot of cancers” (in the FOBT + FS and balanced clusters). The FOBT cluster had the least concerns about being unclear whom to screen and how often to screen with FOBT, that FOBT misses a lot of cancers, and that FOBT generates a lot of false positives. The FOBT cluster also most strongly endorsed concerns about being unclear whom to screen and how often to screen with FS and that FS patients often have complications.</p>

Content analysis from provider interviews supports our quantitative findings, including findings related to the influence of KPNW guidelines, the tendency for PCPs in the FOBT and FOBT + FS clusters to be more likely to recommend a specific strategy, and that the balanced cluster PCPs were more likely to use a more mutual or “joint” approach to decision making. In addition, the qualitative data support the finding that influence and interpretation of recommendations from “local” organizational experts are also factors in shaping providers’ test preferences and approaches with patients, particularly for PCPs in the FOBT and FOBT + FS clusters. Furthermore, PCPs in the FOBT + FS cluster were most concerned about overburdening the system with colonoscopies, which may contribute to their making more frequent recommendations that patients get screened with noncolonoscopy methods. Although the colonoscopy + FOBT group described recommending yearly FOBT, this group also strongly stated the importance and need for some additional scoping and preferred the completeness of colonoscopy to that of FS. Providers in the balanced group described feeling “more free” to discuss and recommend all screening options with patients, allowing them to engage in a more patient-driven approach rather than recommending a specific strategy based on test concerns or resource constraints.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Given the literature and the findings from the current study, it is reasonable to conclude that provider recommendation to screen, and <italic>not</italic> the specific nature of the recommended test, is the major driver of colorectal cancer screening completion. Our analyses of self-reported CRC screening test recommendations made by PCPs in a large integrated care setting demonstrated that recommendations fell into 4 primary patterns. These patterns were associated with types of CRC screening tests actually completed by patients. However, the groups (by test recommendation pattern) did not differ significantly in their overall practice-level CRC screening rates. More providers in this study reported a “balanced” screening test recommendation pattern than any other pattern; their resulting screening rates were comparable to those of other groups. This finding is contrary to 2 recent studies suggesting that providing a choice of more than 2 CRC screening tests may result in decreased screening completion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X11406285">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272989X11406285">38</xref></sup> The likely explanation is that many patients follow their physician’s CRC screening test recommendations when choosing a screening method,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272989X11406285">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272989X11406285">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0272989X11406285">40</xref></sup> no matter which test is recommended. Our findings are of interest because there is very little published research comparing PCP-reported specific CRC screening recommendation strategies to actual screening rates. One national study of PCP screening practices revealed that recommending FOBT and colonoscopy was the most commonly reported practice pattern (50.3%), followed by colonoscopy only in 15% and FOBT, FS, and colonoscopy in 14%, but this study did not relate these patterns to overall practice screening rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272989X11406285">26</xref></sup> Thus, an important and simple message for health care practitioners is that they should enthusiastically recommend CRC screening in a way that fits current practice standards and practices within individual clinic settings.</p>
<p>A separate finding of this study is that test recommendation patterns were influenced both by concerns about accuracy of specific tests and also by patient-provider jointness of decision making. We are unable to determine the direction of cause and effect for associations between decision making and pattern of screening recommendations; however, our qualitative data strongly suggest that, in the cases of the balanced and FOBT + colonoscopy groups, belief in patient choice is a primary factor leading to these patterns of test recommendation. Providers in the balanced group also reported concerns about accuracy of FOBT. PCPs in the FOBT + colonoscopy group did not report having these concerns about FOBT but, in interviews, preferred the thoroughness of colonoscopy to that of FS. PCPs in the FOBT and FOBT + FS groups did not report concerns about either FOBT or FS, and they more frequently reported recommending one specific screening strategy. Some providers appear to use their decision-making style (recommending a specific screening method) to encourage patients to be screened using their preferred testing strategies.</p>
<p>Our results have implications for CRC screening effectiveness and, ultimately, cost-effectiveness. Test concerns will be important leverage points for policy and practice leaders to influence the mix of CRC screening tests recommended in the future. Screening with annual fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) may allow access to screening for diverse populations and is considered equally as cost-effective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272989X11406285">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272989X11406285">42</xref></sup> or more cost-effective than 10-yearly colonoscopy or a combination of annual FIT and 5-yearly sigmoidoscopy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0272989X11406285">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0272989X11406285">44</xref></sup> Yet the projected cost-effectiveness of FIT assumes that the patient adherence to annual FIT (year after year) can be the same as patient adherence to one-time completion of endoscopy. We were not able to distinguish single-test completion success from adherence to repeated test completion in this analysis. Furthermore, we found that concern about the accuracy of FOBT is among the strongest factors differentiating those groups recommending more FOBT from those recommending more endoscopy. Another study similarly found that provider concerns about FOBT accuracy were associated with reduced likelihood of CRC screening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272989X11406285">45</xref></sup> To increase the number of providers recommending fecal tests, clinicians would likely want to see improved sensitivity and specificity, with this information clearly conveyed through influential clinical practice guidelines.</p>
<p>Finally, PCP groups did not differ in the extent to which they included all the possible counseling elements about CRC screening. All groups reported often providing information about the benefits and recommended frequency of screening and gave less information about test discomfort, accuracy, and complications. Other research supports this common communication pattern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0272989X11406285">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0272989X11406285">46</xref></sup> It is possible that multiple counseling approaches, thoughtfully delivered in the context of complex factors such as physician-patient relationship and history, perceived patient socioeconomic status, literacy, numeracy, and PCP perceptions of patient-desired counseling style, do achieve similar results as long as the clinician enthusiastically recommends CRC screening. Other studies have found that patient perception of clinician “spending sufficient time,” providing an “adequate explanation”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0272989X11406285">47</xref></sup> or good “information,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272989X11406285">48</xref></sup> assessing patient understanding during CRC screening counseling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0272989X11406285">49</xref></sup> and answering patients’ questions adequately<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272989X11406285">25</xref></sup> have been positively associated with receipt of CRC screening. In contrast, discussing pros and cons and eliciting patient preferences,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0272989X11406285">49</xref></sup> as well as providing screening choices,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272989X11406285">25</xref></sup> reduced screening likelihood in other studies. Our results need to be interpreted with caution. The PCPs in our study indicated that they frequently included many different CRC screening counseling elements. However, other studies have found that when clinicians are observed in practice, often they do not include many elements related to informed CRC screening decision making,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272989X11406285">22</xref></sup> and they overestimate the number of elements that they do include.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0272989X11406285">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study has several limitations. The study site, an integrated group practice that is culturally strongly guideline focused, may have less variation in practice than other environments. The findings may not therefore be completely generalizable. In particular, there were few PCPs who reported mostly recommending colonoscopy, and thus we had a limited ability to evaluate that practice pattern. The study included a small number of PCPs in each group, especially for the qualitative data gathering. Also, the study’s retrospective design introduces several weaknesses. For the primary outcome, we attempted to distinguish true CRC screening from diagnostic testing, but we may not have been completely successful in this regard. However, this study has multiple strengths, such as a very high PCP participation rate, clinically documented screening v. patient report, the ability to validate clinician-stated recommendations through data on specific screening test use, and enough variation in CRC screening practice to generate clearly identifiable practice patterns.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although the balanced recommendation style was the most common (40.9% of PCPs surveyed), the other 3 styles were common as well (ranging from 16.7% to 23.5% of PCPs surveyed); patterns were primarily distinguished by PCP specialty, the influence of guidelines and test concerns (especially related to FOBT test performance), and decision-making style. Each of the 4 physician recommendation patterns identified here appeared to be equally effective in accomplishing CRC screening. As more information becomes available about the relative cost-effectiveness of older v. newer technologies, communicating this information to clinicians in a manner that considers their diverse influences, test-related concerns, and decision-making styles will be important for improving community CRC screening rates.</p>
