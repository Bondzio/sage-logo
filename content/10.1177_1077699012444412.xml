<p>So much of the mass media is about personality—the newsmakers and celebrities themselves, as well as the people who bring them to us. The messenger often becomes the message, whether it’s Nellie Bly, Rupert Murdoch, or Rush Limbaugh.</p>
<p>Personalities abound in this set of <italic>JMCQ</italic> books, from a generation of Victorian newspaper women whose importance at the turn of the (previous) century may have been underrated, to “titans” of Washington, D.C., journalism who helped create a national culture, to the journalists who toppled a president and covered Vietnam, to the man and the myth who was Howard Cosell.</p>
<p>This edition of <italic>JMCQ</italic> books leads with a synthesis essay by Giovanna Dell’Orto of the University of Minnesota that features some of journalism’s proudest moments. “Journalism’s Crusading 1970s” looks at Watergate’s legacy for <italic>The Investigative Impulse</italic>, paired with a new collection of the writings of Pulitzer winner Sydney Schanberg, <italic>Beyond the Killing Fields</italic>. “Journalism in the 1970s remains a perfect teaching moment for brave, dogged reporting that helped shape America’s direction,” Dell’Orto says.</p>
<p>Mark Ribowsky’s biography of famously arrogant sportscaster Howard Cosell doesn’t quite satisfy reviewer Anthony Moretti, but there is so much to say about Cosell that few would be content. We already know much about the acerbic commentator, whose relationships with athletes—notably Muhammad Ali—made him as much a celebrity as those he covered. Still, Cosell remains a puzzle: Was he really as annoying as he seemed?</p>
<p>More satisfying, perhaps, are two books on women whose personalities helped shape their times and their press. Historian Alice Fahs’s <italic>Out on Assignment</italic> reframes assumptions about woman journalists of the late 1800s: they were not “brash and brassy tokens in a field that was not simply male-dominated but macho.” Similarly, Eleanor Medill “Cissy” Patterson’s role in Washington journalism made her a newspaper titan in the 1930s and ’40s, says reviewer Maurine Beasley. Called by <italic>Collier’s</italic> both the “most powerful” and “most hated” woman in America in 1940, Patterson was the first female editor/publisher of a major metropolitan daily in the twentieth century. It was not just her journalistic role, however, but her tabloidesque private life that made Patterson both famous and reviled.</p>
<p>Speaking of famous and reviled, Mark Feldstein’s 2011 Mott Award–winning book, <italic>Poisoning the Press</italic> focuses on Richard Nixon and his long conflict with columnist Jack Anderson, whom Nixon tried to have assassinated. “It is a modern Greek tragedy,” writes reviewer Ray Hiebert, who says he, too, was targeted by Nixon’s FBI, “the forces of evil and goodness battling each other to the death, with evil ultimately winning.”</p>
<p>There are many more characters in this issue’s cast of personalities from both sides of the typewriter—<italic>Liberal Champion</italic> Supreme Court Justice William Brennan; CNN anchor Don Lemon and his struggles with racism and coming out of the closet; the cultural importance of <italic>Sex and the City</italic>; and a whole array of <italic>Television Personalities</italic>—hosts and others who play themselves on TV.</p>
<p>Mass communication in all its forms is about much more than the weird and wonderful, of course, but this is a spectator sport, after all, and this issue’s books contain plenty to amaze, entertain, and inform.</p>
