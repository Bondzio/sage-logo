<p>In 2007, 1.2 million people in the United States were hospitalized with pneumonia, and more than 52 000 died from the disease.

Treatment of CABP differs depending on the types of bacteria that are suspected. In the last several years, due to the concern regarding multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), 2 new antibiotics have been developed and approved for use in CABP.

In clinical trials, both agents have been shown to be efficacious and are generally well tolerated. Although these agents have received approval as therapy for CABP, it is the responsibility of physicians and pharmacists to prudently use these antimicrobials where they are truly needed. Until these agents show superiority over conventional therapy for selected patient populations, given the wide variety of pharmacotherapy that can prove efficacious for pneumonia, the new agents should be reserved for patients who have known risk factors for MDROs. Further studies are warranted for these agents in the setting of CABP.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 2007, 1.2 million people in the United States were hospitalized with pneumonia and more than 52 000 died from the disease. Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in the outpatient setting is caused mainly by <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> but can also be attributed to such organisms as <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Haemophilus influenza</italic>, <italic>Chlamydophila pneumoniae</italic>, and certain respiratory viruses. The cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia is similar; however, <italic>Legionella</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and other bacteria could be the culprit. The causative organisms can vary due to comorbid or epidemiologic conditions, such as diabetes, alcoholism, chronic lung or renal disease, or the recent use of antibiotics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460829">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to the current Infectious Disease Society of America/American Thoracic Society (IDSA/ATS) treatment guidelines for CABP, there are several empiric treatment options for CABP in the outpatient setting. Outpatients who are otherwise healthy should receive monotherapy with a macrolide or doxycyline. In those with comorbid conditions, a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, or gemifloxacin) or a beta-lactam plus a macrolide are recommended. If a patient is admitted to the hospital, a respiratory fluoroquinolone or a macrolide plus a beta-lactam are recommended. Additional antibiotics can be added depending on the bacteria suspected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460829">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the last several years, due to the concern regarding multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), 2 new antibiotics have been developed and approved for use in CABP. Ceftaroline fosamil (Teflaro) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2010. Ceftaroline fosamil is a broad-spectrum, beta-lactam antibiotic, with activity against methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) and multidrug resistant <italic>S pneumoniae</italic>. It also has gram negative coverage against <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic>, <italic>H influenza</italic>, and <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>. It has no activity against anaerobes. The drug has a high affinity for penicillin-binding protein 2a, which may lend itself to the inhibition of MRSA. Ceftaroline fosamil is still susceptible to beta-lactamase producing bacteria; therefore, there are ongoing studies with the drug in conjunction with a beta-lactamase inhibitor to expand its antimicrobial coverage. Ceftaroline fosamil is available as an intravenous (iv) formulation and is dosed at 600 mg every 12 hours for 5 to 7 days. Dosage adjustments are required for those patients with a creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012460829">2</xref></sup> Adverse events were minimal in clinical trials with nausea reported in 4% and diarrhea in 5% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012460829">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Tigecycline (Tygacil), approved in March 2009, is the first broad-spectrum, iv, glycylcycline antibiotic for the treatment of CABP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012460829">4</xref></sup> It is a synthetic analogue of the tetracyclines, designed to overcome resistance that is seen with tetracycline. It has broad spectrum coverage against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes, anaerobes, and atypical pathogens. Tigecycline is active against <italic>S pneumoniae</italic>,<italic> S aureus</italic> (MRSA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012460829">5</xref></sup> and <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus) and <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012460829">6</xref></sup> as well as <italic>H influenza</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, and <italic>Morexella catarrhalis</italic>. In addition, there is coverage for <italic>C pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>M pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Legionella</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012460829">5</xref></sup> and anaerobes such as <italic>Bacteroides fragilis.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012460829">4</xref></sup> Due to decreased susceptibilities in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P mirabilis</italic>, tigecycline should not be used to treat these organisms if they are suspected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012460829">7</xref></sup> Tigecycline is able to overcome the mechanisms of tetracycline resistance, ribosomal protection, and active efflux from inside the bacteria, by the addition of a large substituent at position 9 of the tetracycline molecule. This affords the drug activity against bacteria that carry these genes. Patients receiving tigecycline should be given 100 mg iv once, followed by 50 mg every 12 hours for 7 to 14 days. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal insufficiency; however, those with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Score C) require the dose to be reduced to 25 mg every 12 hours. The most common adverse effects are nausea (34.5%) and vomiting (19.6%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012460829">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>Ceftaroline Fosamil</title>
<p>The FOCUS 1 and FOCUS 2 clinical trials are randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase III studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil when compared to ceftriaxone for the treatment of hospitalized patients with CABP. Study participants were randomized (1:1) to receive treatment for 5 to 7 days of either ceftaroline fosamil 600 mg every 12 hours or ceftriaxone 1 g every 24 hours if hospitalized with CABP, requiring iv therapy, and having a Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) risk class score of III or IV. The FOCUS 1 and FOCUS 2 studies were intended as parallel, methodologically alike (with the exception of 2 doses of clarithromycin given on day 1 in FOCUS 1 only), comparative analyses that did not allow switching to oral medications for treatment completion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012460829">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012460829">9</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section3-0897190012460829">
<title>Safety and Tolerability</title>
<p>During the FOCUS 1 and FOCUS 2 phase III studies, all 1228 patients enrolled were monitored for treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). There were 613 patients followed from the initial iv administration of ceftaroline fosamil until the test-of-cure (TOC) visit, and 615 patients similarly followed in the ceftriaxone group. Patients receiving any amount of drug were included in the safety analysis. Additionally, serious adverse events (SAEs) including deaths that transpired within 30 days of the last study drug dose administered and/or up to the late follow-up (LFU) visit were documented. Study drug mean exposure was 6.5 ± 1.1 days for both study groups. Patients participated in scheduled laboratory visits from initiation until the TOC visit, while unscheduled laboratory visits were conducted until the LFU visit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012460829">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012460829"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012460829">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following safety results reported are from the integrated summary of the FOCUS 1 and FOCUS 2 clinical trials. The most frequently documented TEAEs in the ceftaroline fosamil treatment group were diarrhea (4.2%), headache (3.4%), and insomnia (3.1%). About 75% of patients experienced none or only mild TEAEs in either treatment group. Therefore, the severity-based distribution of TEAEs was similar between the 2 treatment groups. The overall incidence rates of adverse events (AEs) were consistent between the ceftaroline fosamil group and the ceftriaxone group, respectively, as follows: patients experiencing at least 1 TEAE (47.0% vs 45.7%), SAE (11.3% vs 11.7%), discontinuation due to an AE (4.4% vs 4.1%), or who died (2.4% vs 2.0%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012460829">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>A total of 27 deaths occurred during the FOCUS trials; 15 occurred in the ceftaroline fosamil group and 12 in the ceftriaxone group. Two deaths (1 from each group) could have been related to study drug when reviewed by the investigator. Of the deaths reported, the investigator categorized them by type or organ system. Deaths related to cardiac disorders (2 vs 7), infections and infestations (3 vs 1), neoplasms (4 vs 0), respiratory disorders (4 vs 3), and general disorders such as sudden death and multiple organ disorder (2 vs 1) occurred in the ceftaroline fosamil and ceftriaxone treatment groups, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012460829">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>There were 7 SAEs reported in more than 2 patients in the ceftaroline fosamil group, which include pneumonia (as defined by worsening or relapse of CABP or nosocomial pneumonia, 9 patients), pleural effusion (5 patients), pulmonary embolism (5 patients), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (4 patients), pyothorax (4 patients), respiratory failure (4 patients), and malignant lung neoplasm (3 patients). The investigator reviewed the SAEs, and the majority of the SAEs (95.7% in the ceftaroline fosamil group and 91.7% in the ceftriaxone group) were regarded as not related to study drug. As a result, there were no safety concerns discovered. There was not a TEAE occurring in more than 2 patients in the ceftaroline fosamil group that led to discontinuation of study drug or withdrawal from study. However, pneumonia (as defined above), pulmonary embolism, respiratory failure, septic shock, and sudden death each occurred in 2 patients in the ceftaroline fosamil group which led to discontinuation of the study drug or withdrawal from the study for those patients. A total of 10 patients in the ceftaroline fosamil group and 9 patients in the ceftriaxone group either discontinued the study drug or withdrew from the study. The majority of the SAEs and the TEAEs leading to discontinuation of the study drug reflected an insufficient therapeutic response, which resulted in a prolonged hospitalization (meets criteria of the SAE definition) or reflects AEs which result in death (withdrawal from the study).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012460829">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Overall, ceftaroline fosamil is well tolerated and does not possess any unforeseen safety concerns. Ceftaroline fosamil is classified as pregnancy category B. Caution should be used in patients previously experiencing an allergic skin reaction to any other beta-lactam antibiotic, and ceftaroline fosamil should be immediately discontinued if a reaction develops. Ceftaroline fosamil has a consistent safety and tolerability profile as seen with ceftriaxone and the cephalosporin class as a whole.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012460829">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012460829">11</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section4-0897190012460829">
<title>Clinical Efficacy</title>
<p>The primary end point of the FOCUS program was to determine noninferiority of ceftaroline fosamil in clinical cure rates when compared with ceftriaxone in the clinically evaluable (CE) and modified intent-to-treat efficacy (MITTE) populations at the TOC visit (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190012460829">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0897190012460829">2</xref>). A clinical cure was defined as resolution of all signs and symptoms of pneumonia or improvement to that point that no further antimicrobial treatment was needed. Patients had to demonstrate total resolution of CABP signs and symptoms in addition to being afebrile for 24 consecutive hours for clinical cure to be established. If a patient previously established a clinical cure at the TOC visit, but later displayed returning symptoms involving additional antimicrobial treatment during the LFU visit then relapse was confirmed. The TOC visit occurred 8 to 15 days from the last dose of study drug administered, and the LFU occurred 21 to 35 days from the last dose of study drug.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190012460829">12</xref></sup></p>

<p>Clinical cure rates for ceftaroline fosamil were noninferior to those of ceftriaxone across all predefined study populations during the FOCUS program. Additionally, clinical relapse rates at LFU were consistent between the 2 study groups for the CE and MITTE populations as reported in the integrated analysis. Therefore, ceftaroline fosamil 600 mg administered iv every 12 hours was determined efficacious and noninferior to ceftriaxone 1 g administered iv every 24 hours in hospitalized patients with CABP, requiring iv therapy, and having a PORT risk class score of III or IV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012460829">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012460829">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190012460829">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Safety and Tolerability</title>
<p>The safety evaluation conducted by Bergallo et al occurred at baseline and day 3 (consisting of laboratory tests and 12-lead electrocardiogram) which additionally monitored for AEs. This evaluation included all patients receiving any amount of study drug in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population (n = 208 tigecycline, n = 210 levofloxacin). The AEs and SAEs were documented up to and including the TOC visit that occurred between 7 and 23 days after administering the last dose of study drug or 14 days after the last dose of study drug, whichever was greater. The mITT population for the 2 treatment groups received study drug for a median of 4 days followed by a median of 6 days of oral levofloxacin therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190012460829">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Almost half of the patients (48.6%, 203 of 418) from the mITT population of both study groups reported at least 1 drug-related AE (DRAE). The most frequently documented DRAEs in the tigecycline group were nausea (16.3%) and vomiting (12.0%), but they were categorized as mild to moderate in severity with few patients discontinuing tigecycline as a result. Discontinuation rates due to any type of AEs were consistent between the 2 study groups. In all, 5 tigecycline-treated patients and 6 levofloxacin-treated patients died during the clinical study, but the investigators reviewed the deaths finding them to be unrelated to the study drugs. There were no significant findings between the 2 treatment groups in hospital length of stay or hospital readmissions. Overall, the investigators concluded that tigecycline was well tolerated and safe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190012460829">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The safety assessment reported by Tanaseanu et al included medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram that occurred at baseline (within 24 hours of study drug dose), during treatment, 2 to 4 days post therapy (early follow-up), and during the TOC visit. The assessment of AEs included all patients receiving any amount of study drug in the mITT population (n = 216 tigecycline and n = 212 levofloxacin). The AEs and SAEs were documented up to and including the TOC visit which occurred between 10 and 21 days after administering the last dose of study drug or 14 days after the last dose of study drug, whichever was greater.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012460829">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>More than half of the tigecycline-treated patients (62.5%, 135/216) reported at least 1 TEAE which is statistically significant when compared to the levofloxacin-treated patients (47.2%, 100 of 212; <italic>P</italic> = .002). The most frequently documented AEs in the tigecycline group were nausea (26.9%) and vomiting (16.7%), but they were categorized as mild to moderate in severity. However, when compared to nausea (8.5%) and vomiting (6.6%) in levofloxacin-treated patients this was statistically significant (nausea, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 and vomiting, <italic>P</italic> = .001). The investigator also reported significantly more DRAEs in the tigecycline-treated patients compared to the levofloxacin-treated patients (44.4% vs 29.2%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Discontinuation rates due to any type of AEs, including nausea and vomiting, were consistent between the 2 study groups. In all, 7 tigecycline-treated patients and 5 levofloxacin-treated patients died during the clinical study, but the investigators reviewed the deaths finding them to be unrelated to the study drugs. This study summarized tigecycline’s safety profile and states it is generally well tolerated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012460829">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Score C), the initial tigecycline dose is 100 mg followed by a reduced maintenance dose of 25 mg every 12 hours. These patients should be cautiously treated and monitored for treatment response. Tigecycline is classified as pregnancy category D due to possible teratogenic effects, and it should not be administered to a pregnant patient since it may cause fetal harm. On September 1, 2010, the FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication concerning the increased risk of all-cause mortality associated with tigecycline compared to other antimicrobials used to treat serious infections. To date, the cause for this increased risk of death has not been identified. Therefore, health care providers should be cautioned to fully weigh the potential risk versus benefit before initiating tigecycline in patients with severe infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190012460829">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012460829">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>Clinical Efficacy</title>
<p>The primary efficacy end points analyzed by Bergallo et al were clinical responses (categorized as cure, failure, or indeterminate) in the CE and clinical mITT (c-mITT) populations at the TOC visit (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0897190012460829">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0897190012460829">4</xref>). A clinical cure response means all signs and symptoms of CABP improved or resolved, chest radiographs were improved or not worse, no further antibiotic therapy was required, and there were no new signs and symptoms of CABP at the TOC visit. Noninferiority was confirmed since the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI was greater than or equal to −15%. The clinical cure rates in CE patients were 90.6% in the tigecycline group versus 87.2% in the levofloxacin group (difference, 3.4% 95% CI, −4.4%-11.2%). Clinical cure rates were also consistent with the c-mITT patients, 78% in the tigecycline group versus 77.8% in the levofloxacin group (difference, 0.2% 95% CI, −8.5%-8.9%). Since there were no statistically significant differences found at TOC, the efficacy of tigecycline was determined to be statistically noninferior to levofloxacin. This comparison study confirmed tigecycline to be efficacious and noninferior to levofloxacin for the treatment of CABP in hospitalized patients requiring iv antimicrobial treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190012460829">13</xref></sup></p>

<p>The primary efficacy end points examined by Tanaseanu et al were clinical responses (cure, failure, or indeterminate) in the CE and c-mITT populations at the TOC visit (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0897190012460829">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0897190012460829">4</xref>). Noninferiority was confirmed since the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI was greater than or equal to −15%. Between both CE groups, 88.9% in the tigecycline group versus 85.3% in the levofloxacin group (adjusted difference, 3.6% 95% CI, −4.5%-11.8%), clinical cure rates were consistent without statistically significant differences at the TOC visit. Clinical cure rates in c-mITT patients were 83.7% in the tigecycline group versus 81.5% in the levofloxacin group (adjusted difference, 2.0% 95% CI, −5.5%-9.6%), therefore, concluding tigecycline’s efficacy to be statistically noninferior to levofloxacin. Differences were adjusted for the Fine Pneumonia Severity Index Score. This severity index is a clinical prediction that calculates the probability of morbidity and mortality in patients with CABP. Adjustments were made to account for differences between the groups with regard to the severity index score. This prospective study supports noninferiority and efficacy of tigecycline versus levofloxacin for the treatment of CABP in hospitalized patients requiring iv therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012460829">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the integrated analysis, Tanaseanu et al evaluated tigecycline’s efficacy and safety results from these 2 phase III trials. According to the safety observations, there were no significant differences in discontinuation rates due to AEs, the frequency of SAEs, or death despite significantly more DRAEs in the tigecycline-treated patients. It was also noted that in severely compromised patients with comorbid diseases such as congestive heart failure, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tigecycline achieved cure rates of 100%, 97.1%, and 81.3%, respectively, as well as 90.9% in patients with bacteremia. These rates were shown to be noninferior to the levofloxacin group as there were no statistically significant differences in the percentages between groups. Ultimately, the investigators concluded tigecycline appeared to be safe with noninferior clinical cure rates when compared to levofloxacin in hospitalized patients with CABP. Overall, clinicians should exercise caution when weighing the potential risk versus benefit of using tigecycline in patients with severe infections due to the increased mortality risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190012460829">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190012460829">17</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As the identification of resistant organisms continues to rise and the lack of new antimicrobials with novel mechanisms of action persists, it becomes more evident every day that antimicrobial stewardship and judicious use of antimicrobials is the new necessity. Antimicrobials such as ceftaroline fosamil and tigecycline are some new options that have gained an indication in the treatment of CABP. The data show that these agents are considered noninferior but there have yet to be adequate studies to support the preferred use of these antimicrobials. As bacteria adapt to the selective pressure that we place on them, it is unknown what will be the next reaction after significant use of these antimicrobials. The approach to antimicrobial research and practice has shifted more toward preservation than development due to the lack of novel agents in the pipeline. This is one reason why antimicrobial stewardship programs are becoming increasingly important in all hospital settings and the use of new agents should be subjected to educated skepticism.</p>
<p>When we step back and take a look at the niche that has been created for these medications we must consider the relevance of each individual patient’s history and their risk for MDROs. These agents were specifically designed to cover MDROs and according to the current guidelines the patients at risk for MDROs would not necessarily meet the criteria for a simple CABP. Many, if not all of these patients, would be classified as a health care–associated pneumonia (HCAP). According to the IDSA guidelines, this classification would justify a more broad therapy than the currently recommended therapy for CABP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190012460829">18</xref></sup> Thus, the utility of these agents in patients who are actual CABP patients becomes greatly reduced. Empiric therapy should be driven by evidence-based medicine (ie, guidelines) and the resistance patterns seen in the community where they reside. Local antibiograms should provide an appropriate source of guidance when choosing empiric therapy in this patient population. In patients who are identified as being MRSA colonized or have had past episodes with multidrug-resistant <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia</italic> (MDRSP), these agents may have found their ideal population for CABP treatment. Along with a small niche for these antimicrobials there are concerns regarding the efficacy in patients who are more severely ill. Questions have been raised regarding the efficacy of tigecycline in the severely ill due to its bacteriostatic nature and also the low serum concentrations that it exhibits due to its large volume of distribution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190012460829">19</xref></sup> These characteristics reduce tigecycline’s utility in patients who are severely ill or have documented or presumed bacteremia. Thus, tigecycline should not be used in patients who are severely ill (ie, septic, bacteremic, etc) when there are other options available or until there is more data to support the safety and efficacy in these patient populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190012460829">19</xref></sup> The utilization of these medications should be reserved for patients who are at a higher risk for MDROs such as those classified as HCAP patients.</p>
<p>Along with the clinical relevance of selecting these antimicrobials comes the question of pharmacoeconomic efficiency. Given the equivalent efficacy of these antimicrobials in CABP, they appear to be a potential option for selected patient populations, however, the cost of use should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine the most appropriate allocation of funds.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0897190012460829">
<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>Ceftaroline fosamil and tigecycline are both agents with great potential for use in selected patient populations. Nonetheless, true CABP patients who do not exhibit the appropriate risk factors should receive more intensive evaluation by trained infectious disease practitioners prior to initiating therapy, whether it is empiric or targeted, with ceftaroline or tigecycline. There may be a greater utility for de-escalation therapy to one of these agents when <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, which neither agent has efficacy against, has been ruled out.</p>
<p>Novel antimicrobials agents are of a dying breed and MDROs are continuing to adapt to the selective pressure of the antimicrobial era. Agents such as ceftaroline fosamil and tigecycline should be used judiciously. Practitioners should be reserving these antimicrobials for patients who have risk factors that justify their use or for identified pathogens with specific resistance to other antimicrobials that are more cost effective. Given their noninferiority, more research is warranted to determine whether there is a significant clinical and pharmacoeconomic benefit to supplant other traditional less-expensive antimicrobials.</p>
