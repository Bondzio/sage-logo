<body>
<p>There is building evidence that the use of routine outcome measurement can improve the outcome of care for consumers through the provision of feedback.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212458813">1</xref></sup> To realize this potential clinicians, consumers and others have to be able to relate the measures used to their daily experience, to understand the information they contain, and use this to support and develop clinical practice. Whilst Australia has introduced a number of routine outcome measures (ROM) into clinical practice under the National Outcomes and Casemix Collection (NOCC), and a framework for their use to improve care has been proposed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212458813">2</xref></sup> the ability to relate to measures that were mostly unfamiliar to clinicians prior to NOCC is still questioned.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, there is growing evidence that ROM has utility for a variety of purposes. The measures can be used broadly as evidence of the effectiveness of service provision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212458813">3</xref></sup> They can be used to support decision making around transfer and discharge in community services,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212458813">4</xref></sup> and they can be used as tools to support consumer/clinician engagement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212458813">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Guyatt et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856212458813">6</xref></sup> have argued that even when users are familiar with standard measures such as Quality of Life measures, specific methods need to be developed to aid interpretability. This can include relating measures to familiar clinical anchor points, focusing on the presence of certain symptoms or individual items. While they acknowledge that there is a ‘trade off’ between a focus on specific items and the complex information provided by the whole instrument, we would argue that focusing upon specific items can enhance the clinical meaningfulness of standard measures.</p>
<p>Significant investment has occurred in training mental health clinicians to complete ROM as part of clinical practice. While the measures do not explicitly tap areas like insight and judgement, they contain scales and/or items relevant to most domains that should be considered in mental health assessment and care planning.</p>
<p>This paper aims to explore and illustrate how these nationally implemented ROM can represent clinically meaningful information regarding individual consumers. The benefits of such representational capacity may be best understood by considering the use of pattern recognition combined with reflective practice to answer three important clinical questions. Have we assessed the consumer accurately? Is there agreement between the consumer and clinician? Has there been change?</p>
<sec id="section5-1039856212458813">
<title>The use of pattern recognition in clinical care</title>
<p>Mental health clinicians must integrate a range of information in the assessment of the current condition of a consumer, and subsequent care planning. Clinical decision making falls into two broad categories, either unconscious/intuitive or conscious and controlled. Both approaches rely on ‘pattern recognition’ in which aspects of a current case are compared with those that have been encountered in the past and using these past experiences to make judgements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212458813">7</xref></sup> Experience improves the accuracy of clinical judgements based on pattern recognition but it can lead to erroneous judgements if there are errors in the recognition of patterns, or the ‘right questions’ are not asked.</p>
<p>Clinicians commonly complain that the standard measures introduced into routine clinical practice often do not tell them anything they do not already know.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856212458813">8</xref></sup> However, standard measures enable clinicians to ‘step back’ and ensure that decisions are consistent with all of the available information and advised ‘good practice’. Commander et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856212458813">9</xref></sup> found that the introduction of a standard measure helped support reflective practice. Reflective practice can improve the accuracy of diagnosis, particularly for complex and unusual cases, by overcoming the adverse effects of automatic reasoning that can accompany the development of expertise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212458813">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The use of ROM in practice can prompt three questions that should support this process of reflection. The first is: what is the consumers current presentation? Second: is there agreement between the consumer and clinician? And third: has there been change? This paper will focus on the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) and the Kessler-10 (K-10), but the principles hold true for any ROM or standard measure used as part of clinical practice. The HoNOS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856212458813">11</xref></sup> is a collection of 12 scales identifying common problems of consumers of mental health services and is rated by the clinician from 0 (no problem) to 4 (a severe problem) in the past two weeks. In contrast, the K-10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856212458813">12</xref></sup> is completed by the consumer and is a self-report of psychological distress over the last month. Pattern recognition, and questions such as the three above, are also used by more experienced clinicians supervising clinical teams or more junior clinicians, and are one starting point for the development of electronic decision support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212458813">2</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1039856212458813">
<title>Representing the current condition of a consumer</title>
<p>The HoNOS can be reported as a total score, subscale scores (behavior, impairment, symptoms or social) or as individual items. The different reporting will appeal to different audiences and answer different questions. Total scores provide a broad indication of the severity of problems an individual is experiencing and may be attractive to those involved in policy development, while the increased specificity of subscales and individual items will have more salience for consumers and clinicians.</p>
<p>Aspects of the current condition of a consumer are represented by a cross sectional view of the HoNOS. This represents the measured ‘status’ of a consumer at a given time, from the clinicians perspective and represents a summary of the clinicians assessment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1039856212458813">Figure 1</xref> is a common cross sectional representation of the HoNOS produced by the majority of clinical information systems across Australia. Here there are two consumers with the same total score on the HoNOS but very different presentations, requiring different types of treatment and management. Consumer A has disturbed behavior, problems with self-harm, alcohol and drug taking and relationships, while Consumer B has cognitive and physical health problems and problems with their accommodation and living situation.</p>

</fig>
<p>While the total score of 21 which both consumers receive provides a measure of ‘global mental health related function’ of the consumer that can be compared with published ‘norms’ in different situations, it may be difficult to directly relate to clinical care. Considering the total score as a representation of a clinician’s assessment of 12 domains of a consumer’s symptoms and function measured over the 12 individual scales has a number of clinical uses. These include assisting care planning, supporting clinical supervision or focusing communication with the consumer or carer.</p>
<p>These clinical uses may be approached by systematically considering those items with clinically significant ratings. A clinically significant rating is 2 or more on the HoNOS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212458813">13</xref></sup> and is a problem that warrants documentation in progress notes and in the treatment or management plan. This type of representation of the consumer can also be used to consider if the ‘pattern’ of scores matches past experience. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1039856212458813">Figure 1</xref>, the absence of drug and alcohol, or relationship, problems may be an accurate assessment of consumer B. However, is this the usual pattern of presentation for consumers with problems with psychotic phenomena or accommodation issues? Not seeing commonly associated clinical phenomena in a particular scenario should lead to questions to ensure the accuracy of assessment. Recognizing an unusual pattern of presentation can be used by the clinician as a conscious prompt for personal reflection, as a prompt to seek the input of a more senior clinician, or used by such a senior clinician to prioritize and inform their supervision. Such pattern recognition is applied to most clinical judgements; be it about risk of harm, likelihood of treatment response, or possible length of inpatient stay. The HoNOS, or any other ‘outcome’ measure, does not predict these issues but may assist when applied appropriately to a given problem.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1039856212458813">
<title>Is there agreement?</title>
<p>The second question to be answered when reviewing the patterns represented by the measures relates to their agreement between the consumer and clinician. This is particularly easy to understand with reference measures like the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856212458813">14</xref></sup> which allows direct rating by parents, teachers and youths regarding the same domains of psychological attributes and their impact, or the Camberwell Assessment of Need, which includes the perspective of the consumer, clinician and carer across 25 domains. However, such agreement may not be as immediately intuitive as the relationship with measures like the Kessler-10 and the HoNOS. There are two main approaches available to clinicians when reflecting on the measures and the patterns they display.</p>
<p>The first approach is to compare the scores of different instruments for consistency in ‘overall severity’, and then consider the implications of any differences. Continuing exploration of consumer B represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1039856212458813">Figure 1</xref>, if the person completed the Kessler-10 and rated a high score, this would be consistent with the clinician’s perspective, and the similarity in perspective could be used in discussions to encourage engagement with care. However, if the consumer rated themselves as having minimal problems this could be for a number of reasons (poor insight, fear of admission, poor task attention due to illness severity) that should be explored by the clinician. High consumer ratings in the presence of low clinician ratings may also occur for a number of reasons but require prompt exploration including checking for missed problems in the clinician assessment.</p>
<p>The second approach is to discuss the clinicians’ ratings with someone else. Discussion with the consumer and/or carer in relationship to the ratings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1039856212458813">Figure 1</xref> may result in obtaining valuable collaborative history about key issues, or key differences in perspective. Further valuable perspectives may be gained through discussion of the ratings with other clinicians involved with the consumer, or a supervisor. This may be particularly useful when a consumer is seen in different settings, or if there is discussion regarding which domains are most important to focus upon in care planning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1039856212458813">
<title>Has change occurred?</title>
<p>The question of ‘agreement’, and asking the ‘right question’ may be even more important when considering if change has occurred in a consumer. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1039856212458813">Figure 2</xref> represents aspects of the longitudinal history of consumer A from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1039856212458813">Figure 1</xref> and contains information likely to influence care planning that may not otherwise have been available. Note that the figure shows aspects of the longitudinal history and, without using clinical judgement to focus attention on issues that appear particularly relevant, the complexity of information may be overwhelming. Such representations can be used for a number of purposes. They can be used to identify the presence of features in past presentations salient to the question being considered (e. g. actions related to suicide or aggression in this case), and help to focus medical record reviews on when the consumer was in a particular state (including when functioning well). Discussing these types of observations with the consumer is a useful tool for discussing behavioral triggers and identifying relapse prevention strategies.</p>
<fig id="fig2-1039856212458813" position="float">

<p>Change over time: longitudinal history of consumer A from Time A to Time F</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1039856212458813-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>These representations can also be used to understand the different perspectives of the consumer, clinician(and potentially carer. Between time point A and B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1039856212458813">Figure 3</xref> it can be seen that the same consumer reports no improvement in their condition, whilst the clinician has rated an early improvement. Change is not seen in the K10, but is seen in the HoNOS (20 to 18). Such a situation is quite common in the early stages of treating severe depression for example, and identifying the different perspective may be used to assist appropriate discussions about why there is a difference, and what it means for prognosis. However, at time point D, the consumer is clearly rating themselves as deteriorating, whilst the clinician has rated them as improving. Early assessment of the reasons for this difference may have a significant impact on the outcome for the patient. Again, supervision or information systems may facilitate such identification.</p>

<title>Application</title>
<p>There are multiple potential applications of the representational ability of ROM, and a proposed framework for their development, implementation and evaluation. However, just as experienced clinicians utilize information from familiar instruments (such as the Mini Mental State Examination) in the context of other sources of information, with an awareness of their strengths and weaknesses, these factors must be considered in the use of ROM.</p>
<p>Outcome measures like the HoNOS and Kessler-10 can be used to identify patterns in the presentation of the consumer and as an aid to reflective practice:</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A range of standard outcome measures are available in clinical practice but clinicians must invest sufficient time to become familiar with a measure, to understand its strengths and limitations, and to know how to extract desired information. This knowledge then becomes applied through the recognition of patterns of consumer presentation and the associated application of evidence-based interventions.</p>
<p>ROM like the HoNOS and Kessler-10 have the potential to represent important aspects of the current condition of the consumer and how that has changed. The support of information systems in presenting scores in a manner that is relevant and easy to understand (e. g. by using appropriate descriptive labels) is important. However, it is even more important that clinicians have familiarity with the measures. Familiarity allows clinicians to both use pattern recognition to understand the potential significance of results and to see the measures as tools that can support reflective practice. Where clinicians are willing to become familiar with the measures, this ability is already being used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856212458813">15</xref></sup> The challenge is to make the use of these measures ‘routine’.</p>
