         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Phase I marks a significant milestone in the development of any new medicinal product. A target has been identified, and a compound has been discovered that hits the target and has been refined to ensure it has good properties for development. In vivo safety pharmacology and toxicology studies have been conducted and the compound has been tested in preclinical models of the disease. This process will have taken many years. A multidisciplinary team has evaluated all the data and decided to take the plunge and invest in clinical development. And now, the drug is ready to be tested in humans.</p>
         <p>The objectives of the phase I development plan are many. Alongside establishing the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and multiple doses in humans and ascertaining the maximum tolerated dose, it is often important to explore at least some of the following: effect of food on exposure, potential drug-drug interactions, gender and/or age effects, alternative formulations, and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects. Traditionally, this has led to sizable phase I packages with multiple studies that take many months to complete. However, with careful planning and protocols that are written flexibly, many objectives can be addressed under one protocol (often with many parts) that can improve efficiencies in the drug development process and speed up the time to becoming phase II ready. This article illustrates some of the ways in which this can be achieved.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section2-0092861511427865">
         <title>Phase I Clinical Development Planning</title>
         <p>To maximize efficiency in phase I development, the clinical development plan must first be considered as a whole, before considering the details of individual studies. What are the objectives of phase I for the compound in question? What data does the team require before it can proceed to efficacy studies in patients? Are there any potential issues from preclinical development that need to be addressed (eg, QT signal, potential for drug-drug interactions)? Once all the questions are identified, the clinical team can plan which studies need to be conducted to answer them, as well as look for specific ways to minimize the time taken and maximize the value of each study.</p>
         <p>It is becoming increasingly common to combine single-dose ascending (ie, first-in-human) and repeat-dose studies under one protocol.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861511427865">1</xref>
            </sup> With a single protocol written in a flexible way, this can save considerable time by cutting out the period between the end of the single-dose study and the writing of the repeat-dose protocol, as well as the time for regulatory review of the second protocol. In these combined designs, it is typical for the clinical development team to be unblinded while the participants, investigator, all staff at the study site (other than the pharmacist), and study monitors remain blinded to treatment allocation. The clinical development team will carefully review any issues of poor tolerability or adverse events at the individual level and thus need to be fully unblind to make an informed choice of doses for the repeat-dose phase while the study is ongoing. Provided an efficient process is in place for transfer of samples between the study site and the bioanalysis laboratory, as well as of electronic data between the study site and the study statistician and pharmacokineticist, statistical summaries of pharmacokinetic and safety data can be provided quickly throughout the course of the trial to assist the clinical development team at each dose escalation or key decision stage.</p>
         <p>Additional objectives can often be easily incorporated into a combined single- and repeat-dose study. The possibilities here are almost limitless, but a few common examples for an orally administered drug primarily aimed at a broad cross section of the population might be as follows:</p>
         <list list-type="order">
            <list-item>
               <p>Assess the food effect on the PK of a selected dose.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
               <p>Assess the relationship between PK and PD effects (eg, on QT interval).</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
               <p>Assess a potential drug-drug interaction (eg, effect of drug A on drug B, effect of drug B on drug A, or both).</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
               <p>Assess the effect of sex and/or age on PK (if applicable to the target population).</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
               <p>Assess the therapeutic effect, if an appropriate PD measure is available (eg, functional magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, blood biomarker, relevant rating scales).</p>
            </list-item>
         </list>
         <p>If the protocol is written in a flexible way, some of these may be incorporated in an opportunistic manner. For example, if the dose escalations stop earlier than planned (due to reaching the maximum tolerated dose or achieving a higher PK exposure than anticipated), 1 or more of the remaining periods can be used to assess, for example, the food effect on a dose that has been established as being well tolerated earlier in that cohort. Optional cohorts may also be included to allow exploration of higher doses where appropriate (eg, if the planned doses are well tolerated and there are appropriate safety margins—for example, the PK exposures are lower than anticipated). Assessments of PD effects, or drug-drug interactions, can often be built into the design of the planned cohorts, obtaining more information using the same set of participants.</p>

         <title>Considerations</title>
         <sec id="section4-0092861511427865">
            <title>Protocol</title>
            <p>When planning a combination study with many objectives such as those illustrated above, care must be taken to ensure that all optional aspects are clearly explained. Stopping rules at the individual, cohort, and study level and the decision rules for selection of doses and for proceeding (or not) with the optional parts of the study should be outlined. The maximum number of participants to be included should be stated, and there must be no compromise to participant safety through the flexible nature of the study design. Ethics committees and regulators will be particularly concerned that there is an appropriate data review process in place for each key decision stage.</p>
            <p>There may be a greater lead time required between the initiation of protocol development and the first participant visit (because of study complexity), but provided this time is built into the development plan, it is easily accommodated. In fact, overall, there will be a reduction in the development time of the drug (from efficiencies by having only 1 protocol to review, time savings between cohorts, and, in the data management, statistical and reporting processes). Other data analysis activities (eg, population PK) will benefit too from having data consolidated onto one database.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section5-0092861511427865">
            <title>Data Capture</title>
            <p>It is important that the data required for in-stream (ie, while the study is ongoing) decision making can be available for review and analysis very quickly, perhaps even within 24 hours of the assessments being performed. Therefore, some means of electronic data capture are necessary. With a multipart study, which may include a mixture of crossover and parallel-group cohorts, the structure of the database must be carefully considered to ensure that the data from any part of the study can be extracted separately as required for reporting. Where possible, data checks should be built in at data entry, to ensure high-quality data are available for in-stream decision making, which will occur prior to database lock.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section6-0092861511427865">
            <title>In-Stream Monitoring</title>
            <p>During the course of the study, there are likely to be several data review meetings to determine the dose level or other design aspect for the next cohort(s) of participants. These meetings need to be planned from the outset and incorporated into the study schedule. Key points to identify upfront are as follows:</p>
            <list list-type="order">
               <list-item>
                  <p>Which data are required for decision making (PK, adverse events, lab results, etc)?</p>
               </list-item>
               <list-item>
                  <p>How much time needs to be built in for sample analysis and data transfer?</p>
               </list-item>
               <list-item>
                  <p>How much time is required by the pharmacokineticist, statistician, and other study team members to analyze and report the data to the team?</p>
               </list-item>
            </list>
            <p>If appropriate measures are in place, it can in most cases be possible to complete (2) and (3) within a week of the last data point being recorded. Dose escalation decisions are usually made jointly between the clinical development team and the investigator, and therefore during review meetings, care must be taken so that any information that might reveal the treatment blind is not shared with the investigator or other study site personnel.</p>
            <p>From all the above considerations, it can be seen that planning is key. Once everything is in place, the study can proceed efficiently through the various cohorts to completion. The resulting time saving compared to doing several separate protocols can have a high impact in terms of reducing cost and overall development timelines.</p>

      <sec id="section7-0092861511427865">
         <title>Case Study</title>
         <p>The following case study is a randomized, double-blind (investigator and participant), placebo-controlled multipart study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of single and multiple ascending doses of compound Y in healthy volunteers, including assessment of food, drug-drug interaction (the assessment of compound Y on the PK of drug Z), and pharmacodynamic effects. It should be noted that at this stage, the evaluation of food and drug-drug interaction effects is exploratory and may require more robust evaluation later in development. However, early assessment can provide helpful estimates of the potential effects and variability, which can inform future development. The overall study design is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0092861511427865">Figure 1</xref> and more fully described as follows.</p>
         <fig id="fig1-0092861511427865" position="float">

         </fig>
         <p>Cohort 1 and cohort 2 will assess single ascending doses (doses A-D in cohort 1 and E-H in cohort 2) of compound Y and placebo (P). Eight participants will be enrolled into cohort 1 and will receive 3 of the 4 doses of compound Y and placebo. Ten participants will be enrolled into cohort 2, which will comprise 5 periods in which participants will receive all 4 doses of compound Y and placebo. The administration of placebo to 2 participants in each period assists with the interpretation of safety data and maintains the study blind. Typically, doses within each period will be administered in a staggered/sequential manner.<sup>

         </fig>
         <p>The dose escalation meetings (to evaluate pharmacokinetics and safety) will be held on the day before the next dose is due to be administered. Statistical analysis of safety data and PK/PD (eg, vital signs, electrocardiogram) modeling may help inform decisions.</p>
         <p>Cohort 3 is an optional cohort. Cohort 3 will be used to explore doses higher than those explored in cohorts 1 and 2. It will consist of up to 5 dosing periods and use a maximum of 10 participants, with the same design as cohort 2. If dose escalation has been completed in cohorts 1 and 2, then cohort 3 will not be used.</p>
         <p>In the event that the dose escalations need to stop prematurely within any cohort (eg, because the maximum tolerated dose has been reached), then the remaining dosing periods may be used to gather more data on lower doses or to administer a previously studied dose with food. If the latter option (food) is used, then in the period where food is administered, all participants will receive the selected dose, and no participants will receive placebo.</p>
         <p>Cohort 4 is an optional crossover cohort comprising 2 periods. Ten participants will receive a single dose of compound Y under fasted and fed conditions (in a randomized order). If the food effect has been explored in an earlier cohort, then cohort 4 will not be used. Cohort 4 can be run in parallel with the multiple-dose cohorts.</p>
         <p>Cohorts 5 and 6 are multiple-dose cohorts, exploring the pharmacokinetics and safety of 2 different dose levels of compound Y when administered daily for 28 days. The choice of dose levels will be based on evaluation of data from the single-dose cohorts. In each cohort, 12 participants will receive active compound and 4 participants will receive placebo, in a parallel-group design. Cohort 5 can typically be run in parallel to cohort 3 (where conducted).</p>
         <p>In cohort 6, it is planned to include an assessment of a potential drug interaction, looking at the effect of repeated doses of compound Y on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of drug Z (which is given on day –7 and day 28). For this development program, the preclinical data indicate the potential only for compound Y to inhibit the metabolism of drug Z and no possibility that drug Z could affect the PK or PD of compound Y. This is not always the case, so care needs to be taken if using this approach.</p>
         <p>Also in cohort 6, assessments of key PD end points will be made on days 1 and 27. The design of cohorts 5 and 6 is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0092861511427865">Figure 3</xref>. Cohort 6 can be started as soon as the data review from day 14 of cohort 5 has been completed.</p>

         </fig>
         <p>Cohort 7 is an optional cohort that may be used to explore the pharmacokinetics and safety of 28 days of dosing of a further dose level of compound Y if required. If cohort 7 goes ahead, there will be 12 participants on active and 4 participants on placebo, and the schedule of assessments will be the same as for cohort 4. Cohort 7 could be started once the review of data from day 14 of cohort 6 has been completed (or, if cohort 7 is at a lower dose than cohort 6, it could run in parallel).</p>

         <title>Commentary on the Case Study</title>
         <p>This example illustrates some of the possibilities, but many different options could have been considered.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861511427865">3</xref>
            </sup> For example, the single-dose ascending cohorts (cohorts 1 and 2) could have used an interlocking cohort pattern, which may be particularly helpful if a long half-life were anticipated requiring a longer washout between doses. The slightly different designs for cohort 1 and cohort 2 also illustrate alternative options. In cohort 1, it is assumed that the doses to be studied are low and not of any interest for the purposes of development. The primary objective of cohort 1 is purely to demonstrate safety before moving on to study higher doses in the therapeutic range in cohort 2. Therefore, the design of cohort 1 is less statistically robust than that of cohort 2, in that participants do not receive all of the dose levels, and the dose levels are completely confounded with period. However, it is conducted more quickly and with fewer participants. In cohort 2, where the doses may cover the range of expected therapeutic benefit, a more robust design is used so that data are available for all doses for all participants, and the dose levels are staggered to some extent across the dosing periods, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0092861511427865">Figure 2</xref>. Cohort 3, if it proceeds, will also use doses that are of potential interest for development and so has the same robust design as cohort 2.</p>
         <p>There are 2 possibilities to assess the effect of food on compound Y. It may be added to a later period of one of the dose escalation cohorts should a decision be taken not to escalate the dose; in this case, cohort 4 will not be needed. However, cohort 4 is included as an option to allow the food effect to be studied if cohorts 1 to 3 complete all dose escalations in each period, as planned.</p>
         <p>For the multiple-dose cohorts, it is assumed that at least 2 and possibly 3 dose levels will be explored. Cohort 5 covers the lowest dose, which perhaps represents the lowest dose that may be considered for future development. Hence, the design for this cohort is simple. Cohort 6 is intended to cover the most likely dose for future development, and this is the reason for including the assessment of the potential drug-drug interaction and also the PD assessments in this cohort. However, PK/PD modeling is more informative where a range of doses is used, and thus, where trial budget and practicalities allow, there would be benefit in including PD in cohorts 5 and 7 (or even the single-dose cohorts), although resources for PD may be best left to studies in patients depending on the nature of the PD. For the assessment of the drug-drug interaction, cohort 6 only considers the effect of repeat dosing of compound Y on drug Z. It should be noted that in measuring the effect of repeat dosing of compound Y (so that it is at steady state) on drug Z, PK is generally more relevant than administering only a single dose of compound Y, but an appropriate design will depend on the half-lives of compound Y and drug Z. Cohort 7 allows the option of a third dose level and, if desired, could also include PD assessments.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>This article has provided an overview of some of the ways in which phase I packages can be tailored to the needs of the specific compound and conducted more efficiently using combination, flexible protocols. Considerations that need to be made at the planning stage have been outlined and the practicalities discussed so that best use can be made of emerging PK and safety data to enable informed decisions regarding study progression. The case study illustrates some of the possibilities within a combination first-in-human and repeat-dose design. Combination studies can also be used in different settings, for example, “cocktail” drug-drug interactions where probes for several CYP450 pathways are administered simultaneously, with and without the test drug, to enable the assessment of several potential drug interactions in 1 study.</p>
         <p>Apart from combination studies, use of novel statistical designs can be used to improve phase I or other clinical pharmacology studies in other ways. For example, the use of incomplete block designs (where each participant receives a subset of the treatments under study) can enable more treatments to be tested within a crossover study than might otherwise be thought practical. This may arise in situations where different formulations of the same compound are to be evaluated. Factorial designs can also be used to help explore several factors simultaneously in 1 study (eg, for ascertaining the optimal dose levels for a combination product). For compounds where the expected variability of the pharmacokinetic parameters is high, resulting in a large sample size, the use of interim analysis or sequential designs can offer the opportunity to complete the study more quickly with fewer participants, if the primary objective has been reached or the study looks as if it will fail to achieve it.</p>
         <p>In conclusion, the use of combination studies, flexible protocols, and novel statistical designs can significantly improve phase I and clinical pharmacology packages, with benefits both in terms of timelines and costs.</p>
