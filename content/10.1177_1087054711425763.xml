</p>
<p>Children and adolescents referred to a pediatric psychopharmacology clinic were systematically evaluated for psychopathology using a psychiatrist-administered diagnostic interview, parent- and teacher-report rating scales assessing the child’s behavior, and child-completed self-report scales. Children diagnosed with bipolar disorder were more verbally aggressive and exhibited higher levels of reactive aggression than children with ADHD without co-occurring bipolar disorder. Children with bipolar disorder also reported higher levels of depressive symptoms than children with ADHD without bipolar disorder. The Child Behavior Checklist pediatric bipolar disorder profile did not accurately identify children diagnosed with bipolar disorder.</p>

</p>
<p>A population of approximately 600 children between the ages of 10 and 14 and their parent/guardians responded to multiple behavioral measures. Outcome measures included parent- and child-reported attention problem behaviors on the Child Behavior Checklist as well as poor school performance as measured by the grade point average. Results found that internal factors such as male gender, antisocial traits, family environment, and anxiety best predicted attention problems. School performance was best predicted by family income. Television and video game use, whether total time spent using or exposure to violent content specifically, did not predict attention problems or grade point average.</p>

</p>
<p>In two studies, these authors measured executive functions, including shifting and resistance to distraction, and evaluated whether children with ADHD can empower these functions by forming implementation plans (e.g., if–then plans). In the first study, children with ADHD made fewer perseverative errors on a shifting task when instructed to make if–then plans. They also benefited from if–then plans in solving math problems that required working memory and the inhibition of distraction earning a second study.</p>

</p>
<p>This study investigated the effect of tic disorder and ADHD on attentional functions. Nearly 100 children participated in this study, including 21 with tic disorders, 23 with ADHD, and 25 with a combination as well as a control group. Attentional performance was tested based on four computerized attention tasks. The effect of tic disorder as well as ADHD on attentional performance was tested using a 2 × 2 factorial approach. A diagnosis of tic disorder had no negative impact on attentional functions but was associated with improved performance in the set shifting task. By contrast, regardless of a diagnosis of tic disorder, participants with ADHD were found to perform worse in the sustained attention, divided attention, and go/no-go task. In participants with tic disorder and ADHD, ADHD psychopathology is often the main source of impairment whereas a diagnosis of tic disorder has little or no impact on neuropsychological performance in most cases and even seems to be associated with adaptive mechanisms.</p>

</p>
<p>In a cross-sectional, case control study, sleep problems were compared in referred children meeting the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed.) criteria for Anxiety Disorder, ADHD, or the comorbid conditions. Children in the clinical groups had more sleep problems than did controls. Children with anxiety disorder and children with comorbid conditions were reported to have more sleep problems than were children with ADHD alone. Night waking was associated with comorbid anxiety disorder and ADHD. Bedtime resistance was associated with anxiety disorder, whereas daytime sleepiness affected all clinical groups.</p>

</p>
<p>A total of 51 adults with ADHD on stable medical treatment or on no medication were randomized into a dialectical behavioral therapy skills training or a parallel loosely structured discussion group. Self-rating scales were administered before randomization and after the treatment. The treatment was feasible in an outpatient psychiatric context well tolerated in significantly reduced ADHD symptoms in on treatment individuals who remain stable regarding medication status. Those receiving the dialectical behavioral therapy demonstrated a significant reduction in ADHD symptoms above and beyond the control group. No reduction of comorbidity was observed in either of the groups.</p>

</p>
<p>This study examined the impact of working memory deficits on parent- and teacher-reported social problems in a sample of children with ADHD and typically developing boys. The authors demonstrated that the impact of working memory deficits on social problems is primarily indirect. That is, impaired social interactions in children with ADHD reflect to a significant extent the behavioral outcome of being unable to maintain a focus of attention on information within working memory while simultaneously dividing attention among multiple, ongoing events and social cues occurring within the environment. Central executive deficits affected social problems through both inattentive and impulsive-hyperactive symptoms, whereas the subsidiary phonological and visuospatial storage/rehearsal systems demonstrated a more limited yet distinct relationship with children’s social problems.</p>

</p>
<p>In this phase three, double-blind placebo control trial, children and adolescents with hyperactive or combined subtype ADHD who had an inadequate response to their stable stimulant regime were randomized to receive extended-release Clonidine or placebo in combination with their baseline stimulant medication. The results of this study suggested that extended-release Clonidine in combination with stimulants may be useful in reducing ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents with partial response to stimulants. Adverse events and changes in vital signs in the group receiving the extended-release Clonidine were generally mild.</p>

</p>
<p>The relationship between direct and indirect measurements of social skills and social problem behaviors for children at risk to receive a diagnosis of ADHD was examined. Participants included 3- to 5-year-old children who were participating in a larger study examining the effects of early intervention, and teachers rated social skills and social problems of all participants. Direct observation data of participants were also collected at preschool during free play. Results support previous research on social skills assessment and suggest that indirect and direct measures may not be measuring the same aspects of social skills. Lower levels of observed social play were associated with higher levels of observed solitary play during free play activities. As expected, lower levels of teacher-rated social problems and aggressive behavior were associated with higher levels of teacher-rated social skills. There was a weak, significant positive correlation between teacher ratings and social skills and direct observation of solitary play. Students who engage in high levels of solitary play may appear to be socially skilled to teachers who may mistake the quiet and personal nature of such play with “good” behavior.</p>

</p>
<p>These authors evaluated treatment preferences of nearly 200 parents of young, medication naïve children with ADHD with an average age of 5.8 years. Preferences were evaluated using a discrete choice experiment in which parents made choices between different combinations of treatment characteristics, outcomes, and costs. Latent class analysis yielded two segments of parents: (a) Medication-avoidant parents constituted 70% of the sample whose treatment decisions were strongly influenced by a desire to avoid medication and (b) outcome-oriented parents constituted 30% of the sample whose treatment decisions were most influenced by a desire for positive treatment outcomes. Parents in the outcome-oriented segment were more stressed and depressed, had lower socioeconomic status and education, were more likely to be single, and had more disruptive and impaired children.</p>
