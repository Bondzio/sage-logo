<abstract>
<p>One of the most significant yet largely hidden outcomes of the Cold War was the proliferation of hundreds of large, multipurpose dams throughout Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America under the auspices of programs of water resource development. These programs were the result of technical assistance programs created and guided by various organs of the US government. Carried out as an effort to convince newly independent states of America’s support and good intentions, this proliferation of water expertise was spearheaded by the US Bureau of Reclamation – an agency of the Department of Interior that became embroiled within efforts of the State Department to achieve specific geopolitical goals by containing the spread of global communism. This paper examines the evolution of a technopolitical network constructed around the Bureau’s most intensive engagement in supervising water resource development overseas, the promotion and design of the Pa Mong dam on the Mekong River during the 1960s. This case contributes to ongoing debates over the convergence between technical expertise and water by considering the complex intermingling – and co-production – of geopolitical practices and technological knowledge and expertise in efforts to transform rivers that were characteristic of the mid-20th century.</p>

<body>
<p>In 1961, just 2 years after becoming Commissioner of the US Bureau of Reclamation, an agency of the Department of the Interior responsible for development of the nation’s water resources, the redoubtable Floyd Dominy received a request from the US State Department that he personally travel to Southeast Asia for an important meeting regarding the proposed construction of a massive dam on the Mekong River. After flying to Bangkok, he was met by the American Ambassador, who informed the Commissioner that he was authorized by the US government to ‘tell the Prime Minister [of Thailand] that the United States will help underwrite the construction of the Pa Mong Dam on the Mekong River.’ Dominy’s garrulous response, recounted years later, is notable:
<disp-quote>
<p>Mr. Ambassador, as Commissioner of Reclamation, I can’t support any such nonsense. … Nobody knows anything about that damsite. All they know is that there’s a canyon there that’s narrow [and] a big river. … Nobody knows the hydrology, nobody knows how many villages you’d flood out with the reservoir, nobody knows what the geology is, whether we can actually put a dam in that canyon safely or not. None of these things are known, so the most you’ll get me to say on behalf of the United States Government is that we’ll make the necessary studies to see if a dam in the Pa Mong dam site area [on the Mekong River] is feasible.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Subsequently, Dominy confided to his interviewer,
<disp-quote>
<p>This is all part of the Vietnam thing, they [the State Department] were trying to do anything they could, you know, to show the United States’ presence in Laos, and Thailand, and … that’s the way it was. I insisted that we limit our [the Bureau’s] participation to making this study. And, of course, I made it look good. I took a man from [Thailand], and a man from Laos, and actually went up the river in a small boat, and looked at the site on the ground. And I flew over it in a small plane, and made a big show out of it; then, we made a study. And it would be a great dam, a dam 350 feet high would create 150 million acre-feet of usable water a year … 10 times greater [than the Colorado].<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0306312712445835">1</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Dominy’s reflections on this ‘great dam’ are remarkable at several levels, but perhaps none more so than the one highlighting the disjuncture between technological knowledge and expertise concerning water resource development, on the one hand, and the geopolitical imagination underpinning US foreign policy in the late 1950s and early 1960s, on the other. Dominy, then Commissioner of perhaps the most well-known water management agency in the world, clearly recognized the need to ‘make a show out of it’, referencing the desire to demonstrate America’s technological prowess when it came to developing water resources. But who was this show for? And what kinds of knowledge and expertise did this show require? While the <italic>idea</italic> of river basin development and massive dam projects was extremely attractive to State Department officials as demonstrations of American technical assistance and financial largesse to newly independent states, the knowledge required to undertake such ambitious schemes rested on, as Dominy notes, a detailed understanding of river hydrology and geomorphology, geological conditions at the dam site and areas slated for irrigated agriculture, and a host of other biophysical and socioeconomic characteristics of the basin – in short, all the knowledge necessary to undertake comprehensive water development. This expertise, however, came into conflict with equally critical forms of calculation: the geopolitical goals of the American state and the developmental goals of the nation-states sharing the lower Mekong basin (Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia). These goals revolved around the provision of economic and technical assistance to ‘underdeveloped regions’ as critical components of a broader strategy to simultaneously contain the political, economic and ideological influence of the Soviet Union (and China) in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>In line with the Special Issue’s themes, this paper draws attention to the mutual constitution of political dynamics and technical expertise embedded within efforts to capture, redirect, enhance, or otherwise alter water in the name of human aspirations – typically but not exclusively related to the contested concept of ‘development’. More specifically, I examine how geopolitical framings of the so-called Third World, in particular mainland Southeast Asia, by the US foreign policy apparatus in the 1950s and 1960s both internalized and re-interpreted the technical expertise associated with the manipulation of flowing water through large hydroelectric dams. The primary agent of this intermingling, or co-production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306312712445835">Jasanoff, 2004</xref>), of knowledge and political dynamics was the US Bureau of Reclamation and its technical experts in engineering, land use planning, hydrology, and associated fields. While the Bureau’s international activities during the Cold War encompassed water resource development projects in such diverse settings as South, East, and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and East Africa, the various histories of these projects have been largely absent from historical studies of the nexus of water, expertise, and development. The focus of the story recounted here is a single massive scheme, the Pa Mong dam, which was seen by its proponents as the linchpin for development of the entire Mekong River basin. Despite years of study costing millions of dollars, and the production of hundreds of plans and reports, Pa Mong was never built. Still, I argue, it clearly demonstrates how particular technologies and forms of knowledge are both integrated within networks of political calculation and also generate broader networks of expertise, ecological relations and, in this case, geopolitics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0306312712445835">2</xref></sup> An important question thus becomes: How did the geopolitical visions adopted by the US state help create new geographies of development – particularly in the Mekong context – via the diffusion of large dams and the technical expertise that accompanied them? Further, how did the changing character of geopolitical conditions in the Mekong engage with and alter the technical expertise designed to generate large-scale water resource development? To respond to these questions, I trace the history of a single project, which, while never fully realized, firmly established the circulation of technology and politics that first imagined and eventually co-produced the Mekong basin as a resource in need of exploitation.</p>
<p>This paper builds on recent work in science and technology studies (STS) and associated fields that explores the relations between water and politics, as mediated by specific technologies and forms of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306312712445835">Alatout, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306312712445835">Barnes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306312712445835">Bijker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306312712445835">de Laet and Mol, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306312712445835">Nega, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0306312712445835">Phadke, 2002</xref>). Despite a longstanding interest in technologies as expressions of political desires and conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0306312712445835">Winner, 1980</xref>), a growing and stimulating engagement with ‘technoscience’ as form of political negotiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306312712445835">Asdal et al., 2007</xref>), and broader commitments to examine the multiple and fluid interactions between technology and politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306312712445835">Papadopoulos, 2011</xref>), the diverse literature in STS has had surprisingly little to say about dams as technological and political objects. This is a rather remarkable absence, considering the highly politicized origins and impacts of so many large dams, the vast societal expenditures required for their construction, their material and symbolic attachment to governments and even specific regimes, and their capacity to simultaneously and radically transform biophysical and social relations. Perhaps even more notably, STS research infrequently has engaged with geopolitics in discussions of the technology–politics nexus, and in particular the historical geopolitical architectures of the Cold War.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0306312712445835">3</xref></sup> Hence, a corollary goal of this paper is to develop a dialogue between research in STS, critical geopolitics, and the geopolitics of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0306312712445835">Slater, 2004</xref>). From a critical perspective, geopolitics encompasses the historical processes that produce state structures, as well as geopolitical imaginations and ‘imaginative geographies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306312712445835">Gregory, 1995</xref>), grounded in discourses specific to certain times and places, that express geopolitics in formal (e.g. through general statements of policy), practical (e.g. diplomatic functions), and popular (e.g. media representations of foreign policy) terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306312712445835">Ó Tuathail, 2006</xref>). Given these conceptual aims, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306312712445835">Timothy Mitchell’s (2002)</xref> seminal work on the historical role of US foreign aid in the construction of the modern state of Egypt serves as a useful guide. In the context of the present discussion, Mitchell’s key contribution resides in his investigation of how technical expertise came to be deeply embedded within political actors and actions associated with the complex process of economic development in the latter half of the 20th century, a process he terms ‘technopolitics’. While recognizing that dams are, of course, exceptionally thick with politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306312712445835">Bijker, 2007</xref>), my aim is to bring to light the particular technopolitical configurations specific to each project and place that were created and in many ways retained in the context of river basin development.</p>
<p>In addition, this paper emphasizes the need for an historical perspective to tease out the precise character of technological interventions regarding water in terms of both (geo)political origins and subsequent effects. While early historical studies within technology studies assumed an unambiguous, albeit dialectical and systemic, relationship between technological and social change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306312712445835">Hughes, 1993</xref>), more recent work argues that ‘technologies and human lives are mutually embedded, enabling, and determining’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0306312712445835">Schatzki, 2003</xref>: 90–91). Within this process, that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0306312712445835">Theodore Schatzki (2003)</xref> describes as ‘technologization’, human interactions with technology (and nature) increase in intensity and mutual dependence over time, creating new situations that in turn further integrate human lives with technologies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0306312712445835">4</xref></sup> Large dams and ‘water resource development’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0306312712445835">5</xref></sup> efforts more generally are intimately bound up in the recursive processes Schatzki describes, and numerous studies have examined the historical transformations of regions and rivers when dams and other water infrastructures generate novel hybrids of nature and society, frequently over a time span of several decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306312712445835">Billington and Jackson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306312712445835">Klingensmith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306312712445835">O’Neill, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0306312712445835">White, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0306312712445835">Worster, 1992</xref>). In effect, river basins have become ‘organic machines’ whose regulation for use by human societies has resulted in intensely hybridized forms of organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0306312712445835">White, 1995</xref>). Concomitantly, recent historical studies within STS have demonstrated the critical role of water and its incorporation within political discourses and actions as part of broader processes of nation building and development. The end result is technopolitical networks that privilege certain discourses concerning water (for example, discourses on ‘abundance’ or ‘scarcity’) and that bolster the political agendas of specific social groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306312712445835">Alatout, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306312712445835">2009</xref>). The key point is that claims about water’s inherently political nature are banal ‘without specifying how water becomes part of a specific technopolitical network with specific effects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306312712445835">Alatout, 2009</xref>: 370–371). In the case of Pa Mong, the technological knowledge required to conceive and ultimately construct the project came into constant dialogue with geopolitical expertise – itself founded on a frequently mistaken and opaque geopolitical imagination of mainland Southeast Asia and the Mekong region’s states and societies. Under the guidance of Bureau water experts, US State Department officials, and their counterparts among the riparian states, development of the Mekong constituted a technopolitical network with its own historical trajectory, with the Pa Mong dam as a key node.</p>
<p>The empirical details presented here are based primarily on archival records gathered at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in Washington, DC, and NARA’s Rocky Mountain Regional office in Denver, Colorado. Information on the activities of the US State Department (Record Group 59) and the Bureau of Reclamation (Record Group 115) were supplemented by relevant documents attained through the Declassified Document Reference System (DDRS), an invaluable online, full-text collection of declassified US government documents covering the years immediately after the Second World War through the 1970s. During several visits over the past decade, I also consulted numerous reports on the Pa Mong project at the Document Center of the Mekong River Commission in Vientiane, Lao PDR. In terms of methodology, I have tried to heed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0306312712445835">Hayden White’s (1987</xref>: 164–165) advice to not ‘go to history’ as a tourist without a clear idea of how a particular history might serve specific conceptual goals. Rather, historical research must maintain a constant dialogue between research goals – in this case, how technical expertise and global geopolitical objectives coalesced around water resource development in the Mekong basin in the 1950s and 1960s – and the efficacy of the archival materials that bring that history to light. The end result should be a plausible account of the historical processes under consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0306312712445835">White, 1987</xref>: 164), one that readers can assess and, if they are so inclined, reconstruct.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0306312712445835">6</xref></sup> This paper proceeds to an exploration of the technopolitics of water resource development during the Cold War era by considering, next, the scope and scale of the US Bureau of Reclamation’s international engagements in technical assistance, with a particular focus on how Bureau technical expertise became embedded within US foreign policy objectives. I then turn to a specific case study – that of the planning of the Pa Mong dam during the 1960s as <italic>the</italic> key mainstream project that would catalyze development of the entire Mekong River basin. I conclude with some thoughts on what this case might contribute to contemporary research on water-society relations and the role that technical expertise plays in constructing and maintaining these networks in the Mekong region and elsewhere.</p>
<sec id="section1-0306312712445835">
<title>The Bureau of Reclamation and the global circulation of water expertise</title>
<p>The Bureau of Reclamation was created by an act of the US Congress in 1902. It began as a relatively modest organization charged with providing water through irrigation infrastructure to the arid lands of the Western US. As the sophistication and capability of long-distance power transmission progressed in the early 20th century, the Bureau’s mandate shifted to include the construction of large-scale hydroelectric dams. During the New Deal era of the 1930s and 1940s, the Bureau became deeply entwined with Federal efforts to stimulate economic development through the construction of multi-purpose projects and, eventually, comprehensive river basin development programs designed to promote agricultural and urban development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306312712445835">Billington and Jackson, 2006</xref>). As large-scale, regional initiatives became more and more part of the Bureau’s vision and practice in the 1930s, in particular massive hydroelectric projects such as Hoover Dam on the Colorado River, an ‘engineering mentality’ came to define the Bureau’s organizational culture that, according to the Bureau’s ‘semiofficial’ historian Michael Robinson, generated an institutional propensity for ‘majestic dams’ that produced enormous quantities of electricity (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306312712445835">Reisner, 1986</xref>: 135–136). In addition, the Reclamation program was from its inception subject to political pressures from a host of actors – including agricultural interests, Congressional representatives, local ‘boosters’ of (especially Western US) economic growth, and resource managers of various stripes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306312712445835">Reisner, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0306312712445835">Worster, 1992</xref>) – and these pressures deepened as the Bureau’s operations expanded throughout the West. Thus, it is not an understatement to say that the Bureau’s prodigious domestic engineering achievements – the construction and operation of about 180 projects in 17 Western US states at a total cost of roughly US$11 billion<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0306312712445835">7</xref></sup> – were predicated on a deeply politicized domestic milieu of competing interests.</p>
<p>While the Bureau’s domestic activities vastly overshadowed its international efforts in terms of staff and resources, the scope of what the Bureau called its ‘foreign operations’ was extraordinary. Those operations commenced officially in 1950 and centered on the transfer of technical knowledge on water resource development primarily to the ‘developing’ regions of Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0306312712445835">8</xref></sup> In a paper delivered in 1969, Assistant Commissioner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0306312712445835">Gilbert Stamm (1969</xref>: 1) reflected that the ‘Bureau of Reclamation has provided technical assistance in the field of multiple- purpose water resource development to over 108 nations in an effort to narrow the ever-widening gap in technology between the developed and developing nations.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0306312712445835">9</xref></sup> A similar overview in 1973 noted the following countries had received substantial assistance: Lebanon, Sudan, Turkey, Ethiopia, Thailand, India, Australia, Afghanistan, Brazil, China, Korea, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, Iraq, Iran, Costa Rica, the Philippines, and Nicaragua (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0306312712445835">Thorsky, 1973</xref>). Prominent among the Bureau’s most significant efforts, listed chronologically, were the investigations of the Litani River Basin in Lebanon (1952–1958), the Blue Nile Basin in Ethiopia (1956–1964), a series of river basin studies in the Philippines (1962–1970), and of course the Bureau’s long engagement in the Mekong (1960–1974). This tremendous expansion in the number of regions hosting Bureau technical experts was to a significant extent the result of US geopolitical calculations as to where the regimes of newly independent states in what came to be called the ‘Third World’ could be convinced that allying with the West in Cold War struggles was to their benefit (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0306312712445835">Westad, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The Bureau’s overseas forays also raise questions about the distribution of the technical knowledge surrounding water resource development to ‘underdeveloped regions’, and who was most competent to wield this knowledge. According to agency staff, who were present at the inception of the foreign program in the early 1950s, it was critical that the Bureau’s prodigious technical expertise in water resource development was not misused and delegitimized, regardless of geopolitical goals. Bureau specialists had faith in neither State Department representatives nor foreign officials to adequately assess a developing nation’s needs in the area of water resource development. As the Director of Foreign Operations argued at the onset of the Bureau’s overseas activities in the early 1950s, the ‘concept of an organization which engaged in the control, conservation, and use of water resources and the land resources in connection therewith is simply not one that is readily understood in the isolated cloisters of State Department diplomacy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306312712445835">Pratt, 1953</xref>: 9). Two years prior, the Bureau’s Acting Commissioner noted that ‘embassy aids [sic.], no matter how bright and industrious, are not qualified to interpret reclamation needs of countries in the terms that the Bureau requires to analyze requests and organize technical assistance missions.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0306312712445835">10</xref></sup> Bureau engineers demanded that ‘qualified’ Bureau experts should undertake any assessment of water resource development potential as a prerequisite to deeper involvement. Following a trip to India in 1950, the Acting Commissioner wrote that he ‘discovered what the country <italic>really</italic> needs from the Bureau’, and that it was a far cry from ‘what it has requested and is now continuing urgently to request.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0306312712445835">11</xref></sup> Moreover, if the Bureau’s technical superiority was not recognized and adequately prioritized in foreign programs of water resource development, there could be a loss of confidence in the Bureau’s technological skills as well as unforeseen geopolitical consequences for the US. A 1952 communiqué from the Bureau’s Director of Project Planning reveals precisely this concern. After noting that in the past several years ‘the Bureau has assumed the responsibility for the design of dams and other project works [overseas] without any knowledge of the hydrology involved’, the Director enumerates the ways in which a lack of basic hydrologic data of reasonable quality or, in some cases, a blind acceptance of hydrologic data provided by the country hosting the project, could lead to negative impacts. For example, a ‘dam designed without an adequate spillway [a structure for channeling abnormally high flows over or through a dam] is a menace and may fail by overtopping’, leading to ‘extensive damage and loss of life.’ Such outcomes ‘could not only hurt the Bureau’s reputation but also severely damage the international good will that the technical assistance work is intended to build.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0306312712445835">12</xref></sup> Eventually, as evidenced by Dominy’s statements about his trip to Southeast Asia in 1961, concerns over how the Bureau’s expertise might be misappropriated were also present in the case of the Pa Mong project. Yet, as described below, such concerns were largely overrun by geopolitical objectives.</p>
<p>Accounts from the Bureau’s early years of technical assistance in what would eventually be called the ‘Third World’ reflect the organization’s desire to defend and stabilize that expertise for the power and legitimacy it conferred. However, Bureau staff members were dismayed that their expertise would be used and de-legitimized for political ends in the context of foreign interventions. This professed outrage, however, overlooked the Bureau’s own history (mentioned above) as a dynamic political actor <italic>within</italic> the US, and in general the highly politicized character of water resource development throughout American history. Over the course of the 20th century, both individual dam projects and programs of river basin development were transformed in all phases of their implementation – from conception and design to construction and operation – through the efforts of congressional representatives, advocates of regional economic growth, agricultural interests, certainly Bureau officials themselves, and numerous other political actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306312712445835">Billington and Jackson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306312712445835">Introcaso, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306312712445835">Jackson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0306312712445835">Worster, 1992</xref>). And yet, I argue, the <italic>global</italic> networks and geopolitical imaginations at work during Cold War efforts to use technical assistance in general, and water resource development in particular, as tools against perceived Communist expansion produced specific types of technopolitical configurations. These configurations depended crucially on the places and things being ‘developed’ and, as noted above, the specific technologies and knowledge (in this case, the exploitation of water resources) being applied to such development. In addition, the Bureau’s overseas activities – as was the case with development assistance programs in Egypt described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306312712445835">Mitchell (2002)</xref> – did not represent a novel form of technological expertise so much as a reorganization and concentration of previously existing forms applied in new locations that had been largely unknown to the self-professed experts. The Bureau’s expertise in water resource development ‘did not work by bringing science and technology to develop natural resources. It happened just as much the other way around, and in ways that tended to be incomplete or unrealizable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306312712445835">Mitchell, 2002</xref>: 41–42). In the context of the Bureau’s efforts in Southeast Asia during the 1960s, the particular characteristics of the Mekong River basin (the ‘natural resources’ waiting to be ‘developed’) were calculated and simplified under the impetus of the Bureau’s particular expertise in water resources and river basin development. What made this, to return to Alatout’s phrase, ‘technopolitical network’ unique was the reasoning – initiated by US foreign policy staff and later accepted, at least partially, by Bureau experts – that the Pa Mong dam could simultaneously be an ‘American project’ rendering tangible geopolitical benefits as well as the ‘sinew of development’ for the entire basin and its nation-states.</p>

<title>Bureau expertise, the Pa Mong dam, and Cold War geopolitics in Southeast Asia</title>
<p>Of its numerous international activities, the Bureau’s work in the Mekong and on studies specifically related to construction of the Pa Mong scheme constitutes the most intensive overseas activity in their history. Related historical work has covered the role of Mekong development initiatives in the regional geopolitics of the Cold War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306312712445835">Nguyen, 1999</xref>), the Bureau’s activities in the region focused on spurring modernization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306312712445835">Biggs, 2006</xref>), and how the Mekong became part of a broader geopolitical and developmental vision to globalize river basin planning strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306312712445835">Ekbladh, 2002</xref>), yet no studies place Pa Mong at the center of analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0306312712445835">13</xref></sup> In this account, I highlight the tensions between the actual work of the engineers engaged in river basin studies and the broader geopolitical aims of policy makers in the State Department. These tensions were not simply indicative of bureaucratic ‘turf battles’ or organizational dysfunctions, but reflected a deeper struggle between the perceived value of using technical assistance as a geopolitical tool, professed by US foreign policy experts, and the approach of Bureau of Reclamation engineers in their desire to measure, calibrate, estimate, and otherwise examine the necessary biophysical details of a dam site – to generate multiple ‘inscriptions’ in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312712445835">Latour’s (1990)</xref> sense – before moving ahead with a project. Yet, Pa Mong reflected an additional tension, more internal to the Bureau and how it applied its expertise to the Mekong River as a developmental challenge. Documents emphasize repeatedly that Pa Mong was simply the beginning of a much more ambitious program of river basin development. It was to be, in the words of a promotional document produced by Bureau officials, the ‘sinew of development’ for transforming the entire basin through the construction of multiple hydroelectric projects, irrigation works, advanced agricultural production, agro-industrial development, and other accoutrements of the ‘modern’ river basin (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0306312712445835">Sneddon and Fox, 2011</xref>). This ‘imaginative geography’ of a transformed Mekong basin was propagated, initially, by State Department officials convinced of the efficacy of water resource development as a geopolitical tool. As I show below, the Bureau experts working on Pa Mong at first were hesitant to embrace this representation in the face of significant technical and economic hurdles. Eventually, however, they adopted the vision of basin-scale development. Bureau expertise thus played a key role in co-producing and legitimizing an imaginative Mekong geography, which in turn generated the blueprint for efforts in later decades by the riparian states and affiliated development agencies to materially alter the basin’s biophysical processes through large-scale water resource development.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the actual biophysical conditions of the dam site and the larger Mekong basin, and the socio-cultural and political-economic networks within which this massive water development scheme was embedded, became immaterial until planners realized that these conditions and networks presented significant obstacles to the continued application of either technological or geopolitical know-how. While Bureau engineers and bureaucrats were able to effectively negotiate domestic politics and material conditions as they reworked the geography of the American West, the Mekong proved more difficult. Still, the creation of an imagined Mekong geography – founded on basin-wide water development with Pa Mong at its center – was a direct outcome of the technopolitical network that was set up through the Bureau’s efforts, and it has persisted to the present. This section proceeds by tracing the construction, dynamics, and apparent unraveling of the technopolitical network focused on construction of the Pa Mong dam as means of accomplishing geopolitical and developmental objectives in the Mekong basin.</p>
<sec id="section3-0306312712445835">
<title>The genesis of an ‘American project’</title>
<p>The US government’s earliest engagements with Mekong development and the transfer of technical knowledge involved the conception and coordination of a reconnaissance survey carried out by a team of Bureau experts in early 1956 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306312712445835">United States Bureau of Reclamation, 1956</xref>). A United Nations (UN)-sanctioned team comprised of international experts completed a separate investigation in 1957 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306312712445835">Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, 1957</xref>). These missions and behind-the-scenes lobbying from officials affiliated with both the US and the UN Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) – an agency with a long-standing interest in river basin development – led to creation of the Committee for the Co-ordination of Investigations of the Lower Mekong Basin (Mekong Committee), following an agreement signed in 1957 by Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam. Notably, the agreement did not include the upstream states of Burma (with a negligible portion of the basin within its territory) and more significantly China. At a technological level, this agreement paved the way for the investigations that prioritized Pa Mong and additional large-scale projects, but the Bureau’s early engagements in the region are clearly indicative of the overarching role of geopolitical considerations in the unfolding Mekong-oriented technical and economic initiatives.</p>
<p>The US State Department played a critical and largely hidden role in encouraging international cooperation in the Mekong region during this period. These officials steered the newly independent governments of Indochina towards cooperation, initially with each other and, more importantly, with an American state willing to provide economic and technical assistance as part of an emerging strategy of containment in Cold War-era Southeast Asia. As early as 1954, US embassy personnel stationed in mainland Southeast Asia were urging Thai officials to consider regional economic cooperation under the rubric of a ‘Mekong River Authority’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0306312712445835">14</xref></sup> John Mecklin, an official with the US Information Agency in Saigon, wrote a classified memorandum to Washington, DC in January 1955 detailing what he called the ‘test on the Mekong’, which constituted what he perceived as the geopolitical challenge for the US in the region. Mecklin argued for the US to launch an ‘all out economic aid program’ in Indochina to help fill the political vacuum left after the abrupt termination of nearly a century of French influence, primarily to avoid Communist takeover of South Vietnam and thus ‘save’ Cambodia and Laos as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0306312712445835">15</xref></sup> The State Department subsequently requested from the Bureau a ‘two or three man team … experienced in river basin development’ to undertake a reconnaissance mission in the Lower Mekong basin that should be ‘initiated as soon as possible’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0306312712445835">16</xref></sup> US Embassy officials in the riparian countries suggested that preliminary discussions of the survey should include ‘urgent implementation’ of the study, and, if the study deemed the potential for water development sound, they should envision ‘hydro-electric development at some point on Mekong [sic.]’ along with comprehensive resource development in navigation, forestry and agriculture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0306312712445835">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>After overcoming hurdles related to expenses and holding discussions within the International Cooperation Administration (ICA) on how much priority should be given to Mekong development, three Bureau engineers were designated to the Survey team. The engineers represented several decades of experience across a diversity of water management and dam construction projects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0306312712445835">18</xref></sup> The information presented in the 3-month survey was rather anticlimactic, with no mention of Pa Mong. One of its central conclusions was that the basic data for ‘orderly development of the basin’ were largely non-existent, and that top priority should be accorded to basic data collection relating to ‘stream gaging, rainfall, mapping, hydrographic and topographic surveys, and soils’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306312712445835">United States Bureau of Reclamation, 1956</xref>: i). Assessments of the basin’s potential were cautious and modest; the report noted that a number of ‘small hydroelectric projects appear attractive for study’ and that flood control, presumed by many basin development advocates as a core goal for damming the river, ‘was of doubtful value’ given that ‘(m)ost of the [riparian government] officials questioned stated that floods were beneficial to agriculture, fish production, and high water navigation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306312712445835">United States Bureau of Reclamation, 1956</xref>: i).</p>
<p>Despite the Bureau experts’ lukewarm appraisals of the immediate development potential and the lack of critical hydrological information, embassy officials and ICA staff members were already committed to promoting cooperative economic development of the Mekong as a key objective of US policy. As early as January 1955, Director of ICA John Hollister gave a speech in Bangkok, in which he mentioned the ‘gigantic power [and] irrigation potential of Mekong benefitting four Southeast Asia countries’, and touted the Mekong as an example of a project under study by the US for long-term assistance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0306312712445835">19</xref></sup> Assessments of US strategic interests in mainland Southeast Asia also made the case for US involvement in Mekong development. A 1959 National Security Council report emphasized the ‘importance of steady economic growth and political and social stability in non-Communist Asia, if it is not to succumb to Communist pressures or lures’, and noted bluntly that the ‘weakness and instability of various non-Communist Far East countries – including in some instances a lack of popular identification with the regime in power – engendered by the area’s incomplete political, social and economic revolutions, are major handicaps in meeting the Communist threat.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0306312712445835">20</xref></sup> This same report advises the US bilateral aid programs to support ‘regional and Free World cooperation advantageous to U.S. objectives through such measures as appropriate support of the Colombo Plan, ECAFE, and regional undertakings such as the Mekong Valley Project’, and to give special attention to ‘impact type projects’.</p>
<p>Having established the Mekong River basin as the focus of US technical assistance, in spite of the rather tepid assessment of the Bureau’s water experts of the river’s development potential, Mekong-affiliated planners began the search for an ‘impact type’ project to capture the imagination of the riparian states and attract the technical, financial and geopolitical attentions of international donors, particularly the US government. The Pa Mong dam – to be located on the main channel of the Mekong River approximately 20 km upstream of the Lao capital Vientiane (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0306312712445835">Figure 1</xref>) – was first proposed by staff of the Mekong Secretariat, the administrative and technical arm of the Mekong Committee, as part of a comprehensive river basin development plan that anticipated eight massive hydroelectric dams on the river’s main channel and a slate of tributary projects within the basin’s stream network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306312712445835">Mekong Committee, 1961</xref>). The Mekong Committee and its Chief Executive Officer, C. Hart Schaaf, astutely perceived the attractiveness of a singular, massive project in terms of garnering US financial support and thus demonstrating US beneficence in the region. The Pa Mong project became the focal point of Mekong development, and American attention, following the timely visit by Bureau Commissioner Floyd Dominy in 1961. Dominy’s personal outing to the region and the Pa Mong site further established the tight linkages between technological expertise and geopolitical aims in two important ways. As noted above, he was essentially ordered to Thailand by the State Department in order to demonstrate US commitments to the region’s governments in the form of long-term economic and technical assistance as a counterpoint to growing US military involvement in Indochina. As recounted in a memorandum from the Bangkok Embassy in July 1961, Dominy accomplished this in a masterful way by personally participating in an aerial reconnaissance to the dam site. He played up the Pa Mong scheme as a ‘tremendous project as large as if not larger than anything undertaken by the Bureau of Reclamation in the US’, and committed the Bureau to sending three experts to begin more in-depth investigations of the dam’s feasibility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0306312712445835">21</xref></sup> Second, Dominy clearly established the Bureau’s credentials as the world’s foremost water development agency; one willing and able to provide the appropriate technical expertise for what was one of the world’s largest and most challenging projects, the Pa Mong dam. In the words of an embassy official, the visit was highly successful, showcasing for Thai and Lao representatives ‘a highly qualified team headed by one obviously in full command of the science of putting water and land to use for economic development’, and demonstrating ‘tangible evidence of US interest in the area.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0306312712445835">22</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>However, during this same visit Dominy also advised the riparian governments of ‘the need to proceed carefully to determine the exact nature of the [Pa Mong] project’, and ‘warned against overoptimism’ regarding the speed at which development of the Mekong might commence. The recalcitrance of US technical experts for setting a rapid timetable for completing Pa Mong and similar projects was not palatable to officials in the US State Department, who were convinced that technical assistance, if deployed rapidly, was a critical tool in the Cold War’s ideological struggles. At roughly the same time as Dominy’s Mekong excursion, Southeast Asian specialist Kenneth Landon advised the Kennedy administration that the ‘Mekong has enormous potential for the political and economic future of Southeast Asia and great significance for the future of U.S. relations with the riparian countries.’ And yet, efforts to ‘derive the maximum short-term political impact possible’ from the administration’s proposed funding of Pa Mong studies were in danger of derailment. The source of this disruption was evident: a ‘major hazard lies within our own government [particularly the ICA] because of the one-dimensional thinking … <italic>at the technical level</italic>’ (emphasis added). Landon bemoaned the fact that ICA staff, following conversations with Bureau experts, ‘concluded it would be premature from a technical standpoint to begin an engineering survey of the Pa Mong dam site’ without due attention to economic analyses, alternative options for resource development, and the needs of the people in the region of the project. Ultimately, Landon points out, the State Department perspective triumphed and the Bureau studies were initiated under the authorization of US foreign policy officials. The geopolitical rationale for this triumph is telling: ‘political considerations [are] overriding’ and the offer to fund engineering feasibility studies ‘will have the value of tagging the Pa Mong site as an American project.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0306312712445835">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>In effect, the technical expertise, represented by the credentials and preliminary analyses of the Bureau’s water experts, proved intractable for the geopolitical calculation of the rapid deployment of American aid. In response, that expertise, which recognized the complexity of constructing even a single dam on a river whose dynamic characteristics had yet to be adequately measured, became further embedded within an emerging technopolitical network that prioritized geopolitical expediency. As a result, doubts over Pa Mong’s technical feasibility eventually withered away for a time. Moreover, as the Bureau’s studies of Pa Mong and its environs proceeded, and the hydrologic, geographical, and socioeconomic data supporting the economic necessity to build the dam were collected, inscribed, and disseminated through Bureau channels, the technological hurdles receded further into the background. By the mid-1960s, the technical work and water resource expertise devoted to the project had become so deeply entwined with the Pa Mong dam’s geopolitical origins and ends that the technopolitical project gained momentum, partially if not wholly divorced from its technological and economic feasibility.</p>

<sec id="section4-0306312712445835">
<title>The ‘sinew of development’ and its undoing</title>
<p>Eventually, the Bureau received approval and the necessary funding to carry out feasibility studies on the Pa Mong scheme, and officially launched in August 1963 what would become its longest and most expensive overseas venture. By 1965, the Bureau had seven full time engineering experts working on the Pa Mong studies, and specialists in soils, geology, drainage, and economics were assigned for periods of varying lengths. The Thai and Lao governments contributed more than 40 staff members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0306312712445835">United States Bureau of Reclamation, 1965</xref>). Expenses related to the Pa Mong studies totaled roughly US$10 million dollars over the approximately 12-year life of the program. Phase I, carried out from 1963 to 1966, generated an extraordinary amount of technical information on whether the massive dam was indeed feasible from a biophysical and economic standpoint, although this seemed a foregone conclusion given the geopolitical value attached to the project. Phase II, initiated in 1966 and targeted for completion in an estimated 5 to 7 years, was designed to produce a report on Pa Mong that would bring the study ‘to reconnaissance standards, defined as generalized estimates of costs and benefits of all aspects including irrigation, power production, flood control, and improvement of navigation from increased flows and reduction of salt water intrusion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0306312712445835">United States Bureau of Reclamation, 1966</xref>: 4). When fully completed, the dam’s power plants were projected to produce between 4800 and 5400 MW (dwarfing regional energy demand at the time), and the dam’s reservoir would provide enough stored water to irrigate more than 1 million hectares in the central plains of Laos and in northeast Thailand. According to a Bureau of Recreation promotional brochure at the time, the reservoir produced by the dam would be ‘two and one-half times the size of the largest man-made lake in North America, improving navigation far upstream, as well as [providing] additional flows during low-water periods for navigation downstream of the project’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0306312712445835">United States Bureau of Reclamation, 1970</xref>: 8).</p>
<p>It is impossible conceptually and technologically to separate construction of the Pa Mong dam from the broader program of water resource development envisioned for the Mekong basin, a program that was supported by Mekong Committee staff, US foreign policy experts, Bureau engineers, and – at times haltingly – the basin’s riparian governments. The general idea was to use Pa Mong and two additional massive schemes (the Sambor and Stung Treng dams in Cambodia) for the production of hydroelectricity to fuel industrialization in the region, and simultaneously to use the enormous amount of water stored in their reservoirs to stimulate modern irrigation development. The Pa Mong scheme was ‘considered as the key one in the entire system’,
<disp-quote>
<p>not only because the Pa Mong project … would produce the largest block of power and … bring the largest area under irrigation in the semi-arid region of northeastern part of Thailand, but because of its vast storage capacity that can substantially increase the low water discharge six fold from about 500 m<sup>3</sup>/sec to 3,000 m<sup>3</sup>/sec. Such an increase of perennial flow would add tremendously to the power production capacities of all four multi-purpose projects located downstream, as well as materially increase the [water flows] available for navigation and reduce the extent of salt water intrusion [in the delta]. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306312712445835">Mekong Committee, 1961</xref>: 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The expertise invested in determining the feasibility and design of the Pa Mong dam was by the early 1960s seen as crucial to any future basin-wide development schemes. This perspective on Pa Mong as the catalyst for basin-wide water resource development was reiterated in a later interim report by the Bureau, which argued that Pa Mong must be considered ‘in the perspective of overall basin development … [that] applies not only to the integrated planning of Mekong projects but also to … development schemes such as transportation systems, industrial installations, and educational programs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0306312712445835">United States Bureau of Reclamation, 1965</xref>: 20). This perspective was captured well in an imaginative rendition of Pa Mong as the ‘sinew of development’ that would have impact on nearby landscapes that included portrayals of electricity transmission, urban and industrial development and modern agricultural systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0306312712445835">United States Agency for International Development, 1968</xref>: 13). Bureau engineers also had to undertake the delicate political task of negotiating, albeit within technical discourses, the complicated dynamics of the riparian states’ differential interests in Pa Mong and broader river basin development goals in the basin. As early as 1961, the Thai Prime Minister expressed the hope that a high dam at Pa Mong would contribute to modern irrigation development in the country’s northeast region, which was habitually perceived as Thailand’s most ‘backward’ region and thus susceptible to Communist influence. In a similar vein, the Lao Commissioner of Planning at this time – whose government was confronting growing insurgent forces and a host of internal political conflicts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306312712445835">Karabell, 1999</xref>: 206–224) – made the point to the Bureau that ‘it was extremely important for the dam to be high enough to provide gravity irrigation to Vientiane plain in Laos’, and to observers of the 1961 meeting between Dominy and Oukeo it was obvious that the Lao official ‘was trying to assess the seriousness of the American intention.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0306312712445835">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The most publicly visible expression of the role of Mekong development in Cold War geopolitics was arguably its designation by the Johnson administration as an ‘alternative strategy’ for bringing about peace in Southeast Asia during the latter half of the 1960s. Johnson and his advisors hoped that development of the basin – guided by Bureau experts and funded through the US Agency for International Development – would become a political and cultural symbol of peace, and of cooperative efforts towards material progress for a strife-ridden region. He proposed a total aid package of $89 million to help in the ‘peaceful development of Southeast Asia’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306312712445835">Johnson, 1965</xref>: 303), declaring that the ‘vast Mekong River can provide food and water and power on a scale to dwarf even our own TVA [Tennessee Valley Authority]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306312712445835">Johnson, 1966</xref>: 397). Yet this aid package largely failed to materialize, in part due to growing concerns over the efficacy of large-scale river basin development in the Mekong basin and, more obviously, domestic objections in the US Congress and among the American public to continuing military involvement in Southeast Asia. For these and other reasons, Mekong development centered on construction of the Pa Mong dam became increasingly difficult to maintain as a viable exercise in technopolitics. Nevertheless, Bureau staff persons continued to produce water-related knowledge and promote Mekong development as vital to US national interests. As noted rather grandiloquently by an American journalist working in the region, the ‘Bureau of Reclamation personnel, who have staked this out as their special area of action in the whole region, regard Pa Mong as a once-in-a-generation proposition whose scientific sex appeal would be felt by any virile young American engineer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306312712445835">Hanna, 1968</xref>: 1). The engineers and associated planners working on the Pa Mong and other projects seemed to assume that the scheme’s efficacy was self-evident:
<disp-quote>
<p>Bedazzlement with the bright promise of Pa Mong, Sambor, Stung Treng, and other Mekong projects not infrequently infuses developmental enthusiasts with a sort of ‘project mystique’ which induces them to accept certain ritualistic elements as though they constituted a set of positive values of their own. This means … the conversion of a suggested then often reiterated target date into a fixed schedule and the gradual acceptance of conjectures about costs and returns, once they have been much mooted about, as firm commitments that the money must be raised and the results produced – the disposition … to make the transition, imperceptibly and inadvertently, from the contingent to the categorical. This may well be happening, for instance, with regard to Pa Mong. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306312712445835">Hanna, 1968</xref>: 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This move from the ‘contingent to the categorical’ involved survey missions, a series of professional projections to US foreign policy officials and international aid experts, and, most importantly, thorough technical analyses. The scale and scope of the Bureau’s technical investigations undertaken as part of the Pa Mong program are incredible by any measure. The results of the Phase Two feasibility studies (at least their first stage) encompassed a series of massive volumes, covering a range of issues concerning the project’s suitability: land resources; drainage; hydrology and climatology; geology; plans and estimates (detailing the figures for specific projects within the Pa Mong planning context, including a series of smaller dams and weirs to redirect flows for additional irrigation coverage); economic, agricultural, social, and financial analysis; and a series of corollary studies that dealt with, for example, fisheries and wildlife concerns. Throughout the different phases of the investigation, the map (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0306312712445835">Figure 1</xref>) of the dammed Mekong basin highlighting the most critical projects was reproduced hundreds of times in a multitude of reports (and became <italic>the</italic> basic representation of the ‘developed’ Mekong well into the 1990s). One of the most significant aspects of inscriptions is the ‘unique advantage they give in the rhetorical or polemical situation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312712445835">Latour, 1990</xref>: 67), and these became crucial tools for demonstrating the Bureau’s technical convictions regarding the feasibility and developmental benefits of the proposed projects. In addition, as the multitude of graphs, detailed illustrations of the dam and dam site, tables, and other technical representation accumulated, resistance to the construction of Pa Mong on technical grounds became less salient.</p>
<p>However, as US officials began to comprehend the full costs of Pa Mong development, the project and the technopolitical network that supported it – that once appeared inevitable in the minds of nearly all the geopolitical and technical agents involved in its development – began to unravel. In 1968, project experts put the tab for the dam itself at US$600 million, although that figure did not include projected costs for irrigation infrastructure (potentially another $1 billion) and indirect costs associated with training, maintenance, administration, education, and the like. Later estimates of full expenses, including transmission lines for delivering the dam’s electricity and an array of irrigation projects, had the project costs at $1.2 billion. While construction of the main dam and power plants was optimistically estimated to be completed in 5 to 10 years, building the irrigation component was predicted to take 25 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306312712445835">Hanna, 1968</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0306312712445835">25</xref></sup> In addition to growing concerns about the dam’s economic viability and its geopolitical utility (see below), by late 1967 Bureau staff members were expressing apprehension over whether geological conditions in the Pa Mong region were conducive to project goals for irrigation development, echoing earlier reconnaissance studies that identified problems with soils and land classification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0306312712445835">26</xref></sup> These and other issues led the Bureau, with the encouragement of State Department officials, to send senior staff to the Mekong region for ‘top-level guidance and direction [of] Pa Mong investigations’ in an effort to see if such reservations could be addressed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0306312712445835">27</xref></sup> It was becoming clearer by the late 1960s – while the Bureau’s Phase Two operations continued to churn out biophysical and socioeconomic data on the project’s location – that the relationship among Mekong development, the feasibility of the Pa Mong dam, political dynamics within the region, and the geopolitical objectives of the US government had significantly changed. Rutherford Poats, a Far East specialist within the US Agency for International Development (AID), observed that although the US had ‘stimulated the start of planning [in 1956] for a Mekong Development as a symbol and focal point for regional cooperation’, the construction of Pa Mong and similar projects ‘would not be economically justified during the next decade.’ Moreover, the political dynamics within the region were changing in a way that was not conducive to the grand visions of large-scale development promised within Pa Mong planning documents. Political conditions and armed conflicts within Laos ‘made all project proposals in that country appear infeasible at present.’ Elsewhere, the ‘Cambodian government’s expulsion of US aid missions’ made water resource development progress unmanageable, and the Vietnam delta was ‘a war zone’, making water development projects there extremely unlikely. Given these conditions, the AID synopsis argued that large-scale basin development over the next decade would be ‘likely to be less significant to the economic progress of Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia than many other immediately promising investments in their human, agricultural and industrial resource.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0306312712445835">28</xref></sup> By the early 1970s, a host of officials in the US government – including President Nixon – re-focused foreign policy in Southeast Asia on how to effectively withdraw from engagement in Vietnam. In general, the Nixon administration placed far less priority on the use of economic and technical assistance to hinder Communist influence in the third world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306312712445835">Gaddis, 2005</xref>: 272–306). State Department and AID communications instead talked about how Mekong development, including Pa Mong, might provide the impetus for ‘peacetime reconstruction and development of the Indo-China countries’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0306312712445835">29</xref></sup> This also implied limiting the direct role of US agencies, prominently the Bureau of Reclamation, and increasing the influence of multilateral entities such as the World Bank, the newly created Asian Development Bank, and the various United Nations agencies that had historically been engaged in Mekong activities (e.g. UN Development Programme).</p>
<p>By this time, the technopolitical network constructed so carefully through the Bureau’s water expertise and the State Department’s geopolitical and developmental discourses was clearly coming apart. Space prevents a detailed accounting of the roles that the Mekong River and basin played in the construction and maintenance of these technopolitical relations (not least as exhibited through the insubordination of biophysical characteristics such as unsuitable soils), but I can briefly mention the growing awareness of the significant socio-ecological impacts of Pa Mong and other water projects. By the late 1960s, a small but growing number of ecologists, anthropologists and other researchers generated critical analyses of the consequences of large dams and other ‘careless’ technologies, particularly their effects on ecosystems and resource-dependent livelihood patterns (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306312712445835">Farvar and Milton, 1972</xref>). Representations of dams as a destructive technology, which previously had been rare, increasingly emerged as part of popular discourse. Claire Sterling, writing in the <italic>New York Times</italic> regarding Pa Mong and similar projects, captures some of this awareness:
<disp-quote>
<p>When the bureau began its feasibility study [1962], billion dollar dams like Pa Mong were a straightforward proposition: if the dam could stand up, store water, and produce plenty of cheap power, why not? [And] those were the days when there were no ecologists underfoot and almost everybody thought big dams meant instant progress. Times have certainly changed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0306312712445835">Sterling 1971a</xref>: A18)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sterling identifies several of the costs of the $1.1 billion Pa Mong project that had received little attention. The drowning out of 948,000 acres of productive farmland worth somewhere between $57 and $110 million in lost revenue would be one of the more substantial costs associated with Pa Mong. Ensuring that the number of people displaced by the dam – estimated at somewhere between 312,000 and 500,000 depending on completion of the project – could move to equally productive lands would involve prohibitive costs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0306312712445835">30</xref></sup> These and other factors lessened its viability. By 1973, despite the hundreds of studies, vast expenditures of monetary resources, years of investigations, and the collective expertise of Bureau staff, the plans for the Pa Mong dam were effectively shelved.</p>

<title>Conclusion: Technopolitics and large dams</title>
<p>I have traced the integration of geopolitical and technical expertise and actions that coalesced around a particular project designed to catalyze large-scale development of water resources in the Mekong River basin. Although the technological object that comprised the focus of these efforts (the dam itself) never materialized, it still managed to shape and alter the network of discourses, decisions and technical practices that characterized the geopolitics of development in the Mekong basin and Southeast Asia. I conclude by considering, first, how the Bureau’s technopolitical engagement with Pa Mong established the groundwork for perceptions of the Mekong basin – views held by nearly all parties concerned with its development then and now – as a simplified ‘resource’ amenable to manipulation through water resource development. I then reflect on the changing geopolitical assumptions and decisions regarding technical assistance in Southeast Asia and how these became integrated with and ultimately defined the Bureau’s technical expertise surrounding water and development. Both themes prompt a critical re-examination of present-day efforts to transform the Mekong through massive hydroelectric schemes in ways that fully recognize the inseparability of geopolitics, technologies, and expertise in the arena of economic development.</p>
<p>Discussions surrounding Mekong development during the 1960s were predicated on the understanding that Pa Mong, under the guidance of the world’s most knowledgeable and effective water resource development agency, would usher in an era of basin-wide development and hence economic modernization. In tandem with other large mainstream schemes, the project, established and enhanced an imaginative geography of the Mekong basin as a completely regulated river system. This project virtually ignored the complex biophysical dynamics (including such matters as upstream–downstream relationships, annual flooding cycles, tremendous fisheries productivity) and the livelihoods of basin residents who depended on these dynamics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0306312712445835">Sneddon and Fox, 2006</xref>). The Bureau’s Pa Mong investigations – backed by its global reputation as the world’s premier dam-building organization – generated enormous quantities of data and multiple inscriptions, nearly all designed to facilitate and represent the transformation of the Mekong into a ‘working’ river by means of human manipulation of flowing water. Pa Mong was thus decisive for constructing an image of the Mekong as a river basin, as <italic>water</italic>, ripe for development and improvement if only the appropriate technologies and knowledge could be applied – an imagined geography that, while sustained by different actors, has persisted until more recent times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306312712445835">Bakker, 1999</xref>) and certainly drives current development initiatives (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306312712445835">Middleton et al., 2009</xref>). While extensive water resource development of Mekong tributaries – especially in northeast Thailand and to some extent in the highlands of Laos and Vietnam – proceeded throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the Bureau’s expert advice regarding Pa Mong and its prodigious hydroelectric capacity finds its current legacy in revived plans to build a series of large schemes on the river’s main channel. Most recently, controversy has erupted over the plans of the Lao government – which represents itself as the future ‘battery of Southeast Asia’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306312712445835">Ferrie, 2010</xref>) – to construct the massive Xayaburi Dam on a stretch of the Mekong falling within its borders. While the project’s feasibility from an engineering point of view is unquestioned, critics assert the dam – slated to produce nearly 1300 MW of electricity, nearly all to be sold directly to Thai utilities – and the planned construction of 11 additional mainstream projects will almost certainly impair the basin’s fisheries and the millions of rural livelihoods that depend partly or wholly on those fisheries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306312712445835">Grumbine and Xu, 2011</xref>). The Xayaburi project and other planned hydroelectric schemes on the mainstream rely on the same vision of the Mekong basin that Pa Mong helped produce – a developmental vision of water control that has proved remarkably resilient in the face of complex geopolitical change in the Mekong region.</p>
<p>The history of the Pa Mong dam also serves as an exemplar of the critical amalgamation of technical expertise and (geo)political practices that animate so many large-scale water development projects. These geopolitical practices, in the first instance, allowed for the diffusion and application of technical knowledge and, in the second, actively shaped the intensity and duration of knowledge production. In terms of geopolitics, the <italic>idea</italic> of Pa Mong became more important, and eventually more powerful, than the millions of dollars expended on the studies and the Bureau expertise required to produce them. The architects of US foreign policy had, from the late 1950s onwards, encouraged the rapid implementation of the Pa Mong project and development of the Mekong basin for geopolitical ends: a more stable Southeast Asia that looked to the US rather than the Soviets as a model of political and economic modernization. The Bureau’s ability to serve as a wellspring of technological know-how, and in Floyd Dominy’s words to present a ‘show’ of technical expertise, was absolutely critical for this geopolitical agenda. The Bureau’s presence helped ensure political support among the Mekong basin’s riparian states in support of US interventions. Yet, it was the relatively rapid shift in geopolitical conditions, highlighted by increasing American distaste for continued strategic engagement in the Mekong region, that ultimately overruled technical assessments of the dam’s feasibility and effectively shelved the project. Water expertise and (geo)political practices do not operate, and should not be considered, in terms of dialectical relations; rather, they are co-produced within complex, hybrid networks such as the one that formed around Pa Mong and development of the Mekong basin.</p>
<p>Finally, paying attention to the technopolitical networks first constructed in the late 1950s and 1960s directs attention to contemporary development discourses and practices in the Mekong context (and indeed in any context of massive water alteration), which also are deeply infiltrated by geopolitics and technical expertise. The novel Mekong geography envisioned and represented by Bureau experts working on Pa Mong and Mekong development planning has been partially fulfilled through the construction of numerous tributary projects within the national territories of the basin’s riparian states over the past three decades. As mentioned above, the cascade of mainstream dams currently being contemplated in the lower Basin along with the Chinese government’s decision to build a series of massive hydroelectric dams on the upper Mekong’s main channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306312712445835">Hirsch, 2011</xref>) promises to transform the Mekong’s biophysical relations in ways that will result in an irrevocably altered basin geography. Moreover, much has been made of recent Chinese efforts to use economic and technical assistance in the Mekong region as means of garnering geopolitical influence<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0306312712445835">31</xref></sup> – which should sound familiar given this paper’s topic. Concerns over China’s growing influence in the region have, according to some observers, prompted Lower Basin governments to re-engage with the US State Department as a possible counterweight to Chinese power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0306312712445835">Roughneen, 2010</xref>). Despite the power of geopolitics for determining past and present efforts to transform the Mekong into a tightly controlled and managed basin, these efforts all rest on a technical knowledge base first mobilized under the auspices of the Bureau of Reclamation and its colleagues during the late 1950s and 1960s. Unearthing the manner in which geopolitical dynamics intersect with, transform, and on occasion are transformed by, technical expertise remains a crucial task for scholars of STS, critical geopolitics, and other fields interested in the co-production of water, politics and technical knowledge. Similarly, efforts to shape the forces that constitute the Mekong basin and similar water-related networks – whether grounded in calls for ecological and livelihood sustainability, or justice for the human and nonhuman entities facing violent disruption under currently proposed development programs – would benefit from thinking historically about the specific technical expertise and geopolitical practices directing water governance.</p>

<p>Fields such as geography have also witnessed a vibrant set of recent debates on how to think about nature, technology, and society, not as a relatively bounded set of separate spheres of research and action, but as a highly entangled, hybrid set of concepts and practices. An important part of the creation of these constructions – what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306312712445835">Bakker and Bridge (2006)</xref> term ‘socionatural networks’ and what others refer to as ‘technonatures’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0306312712445835">White and Wilbert, 2006</xref>) – concerns the influence of scientific and technological knowledge production in particular places and times and linked to certain scalar narratives ranging from ‘local’ to ‘global’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306312712445835">Furlong, 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>The decision of the US government to have the Bureau lend its expertise to other nations came soon after President Truman’s now famous ‘Point Four’ speech at his inauguration in January 1949. Truman called for expanded US economic assistance overseas, not only to help reconstruct Europe through the Marshall Plan, but to aid ‘underdeveloped regions’ in overcoming poverty. The Bureau’s earlier efforts at providing technical assistance internationally and the challenges of creating the institutional mechanisms within the US government to allow for an expanded program deserve fuller explication, and are included as part of an ongoing research project investigating the Bureau’s international activities in the 20th century.</p>

<p>Additional aspects of the Bureau’s overseas activities are important to consider here. First, a significant number of the Bureau’s international activities involved ‘the gratifying task of training foreign nationals in our facilities at home’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0306312712445835">Stamm, 1969</xref>: 1). Indeed, as of the early 1970s, well over 5500 individuals (almost all male engineering students) had undertaken more or less intensive training programs at the Bureau’s offices in Denver and at field sites in the Western US. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0306312712445835">Wescoat et al. (1992)</xref> aggregate these visitors according to country of origin and note the clear correlation between sending countries and those regions of strong interest to the architects of US foreign policy during the Cold War. Second, a significant number of the Bureau’s trainees assumed very important positions within their own governments’ water bureaucracies, including high-level positions in the Philippines, Thailand, Turkey, India and Sri Lanka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0306312712445835">Palmer, 1963</xref>). This aspect of the Bureau’s international activities was a critical vehicle for the dissemination of the ideologies and technological knowledge associated with river basin development.</p>

In elucidating the manner in which the Bureau advanced ideas of modernization in the region, however, he pays less attention to the roles of technology and technological expertise, and their entanglements in America’s geopolitical vision, in the efforts to transform water management in the Mekong.</p>

Another Bureau expert noted that the project area’s soils are ‘beset with serious problems involving extremely low fertility and highly permeable top soil underlain by impermeable substrata’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0306312712445835">1962</xref>: Appendix B, p. 2).</p>

<p>In an earlier and remarkably prescient article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0306312712445835">Sterling (1971b)</xref> detailed the potential ecological impacts of Mekong basin development schemes: the loss of silt in the delta region, due to upstream dams, and the resultant effects on soil fertility in this critical rice-growing area; the blockage of nutrients and resultant impacts on economically important fish populations and other aquatic organisms; the extinction of riverine organisms, including the Mekong giant catfish; damage to the Tonle Sap fisheries, on which millions of people depend for food and income; the efflorescence of invasive weeds in newly created reservoirs; salinization in those areas of northeast Thailand (an area that is underlain by an enormous salt formation, subject to irrigation from Mekong waters); the inundation of good quality agricultural lands, resettlement of millions of inhabitants and increases in water-borne diseases due to reservoir creation.</p>
