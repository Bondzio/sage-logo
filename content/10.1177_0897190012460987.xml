<p>Drug shortages are at an all time high, exceeding more than 200 shortages as of mid-September 2011 compared to the 50 to 60 per year average of 2003 to 2006.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460987">1</xref></sup> These shortages are putting the public in danger of not receiving lifesaving medications. Most of the shortages are occurring within hospitals as generic injectables seem to be predominately effected. This issue has finally caught the attention of the government and now President Obama has issued an executive order directing the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to “speed reviews for companies wanting to make a drug in short supply and to alert the Justice Department when the agency sees signs of drug sellers charging exorbitant prices for scarce medicines.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012460987">2</xref></sup> Now that action has been taken by the government, is there anything the manufacturers can do to help alleviate the drug shortage situation as well?</p>
<p>First, let us take a look at factors that can affect the production of a medication and result in a true drug shortage. Some factors include regulatory affair issues, such as noncompliance with good manufacturing practices (GMP), which can lead to a temporary suspension in production. Mergers between manufacturing companies can result in a shortage if the 2 companies were producing a similar product and then decide to consolidate those products. Shortages can also be the result of a business decision influenced by the cost-effectiveness of producing a brand name drug versus a generic. Over 80% of all shortages are for generic injectables.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012460987">3</xref></sup> “Only a half-dozen companies make the vast majority of injected generics. Even if other companies wanted to begin making a drug in short supply, they're discouraged by the lengthy, expensive process of setting up new manufacturing lines and getting FDA approval”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012460987">4</xref></sup> Other factors include problems with obtaining product ingredients, a change in production output or capacity, an increase in demand, or changing of manufacturing facilities.</p>
<p>How can manufacturers help alleviate the drug shortage situation? The only area where I see manufacturers may be able to make a difference is by helping to alleviate the artificial part of the drug shortage. Secondary distributors, referred to as the “gray” or “black marketers,” are wholesalers who speculate on drugs in limited supply and then purchase a large quantity, resulting in, what seems to be, a true drug shortage, when in fact it is an artificial drug shortage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012460987">5</xref></sup> By hoarding these drugs, they are keeping them away from patients who may be in desperate need of them; that is, of course, unless the patient or facility can pay the new and inflated price. Manufacturers can prevent sales to these types of wholesalers by looking into their product sales price versus the wholesalers purchase price from the manufacturer. If the manufacturer sees that the wholesaler has been charging an “above normal” markup from their purchase price, they should reconsider selling the product to that wholesaler.</p>
<p>One of the main factors resulting in true drug shortages is the cost-effectiveness of production and is not entirely in the manufacturer’s control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012460987">6</xref></sup> There are two parts to cost-effectiveness; the cost of running the facility, which the manufacturer can control to an extent, and the reimbursement rate they get paid for their product, which the manufacturer gets pushed into extremely low rates. When a brand name drug loses its patent, the production of its generic begins and “its price can drop as much as 90 percent as manufacturers compete for the market share.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012460987">7</xref></sup> This becomes a problem once a shortage arises, because according to the economic principle of “supply and demand,” as the supply decreases, the price should increase, which would then attract more manufacturers to produce the drug. However, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 has put a 6% price increase cap per 6 months on their reimbursement rates, stunting the price growth of the product. The pharmaceutical industry is first and foremost a business with its primary goal being to maximize profits, so by putting a cap on reimbursement rates, the manufacturers start to lose interest in producing that product and move onto producing a more profitable product. Now the question is, “How do we motivate manufacturers to produce the low-cost generics?” I would suggest some type of financial incentive from Medicare that would allow for an increased reimbursement rate in the event of a truly persistent drug shortage. These special cases would also require new job positions on Medicare’s end such as analysts and inspectors to negotiate a fair reimbursement rate to the manufacturer. Some people may suggest cutting the government entirely out of drug pricing, but as a future health care provider, I believe it is important to keep the government involved to ensure reasonable prices are being offered to patients. Without this control, manufacturers could increase the cost of a drug in short supply to an extent that would leave no patient the ability to afford the product. The only balance I can find between government involvement in drug pricing control and business concerns in maintaining a profit is to have some flexibility in reimbursement rates on the government’s end. A flat rate cannot apply to all situations, and when it comes to drug shortages, the rate should most certainly be adjusted.</p>
<p>There are true drug shortages and there are artificial drug shortages. Manufacturers can help alleviate the artificial drug shortage by avoiding sales to the “gray market,” a process that may cost a little more time, but will help prevent hoarding by these wholesalers. However, our current drug shortage is mostly due to business decisions regarding the cost-effectiveness of production, something that manufacturers have little control over. Medicare plays a large role in controlling the price of drugs, ultimately causing manufacturers to back out from producing low-profit drugs, which happen to be the ones that are in persistent shortage. I believe this can be best alleviated by creating reimbursement rates that are adjustable according to the demand for the product. No matter how it is done, a solution needs to be found soon so patients can stop suffering the consequences.</p>
