<p>As a student I was drawn to different ethnographic approaches and the study of ordinary people’s everyday lives. Indeed I am still fascinated even today by sociology’s potential to provide counter-intuitive insights into everyday issues using various qualitative approaches. To me, ethnomethodology always felt like the right way to move forward. Having explored other methodological paths since then, I am glad this book was offered to me for review, as it has served to reawaken my interest in ethnomethodology.</p>
<p>The editors of <italic>Ethnomethodology at Work</italic> claim at the outset that their book is special because each essay (there are 20 in all) was written with the intention of imagining ‘a student coming to the study of work in organizations for the first time and [writing] something for them, something that would provide an outline, some data and examples of an ethnomethodological approach to a number of commonplace organizational topics and issues’ (pp. xvii–xviii). However, the book can also serve as a review of extant ethnomethodological research on work and the organization of workplaces in particular. Its diverse contents range from extracts from empirical research through to comparisons between the sociology of work, science and technology studies (STS), and related fields in order to highlight what ethnomethodology has to offer that differs from traditional sociological constructivism. In this regard, we encounter a host of theoretical musings on how ethnomethodology is different. What we get empirically are some insightful analyses of, for example, how knowledge and experience are articulated in practice in a chapter on ‘organizational acumen’ and the reality of paper in an allegedly paperless office, including the ‘placial affordances’ (p. 170) of paper documents (my favourite chapter).</p>
<p>At certain points, however, the empirical material appears under-interpreted. In the chapter entitled ‘Talk: Talking the organization into being’, for instance, we are presented with extracts from the transcripts of telephone conversations that are said to show ‘how a number of organizational policies and features are enacted within organization–customer interaction by call operators in conjunction with technology’ (p. 113). One of the results presented in this chapter is that a small change in the opening sequence of the call has produced important efficiency savings. The ‘analysis’ that follows simply states what the managers of the company in question themselves intended in the first place, namely that the changed procedure saves time and thus money. That is, they instructed their phone operators to skip the standard opening cordialities and start more directly with the crux of the phone call. Although most of the analysis is taken up with simply repeating the obvious, it also mentions that there are complications, such as customers’ resistance to choosing new security codes over the phone. The authors then claim that it is these reactions in non-standard situations that cause the organization, as Martin and O’Neill put it, to ‘come alive’ and to become ‘instantiated and elaborated in practice’ (p. 128). However, this coming alive is then supported merely by statements such as that ethnomethodological research can ‘reveal a lot about organizational structures’. Exactly what this might be never actually became clear to me. What the book does reveal is that everything can be re-examined through the lens of ethnomethodology, even if in some cases it remains nebulous what the actual pay-off, or gain in knowledge, might be as a result of ethnomethodological analysis. In this respect, the book invites the long-familiar criticism that some strands of sociology merely tell us what we already know. Since I was hoping for fresh new insights into the field, the book left me feeling slightly disappointed.</p>
<p>However, it should be mentioned that many of the authors in this book are very good at showing what ethnomethodology is not and what it seeks to counter. The arch-enemies of ethnomethodology are still ‘standard sociological positions’ and ‘standard social categories’. But despite showing what ethnomethodology is not, a significant swathe of current sociological work is ignored that appears to be doing what some of the authors of <italic>Ethnomethodology at Work</italic> themselves claim to be doing. This includes, for instance, research on time and space, network analysis, nature and technology in everyday practices (that is, theory of practice taken well beyond Bourdieu, whom many of the authors in this book use as a straw man), the strategic use of ignorance, recent research on tacit knowing and related fields. Of course, ethnomethodologists would probably retort that these strands of research enact a rather shallow approach whereas ethnomethodology probes more deeply and gets to the crux of the matter. Judging from this book, however, this crux appears to be quite esoteric and does not reveal itself to the sympathetic reader. Put in positive terms, perhaps ethnomethodological approaches and insights have become part of a standard approach in many social sciences, only without ethnomethodology being given explicit credit. However, my impression is that the authors of this volume have constructed quite a few straw men to represent ‘standard sociological positions’ in order merely to highlight their own ethnomethodological approaches.</p>
<p>Consequently, the self-proclaimed renegade status of some of the proponents of ethnomethodology quickly wears thin. Worse, the preacherly tone adopted in many of the chapters in this book goes way beyond pointing to the merits of one’s own approach and sometimes appears to be quite counterproductive. Reading through the chapters, one gets the impression that ethnomethodology is seen as the one approach that might just save twenty-first-century qualitative methods. The book would have been much stronger if the authors and editors had been more modest and had illustrated clearly what exactly makes their approach superior compared to other methodologies, rather than repeating time and again that ethnomethodology is somehow better equipped to analyse the everyday world of work.</p>
