<abstract>
<p>Empirical studies of the relationship between acquisition experience and acquisition performance have had mixed results. Interestingly, these studies have found that acquisition experience does not necessarily increase acquisition performance. In particular, the extent to which the recency of the acquisition experience affects the performance of the focal acquisition remains equivocal. To investigate this issue, the authors adopt a perspective based on the concept of organizational forgetting. In the context of operations management, organizational forgetting explains the decrease in productivity that firms experience as a result of knowledge depreciation over time and interruptions to production. Cognitive psychology scholars find that the forgetting process follows specific laws. On the organizational level, these laws indicate that the organizational memory may deteriorate over time for three reasons: inefficient encoding, decay, and disuse. In the context of acquisitions, the authors examine how forgetting depreciates acquisition experience and, therefore, increases the likelihood of failure in subsequent acquisitions. They carry out a survival analysis on a population of 731 U.S. firms acquired by French firms between 1988 and 2006. The research shows that acquisition experience that is old or recent has no significant impact on acquisition performance. However, medium-term acquisition experience reduces the likelihood that the focal acquisition will fail. These findings are consistent with the laws on forgetting. This research also provides evidence of the existence of reinforcement mechanisms as well as a paradoxical influence of past alliances with the target.</p>

<p>To better understand the determinants of acquisition performance, scholars focusing on the relationship between acquisition experience and acquisition performance generally address two key issues. The first is whether prior acquisition experience determines the likelihood of a future acquisition and the second is whether prior acquisition experience determines the success of a future acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206310392574">Finkelstein &amp; Haleblian, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206310392574">Haleblian &amp; Finkelstein, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206310392574">Haleblian, Kim, &amp; Rajagopalan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206310392574">Hayward, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206310392574">Meschi &amp; Métais, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206310392574">Shaver, Mitchell, &amp; Yeung, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0149206310392574">Vermeulen &amp; Barkema, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0149206310392574">Zollo &amp; Singh, 2004</xref>). On the basis of organizational learning theory and learning curve theory, scholars have assumed that firms with extensive prior acquisition experience are better prepared to select the right target and manage the postacquisition integration than those with little or no experience. According to these scholars, as firms accumulate acquisition experience, they develop their acquisition management expertise and are, therefore, more likely to undertake successful acquisitions.</p>
<p>However, the empirical findings show that the relationship between acquisition experience and acquisition performance is far from automatic, positive, or monotonic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206310392574">Barkema &amp; Schijven, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206310392574">Finkelstein &amp; Haleblian, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206310392574">Haleblian &amp; Finkelstein, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206310392574">Meschi &amp; Métais, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0149206310392574">Zollo &amp; Singh, 2004</xref>). In fact, the findings presented in existing literature are inconclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206310392574">Barkema &amp; Schijven, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0149206310392574">Zollo &amp; Meier, 2008</xref>). In particular, the extent to which the recency of the acquisition experience affects the performance of the focal acquisition remains equivocal. One view, derived from learning curve theory, is that acquisition performance is predominantly affected by the most recent experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206310392574">Ingram &amp; Baum, 1997</xref>). In contrast, a knowledge-based view of acquisitions suggests that time is needed to consolidate recent acquisition experience before it can be transformed into competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206310392574">Huan &amp; Ghauri, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0149206310392574">Zollo &amp; Singh, 2004</xref>). These contradicting views reflect the fact that the passage of time has received little attention in prior research on the relationship between acquisition experience and acquisition performance. From an organizational learning perspective, an acquisition that took place 20 years ago is often considered to be as significant as a very recent acquisition. In other words, the impact of acquisition experience recency on a subsequent acquisition performance remains unexplored in the literature.</p>
<p>In an attempt to address this gap, we introduce the concept of <italic>forgetting</italic> in this article. This concept helps to improve our understanding of the performance of acquisitions on both the theoretical and practical levels. Organizational learning theory indicates that forgetting can improve learning in an organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206310392574">Bettis &amp; Prahalad, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0149206310392574">Hedberg, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206310392574">Martin de Holan &amp; Phillips, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206310392574">Thompson, 2007</xref>) because it creates room for new knowledge to be accumulated. Despite this theoretical interest, the concept of organizational forgetting has, surprisingly, not been applied to the context of acquisitions. Organizational forgetting is well documented in the context of operations management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206310392574">Argote, Beckman, &amp; Epple, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206310392574">Benkard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206310392574">Darr &amp; Argote, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206310392574">Epple, Argote, &amp; Rao, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206310392574">Thompson, 2007</xref>), where it explains why firms can experience a decrease in productivity as a result of knowledge depreciation over time.</p>
<p>Forgetting occurs because organizational memory—the set of information that a firm acquires, stores in repositories, and retrieves for future use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206310392574">Walsh &amp; Ungson, 1991</xref>)—is an imperfect information processing system: Not all information is encoded or stored, some information is lost and the locations of stored information are forgotten. Over time, this leads to memory decay in organizations. We investigate this decay process as it relates to acquisition experience in order to assess its impact on future acquisition performance.</p>
<p>More specifically, this article attempts to answer the following research question: <italic>To what extent does organizational forgetting depreciate acquisition experience, and how might this affect the likelihood that subsequent acquisitions will fail?</italic> Our aim is to show that the impact of prior acquisition experience on acquisition performance may be linked to the depreciation of the acquiring firm’s acquisition experience stock over time—otherwise defined as organizational forgetting.</p>
<p>The first section of this article studies the relationship between acquisition experience and acquisition performance. We then introduce the concepts of forgetting and organizational memory, examine how they affect this relationship, and formulate two research hypotheses. The second section provides an introduction to the research population, the data collection, the variables, and the survival analysis. The third section presents the test of the hypotheses and the statistical results. Supplementary analyses are included in the fourth section, and the contributions and limitations of this research are discussed in the last section.</p>

<title>Learning, Forgetting, and Acquisition Performance</title>
<p>According to organizational learning theory, prior acquisition experience provides acquiring firms with feedback about effective and ineffective patterns of managing acquisitions, which should allow them to enhance their performance in managing acquisitions over time. However, empirical studies do not confirm that this assumed relationship between acquisition experience and acquisition performance exists in all cases. In fact, the relationship between acquisition experience and acquisition performance has been shown to be U shaped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206310392574">Barkema &amp; Schijven, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206310392574">Haleblian &amp; Finkelstein, 1999</xref>). In addition, the number of prior acquisitions in itself cannot fully explain variations in acquisition performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0149206310392574">Zollo &amp; Singh, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, other variables pertaining to the nature of the acquiring firm’s experience have an impact on future acquisition performance: the international dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206310392574">Li, 1995</xref>), the degree of relatedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206310392574">Baum, Li, &amp; Usher, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206310392574">Hayward, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206310392574">Kim &amp; Finkelstein, 2009</xref>), the geographical proximity of the acquiring firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206310392574">Baum et al., 2000</xref>), country experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0149206310392574">Véry &amp; Schweiger, 2001</xref>), and similarity to past acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206310392574">Hayward, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Although knowledge of the stock of acquisition experience is necessary for those wishing to estimate future acquisition performance, it is not sufficient on its own to allow for such estimations. Various organizational mechanisms determine the effectiveness of a firm’s learning process. In other words, two acquiring firms with similar acquisition experience could develop different abilities for managing acquisitions, which would give rise to different acquisition outcomes. In this respect, the literature on acquisition performance has examined the influence of several variables on postacquisition organizational learning, such as feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206310392574">Haleblian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206310392574">Hayward, 2002</xref>), knowledge codification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0149206310392574">Zollo &amp; Singh, 2004</xref>), and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206310392574">Brown &amp; Eisenhardt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206310392574">Hayward, 2002</xref>). The question of time is fundamental to both organizational learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206310392574">Miner &amp; Mezias, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206310392574">Piao, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206310392574">Simon, 1966</xref>) and learning curve theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310392574">Sampson, 2005</xref>) for two reasons. First, the quality of the stock of experience depends on the temporal distance from that experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206310392574">Benkard, 2000</xref>). Second, experience must be integrated and codified before it becomes knowledge, which requires time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206310392574">Huan &amp; Ghauri, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0149206310392574">Zollo &amp; Singh, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the apparent importance of time with regard to acquisition experience, the time factor has generally been neglected in prior research. Only the temporal distance between the focal acquisition and a prior acquisition has been taken into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206310392574">Haleblian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206310392574">Haleblian &amp; Finkelstein, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206310392574">Hayward, 2002</xref>). In other words, the time needed to ensure experience assimilation has never been considered.</p>

<title>The Impact of Forgetting on Organizational Learning</title>
<p>The impact of the passage of time has been included in literature on the concept of forgetting. Organizational forgetting is a crucial factor to consider in the analysis and assessment of a firm’s stock of experience and, more generally, of organizational learning.</p>
<p>Organizational learning theory views forgetting as a major driver of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0149206310392574">Hedberg, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206310392574">Martin de Holan &amp; Phillips, 2004</xref>). On one hand, forgetting creates room for the assimilation of new knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206310392574">Bettis &amp; Prahalad, 1995</xref>). On the other hand, if it is poorly managed, forgetting may affect recently acquired knowledge and, consequently, hamper the accumulation of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206310392574">Day, 1994</xref>). In general, this field of research views organizational forgetting as complementary to organizational learning.</p>
<p>Learning curve theory states that a firm’s productivity can decrease over time as a result of organizational forgetting. Such forgetting can occur in two ways. First, an interruption to production will harm the knowledge accumulation process and lead to people forgetting about a specific competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206310392574">Hirsch, 1952</xref>). In other words, learning curve theory indicates that changes in experience, as well as spillovers of that experience, lead to a decrease in productivity and, therefore, a loss of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206310392574">Benkard, 2000</xref>). Second, Benkard proposes that “a firm’s stock of production experience depreciates over time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206310392574">2000</xref>: 1034). Even when production is continuous, cumulative production must take the date of production into account and needs to be counterbalanced by the passage of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206310392574">Argote et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206310392574">Benkard, 2000</xref>). This is the result of several factors: technological change, inefficient organizational memory systems, workers upgrading, staff turnover, and layoffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206310392574">Thompson, 2007</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206310392574">Benkard (2000)</xref> has found that the rate of knowledge depreciation for an aircraft manufacturer can be as high as 40% per year.</p>
<p>In order to take the fact that experience depreciates as a result of forgetting into account, management scholars apply discount factors to production experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206310392574">Benkard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206310392574">Darr &amp; Argote, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206310392574">Thompson, 2007</xref>). These discount factors decrease the weight of an experience depending on its recency, that is, an older experience is expected to be less influential than a recent one. When measuring the experience level of a firm, therefore, scholars assume that an experience that occurred a long time ago does not have the same weight as an experience that occurred more recently. This provides a better explanation of variations in productivity over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206310392574">Thompson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The same rationale has been followed in the field of strategic management. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206310392574">Baum and Ingram (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206310392574">Ingram and Baum (1997)</xref> apply four discount factors to the operating experience of hotel chains in order to explain their survival rates. Using the methodology developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206310392574">Argote et al. (1990)</xref>, they depreciate experience as a function of firm age in order to take the potential depreciation of knowledge gained from past experiences into account. Discounted experience is shown to be a predictor of the hotel chains’ hazard rate, indicating that organizational forgetting affects experience and performance.</p>
<p>This rationale, which is derived from the experience curve literature, might also be useful for accounting for organizational forgetting as it relates to acquisition experience. Acquisitions, by definition, result in “interruptions to production.” Furthermore, acquisitions are hardly everyday events for firms. Therefore, the knowledge accumulation process might be harmed by the lack of exposure to similar experiences over a certain period. In addition, the acquisition knowledge can also depreciate for reasons similar to those put forward by experience curve scholars, including inefficient organizational memory systems, cross-functional mobility, workers upgrading, staff turnover, and layoffs. In particular, staff turnover can be a key source of decay of acquisition experience. Executives, managers, and employees who were involved in past acquisitions may leave the company, especially as acquisitions are often followed by organizational restructuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206310392574">Barkema &amp; Schijven, 2008b</xref>).</p>
<p>These factors indicate that organizational forgetting must be considered when assessing the impact of acquisition experience on acquisition performance. Specifically, drawing from previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206310392574">Argote et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206310392574">Benkard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206310392574">Ingram &amp; Baum, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206310392574">Thompson, 2007</xref>), we suggest that acquisition experience needs to be depreciated by discount factors that account for organizational forgetting. We therefore propose the following hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list1-0149206310392574" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Discounted acquisition experience will decrease the probability of failure of the focal acquisition.</p></list-item>

<title>The Psychological Laws of Forgetting</title>
<p>Cognitive and experimental psychology examine forgetting in order to understand and formalize the laws of forgetting on the individual level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206310392574">Hovland, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206310392574">Jost, 1897</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0149206310392574">Lansdale &amp; How, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0149206310392574">Ribot, 1881</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206310392574">Simon, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0149206310392574">Wixted, 2004</xref>). To our knowledge, psychological laws on forgetting have not been applied to strategic management issues, although they do provide insight into the process of memory decay over time. Cognitive psychology scholars have analyzed the relationship between the delay interval between memory stimuli and traces (known as reinforcement procedures), and the extent of human forgetting and retention. Their aim is to understand how forgetting occurs and the way it can contribute to, or hamper, learning. Researchers have observed that forgetting takes the form of a decay of memory traces with the passage of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206310392574">Bailey, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206310392574">Brainerd, Kingma, &amp; Howe, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206310392574">Schendel, Shields, &amp; Katz, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0149206310392574">Wixted, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>This memory decay process is governed by two fundamental laws. The first is called Ribot’s Law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0149206310392574">1881</xref>), which is “referred to as temporally retrograde amnesia” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0149206310392574">Wixted, 2004</xref>: 864). It stipulates that brain damage affects new or recent memory traces to a greater extent than older ones. The main interpretation of this law is that time is needed for memories to consolidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0149206310392574">Wixted, 2004</xref>). Hence, a person’s competence and performance cannot be determined by his or her most recent experiences, as time is required for those experiences to be consolidated and assimilated.</p>
<p>The second fundamental law is Jost’s Law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206310392574">1897</xref>), which stipulates that “given two associations [i.e., two memory traces] of equal strength, but of different ages, the older falls off less rapidly in a given length of time” (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206310392574">Hovland, 1951</xref>: 649). If older memory traces are more likely to be reinforced by additional learning stimuli than recent ones, it is because the decay of memory traces is accelerated at first and then slows over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0149206310392574">Wixted, 2004</xref>). This law explains a paradox: Despite the existence of an experience effect, forgetting follows an exponential function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206310392574">Anderson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206310392574">Simon, 1966</xref>). There are two significant interpretations. First, old experience has less of an impact on performance than recent experience as a result of the exponential decay of memory traces. Second, only new stimuli can slow this memory decay.</p>
<p>These two laws concern forgetting in individuals. To avoid any anthropomorphism, we need to discuss their potential applicability to the organizational level. Individual memory and organizational memory may be considered as two distinct concepts—an organization has its own memory, which is independent of the memories of the individuals that make up the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206310392574">Walsh, 1995</xref>). Although individual and organizational forgetting mechanisms are undoubtedly different, the forgetting process may result in similar outcomes. In order to understand how individual and organizational forgetting may be related, we must first discuss the general principles of memory structure and functions. We must also assess the extent to which different mechanisms can have similar impacts on forgetting on the individual and organizational levels.</p>

<title>Individual Forgetting and Organizational Memory: General Principles</title>
<p>Organizational memory is the body of information that a firm acquires, stores, and retrieves over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206310392574">Walsh &amp; Ungson, 1991</xref>). Organizations make decisions and implement them in response to stimuli. All of the contextual conditions (including the “why?”) in which answers have been provided, together with their outcomes, are stored in the organization’s memory and can be retrieved in response to other similar stimuli. The information is stored in repositories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206310392574">Argote, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206310392574">Day, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206310392574">Moorman &amp; Miner, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206310392574">Walsh and Ungson (1991)</xref> have identified these repositories as six “storage bins”: individuals, culture, transformations, structures, ecology, and external archives.</p>
<p>In their seminal article on organizational memory, Walsh and Ungson adopt a working assumption that although organizational memory and individual memory are different by nature, both share the same function in terms of information processing. From a strictly functional point of view, therefore, a law concerning information processing on the individual level may apply, in theory, on the organizational level.</p>
<p>Individuals are the first of the six organizational memory bins in which information is stored. Therefore, individuals are a key element in organizational memory. Organizational memory is characterized by three stages: information acquisition, retention, and retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206310392574">Hargadon &amp; Sutton, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206310392574">Walsh &amp; Ungson, 1991</xref>). Individuals are vital with regard to the selection of information, which is then stored in other bins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206310392574">Walsh &amp; Ungson, 1991</xref>). They are also important to information retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206310392574">V. Anand, Manz, &amp; Glick, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206310392574">Doyle Corner, Kinicki, &amp; Keats, 1994</xref>). Therefore, a law that affects individuals may indirectly affect the other bins.</p>
<p>According to Ribot’s Law, individuals may fail to store information if they have not seen it or have not had time to consolidate it. In an organizational context, this information will not be stored in the other bins. Jost’s Law, on the other hand, explains that an individual may, over time, forget not only information but also its meaning, as well as the place in which it is stored. Individual forgetting can, therefore, indirectly lead to organizational forgetting. The distributional structure of organizational memory may partially correct this problem, but the impact of individual forgetting on organizational memory cannot be assumed to be negligible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0149206310392574">
<title>The Mechanisms of Organizational Forgetting</title>
<p>In addition to these general principles, we need to analyze how organizational forgetting mechanisms are influenced by individual forgetting. Our aim is to assess the extent to which organizations may be affected by organizational forgetting laws that reflect Jost’s and Ribot’s Laws. Organizational forgetting is the process by which organizational memory deteriorates for three reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206310392574">Walsh, 1995</xref>): inefficient encoding, information decay, and disuse.</p>
<p>Effective encoding requires that individuals recognize information, acquire it, codify it, store it, and know where it is stored if they are to be able to retrieve it when needed. Information will be stored and possibly reused by an organization only if individuals share it, acknowledge that it has a common utility, and give it shared meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206310392574">V. Anand et al., 1998</xref>). This mechanism affects the way the bins are filled.</p>
<p>From an information processing perspective, inefficient encoding on the organizational level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206310392574">V. Anand et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206310392574">Walsh, 1995</xref>) is similar to the process described by Ribot’s Law on the individual level. Ribot’s Law suggests that an individual’s information memorization may be inhibited by insufficient assimilation of the knowledge in question. Similarly, an inefficient encoding mechanism would make the filling of bins on the organizational level imperfect. An organization needs knowledge codification, socialization, and transfer processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0149206310392574">Zollo &amp; Winter, 2002</xref>) before the knowledge can be exploited.</p>
<p>In the case of an acquisition, memorization of integration practices and their effectiveness constitutes a process that requires time and collective effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206310392574">Hébert, Véry, &amp; Beamish, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0149206310392574">Zollo &amp; Singh, 2004</xref>). Once analyzed and encoded, these practices will be stored in one or several bins. For instance, tolerance of a target’s culture will be stored in the “culture” bin, while consultants who have taken part in the integration process will retain the relevant integration information in the “external archives” bin and an integration team will store information in the “structures” bin. These processes require time and may be imperfect, which suggests that the most recent acquisition experience will not have the greatest impact on future acquisition performance.</p>
<p>Once information is stored in the bins, it is subject to depreciation, which itself is dependent on two key factors: decay and disuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206310392574">Walsh, 1995</xref>). These mechanisms can be thought of as a progressive emptying of the bins. Decay arises from the natural erosion of the stored information, regardless of the bin in which it has been stored. It can arise because files are lost, individuals leave the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206310392574">Argote &amp; Darr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206310392574">Shafer, Nembhard, &amp; Uzumeri, 2001</xref>), the structure of the firm evolves, the culture changes, new transformations appear, and external archives become scattered. The distributional nature of organizational memory may cause further decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206310392574">Olivera, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206310392574">Ren, Carley, &amp; Argote, 2006</xref>). This mechanism is made stronger by “retroactive interference” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206310392574">Walsh &amp; Ungson, 1991</xref>)—new stimuli continually affect organizations, leading to the storage of new information that, over time, replaces the information previously stored in the bins.</p>
<p>Disuse arises from the absence of information recall in the long term. All new problems that arise and require the retrieval of information contained in the organizational memory will reinforce that information and its continued place in the organizational memory. On the other hand, if the information is not used, it will disappear over time. Information disuse will therefore accelerate information decay. Although the decay process might be slowed by additional stimuli, it is considered unavoidable in the long run. For this reason, disuse is not taken into account in our hypotheses (although it is considered in the supplementary analyses section).</p>
<p>From an information processing point of view, information decay on the organizational level, as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206310392574">Walsh (1995)</xref>, is similar to the process described by Jost’s Law on the individual level. Jost’s Law argues that an individual forgets information over time and in accordance with an exponential law. Similarly, on the organizational level, the decay process favors the emptying and the renewal of bins over the long term. This suggests that old acquisition experience should have no impact on future acquisition performance.</p>
<p>This review gives rise to three conclusions. First, old experiences decay to the point that they are no longer stored in (or retrievable from) organizational memory. Second, recent experiences are not sufficiently consolidated in the organizational memory to be leveraged. Third, if old experience decays and if recent experience requires time to be assimilated, then medium-term experience may have the most significant impact on subsequent acquisition performance. Hence, our second hypothesis is as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-0149206310392574" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Medium-term acquisition experience will affect the probability that a focal acquisition will fail more negatively than both recent acquisition experience and old acquisition experience.</p></list-item>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section7-0149206310392574">
<title>Population and Data Collection</title>
<p>This article’s research population consists of all acquisitions undertaken by French firms in the United States between January 1988 and December 2006. By focusing on French acquisitions in the United States, we are able to control for a certain number of country variables, including the level of state corruption and political risk, which are often determinants for the survival and performance of international acquisitions in other geographical areas, particularly in emerging economies. In this regard, we are consistent with Hayward and Shimizu, who restrict their analysis to U.S. targets in order to “avoid potentially confounding factors such as country risks and different institutional arrangements (e.g., legal and regulatory issues related to M&amp;As)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206310392574">2006</xref>: 545).</p>
<p>The decision to focus on this specific research population was also motivated by the number of French acquisitions in the United States and the dynamics of this acquisition trend. In fact, the United States is the leading recipient of French direct investments abroad. This trend has accelerated since 2000 as a result of the strong, steady progression of parity between the euro and the U.S. dollar. In 2008, for example, not only was the United States the top recipient of French direct investment abroad, but France was also the fourth largest investor in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206310392574">Anderson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The data set of French acquisitions in the United States was drawn from data published by Edgar-SEC, Thomson One Banker, Who Owns Whom, Factiva, and Mergerstat, as well as from information from the Washington-based <italic>Poste d’Expansion Economique de l’Ambassade de France</italic>. A two-step selection procedure was used to identify and collect this data. First, all French acquisitions of U.S. targets in the given time frame—where <italic>acquisition</italic> was defined as a mode of external growth that leads to the taking over of more than 50% of the equity of an independent firm—were listed. Divisional acquisitions, partial acquisitions undertaken in cooperation with other firms, minority holdings, and mergers of French and U.S. firms were excluded. Divisional acquisitions, partial acquisitions with other firms, minority holdings, and mergers entail specific negotiation, control, and management processes, which distinguishes them from acquisitions of independent firms. Second, acquisitions undertaken by French banking and insurance firms were removed from the research population. Given the specific financial features of these firms, it is difficult to compare them to other French acquirers, particularly in terms of returns on assets and debt ratios. The final data set encompassed a total of 731 acquisitions of U.S. firms made by 129 French firms from 1988 to 2006, with an average of more than five acquisitions per French acquiring firm.</p>
<p>Left censoring (i.e., the omission of French acquisitions in the United States that were performed and divested prior to the 1988–2006 period) has little impact, as few French acquisitions took place between 1970 and 1980.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0149206310392574">
<title>Dependent Variable and Cox Proportional Hazards Model</title>
<p>The probability of acquisition failure is the dependent variable. This variable was identified using a three-stage selection process. In the first stage, each of the 731 acquisitions was followed using a longitudinal analysis over a period at risk ranging from the date of the focal acquisition until the cutoff date of January 2007. This period at risk could span just a few months for focal acquisitions undertaken in 2006 to a maximum of 18 years for those undertaken in 1988. Within this period at risk, we identified all focal acquisitions that were divested. In so doing, we were able to distinguish between (a) focal acquisitions that still belonged to the business portfolio of the acquiring firms at the end of the period at risk (<italic>surviving acquisitions</italic>) and (b) those that had been divested before the end of the period at risk (<italic>divested acquisitions</italic>). During this first stage, we included all divestments, regardless of the divestment motive. In addition, the divestment could be of either the acquired entity alone if it remained independent from the acquiring firm or of a complete business unit into which the acquired entity had been integrated. Only acquired firms that were entirely divested by the acquiring firm were categorized as divested.</p>
<p>Partial divestments were treated as censored cases (i.e., cases for which divestment resulting from an acquisition failure had not occurred by the cutoff date of the period at risk), as we considered such partial divestments to be postacquisition restructuring operations aimed at enhancing the performance of the acquired firms. In all, 33 acquired firms were partially divested (4.5% of the population). The average time between the acquisition announcement and the partial divestment was 1.5 years, which supports the notion that most partial divestments are restructuring operations carried out just after acquisition.</p>
<p>The aim of this first stage was to categorize the 731 acquisitions as <italic>surviving acquisitions</italic> or <italic>divested acquisitions</italic> and to estimate the longevity (measured in years) of each acquisition. We observed a total of 190 divestments before the end of the period at risk. This amounts to a divestment rate of 26%, which is nearly equivalent to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206310392574">Shaver et al.’s (1997)</xref> estimation that one quarter of foreign acquisitions and wholly owned subsidiaries in the United States are divested within the first 5 years. These 190 divestments include four acquired firms that went bankrupt. On average, these divestments occurred within 6 years of acquisition. This average falls between the 3.8 years observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206310392574">Hoskisson, Johnson, and Moesel (1994)</xref> and the 7 years recorded by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206310392574">Kaplan and Weisbach (1992)</xref>.</p>
<p>In the second stage, we sought to distinguish between (a) divestments resulting from acquisition failure (<italic>failure divestments</italic>) and (b) divestments undertaken for other reasons (<italic>other divestments</italic>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0149206310392574">Table 1</xref>). The first category includes divestments motivated by low returns, financial losses, and/or poor postacquisition synergies between the acquirer and the acquired firm. However, divestments that were made without regard for the focal acquisition’s <italic>intrinsic</italic> performance, such as divestments resulting from business refocusing, portfolio restructuring, and redeployment or debt-reduction decisions, were excluded from this category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206310392574">Brauer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206310392574">Hamilton &amp; Chow, 1993</xref>) and categorized as <italic>other divestments</italic>. In order to classify the divestments according to this categorization system, we analyzed the conditions of sale (especially the motive[s] for divestment) of the 190 divestments using the various sources of information at our disposal (see the note to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0149206310392574">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p><italic>Note</italic>: These divestments were classified using (and cross-checking) as follows: First, we compiled archives and secondary data from Edgar-SEC, Thomson One Banker, Who Owns Whom, Factiva, and Mergerstat. Second, we contacted each of the 129 French acquirers by e-mail (using their investor relations Internet links) or by phone (using the phone directories of alumni from French business schools). Third, we presented the outcomes of this classification process to three experts in the field of French acquisitions and transactions abroad. These experts represent two investment banks (Rabobank International and Société Générale) and one consulting firm (PricewaterhouseCoopers). They verified and validated the divestment classification.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0149206310392574">Table 1</xref> presents the most prevalent motives underlying the two categories of divestment (a comprehensive list of motives for divestment is available upon request). We coded divestments that involved both categories as failure divestments. Of the 190 divestments, 81 were classified as failure divestments, while 109 were found to be other divestments. In the subsequent analysis, we treated the 109 other divestments as censored cases, in the same way as surviving acquisitions and partial divestments. The ratio between failure divestments (42.6%) and other divestments (57.4%) in the divestment subset is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206310392574">Kaplan and Weisbach (1992)</xref>, who reported that 34% of divestments were the result of unsuccessful acquisitions, and with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206310392574">Montgomery and Thomas (1988)</xref>, who calculated a 66% rate of strategic divestments by combining tactical and strategic-related sell-offs.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the ex post validity of this divestment classification, we performed mean difference tests for several indicators pertaining to the divested acquisition. First, we compared the average time of occurrence for each of the two categories of divestments and found statistically significant differences (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) with an average of 5.1 years for failure divestments and an average of 6.6 years for other divestments. We then calculated the return on sales (the net profit to sales ratio) for the year prior to the divestment. The mean difference test was slightly significant for the two divestment categories (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .1). The average return on sales for failure divestments was −5.5% as opposed to +2.5% for other divestments. Therefore, the <italic>failure divestments</italic> category seems to be significantly distinct from the <italic>other divestments</italic> category. The distinct differences between the two categories support our idea that the failure divestments category reflects a specific decision to divest due to the failure of the acquisition.</p>
<p>In the third stage, the 731 acquisitions were dummy coded by distinguishing between (a) acquisitions that survived at the end of the period at risk in January 2007, and acquisitions that had been partially or entirely divested for reasons other than failure (coded 0), and (b) acquisitions that were divested as the result of an acquisition failure before the end of the period at risk (coded 1). We also computed the duration of each acquisition by comparing the date of acquisition to either the date of divestment for failure divestments or to the end of the period at risk on January 2007 for censored cases. This duration ranges from 1 year for acquisitions performed in 2006 to a maximum of 18 years for those performed in 1988. On this basis, we estimated the hazard rate (the probability of failure) of French acquisitions in the United States at time <italic>t</italic> within the period at risk as follows,</p>

<p>The hazard rate h(<italic>t</italic>) expresses the instantaneous probability of acquisition failure at time <italic>t</italic> within the period at risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206310392574">Allison, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0149206310392574">Yamaguchi, 1991</xref>). <italic>P</italic>(<italic>t, t</italic> + Δ<italic>t</italic>) is the probability of acquisition failure within a time period ranging from <italic>t</italic> (the beginning of the period at risk) to <italic>t</italic> + Δ<italic>t</italic>.</p>
<p>We examined the impact of the independent variables on the hazard rate using a semiparametric Cox proportional hazards model. We selected this survival model because of its flexibility in the sense that it does not require specification of the time dependence of the hazard rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206310392574">Allison, 1984</xref>). We verified that the proportional hazards assumption was confirmed for our research population by checking (a) that the impact of independent variables on the probability of acquisition failure was constant over time and (b) that, given two acquisitions with a different probability of acquisition failure over time, the value of the hazard ratio combining the probability for these two acquisitions remains the same regardless of the time frame for the period at risk. We examined and validated the proportional hazards assumption for each independent variable using the scaled Schoenfeld residuals test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0149206310392574">Schoenfeld, 1982</xref>).</p>

<title>Acquisition Experience Variables</title>
<p>We defined several acquisition experience variables. These experience variables are based on the counting and cumulation of past acquisitions performed in the United States by French acquirers over a 15-year moving window preceding the date of each focal acquisition. This procedure was carried out for the 731 French acquisitions undertaken in the United States between 1988 and 2006 using the same sources of information that were used to collect data on the research population. The period of analysis, therefore, begins in 1973 (for acquisitions transacted in 1988) and ends in 2006. The focal acquisition together with any acquisitions carried out the same year were counted and cumulated as prior acquisitions. Therefore, the acquisition experience variables have a lower bound of 1. This procedure allowed us to compute an acquisition experience score pertaining to each of the 731 acquisitions transacted between 1988 and 2006.</p>
<p>The first experience variable, <italic>gross experience</italic>, corresponds to the acquisition experience score. No particular depreciation of time was applied to this score. The gross experience score of French acquiring firms varies from 1 to 29 past acquisitions, with an average score of 6.7.</p>

</p>
<p>DE<sub><italic>ai</italic></sub> is the discounted experience of the French acquirer <italic>i</italic> at the time of the focal acquisition <italic>a</italic>. E<sub><italic>ait</italic></sub> is the gross experience accumulated by the French acquirer <italic>i</italic> in year <italic>t</italic> (with <italic>t</italic> ranging from −15 to 0; also defined as the year of the experience), and D<sub><italic>t</italic></sub> is the effect of depreciation over time.</p>
<p>Four discount factors were considered and codified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206310392574">Baum &amp; Ingram, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206310392574">Ingram &amp; Baum, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206310392574">Simon, 1966</xref>). They are presented here in ascending order according to the importance of the decay resulting from organizational forgetting. First, D<sub><italic>t</italic></sub> is equal to the square root of the age of the experience (low depreciation of experience over time and a limited impact from organizational forgetting on the acquisition experience of the acquiring firm). Second, D<sub><italic>t</italic></sub> is equal to the age of the experience (linear depreciation of the experience over time). Third, D<sub><italic>t</italic></sub> is equal to the age of the experience squared. Fourth, D<sub><italic>t</italic></sub> is an exponential function of the age of the experience. This fourth depreciation factor was suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206310392574">Simon (1966)</xref> and puts the greatest emphasis on organizational forgetting’s role in the decay of old experiences and the overvaluation of the most recent experiences (i.e., the 2 years prior to the focal acquisition).</p>
<p>The third and final variable, <italic>experience timing</italic>, refers to the temporal distance between the focal acquisition and prior acquisition experience. We first applied a 5-year cutoff point, which is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206310392574">Haleblian and Finkelstein (1999)</xref>, to distinguish old experience from recent experience. Then, in order to test Ribot’s Law, we introduced a 2-year cutoff point to isolate very recent experience. We selected this time frame on the basis of prior research indicating that postacquisition integration may take up to 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206310392574">Buono &amp; Bowditch, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206310392574">Chakrabarti, Gupta-Mukherjee, &amp; Jayaraman, 2006</xref>). More specifically, Buono and Bowditch suggest that “the period following an organization consolidation is often characterized by ‘we-they’ tensions, power struggles, turnover and absenteeism, and declines in job-related attitudes and performance in the acquired or merged firm that typically require at least one to two years to resolve” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206310392574">1989</xref>: 193). On this basis, we obtained three experience timing scores. The first score corresponds to short-term or recent experience (acquisitions transacted during the period [−2, 0]). This period comprises all acquisitions transacted over the 2 years prior to the focal acquisition as well as all acquisitions undertaken in the same year as the focal acquisition. The second score corresponds to medium-term experience (acquisitions transacted during the period [−4, −3]), and the third score corresponds to old experience (acquisitions transacted during the period [−15, −5]).</p>

<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>In addition to acquisition experience variables, we included a number of control variables. These variables are presented in acquisition literature as determinants of acquisition performance. We grouped these control variables into three categories: variables specific to the nature and performance of the acquirer, variables specific to the nature of the acquisition itself, and other acquirer experience variables.</p>
<p>The first series of control variables relates to the impact of the nature and performance of French acquirers on the probability of acquisition failure. First, we added <italic>acquirer size</italic> to the Cox regression models. This variable is considered as a determinant of acquisition performance as larger firms are more experienced and have more resources than smaller acquirers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0149206310392574">Nadolska &amp; Barkema, 2007</xref>). As a consequence, larger acquirers are better prepared to manage acquisitions. This control variable was measured in terms of acquirer sales (in USD million) and was logarithmically transformed. Second, <italic>acquirer debt</italic> (the long-term debt to equity ratio) was used to measure the acquirer’s available financial resources. According to the literature on acquisitions, a firm with a significant amount of available financial resources will find it easier than an indebted firm to engage in external growth operations. In addition, it has a wider choice of potential targets and can take more risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206310392574">Finkelstein &amp; Haleblian, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206310392574">Haleblian &amp; Finkelstein, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206310392574">Hoskisson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206310392574">Jensen, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206310392574">Shimizu, 2007</xref>). Third, we included a <italic>CEO change</italic> variable to account for the impact of the acquirer’s executive turnover on the probability of acquisition failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206310392574">Barkema &amp; Schijven, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206310392574">Shimizu, 2007</xref>). This variable was coded 1 for acquisitions in which the CEO of the acquiring firm changed during the 2 years preceding the end of the period at risk (19% of the population) and 0 otherwise (81%). Last, we introduced a variable pertaining to acquirer performance—<italic>acquirer return on sales</italic> (the net profit to sales ratio). A high level of performance is often considered to be a good indicator of a firm’s propensity for undertaking acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206310392574">Haleblian et al., 2006</xref>) as well as its capacity to be successful in acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206310392574">Bergh, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206310392574">Finkelstein &amp; Haleblian, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206310392574">Haleblian &amp; Finkelstein, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206310392574">Hoskisson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206310392574">Markides &amp; Oyon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206310392574">Shimizu, 2007</xref>). All of these control variables were calculated for the year prior to the focal acquisition.</p>
<p>The second series of control variables relates to the nature of the acquisition itself. The first of these variables concerns the <italic>relative size</italic> of the acquisition, which was measured as the ratio of acquisition sales (in USD million) to acquirer sales (in USD million) in the year prior to the focal acquisition. Relative size is often assumed to be a determinant of acquisition performance. However, the relationship between relative size and acquisition performance is unclear. Relative size is associated not only with high future gains resulting from large economies of scale and the realization of synergies between the acquired firm and the acquirer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206310392574">Asquith, Bruner, &amp; Mullins, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206310392574">Capron &amp; Pistre, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206310392574">Haleblian &amp; Finkelstein, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206310392574">Hayward, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206310392574">Seth, Song, &amp; Pettit, 2002</xref>) but also with high postacquisition integration costs and risks of acquisition failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206310392574">Moeller, Schlingemann, &amp; Stulz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206310392574">Shimizu, 2007</xref>). The second variable in this series relates to <italic>payment form</italic>, which corresponds to the mode of financing for the focal acquisition. The acquiring firm can pay for its acquisition with cash or stocks, or with a combination of the two (combo). This variable was coded 0 for cash-financed acquisitions (89.5% of the population) and 1 otherwise (10.5%). The literature on acquisitions generally assumes that a cash-financed acquisition will perform better than a stock-financed one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206310392574">Hayward, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206310392574">Huang &amp; Walkling, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206310392574">Moeller et al., 2004</xref>). This assumption is supported by the fact that acquiring firms that perform well tend to pay for their acquisition in cash rather than in stocks. The third control variable is the <italic>acquirer-to-target relatedness</italic> ratio. It is calculated by comparing the acquirer’s SIC code(s) with that of the acquired firm. In an adaptation of the methodology used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206310392574">J. Anand and Singh (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206310392574">Bergh (1997)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0149206310392574">Rumelt (1974)</xref>, we placed each focal acquisition on a scale ranging from 0 to 4. The acquisition was coded 0 (47.2% of the population) if the acquired and acquiring firms had the same four-digit SIC code, 1 (10.4%) if they had the same three-digit SIC code, 2 (13.1%) if they had the same two-digit SIC code, 3 (10.3%) if they had the same one-digit SIC code, and 4 (19%) if their SIC codes were completely different. This variable is recognized in the acquisition literature as a determinant of acquisition performance. However, the results of empirical studies using the probability of acquisition divestment as a performance measure have not been consistent. Some empirical studies conclude that there is a negative relationship with the acquirer-to-target relatedness ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206310392574">Hoskisson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206310392574">Kim &amp; Finkelstein, 2009</xref>), while others come to no conclusion at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206310392574">Matta &amp; Portugal, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206310392574">Shimizu, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The third series of control variables includes experience variables that are distinct from the acquisition experience variables but that may influence acquisition performance. The first of these variables is the <italic>acquirer internationalization degree</italic> (measured as the ratio of foreign sales to total sales). The literature on international acquisitions implies that acquiring firms with a high level of international exposure, regardless of the internationalization mode, are better prepared to manage acquisitions abroad than acquiring firms with little international experience or only a local presence. Such globalized acquirers are assumed to be familiar with different national cultural values and are expected to have routines and procedures to help select the right target in a foreign country, reduce the time and costs associated with postacquisition integration, and handle cultural differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206310392574">Andersson, Johanson, &amp; Vahlne, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206310392574">Barkema &amp; Vermeulen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206310392574">Buono &amp; Bowditch, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206310392574">Chang &amp; Rosenzweig, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0149206310392574">Nadolska &amp; Barkema, 2007</xref>). We also included the <italic>experience of past alliances with the target</italic> variable in the Cox regression models. This variable was coded 0 for acquisitions for which the acquiring firm had no past interorganizational relationship with the acquired firm (94.3% of the population) and 1 for acquisitions in which the acquiring firm was involved in past alliances with the acquired firm (such as R&amp;D agreements, sales agreements, or joint ventures; 5.7%). This type of experience is linked to “the idea of using the alliance as acquisition due diligence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206310392574">Arend, 2004</xref>: 284), where an alliance enhances the acquirer’s ability to assess the target. Empirical studies have supported this idea by showing that experience gained from past alliances increases the probability of a successful acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206310392574">Agarwal, Anand, &amp; Croson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206310392574">Al-Laham, Schweizer, &amp; Amburgey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206310392574">Porrini, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206310392574">Reuer, 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>To test our hypotheses, we ran several Cox regression models (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206310392574">Table 3</xref>). The effects of the experience variables on the probability of acquisition failure are examined in Models 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, while Model 1 is restricted to control variables.</p>

<p>The Cox regression models examining the impact of acquisition experience on the probability of acquisition failure display a good statistical fit (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). We observe that there is no clear pattern in terms of the effect of the <italic>gross experience</italic> held by French acquirers on the failure probability of French acquisitions in the United States. This indicates that gross acquisition experience per se does not affect the probability of acquisition failure, which is consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206310392574">Laamanen and Keil (2008)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0149206310392574">Zollo and Singh (2004)</xref>.</p>
<p>The second experience variable, <italic>discounted experience</italic>, is broken down into four scores (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0149206310392574">Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206310392574">Table 3</xref> shows that all four discounted experience scores have no significant impact on the probability of acquisition failure. This does not support Hypothesis 1. Moreover, a comparison of log likelihoods in Models 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206310392574">Table 3</xref>) shows that the models examining the impact of acquisition experience discounted by the age (log likelihood = −460.88), by the square root of the age (−460.92), by the age squared (−460.89), and by an exponential function of the age (−460.83) fit the data in the same way as the model testing the impact of gross experience (−460.91). Therefore, acquisition experience does not appear to affect the probability of acquisition failure. This is particularly true when organizational forgetting has a significant impact on the acquiring firm’s stock of experience.</p>
<p>The third experience variable, <italic>experience timing</italic>, covers three distinct time windows associated with the acquisition experience: a period (−2, 0) for recent experience, a period (−4, −3) for medium-term experience, and a period (−15, −5) for old experience. These three windows have varying effects on the probability of acquisition failure. Only medium-term experience has a significant, negative impact on the probability of acquisition failure (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Recent and old experience have no significant effects.</p>
<p>The effects linked to the three experience timing scores correspond to the predictive strength of each experience variable. The coefficient for medium-term experience (−0.31) indicates that each additional acquisition in period (−4, −3) reduces the probability of failure of the focal acquisition by 26.6% (=[exp(coefficient) − 1] × 100%). For recent and old experience, each additional acquisition translates to 3% and 7.2% increases (nonsignificant results), respectively, in the probability of acquisition failure. Therefore, the results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206310392574">Table 3</xref> indicate that (a) the most recent experience has no impact, (b) the impact of medium-term experience is strong and significant, and (c) the oldest experience has no impact.</p>
<p>In a complementary analysis, we created three subpopulations. The first subpopulation includes acquisitions undertaken by acquirers with at least one long-term experience. The second is composed of acquisitions undertaken by acquirers with at least one medium-term experience. The third encompasses acquisitions carried out by acquirers with at least one short-term experience. In order to determine the differences in the probabilities of acquisition failure among these three subpopulations, we used the log rank and Wilcoxon tests of equality of hazard rates. A comparison of the subpopulation of acquisitions performed by acquirers with at least one long-term experience to the subpopulation of acquisitions performed by acquirers with at least one medium-term experience shows that the probabilities of acquisition failure for the two subpopulations are significantly different at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 using the log rank test and at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 using the Wilcoxon test. A comparison of the subpopulation of acquisitions performed by acquirers with at least one short-term experience to the subpopulation of acquisitions performed by acquirers with at least one medium-term experience shows that the probabilities of acquisition failure for the two subpopulations are significantly different at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 using the log rank test and at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .1 using the Wilcoxon test. These results support Hypothesis 2.</p>
<p>In regard to control variables, only the acquirer-to-target relatedness ratio and the existence of prior ties with the acquired firm have a significant, positive impact on the probability of acquisition failure. Therefore, the lower the degree of relatedness between the acquirer and the target, the greater the likelihood of acquisition failure. This is consistent with empirical studies on the relationship between relatedness and acquisition performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206310392574">J. Anand &amp; Singh, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206310392574">Haleblian &amp; Finkelstein, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206310392574">Markides &amp; Oyon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206310392574">Pennings, Barkema, &amp; Douma, 1994</xref>).

<title>Supplementary Analyses</title>
<p>We performed three additional analyses in order to better understand the results and to check their robustness. The first analysis examined the impact of different medium-term time windows on the probability of acquisition failure. The second analysis explored the assumption that medium-term acquisition experiences reinforce old memory traces. The third analysis focused on the relationship between past alliances with the acquired firm and the probability of acquisition failure.</p>
<sec id="section13-0149206310392574">
<title>Effect Size of Different Medium-Term Time Windows</title>
<p>The time window (−4, −3) has been shown to have a strong impact on the probability of acquisition failure (with an effect size of −26.6%, significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Therefore, medium-term experience may be a key factor. Although the time window used in the original analysis was selected in accordance with existing literature, we checked whether this result persisted given different medium-term time windows. In this regard, we examined the impact of two time windows including more recent experiences ([−4, −2] with an effect size of -24.3%, significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; and [−4, −1] with a nonsignificant effect size of −6.5%) and two time windows including older experiences ([−5, −3] with an effect size of −17.1%, significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .1; and [−6, −3] with an effect size of −14.7%, significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .1). These effect sizes were estimated with variables adjusted for recent and old experience and with the same control variables as those included in Model 7 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206310392574">Table 3</xref>). These analyses show that the strong impact of the medium-term experience persists when the time window is extended to 1 year before or 1 year after the original time window. However, beyond those points, its impact disappears. These findings may clarify the boundaries of the medium-term time window.</p>

<title>Reinforcement Effect for Old Acquisition Experiences</title>
<p>Our results provide some evidence that old memory traces decay. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206310392574">Walsh (1995)</xref> suggests that if old memory traces are not used, their decay is accelerated, while additional experience might reinforce them and slow the pace of decay. In order to explore this process, we divided our population into four subpopulations according to two criteria: (a) the absence or presence of long-term experience and (b) the absence or presence of medium-term experience (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0149206310392574">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Past Alliances With the Acquired Firm</title>
<p>The strong positive impact of past alliances with the acquired firm on the probability of acquisition failure contradicts prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206310392574">Agarwal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206310392574">Al-Laham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206310392574">Porrini, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206310392574">Reuer, 2005</xref>). We therefore conducted further statistical analyses of this issue. As a robustness check, we reran the different Cox regression models without the inclusion of this variable. Only the revised Models 1 and 7 remained statistically significant. These revised models do not change the direction of our results, but they do add a nuance to their overall significance. We then looked more closely at this result by focusing on the subpopulation of the 41 acquisitions in which there had been an alliance between the acquirer and the target in the past (5.7% of the population). Building on previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206310392574">Agarwal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206310392574">Al-Laham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206310392574">Arend, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206310392574">Porrini, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206310392574">Reuer, 2005</xref>), we created three new variables specific to this subpopulation: (a) two dummy variables, <italic>past manufacturing alliance</italic> and <italic>past R&amp;D alliance</italic>, which reflect the nature of the past alliance, and (b) one variable, <italic>past alliance duration</italic>, which was assessed (in years) by comparing the date of the creation of the alliance with the date of acquisition.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0149206310392574">Table 5</xref> indicates that the duration of past alliances has a significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 in Model 1 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 in Model 2), negative impact on the probability of acquisition failure, although one should keep the limited size of the subpopulation in mind. This result helps to explain the counterintuitive effect initially observed by showing that only past alliances that are developed a short time before the focal acquisition occurs contribute to a significant increase in the probability of acquisition failure. In contrast, long-term past alliances decrease this probability, which is consistent with existing literature. The duration of past alliances categorized as “acquisition due diligence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206310392574">Arend, 2004</xref>) seems to be a key factor with regard to the success of acquisitions.</p>

<p>To interpret this result, we suggest applying the “honeymoon period” concept, which “results in temporary suspension of judgment regarding the desirability of the activity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206310392574">Fichman &amp; Levinthal, 1991</xref>: 445). In the first years of an alliance’s existence, the partners might overestimate the potential synergies and complementarities and minimize sources of conflict and cultural incompatibility. If this somewhat distorted vision leads to an acquisition of the partner, it may affect the acquisition’s ultimate success. On the other hand, an acquisition that occurs after the “honeymoon period” might benefit from a more realistic assessment of the partner.</p>

<sec id="section16-0149206310392574" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This article aims to analyze the impact of experience timing variables on the likelihood that a focal acquisition will fail. It makes four contributions to the understanding of acquisition performance and its relationship to acquisition experience.</p>
<p>First, the article suggests that firms are unlikely to develop an acquisition management competence if their stock of acquisitions contains only old experiences (as they are affected by the exponential decay over time) or only recent experiences (as they are too fresh to be integrated and encoded). In other words, the development of this acquisition management competence and its storage in organizational memory are conditioned by organizational forgetting, in accordance with Jost’s and Ribot’s Laws.</p>
<p>Second, this research helps to consolidate our understanding of collective learning and forgetting mechanisms. Organizational forgetting is neither a homogeneous process nor a linear one. Our research complements the four categories of forgetting proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206310392574">Martin de Holan and Phillips (2004)</xref> by showing that organizational forgetting depreciates knowledge and experience in a distinct way and in accordance with specific laws on forgetting. At the same time, we demonstrate that organizations need time to consolidate acquired knowledge following a set of discontinuous experiences and to transform that knowledge into competences that will enable them to enhance their performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0149206310392574">Zollo &amp; Singh, 2004</xref>). Our findings, therefore, imply that experience capitalization and feedback procedures are important, as experience cannot be consolidated and might rapidly disappear without these mechanisms. Furthermore, forgetting seems to follow an exponential function in the long term, which can significantly depreciate experience and decrease a firm’s performance. However, an additional medium-term experience might interrupt the disuse process and therefore slow down the memory decay.</p>
<p>Third, the literature tends to view all divested acquisitions as failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206310392574">Shaver et al., 1997</xref>). However, divestments may be the result of factors other than outright failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206310392574">Hamilton &amp; Chow, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206310392574">Kaplan &amp; Weisbach, 1992</xref>). This led us to distinguish between failure divestments and other divestments, and we found significant differences between the two categories. Notably, the probability of divestment in the population of French acquisitions in the United States is 26%, which is consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206310392574">Shaver et al. (1997)</xref>. However, when we focus on only failure divestments, the probability drops to 11%. This suggests that foreign acquirers generally prepare for, manage, and integrate international acquisitions more efficiently than previously believed.</p>
<p>Fourth, we found that medium-term acquisition experience has a significant negative impact on the probability of acquisition failure. This impact might be explained by the development of a specific managerial competence that results in a lower probability of acquisition failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206310392574">Ashkenas, DeMonaco, &amp; Francis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0149206310392574">Zollo &amp; Singh, 2004</xref>). Many empirical studies have shown that one of the key benefits of prior acquisition experience in the same geographical location is that such experience increases the foreign firm’s adaptation to the host country and reduces its liability of foreignness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206310392574">Pennings et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206310392574">Shaver et al., 1997</xref>). Consequently, firms that have managed to transform their stock of acquisition experience into an acquisition management competence are more able to cope with the many difficulties surrounding any international acquisition. In this regard, the article shows the benefits of accumulating acquisition experience within this time frame for French firms aiming to acquire U.S. firms.</p>
<p>Some limitations of this study must also be considered. One important issue is that the context of French acquisitions in the United States is quite specific. The focus on acquisitions performed by French firms in the United States allowed us to control for country effects. However, that focus limits the generalizability of the findings to samples drawn from other geographical contexts. Our intention was to neutralize the impact of cultural interactions between the acquired firm and the acquirer on acquisition failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206310392574">Buono &amp; Bowditch, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206310392574">Cartwright &amp; Cooper, 1993</xref>). By restricting the focus to French acquisitions in the United States, we were able to control for just one dimension of cultural interactions—national cultural differences between French and U.S. firms. Other key dimensions of cultural interactions—organizational cultural compatibility and identity conflicts between the acquired firm and the acquirer—were not included as control variables. This is, therefore, a second important limitation to the research.</p>
<p>Another limitation is the measurement of acquisition failure itself. In this article, this dependent variable is measured using the probability of divestment because of the failure of the focal acquisition (defined as <italic>failure divestment</italic>). We classified acquisition divestments as <italic>failure divestments</italic> when they were motivated by low returns, financial losses, and/or poor postacquisition synergies between the acquirer and the acquired firm. This classification procedure can be criticized, as it captures only the financial dimension of acquisition failure. The focus on the financial failure of acquisitions is apparent in the mean difference test on the returns on sales in the different categories of divestments: The average return on sales for failure divestments is −5.5% as opposed to +2.5% for other divestments. This emphasis on financial failure does not allow for the possibility that technological learning, knowledge transfer, or other objectives were met before an acquisition was divested. Further research could address this issue by relating the measurement of acquisition failure to the initial acquisition objectives, as Ahuja and Katila suggest: “[E]valuating all acquisitions on the same performance metric, for instance financial performance, may not be appropriate. Acquisitions motivated by different objectives may differ in their timing and mode of impact on firm performance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206310392574">2001</xref>: 216).</p>
<p>We must also draw attention to an observation related to one specific control variable—prior ties with the focal acquisition. The findings of this article imply that past alliances with the target may adversely affect future acquisition outcomes. This is intriguing, as the observed impact is contrary to conventional wisdom and the findings of some empirical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206310392574">Agarwal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206310392574">Al-Laham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206310392574">Porrini, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206310392574">Reuer, 2005</xref>). More research is needed to theoretically and empirically examine the benefits and drawbacks of engaging in an alliance with a firm prior to its acquisition.</p>
<p>These limitations provide avenues for future research. Our findings may also point toward new directions for research on international acquisitions. Given the tacit assumptions behind Jost’s Law (new experience enhances old memory traces), it would be interesting to explore the impact of the pace of acquisitions over time on acquisition performance. As reinforcement seems to curb the decay of organizational memory, it would be relevant on both the theoretical and practical levels to identify the optimal timing pattern for acquisition experience.</p>
<p>In addition, we distinguish between <italic>failure divestments</italic> and <italic>other divestments</italic>, a distinction that had not previously been made in the literature. Further research on acquisitions could, therefore, provide a more complete picture of acquisition divestment and its determinants in two ways. First, it could clearly define the motives for divestment. Second, it could examine divestments not directly related to acquisition performance.</p>
<p>The research presented here also has implications for managers. Our results show that the forgetting process can depreciate past acquisition experience and decrease the performance of the subsequent acquisitions. Managers should, therefore, ensure the accumulation of acquisition experience through an appropriate experience feedback process. Furthermore, managers should not underestimate the time needed for experience consolidation or the effort needed to gather and encode relevant information. In addition, they should recognize that the memory of an organization has a specific lifecycle. As it can completely decay over time, it needs to be managed. Each organizational memory bin is subject to an emptying process over time, but this process might be slowed in three ways: by decreasing the turnover of critical people, that is, the people involved in the overall management of the acquisition; by filling the five other bins, that is, in addition to the “individual” bin; and by reinforcing old experiences with new experiences.</p>
<p>Last, our research indicates that acquisition performance is not as low as is usually assumed. While short-term financial returns are usually believed to be negative for the acquirer’s shareholders, the results presented here show that the long-term hazard rate might be relatively low. From this point of view, acquisitions remain a valuable option for growth.</p>
