<p>Interactions between citizens and their elected officials always entail challenges. It is, however, safe to assume that Slovak officials did not expect the turnout they received when they offered their constituency the opportunity to suggest names for a planned pedestrian and cycling bridge connecting Slovakia to its neighbouring country Austria. Indeed, in 2012, <italic>TIME Magazine</italic> reported on the 74% majority that had voted to name the bridge after American actor and Internet favourite Chuck Norris – suggesting that the ‘Chuck Norris Bridge’ connect the two countries.</p>
<p>The suggestion to name the bridge after Norris – arguably made in an absurd, nonsensical fashion typical of so-called meme-style tomfoolery – was eventually rejected by Slovakian officials. While this example is indeed somewhat extreme, it serves here as a reminder of the wide range of outcomes that are possible when governments make attempts at different forms of online consultations with their citizens.</p>
<p>The volume under discussion here deals specifically with such interactions between citizens and politicians. A number of different terminologies have been used to demarcate and describe the ways in which political actors – be they citizens or elected officials – have taken to the Internet. While a term such as ‘e-government’ is often used to denote what could be described as a more administrative side of research, terms like ‘e-democracy’, ‘e-consultation’, ‘online deliberation’ and ‘e-deliberation’ are often used interchangeably among researchers, seemingly also in the book at hand. As such, while the introductory chapter offers a definition of the term also featured in the title of the book, the use of the ‘online consultation’ brand appears somewhat varied throughout. Of course, with a roster of chapters as impressive and varied as featured here, a certain degree of terminological multiplicity is to be expected. Including the preface and the conclusion, written by editors Shane and Coleman respectively, <italic>Connecting Democracy</italic> boasts a total of 17 chapters written by some 20 authors, effectively sketching the intellectual history of the field.</p>
<p>The chapters are divided into three broad thematic sections, the first of which deals with the structures available for meetings and consultations between politicians and citizens. Highlights here include Andrew Chadwick’s chapter that seeks to ‘broaden the debate about e-democracy’ (p. 45) by critically assessing some of the rather highly held assumptions about such practices that were often posited during the late 1990s. Specifically, Chadwick discusses how the concepts related to the rationale for web design often described as ‘Web 2.0’ are starting to make their way into political communication practices. Indeed, while services like Facebook or Twitter generate enormous amounts of traffic on a daily basis, it is difficult to gauge how useful these services could be from the perspective of deliberation. As pointed out by Chadwick, ‘the best-known formal deliberative schemes have never grown beyond communities of a few hundred’ (p. 61). In this light, Chadwick suggests that while the supposed novelty of Web 2.0 services might soon wear off, it would be a mistake to disregard their potential for democratic practices. However, as with the Internet itself, such potentials have been heralded for some 15 years and counting – with empirical research providing relatively sombre outcomes. It is therefore essential to remain critical of the hyperbole that surrounds new technologies.</p>
<p>Where Chadwick’s contribution is largely conceptual, the chapter penned by Joachim Åström and Åke Grönlund adopts a more empirical approach. Focusing on the previously under-researched level of local governments, the authors present a synthesis of research performed on online consultations, providing a comparative analysis and a gauging of what seems to ‘work’ in a very practical sense – and what does not. The chapter is impressive; almost a schoolbook example of a meta-analysis, it provides some interesting food for thought. For example, the question of researcher bias is raised as the results presented indicated that researcher involvement in the subject of their studies tended to result in higher scores regarding consultation effects. Furthermore, results indicated that simple ‘have your say forums’ were rarely deemed as successful – relating, ever so slightly, back to the aforementioned Chuck Norris bridge debacle. An enlightening chapter, this reviewer would nevertheless have liked to seen it complemented with a clear set of research recommendations. A meta-analysis like this one holds a unique position to provide the research community with possible ways forward – an opportunity that is not entirely acted upon here.</p>
<p>The second section is entitled ‘What Online Consultations Mean to Their Participants’ and thus places its focus on the actors taking part in these processes – broadly speaking, citizens and politicians. The chapter by Vincent Price looks at the first of these groups, drawing on findings from two large-scale field experiments in order to assess how citizens experience deliberative encounters. While the critical reader will keep in mind that the data used were originally collected over a decade ago-in 2000 and 2004/2005 respectively, the chapter provides useful insights into the topic at hand and provides proposals for future research. In so doing, the authors suggest some interesting interdisciplinary efforts – given that a research project on designing for deliberation would need to include scholars with different backgrounds.</p>
<p>In their contribution, Coleman et al. are similarly focused on citizens. Specifically, the authors report on a 2005 survey looking into the political views and activities of the online UK public. Much like with the previous chapter, the data presented here could be considered somewhat dated – especially given the more recent developments detailed in the previously discussed chapter by Chadwick. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that online political engagement tends to involve groups other than ‘the usual suspects’ – i.e. those of higher socioeconomic status. While predictors of offline political participation tend to be rather similar to previous studies, the differences when comparing triggers to online activity are indeed an interesting result. I particularly enjoyed the identification of different user groups or ‘ideal types’ of citizens taking part (or not) in different types of online consultations – these categorizations should serve as relevant input for scholars and policy makers alike.</p>
<p>The chapter penned by Jeffery S Lubbers deals with officials and their uses of online services – specifically, the chapter is focused on ‘Federal agency rulemakers’ attitudes about e-rulemaking’. Based on a survey that partly suffers from low response rates (an all too common problem) and a rather complicated mode of presentation, the author shows that while administrators feel that different types of online initiatives generally constitute positive initiatives, such opportunities for interaction with citizens are generally burdened by different administrative difficulties in adapting the emerging opportunities to an established organizational culture. Indeed, similar difficulties have been noted elsewhere (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267323113485777">Chadwick, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267323113485777">Klang and Nolin, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The third and final section touches upon such types of more administrative problems, or more precisely, legal ones. The first two chapters here, written by Peter L Strauss and Polona Pičman Štefančič respectively, outline the legal frameworks and institutional settings for online consultations in the United States and European Union respectively. Both chapters take largely descriptive approaches – detailing the specifics of each specified context. Still, I can’t help but feel that some form of normative approach could have been useful here – perhaps as a means to more clearly compare the US and EU cases. However, as the entire book builds on contributions from researchers of varied academic backgrounds, such differences in writing style are perhaps to be expected.</p>
<p>The previously mentioned administrative difficulties of integrating new modes of communication with established institutional rulings are brought up in the subsequent chapter by Shane and Pičman Štefančič. The authors succinctly point out that as ‘the relevant laws and regulations were formulated largely in and for a predigital world’ (p. 351), the difficulties reported by Lubbers should come as less of a surprise than many might assume. Hopefully, the future shaping of governmental policy and practice will take findings like these into account, allowing for less cumbersome tasks at the hands of administrators, and, as a supposed consequence, richer end-user experiences.</p>
<p>In closing, the volume constitutes an impressive collection of essays thread loosely around a common theme. There is something here for everyone from the casually interested to the specialized political communication scholar. Several of the featured authors suggest the need to move the study of online consultation forward by not only studying official, government-sponsored initiatives, an excellent suggestion for interested researchers. As previously pointed out, the advent and supposed ease of use of social media could lead to a new influx of engaged citizens – or it might further strengthen what is mostly described as a status quo of who gets involved and who chooses not to. Future research will provide us with more detail, and hopefully also shape the services and practices at play.</p>
