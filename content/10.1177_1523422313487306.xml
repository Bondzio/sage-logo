<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Children’s Hospital Colorado, a pediatric institution founded in 1908, underwent significant transformation from 2006 to 2012. In the fall of 2007, the hospital relocated from its downtown Denver location to the new Anschutz Medical Campus in neighboring Aurora. Additionally, long-tenured leadership retired, bringing in an almost completely new senior leadership team. From 2006 to 2010, revenue grew 65% and the number of full-time equivalent staff grew 40%. By the beginning of 2011, the growth in staff numbers and attrition resulted in 60% of hospital staff being new to the organization since 2007.</p>
<p>In addition to these demographic shifts, several geographic changes occurred which interrupted previously existing socialization patterns. The facility size increased dramatically from 800,000 square feet to above 2.3 million square feet. Staff workspaces were redesigned and departments moved to a separate administrative building. The central hospital originally served as the primary hub for patient activity, supported by a few, small satellite clinics, but as new and larger locations were added in the Denver metro area, a significant number of staff experienced no connection with the main hospital. All of these changes meant that previous patterns of socialization that had occurred within and between departments were uprooted and people no longer had physical contact with people with whom they had previously worked.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1523422313487306">
<title>Problem</title>
<p>In the midst of this change, references to the espoused values, which had previously been shown on staff badges and in internal publications, were de-emphasized or removed entirely. In a series of retreats in July of 2010, above 400 leaders were asked if they could correctly identify the organization’s existing list of core values and only two people were able to do so.</p>
<p>Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered to validate leadership’s intuitive concerns related to the cultural impact of the significant organizational change (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1523422313487306">Figure 1</xref>). The purpose of the data collection was to determine if there was enough evidence to warrant an intervention.</p>

</fig>
<p>Demographic data highlighted changes in the workforce and validated the shift toward a majority of staff with tenure of less than 5 years. An internal report noted that 60% of staff were new to the organization between 2007 and 2010 due to growth and natural attrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422313487306">Children’s Hospital Colorado, 2010a</xref>). The annual employee opinion survey, administered by an external vendor, also provided quantitative data related to staff expectations, perceptions, and degrees of commitment. In the 2010 survey, of 2,971 respondents (70% participation rate), one of the lowest scoring questions related to different departments working well together in the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1523422313487306">Children’s Hospital Colorado, 2010b</xref>). Specifically, more than 42% of respondents rated the question as either neutral or negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1523422313487306">Children’s Hospital Colorado, 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>Qualitative data collection included the examination of language and statements made by staff related to the organizational values and their accessibility to staff. Comments from open-ended questions within the staff opinion survey were reviewed to identify themes or emergent issues related to behaviors that were incongruent with the espoused values.</p>
<p>Senior management expressed concern that as a result of the cumulative effects of the changes, the hospital’s culture could fragment and threaten staff engagement. Leadership considered Children’s relationally based social environment and strong embedded values as essential elements to organizational cohesion and alignment because they drove and enhanced the mission focus related to caring for children. Senior management sponsored additional work to determine what interventions might be appropriate to address these concerns.</p>
<p>The following section highlights the theoretical framework and underlying theories used to address this problem. With the theoretical framework laid out, the process used to identify and implement a solution is described, followed by reflections on how the theories of appreciative inquiry (AI) and Theory U played out in the process. The article concludes with a discussion, including implications, and a critical thinking section.</p>

<title>Informing Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>The intervention was based on the synthesis of multiple theoretical frameworks: culture change and organizational values, action learning, AI, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer’s (2009)</xref> Theory U. The role of values in culture change served as the guiding meta-theory, while action learning provided the methodology using AI and Theory U as methods and supporting theories (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1523422313487306">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Role of Values in Organization Culture Change</title>
<p>Defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1523422313487306">Schein (1990)</xref>, “Culture is what a group learns over a period of time as that group solves its problems of survival in an external environment and its problems of internal integration” (p. 111). The values of an organization, based on the underlying assumptions, therefore are central to the ability of the organization to solve problems and survive in its external environment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422313487306">Denison (1990)</xref> described the importance of values as the “fundamental basis for coordinated action within an organization” (p. 6), and directly connected values to organizational effectiveness.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1523422313487306">Schein (1990)</xref> identified three levels central to cultural change efforts: observable artifacts, values, and basic underlying assumptions. Strategies for the intervention that could impact all three levels were sought out. Organizations can use a variety of methods to identify shared values and underlying assumptions, such as surveys, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1523422313487306">Schein (1990)</xref> suggested that “interview and observation methods” (p. 114) “working with motivated insiders” (p. 112) of an organization can bring the underlying assumptions to the surface.</p>
<p>In this case, the approach that was chosen was one in which the existing basic assumptions that were suited to the current challenges would be identified through interview and listening sessions by a cross functional group of motivated insiders representing different parts of the organization. This information would then be shared in a newly formulated values statement, which would be an artifact that the organization could refer to. In addition, the stories gathered in the process would be shared broadly, thereby creating another set of artifacts that would reinforce the basic assumptions. Finally, the collaborative way in which the values statement was created would be shared as an example of the organization living its values. In this way, the three levels of the intervention would reinforce one another (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1523422313487306">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Several additional sources of values literature were reviewed to substantiate the values meta-theory used in this case. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1523422313487306">Posner and Schmidt (1993)</xref> found managers who had clarity around their personal values were more positive about their work and ethical practices than those who did not have clarity about their personal values. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422313487306">Cameron and Quinn (2011)</xref> found that higher levels of congruence of manager and organization values were a prerequisite for higher performance. As we will see, this was an important part of the overall process for staff to express their own values as they were rearticulating the values of the larger organization.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422313487306">Meyer’s (1995)</xref> study found that narrative is essential to the development of organizational culture built on the values that guide staff behavior. Through a series of interviews, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422313487306">Meyer (1995)</xref> uncovered value themes that staff had in common and that were in conflict with each other. Through this understanding the organization was able to resolve conflict and develop a shared understanding of their values. The process discussed in this case was not without conflict and vigorous dialogue among the team members.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1523422313487306">Hassan (2007)</xref> conducted an exploratory study to understand the relationship of human resource development (HRD) practices and organizational values. This study focused on the perspective of the staff rather than of management. Similar to the case discussed in this article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1523422313487306">Hassan (2007)</xref> used tools to “articulate cherished values” (p. 445) and found that staff used values in day-to-day decision making.</p>
<p>The above research clearly demonstrates the need for organizations and individuals in those organizations to do two things regarding organizational culture and firm performance. One, ensure staff reflect upon their personal values and how those values relate to the organization’s espoused values. Second, promote the use of narrative to articulate the values relevant to the organization. As previously stated, the role of values in culture change served as the guiding meta-theory, while action learning provided the methodology using AI and Theory U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer, 2009</xref>) as methods and supporting theories (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1523422313487306">Figure 2</xref>). Given this framework, we now explore the role of action learning as the methodology used in this case.</p>

<title>Action Learning in Organizational Interventions</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1523422313487306">Revans (1982)</xref>, credited with developing the concept of action learning, set out to solve practical or “real” problems in a social process of collective learning that outlives the original problem. From its origin in 1945 through the late 1970s, action learning received little attention by academics but has since developed into multiple schools of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1523422313487306">Marsick &amp; O’Neil, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1523422313487306">Revans, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422313487306">Marquardt and Banks (2010)</xref> define action learning as “a process and tool that enable individuals and groups to learn while solving problems and implementing action” (p. 160). Action learning has developed and evolved into a method that entrusts small groups to work on practical problems with the intent of problem solving and learning as an outcome of the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422313487306">Cho &amp; Egan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422313487306">Marquardt, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422313487306">Marquardt and Banks (2010)</xref> stated that action learning has developed into a useful tool in developing teams. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1523422313487306">Nolan and Grant (1993)</xref> suggested six requirements for successful action learning and change initiatives. The first and the prerequisite for success was “that there is a shared and explicit set of values acting as a guide for practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1523422313487306">Nolan &amp; Grant, 1993</xref>, p. 307). They noted that while this first step is critical for the success of change initiatives, often members of a team do not have a shared understanding of their underlying values. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422313487306">Nolan (1991)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422313487306">Nolan and Grant (1992)</xref> in a previous study had developed a checklist to elucidate perception of nurses and found there to be a lack of consistency in the values they identified. This highlights the importance of creating an opportunity for members of a change effort to have the time and space to develop a shared understanding of values for the organization or team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1523422313487306">Nolan &amp; Grant, 1993</xref>).</p>

<title>Supporting Theories as Methods—AI</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422313487306">Whitney and Trosten-Bloom (2010)</xref> defined AI as a process that “ … gives people the experience of personal and collective power” (p. 266). Using positive questioning and reflection, AI “enhanced self-esteem and self-expression” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422313487306">Whitney &amp; Trosten-Bloom, 2010</xref>, p. 266). Whitney and Trosten-Bloom also defined six elements that were essential to enabling personal and organizational power. The six elements they identified are (a) freedom to be known in relationship, (b) freedom to be heard, (c) freedom to dream in community, (d) freedom to choose to contribute, (e) freedom to act with support, and (f) freedom to be positive. These concepts and principles of AI were used in designing the overall interventions and in making course corrections. Additional aspects of AI are delineated in the Reflections section that follows the description of the process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1523422313487306">
<title>Supporting Theories—Theory U</title>
<p>Theory U, developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer (2009)</xref> describes a process for initiating attention and intention to situation analysis and problem solving. Theory U is intended to engage individuals or groups in techniques to shift from existing mental models to a broader openness in seeing emergent possibilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer’s (2009)</xref> U framework was a helpful construct in designing the overall process as well as some of the specific components.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer (2009)</xref> defines the stages in the “U” as:</p>

<title>Process to Reach the Solution</title>
<sec id="section12-1523422313487306">
<title>The Values Rearticulation Intervention</title>
<p>The process of rearticulating the values was divided into five phases:</p>
<list id="list2-1523422313487306" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Culture rounding</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Values champions team formation</p></list-item>

</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1523422313487306">
<title>Culture Rounding</title>
<p>The first step in the intervention involved working with leadership within the hospital system (defined as anyone with a direct report) to help them understand the role of culture in creating effective outcomes. People Development (the internal HRD department) held a retreat to provide an overview of culture theory. With awareness of potential resistance to a large-scale intervention, an interview process referred to as “culture rounding” was implemented to gather further qualitative data on perceptions of current organization behaviors. Managers were asked to interview up to 10 staff members about behaviors they had seen that “moved us forward” or “held us back.” The data from 1,155 interviews were captured and synthesized by People Development into thematic categories.</p>
<p>From these themes, a video was created in which leaders relayed stories of what they heard. Some of these stories were positive and uplifting and others were examples of negative behaviors such as incivility. This video was shared at a follow-up leadership retreat.</p>
<p>One of the intentions of using the video was to create a sense of unease when stories of Children’s at its best were contrasted with more negative stories. When asked about stories that seemed to contradict leadership expectations, leaders spoke of the behaviors being inconsistent with “who we are.” Participants also experienced discomfort when they heard the negative stories. This led to a willingness to discuss the values underlying the negative stories. Being clear about these values would help set expectations and develop a foundation for the resulting intervention.</p>
<p>Based on the culture rounding process, senior leaders in partnership with the Chief Human Resources Officer and People Development, determined that rearticulating core organizational values would help anchor staff to the hospital’s mission and serve as a basis to set behavioral expectations. Senior leadership gave clear public support to do the additional work to create a renewed values statement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1523422313487306">
<title>Values Champion Team Formation</title>
<p>Given this mandate to rearticulate its values, the Chief Human Resources Officer tasked the director and a consultant from the People Development team to facilitate the process. Each person in the organization with direct reports was asked to nominate people who best represented Children’s core values. From those nominated, 12 participants were selected by People Development taking into account tenure, role, level, and department team. These nominees were invited in a letter from the CEO to be “values champions” and participate in the values rearticulation process.</p>
<p>In a series of retreats and meetings, the values champions were trained on concepts related to values. In this process, they were taught several theories related to the values work including AI and Theory U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer, 2009</xref>). They practiced value identification by working to identify their own personal values in partnership with coaches. They were also informed that the process of values rearticulation would be collaborative and that they would have a role in designing the process itself.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1523422313487306">
<title>Listening Sessions</title>
<p>After this initial work, the team designed a process to gather information directly from staff related to the organization’s values. The values champions would hold a series of “listening sessions” that would be open to all staff, physicians, and leadership. In these sessions, participants would be asked to tell a story about “Children’s at its best.” Participants were asked to identify story themes for inclusion in a final values statement. Each session would be cofacilitated by two values champions and one of the internal consultants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1523422313487306">
<title>Statement Creation</title>
<p>After the listening sessions had been completed, the values champions reviewed session results. The intended outcome of values rearticulation was reiterated and success criteria were shared. Criteria included the expectation that the result of the work be memorable, speak to the heart, and help Children’s staff to identify what was valued by the organization.</p>
<p>The People Development consultants spread the final thoughts on worksheets and notes that had been gathered during the listening sessions throughout the retreat area. Also, photos had been taken of the whiteboards from each session where themes had been gathered. These photos were printed out in large format so that the key words could be identified. During a period of silent reflection, the values champions were invited to roam around the retreat space and pick up artifacts from the process while writing ideas about potential values in a journal that was provided.</p>
<p>After this silent period, participants worked in small groups of 2 to 3 to share their thoughts about what core values were highlighted based on the stories that they had heard. They were invited to play with creative ways of expressing these values together.</p>
<p>Finally, the small groups convened as a whole for a discussion about what the values should be. This large group discussion began with each small group sharing their thoughts and then they began to work together to craft a values statement. During this discussion, there were many pauses to allow for the values champions to process what they were hearing. As certain statements were shared, the champions paid attention to which phrases generated a visceral response. One champion mentioned “shivers up my spine” when hearing an effective expression of a value. When the statement was complete, team members individually expressed their support for the final statement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1523422313487306">
<title>Values Testing and Roll Out</title>
<p>The statement was shared with key stakeholder groups including the senior executive team and the board as well as nursing leadership. Each group expressed support for the statement and the board provided final approval.</p>
<p>After approval, the statement was rolled out to staff in a variety of venues including staff meetings, annual meetings, new hire orientation, and internal publications. In each case, the values champions were the representatives who shared the values and explained how they were identified.</p>
<p>The statement continues to be well received. In 2012, the Values Champions received an organizational award from the CEO for their work. The values are currently being incorporated into formal processes such as performance appraisals and hiring practices. They are also being used informally across the organization for a variety of purposes.</p>

<title>Reflections on Supporting Theories as Methods</title>
<p>Although this intervention was informed by several theories, Theory U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer, 2009</xref>) and AI were both explicitly shared with the values champions to help shape their approach to the work. In this case, the internal HRD consultants were familiar with these models from prior education, training, and self-study. The collaborative nature of Children’s culture meant that the process would be most successful if the values champions not only facilitated the listening sessions, but that they should be deeply involved in its design. It was a core assumption of the work that, with appropriate training and support, the values champions would be capable of applying Theory U and AI theories both in codesigning the process and in adapting the process when challenges arose.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1523422313487306">
<title>Applying AI</title>
<p>The values champions were taught several concepts related to AI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422313487306">Watkins &amp; Mohr, 2001</xref>). Early on in the process design, the values champions realized the power of the language they would use in the process. The idea of language as a creator of reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422313487306">Watkins &amp; Mohr, 2001</xref>) is in the social constructionist roots of AI. In application, the team chose to use the words “values re-articulation” because they wanted to imply the continuity with the past. This was a concern because the intervention was to address concerns that Children’s was “losing its soul”—an indication of the desire to preserve core values, not create new ones. Coming back to core principles meant not creating something new, but reconnecting. Other language choices included listening sessions instead of focus groups, because of the desire to show that the staff already had the answers, but needed to be heard. Even the choice of values champions for the team members was intended to imply that the values already existed but needed champions to remind the organization of them.</p>
<p>Another component of AI that informed the process design was the central role of storytelling. It was hoped that by having people share examples of others living by Children’s values, the process itself would help cocreate meaning to determine authentic, rational, and good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422313487306">Watkins &amp; Mohr, 2001</xref>). As mentioned above, the choice of the label listening sessions for the meetings stressed the importance of the values champions were hearing from the organization. A subtle second meaning is that the participants themselves would be listening to the stories of other participants and would hear their perspectives. As hoped, participants indicated that participating in the listening session helped them feel reinvigorated, refreshed, and reconnected to the hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422313487306">Whitney &amp; Trosten-Bloom, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Further emphasizing the role of stories in the process design, each time the new values statement was shared the values team would refer to specific stories they heard that helped to shape the new statement. This repeating of stories ensured that the stories would become artifacts and help redefine “real, rational and good.”</p>
<p>Core to the underlying concepts of AI is the role of the inquiry itself. The team struggled at first with the idea that the work should focus on the positive core of Children’s. They raised questions about whether this appreciative focus would shut off dialogue or even if it was unrealistic. These concerns became stronger when participants in some of the listening sessions chose to express frustration instead of sharing stories of Children’s at its best. They were reminded, that asking the right questions determines what is discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422313487306">Watkins &amp; Mohr, 2001</xref>). The story that Children’s was losing touch with its positive core was already gaining strength, and focusing on negative stories could reinforce that belief. The team struggled and debated with how to handle the negative stories they were hearing, but by returning to the theory, they were able to gain confidence in their approach. They became capable of holding space for the frustration, but were able to return to the search for the positive core that motivated the work.</p>
<p>Another way that AI informed the work was the fact that it enabled groups to carry the best of the past into the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422313487306">Watkins &amp; Mohr, 2001</xref>). Since this process was explicitly intended to help generate a sense of continuity within Children’s, AI was very well suited to the process. One of the principles used to evaluate whether the values statement was effective was that the statement should “feel relevant 50 years in the past or 50 years into the future.” Past values statements were looked at as sources of inspiration, but the stories themselves helped to create the sense of connection between what Children’s currently values and what it aspires to continue to value. The final values statement made this link to the past clear by beginning with the motto of the hospital from 1920, “For a Child’s Sake,” and ending with a call to action in the present, “This is the moment.”</p>

<title>Applying Theory U</title>
<p>Theory U, developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer (2009)</xref> describes a process for initiating attention and intention to situation analysis and problem solving. The stages of the overall process were designed to help with the journey “down” the left side of the U and begin moving up the right side. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer (2009)</xref> defines the stages in the “U” as:</p>
<list id="list3-1523422313487306" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Coinitiating</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cosensing</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Cocreating (Act in an instant)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Coevolving</p></list-item>
</list>
<sec id="section21-1523422313487306">
<title>Coinitiating</title>
<p>Great care was taken to help find a group of values champions that would be capable of expressing the core values of Children’s. The 12 that were selected were expected to not only live the values, but express them as well. In the design of the first few meetings of the values champions, time was dedicated to allowing the team to get to know each other, through identifying personal values, and to express their passion for the work. During this initial phase, the principle of slowing down to understand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer, 2009</xref>) was introduced and practiced by the team. During personal values identification, they realized that the personal values that they most quickly identified were often “superficial” and were made much clearer with additional time and inquiry from partners. For example, one values champion identified “caring” as her personal core value. As part of the exercise, another values champion questioned what this meant to her and after some discussion, she came to “protecting” as a personally meaningful value. This was more meaningful to her and helped make a distinction between what she perceived as a passive, caring, and an active one, protecting. This experience would be useful later in the design of the overall process when the values champions pushed for more time for organizational values identification. They did this both on a micro and macro level. On the macro level, the original request from senior management was for the values to be identified in several months, but they extended this process to allow for more reflection. Likewise, the listening sessions were designed to be 60 min, but they redesigned it for 90 min to allow more reflection from participants. In both cases, they were able to refer to Theory U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer, 2009</xref>) as a grounding theory for their decision.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1523422313487306">
<title>Cosensing</title>
<p>The second step, cosensing, is expressed as: “Observe, observe, observe: Suspend your Voice of Judgment (VOJ) and connect with your sense of wonder” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer, 2009</xref>, p. 393). The listening sessions were designed to fulfill this intent. The values champions were trained to listen to the content of the sessions and the unexpressed components that might be demonstrated in body language or other indicators. They learned to try to keep their own perspectives in check so that they could listen to the perspectives of others with an open mind. In Theory U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer, 2009</xref>), these practices are expressed in the four levels of listening: (a) Downloading: listening by reconfirming habitual judgments, (b) Object-focused: paying attention to facts and to novel or disconfirming data, (c) Empathetic: a deeper level that requires real dialogue, and (d) Generative: listening from the emerging field of the future.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1523422313487306">
<title>Presencing (Retreat and Reflect)</title>
<p>The team took a day at a team member’s house to craft the values statement and the intention was to “listen from the whole”; to express a statement that would reflect what the values champions had heard in the listening sessions. This required the team to go through the different stages of the U within the day. The day was designed with the intention of cocreating (Step 4) around the middle of the day. This middle step, presencing, is an experience that is difficult to manufacture or control. The agenda for the day listed “Magic Happens” as that particular step. In this step, the values champions were gathered outside and asked to create a values statement together. People shared their thoughts about what statements best expressed the essential underlying truths of what they had heard. One of the ways that the “whole” was listened to was by incorporating awareness of physical reactions to the statements being shared. Values champions were asked to pay attention to signs such as “tingling” or “chills” when statements were shared. The final statement was created and expressed as a pledge:
<disp-quote>
<p>For a child’s sake … We are a caring community called to honor the sacred trust of our patients, families and each other through humble expertise, generous service and boundless creativity… This is the moment.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1523422313487306">
<title>Cocreating (Act in an Instant)</title>
<p>As the statement was shared across the organization, people were asked to find ways to implement the values without any centralized authority directing their actions. Different parts of the hospital implemented the reading of the values statement as a pledge at the beginning of their days. Others built recognition programs around the values statement. These types of interventions were intended to generate interest and action from the sense of “open-will,” or participants’ “ability to access the authentic purpose and self” (Scharmer, 2007, p. 41). It was also hoped that it would honor the fact that the values were locally inspired and not being imposed from external forces.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-1523422313487306">
<title>Coevolving</title>
<p>Currently, Children’s is at the coevolving stage of the process. The individual acts of implementation have had varying levels of success, but long-term impact will require institutionalization of key practices. Several groups are working on these initiatives. One example is a group working to create a set of behaviors that reflect the values in action. These behaviors will then be included in performance evaluations and hiring practices. Although there was not a direct measurement of the impact of the change, it is important to note that the most recent staff opinion survey measured staff commitment levels at their highest point since at least 2005. The organization plans to continue the annual survey and specifically ask about the ability of leadership to recite the new statement.</p>

<sec id="section26-1523422313487306" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>From our experience, HRD practitioners are often engaged by senior management to address acute problems based on empirical data or perception through intuition or strategic foresight. Practitioners use theories by adapting or combining them to help solve specific organizational problems. In the implementation described in this case, there were several challenges that needed to be addressed and theory was critical in overcoming those challenges.</p>
<p>There were two overarching challenges with this intervention that theory helped address. The first challenge to the practitioners involved the process of initiation—how do we begin, what intervention is the most appropriate, and how should it be designed? The second challenge where theory supported practice occurred as the process was underway and asks the question: How can we overcome obstacles and challenges?</p>
<sec id="section27-1523422313487306">
<title>Determining the Intervention</title>
<p>From the intuitive and anecdotal indications that cultural drift was occurring, many potential approaches could have been used. Essentially, the first question is “What do we do about this?” The HRD consultants involved in this work have been exposed to many different approaches and could have selected different approaches. In determining which approaches to use, three criteria were applied.</p>
<list id="list4-1523422313487306" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Will this theory be useful to the problem before us?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Can we apply it?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is the theory consistent with our long-term objectives?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To address the first question, “Will this theory be useful?” there were several additional variables considered. Is it practical? Does the theory lead to obvious action steps? Will the theory help improve the quality of the initiative? Will it be well received by the organization’s existing culture?</p>
<p>Given these variables, AI was an approach with relatively low risk and the potential for the appropriate level of staff engagement in the rearticulation process. It also reinforced the positive aspects of the organization so as to disarm staff from focusing on gaps and negative dynamics. AI had been used in different microsystems within the hospital and had been well received. In addition, the 4-d model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422313487306">Watkins &amp; Mohr, 2001</xref>) gave clear indications of how to begin the work itself.</p>
<p>Whether or not Theory U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer, 2009</xref>) would be useful for the purpose was less clear. As a model, it is very complex and can require significant reflection for appropriate use. In addition, the underlying concepts such as “presencing” would be new to the organization and it was unclear how it would integrate with the culture. The problem that Theory U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer, 2009</xref>) was intended to address, however, was how to make the exercise of the values rearticulation a “deeper” experience that created shifts in understanding. The understanding of the U as a model to slow down and get additional insight provided a useful map. In addition, the levels of listening would help with teaching the values champions how to proceed in the work. Theory U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer, 2009</xref>) also provided a method to ensure a balance between actions and learning as the imbalance between the two dynamics is frequently cited as a problem in action learning interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422313487306">Cho &amp; Egan, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The answer to the second question, “Can we apply it,” also had several variables. One variable was the HRD consultants’ level of skill in using these tools. The two primary consultants had significant experience with AI, and less exposure to Theory U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer, 2009</xref>). Given their transferable experience with other tools and models, they had confidence that they could apply some of the core principles of Theory U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer, 2009</xref>), but did not intend to use it as a complete model for change.</p>
<p>Other variables that were considered were cost and access to resources. In this case, the form of AI used meant that staff could be accessed in small groups at convenient times that were preferable to other large group initiatives that would have required to get the “whole system in the room” (e.g., future search).</p>
<p>For the third question “Is the theory consistent with our long term objectives,” it was important to ensure that the theory modeled the type of culture we were hoping to help create. In this case, the change of the organizational story from “We are losing our soul” to “we are bringing the best of the past into the future” was well served by AI. We would hope, going forward, Children’s would practice the skills of listening and storytelling in diverse situations to address problems.</p>
<p>Theory U as developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer (2009)</xref> was also consistent with the long-term objectives of the organization because it focused on sustainable change. Isolating the values work to a management-only group, or failing to connect with organizational heritage, would have signaled a superficial importance to hospital staff. This approach helped to teach the organization a way to address the challenges that were being created by the growth and changes Children’s was experiencing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-1523422313487306">
<title>Overcoming Obstacles</title>
<p>The second problem, “How can we overcome obstacles and challenges,” also benefited greatly from the application of theory. As demonstrated above, Theory U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer, 2009</xref>) provided an overarching structure for the initiative, but this initial, high-level design assumed the need to adapt as we went along. The details of the listening sessions, for instance, were not clear when the values champions were selected. To help them codesign the process, both Theory U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer, 2009</xref>) and AI provided common language and assumptions that were very useful. Although the values champions depended on the consultants for interpretation of the theories themselves, they quickly became skilled in using them as frameworks for application.</p>
<p>For example, one team used black rocks with single words in metallic pen to highlight what had been learned. This exercise was developed by one of the champions who wanted to provide a moment for quiet reflection that she felt would be consistent with the presencing step in Theory U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Another example of how theory was used to overcome obstacles and challenges was the decision to use an appreciative question to ground the work even though the “presenting problem” was concerned about what was going wrong. The champions were concerned with avoiding an important issue, the negative stories, but seemed to want permission to focus on the positive. AI provided that the permission helped address the sense that not talking about problems was “wrong.”</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section29-1523422313487306">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>We feel this case has several implications for practitioners and scholars alike. As a set of solutions, this approach raises several questions:</p>
<list id="list5-1523422313487306" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What are the consequences of using components of a theory without using the entire framework?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are the consequences of “blending” theories such as appreciative inquiry and Theory U to achieve outcomes?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What role did the consultants’ familiarity with these approaches limit them in their selection?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These are questions the HRD practitioners in this case struggled with throughout the intervention and feel deserve further inquiry from theorists and practitioners alike. For the scholar, specifically, the HRD practitioners used aspects of AI and Theory U to good effect, but what are the implications for theory development if practitioners select to use aspects of a theory, but not another? For the practitioner, if selective in applying aspects of a theory, how can the results of the application be translated and transferred to the scholarly community for further exploration, research, and theory modification?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-1523422313487306" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This case has demonstrated one example of the application of theory to an organizational concern. As an intervention, it was well received by hospital staff and demonstrated leadership’s willingness to address a looming organizational concern while engaging staff in the solution. It also provided an opportunity to reset new language related to shared values and capture the organization’s essence. Employee commitment, as measured by the Employee Opinion Survey increased from 3.97 in 2010 to the score of 4.08 in 2012. This increase was statistically significant. In that period, participation in the survey also increased from 70% to 86% while adding above 800 staff.</p>
<p>Organizational values are acknowledged as critical cultural elements and can serve as a catalyst for organizational change efforts. Children’s Hospital Colorado recognized the utility of extant theories to craft an organizational change effort to reengage staff with the organizational values with the prospect of improving organizational effectiveness.</p>
<p>The HRD practitioners involved in this intervention demonstrated practical use of action learning concepts by synthesizing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313487306">Scharmer’s (2009)</xref> Theory U and AI in the values articulation and culture change efforts. The reformulation effort demonstrates a unique approach to action learning in which empowered staff were able to directly experience and contribute to an organizational culture change effort. Although the outcome of the change effort is not yet fully realized, it has set the stage for further culture and systems changes.</p>
