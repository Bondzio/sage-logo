<body>
<p>Auditory neuropathy (AN) is an otologic syndrome characterized by normal otoacoustic emissions and altered or absent auditory evoked potentials in patients with moderate to profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).</p>
<p>Patients with AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) can develop SNHL secondary to tumors, ototoxicity, and/or opportunistic infections. In addition, the AIDS virus is known to cause direct damage to the cochlear nerve.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812442488">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cryptococcal central nervous system (CNS) infection can present as sudden or progressive SNHL. Moreover, SNHL can be the first symptom of cryptococcal infection. A high index of suspicion is necessary when dealing with an immunocompromised patient. Treatment is directed toward the infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812442488">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812442488">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Auditory neuropathy due to cryptococcal meningitis has not been described yet, but temporal bone studies have demonstrated direct damage to the cochlear nerve by cryptococcal infiltration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812442488">2</xref></sup> In addition, Maslan et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812442488">3</xref></sup> suggested a retrocochlear lesion in a patient with sudden hearing loss and cryptococcal meningitis. We present 2 cases with diagnosis of AN secondary to cryptococcal infection.</p>
<sec id="section1-0194599812442488">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>A 31-year-old man started with a 1-month history of rapidly progressive SNHL. A diagnosis of AIDS was made 1 month previously, and antiretroviral therapy was started simultaneously. He developed meningeal symptoms and was hospitalized. Institutional review board (IRB) approval and patient informed consent were obtained. A lumbar puncture showed an increased opening pressure. China ink stained positive for a <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> infection. Computed tomography (CT) scan was normal, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed areas of hyperintensity in white matter in a T2 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812442488"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Therapy was initiated with amphotericin (1230 mg accumulative dose) and fluconazol (400 mg qid). During hospitalization, audiological tests revealed no hearing in the right ear and left mild SNHL; acoustic reflexes were negative. The patient fulfilled criteria of AN with preserved bilateral otoacoustic emissions and no auditory evoked potentials in the right ear. Because later he developed CNS vasculitis, steroids were administered for 2 months in a reductive dose.</p>

<p>Magnetic resonance imaging of the first patient with cryptococcal infection and AIDS showed areas of hyperintensity in white matter, predominantly in the caudate and lenticular nucleus (T2 sequence). There were no pathological findings in the cerebellopontine angle. Also, no reinforcement was found with gadolinium contrast. Asterisks represent the areas of hyperintensity in the white matter due to cryptococcal infection.</p>

</fig>
<p>Hearing improvement was registered 5 months after the episode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812442488"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>); stapedial reflexes also were now positive. The patient had no viral human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) load detectable in plasma and had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) negative cultures at the end of treatment. Fluconazol was continued for 10 months. Currently, the patient has no evidence of disease.</p>

<p>The follow-up audiometry performed on the first case showed hearing recovery after cryptococcal infection treatment.</p>

<title>Case 2</title>
<p>The second case was a 27-year-old man with a diagnosis of cerebral cryptococcosis secondary to idiopathic CD4 lymphopenia. HIV infection was ruled out. He started with a 2-week course of fever, abdominal pain, and intense headache. Soon after hospitalization, he developed bilateral sudden SNHL. Institutional review board approval was obtained. An India ink stain and antigen determination obtained through a lumbar puncture revealed a cryptococcal infection. Audiometry showed bilateral profound SNHL, with normal otoacoustic emissions and absent bilateral auditory evoked potentials. The MRI was normal. The patient died soon after due to underlying disease.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Auditory neuropathy is defined as sensorineural hearing loss, present otoacoustic emissions, abnormal/absent evoked potentials, poor speech perception, and absent acoustic reflexes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812442488">4</xref></sup> and it is a syndrome frequently described in children. The etiology of auditory neuropathy is diverse: perinatal risk factors such as hypoxia, hyperbilirubinemia, infection, prematurity, or genetic predisposition are some of the causes mentioned in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812442488">4</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is an encapsulated yeast found in dust and bird droppings. Infection is acquired through inhalation of spores. In patients with AIDS, the most common presentation is meningoencephalitis. Cryptococcal meningitis presents with sensorineural hearing loss in 18% to 30% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812442488">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812442488">3</xref></sup> Furthermore, a temporal bone study demonstrated direct damage to the vestibular and cochlear nerves in a patient with bilateral sudden hearing loss and cryptococcal infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812442488">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our study, 1 patient had reversible SNHL with early cryptococcal treatment. The use of corticosteroids is controversial, but our patient developed CNS vasculitis that facilitated their prescription. Antiretroviral therapy has increased the life span of patients with AIDS, and improving quality of life through useful hearing has become a new goal.</p>
<p>We have presented 2 cases with immunodeficiency, cryptococcal meningitis, and auditory neuropathy. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show this association. Team work is needed with communicable disease and neurology departments for the treatment of these patients. Neoplasms such as Hodgkin lymphoma, ototoxicity, and opportunistic infections should be ruled out when faced with an immunocompromised patient with SNHL. Hearing loss can be the first manifestation of an underlying cryptococcal infection.</p>
