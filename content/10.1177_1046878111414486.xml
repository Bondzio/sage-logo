<abstract>
<p>The growing need for intercultural literacy in an increasingly interconnected and computer-mediated world contrasts with the dearth of investigation in best practices when designing simulations aimed at improving intercultural communication. Synthetic cultures inspired by real-world cultural traits, problem-based learning, and a social constructivist theoretical base represent core components of immersive learning environments designed to improve intercultural literacy. Through an analysis of the literature, a model is proposed primarily to promote discussion and debate about intercultural simulations. The Model for Intercultural Communication in Simulations asserts that along with those components, the Experiential Learning Cycle (ELC), natural decision making, and <italic>third place</italic> thinking form an approach in understanding how intercultural simulations should be designed. The Model for Intercultural Communication in Simulations challenges the learner to move beyond known paradigms and encourages simulation and e-learning designers to employ socially situated contexts. Accordingly, within the context of the model, a culminating evaluation of an online intercultural training simulation (<italic>ARGONAUTONLINE</italic>) follows the introduction of the model.</p>

<p>Given the increasing demand to communicate successfully with diverse linguistic and cultural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1046878111414486">Banks &amp; McGee-Banks, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1046878111414486">Shachaf &amp; Hara, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1046878111414486">Thomas, Kinast, &amp; Schroll-Machl, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1046878111414486">B. E. Wiggins, 2010</xref>), intercultural training is an essential tool for anyone hoping to work and interact successfully on the global stage. Although learning foreign languages is often challenging and seemingly insurmountable for some, intercultural training can provide you with the critical edge necessary for success in any area.</p>
<p>Several intercultural training initiatives originally emerged as a response to a perceived lack in cultural awareness or simply as preparation for interacting with culturally diverse individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1046878111414486">Landis, Bennett, &amp; Bennett, 2004</xref>). Such endeavors often involve simulating an interaction or prompting the participant to react in such a way to invoke movement from a familiar paradigm toward acknowledgment of a different cultural construct. For example, let us assume that someone was having trouble understanding why some cultures seem to prefer direct communication and others indirect. A simulation presents a context for the learner, which the learner applies to previous experiences as well as to potentially new ones. In this scenario, the simulation might include a presentation of high- and low-context cultures. Such a simulation would benefit from the use of synthetic cultures; this argument is central to this article.</p>
<p>Intercultural training is rooted in traditions focused on understanding differences in perception of the real world and how communication is interpreted through culturally constructed frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1046878111414486">Jandt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1046878111414486">Trompenaars &amp; Hampden-Turner, 1998</xref>). Simulations represent a vehicle whereby such complex abstractions may be conveyed in ways that promote the realization of one’s own cultural constructs and limitations, and they may help to produce the first crucial step in becoming interculturally literate.</p>
<p>Culture can be conceptually complex and abstract, even for those who share the same one. An approach to improving intercultural literacy is to educate the learner on the intricacies of a given national, regional, or local culture. Another approach is to present a synthesis; synthetic cultures are drawn from real cultures, but are not obviously linked to national, regional, or local cultures. This article is poised to present synthetic cultures not in a new light, but as a tenable resource to understand culture unmasked. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1046878111414486">Fowler and Pusch (2010)</xref> recently reminded us, the 21st century has not as yet seen any new or original development in the area of intercultural simulation games. They note that synthetic cultures, as articulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1046878111414486">Geert Jan Hofstede, Paul Pedersen, and Geert Hofstede (2002)</xref> and earlier by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1046878111414486">Hofstede and Pedersen (1999)</xref>, are the most promising solutions, perhaps due to their intrinsic theoretical value as Triandis argues in the foreword of their book <italic>Exploring Culture: Exercises, Stories and Synthetic Cultures</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1046878111414486">(2002), Hofstede, Pedersen, and Hofstede</xref>, published by Intercultural Press. Synthetic cultures should not replace the use of national cultures in intercultural training. However, to become interculturally literate, it seems logical to include cultural knowledge that is specific to cultural tendencies as opposed to stereotyping or generalizing about entire national cultures. Such approaches that involve stereotypes or generalizations, although potentially beneficial for the quick and easy fix sought by newcomers, can prove harmful if only for the inclusion or implication of cultural categories.</p>
<p>This discussion presents a number of valuable aspects of training simulations designed to improve intercultural literacy. After a series of relevant terms are introduced, the discussion turns to the significance of metaphor in intercultural training as it pertains to simulations. Following this is a review of the literature on nondigital and digital simulations created to promote intercultural awareness and literacy. Subsequently, a model is presented to address key attributes of effective intercultural simulations. The rationale behind the model is to encourage debate on the matter of desired components of simulations and games designed to improve intercultural literacy. The primary perspective of this article is that simulations that rely on experiential, performative, and problem-based models and that incorporate synthetic cultures are effective tools in improving and enhancing intercultural communication.</p>

However, it is important to note that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1046878111414486">Hofstede and Hofstede (2005)</xref>present a similar dichotomy between the values and practices of a particular culture. This is discussed further in a subsequent section on metaphor.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section1-1046878111414486">
<title>Significance of Metaphor in Intercultural Communication</title>
<p>A series of metaphors are often employed in intercultural training solutions to demonstrate the complexities of cultural nuances. These metaphors are relevant to this discussion given their ability to explain complex ideas. Metaphors are composed of two elements; the first element is the subject to which attributes are assigned and the second is the subject from which the attributes are taken. Metaphorical language is present in allegories, parables, and catachresis to communicate how one thing shares certain traits, either literally or figuratively, with another thing. Extrapolated to simulations, metaphors seek to represent something which is abstract by simulating it as something that is accessible, known, and/or familiar.</p>
<sec id="section2-1046878111414486">
<title>The Iceberg Metaphor</title>
<p>Four common metaphors in the area of intercultural training, along with a relatively new metaphor, are included in the discussion for the purposes of communicating contextual clarity about their usefulness in simulations created to improve intercultural literacy. The iceberg metaphor is perhaps the most commonly used to visually express the difference between surface and deep culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1046878111414486">Rimmington &amp; Alagic, 2008</xref>). The iceberg portion above the water symbolizes surface culture; deep culture is the part of the iceberg concealed by water.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1046878111414486">
<title>The Onion Metaphor</title>
<p>Perhaps equally common is the onion metaphor. The multilayered complexity of culture is akin if only in form to an onion; one must <italic>peel back</italic> layers of visible actions to reveal value-laden meaning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1046878111414486">Hofstede and Hofstede (2005)</xref>, in <italic>Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind</italic>, use the onion to present a distinction between the practices and values of a given culture. Specifically, although an outsider sees or observes cultural practices, only the insider understands their cultural meaning (similar to the emic-etic distinction in linguistics and anthropology). They argue further that values are at the core of culture. These are acquired early in an individual’s life and represent general preferences of living.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1046878111414486">
<title>The Genealogical Tree and Rhizome Metaphor</title>
<p>The genealogical tree metaphor signifies a diverse lineage tracing back to a common root culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1046878111414486">Deleuze, Guattari, &amp; Massumi, 1988</xref>). Similarly, the rhizome metaphor portrays culture as a tangled, proliferating growth lacking a clear beginning or end and containing within its countless connections and depth unceasing opportunities for interaction among elements of the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1046878111414486">Clarke, 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1046878111414486">
<title>The Cage Metaphor</title>
<p>The cage metaphor is a relatively new addition to metaphors that clarify the abstractness of intercultural nuances. It implies a dialogic framing of perception and meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1046878111414486">Rimmington &amp; Alagic, 2008</xref>). The adoption of multifaceted (as opposed to limited) perspectives is contingent on the realization of one’s own cultural constraints and how they affect perception.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1046878111414486">
<title>A Common Trait</title>
<p>Subtle differences and similarities present themselves across these metaphors. Their most common trait is the ability to convey visually the abstract notion that culture is a collection of experiences and ways to perceiving reality from the standpoint of the individual. Intercultural simulations must achieve the same outcome. Sharing a similar capacity to demystify the abstraction that permeates cultural complexity, synthetic cultures must be taken into serious consideration when designing simulations and games that are used to improve intercultural literacy and communication.</p>

<title>The Synthetic and the National: Cultural Representation in Intercultural Simulations</title>
<p>Simulations designed to educate individuals about the complexities of intercultural communication tend to recreate either synthetic or national cultures. Although synthetic cultures permit some generalizability, national cultures rely on familiar constructs. Advantages, disadvantages, and applications of both are presented along with a discussion of how one particular simulation employed synthetic cultures embedded with cultural characteristics of real-world national cultures.</p>
<sec id="section8-1046878111414486">
<title>Culture of Choice: Synthetic Versus National</title>
<p>Incorporating a synthetic culture into an intercultural simulation represents a conscious effort to provide learners with an opportunity to explore intercultural dimensions. Accordingly, an advantage of synthetic cultures is the inherent lack of stereotypes and prejudices associated with an individual’s perception of national cultures. Several nondigital intercultural simulations have traditionally referred to national cultures with which learners interact in a real-world setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1046878111414486">Fowler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1046878111414486">Hofstede &amp; Pedersen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1046878111414486">Jameson, 1993</xref>). Learners using such simulations engage themselves with familiar cultures. Proponents of digital and nondigital simulations posit that the added benefit of national cultures is the authenticity of the simulated event regulated by its inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1046878111414486">Fowler, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1046878111414486">Lambertini &amp; ten Thije, 2004</xref>). The rationale to use national cultures in simulations is evidenced by a desire to mimic that which individuals can anticipate in a real context. Consequently, an objective for realism should guide the creation of intercultural training simulations, whether they use synthetic or national cultures. However, synthetic cultures do not necessarily imply that the simulated situation would lack a sense of realism. Indeed, using synthetic cultures in simulations entails benefits as well.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1046878111414486">
<title>The Persistent Value of Synthetic Cultures</title>
<p>The argument for using synthetic cultures is increasingly relevant today given the global growth of virtual worlds and increasing opportunities for virtual collaboration in areas such as business, education, entertainment and edutainment, and government. Initially, the use of synthetic cultures in nondigital learning simulations supported this argument. However, synthetic cultures are equally effective in digital simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1046878111414486">Ahamer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1046878111414486">Klinge et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As a result of its newness, synthetic cultures represent an unfamiliar paradigm thereby urging learners to move beyond familiar methods for working with other cultures. Thus, synthetic cultures enable individuals to interact intuitively with people from other cultures due to the learning experiences drawn from working with synthetic cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1046878111414486">Fowler &amp; Pusch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1046878111414486">Hofstede &amp; Pedersen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1046878111414486">Jameson, 1993</xref>). This differs from the case to integrate national cultures. Synthetic cultures identify characteristics of national cultures instead of incorporating whole national cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1046878111414486">Lambertini &amp; ten Thije, 2004</xref>). For these reasons, synthetic cultures are restricted to the confines of the simulation or game in which players and learners interact with them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1046878111414486">
<title>The Challenge Posed by a Synthetic Culture</title>
<p>Synthetic cultures represent an opportunity for learners to generalize their simulated experiences to a larger number of possible interactions. In addition, synthetic cultures encourage individuals to explore their own cultural constraints without the distasteful inclusion of personal bias or stereotyping that may occur when considering another national culture. Accordingly, generalizing aids in the realization that (a) cultural values are necessarily relative and (b) underlying differences outnumber those which can be perceived at the surface level. Synthetic cultures in simulations enable individuals to take risks, which may not be possible or advisable when interacting with national cultures in real life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1046878111414486">Hofstede &amp; Pedersen, 1999</xref>). Conflict may arise in simulations involving national cultures given that the learners would rely on known paradigms without realizing their cultural constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1046878111414486">Antal &amp; Friedman, 2008</xref>). Although it remains important to gain an understanding of differences among national cultures, especially in business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1046878111414486">Beamer &amp; Varner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1046878111414486">Jameson, 2007</xref>), synthetic cultures in simulations offer an opportunity to rehearse and perform, almost theatrically, that which may occur in a real setting, but without the presence of cultural bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1046878111414486">Fowler, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1046878111414486">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1046878111414486">Jameson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1046878111414486">Phipps &amp; St. Clair, 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section11-1046878111414486">
<title>A Cross-Comparison of Synthetic Cultures</title>
<p>BAFA BAFA, BARNGA, MINORIA-MAJORIA, and CULTURE AWARENESS TRAINING (CAT) are several simulation and game learning solutions that incorporate synthetic cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1046878111414486">Chapel &amp; Martin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1046878111414486">Fowler, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1046878111414486">Klinge et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1046878111414486">Koskinen, Abdelhamid, &amp; Likitalo, 2008</xref>). MINORIA-MAJORIA is focused primarily on economic features of a dyadic relationship whereby one individual or group is wealthier than the other. In BAFA BAFA, learners are split into dichotomous groups of Alphans and Betans, each with its own unique culture, nonverbal language, and ways of interpreting communication. At the core of BARNGA is an opportunity for learners to uncover new solutions to unfamiliar problems brought about by a form of nonverbal communication, similar to BAFA BAFA. The chief difference between these three simulations and the digital CAT is the designation <italic>synthetic</italic>. Although the three previously described simulations enable learners to explore culture and communication without deferring to known cultural paradigms (such as focusing on perceived or expected differences between Japanese and Portuguese), they lack the theoretical base inherent in the synthetic cultures in CAT. In addition to these, other simulations and games with cross-cultural or intercultural subject matter, but which may not incorporate synthetic cultures, include the following: AFTER NAFTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1046878111414486">Butler, 1996</xref>), THE UNIVERSITY GAME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1046878111414486">Damron &amp; Halleck, 2007</xref>), CALDER CONNECTIONS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1046878111414486">Fowler, 2003</xref>), and KNOWLEDGE SHARING SIMULATION GAME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1046878111414486">Oertig, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Importance of Theory, Social Constructivism, and Problems in Simulations</title>
<p>The combination of experiential, situated, and problem-based learning in concert with incorporating synthetic cultures may result in a thoroughly effective multimodal tool to promote and sustain intercultural literacy. CAT is examined below in greater detail and accompanies a discussion of the Experiential Learning Cycle (ELC). The importance of social constructivism in designing simulations is investigated along with the value of role-play and problem-based learning. These concepts are necessary in simulations designed to improve intercultural literacy as they provide a contextualized environment wherein deep learning can take place. This section describes the theoretical basis for the formulation of the Model for Intercultural Communication in Simulations to be articulated in greater detail below.</p>
<sec id="section13-1046878111414486">
<title>The Role of Theory and National Culture Traits</title>
<p>Synthetic cultures are most effective given a theoretical base in real-world, national cultures. The theoretical structure of CAT, its inclusion of synthetic cultures based on the traits within national culture characteristics, and its digital nature present a new solution to intercultural training needs. Two fundamental features of CAT deserve explicit mention. First, the didactic architecture of CAT is based on the ELC, first proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1046878111414486">D. A. Kolb (1984)</xref> and discussed further in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1046878111414486">Baker, Jensen, and Kolb (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1046878111414486">Kayes, Kayes, and Kolb (2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1046878111414486">2005b</xref>). ELC posits four stages of learning whereby an actual (or concrete) experience is integrated into a process of subsequent stages signified by the collection of information about the experience, reflection, and the testing of learned information in a new experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1046878111414486">Becker, 2007</xref>, p. 40). The second feature of CAT is its inclusion of national culture characteristics embedded into synthetic cultures created for the simulation. Each synthetic culture within CAT is based on one of the four cultural dimensions first proposed by Geert Hofstede in his seminal work done with International Business Machines (IBM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1046878111414486">Hofstede, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1046878111414486">Klinge et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The relevance of CAT to this discussion is twofold. Using synthetic cultures in experiential learning is beneficial and convenient given the <italic>digital</italic> version. In their study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1046878111414486">Klinge et al. (2009)</xref> test both digital and nondigital versions of CAT to find that the digital variant was equally valuable when compared with the traditional simulation game. CAT represents the advantage of experiential learning within the context of promoting improved intercultural literacy in a simulation or game. However, while situated learning is present in CAT, problem-based learning appears to be an additional feature of effective simulations and one lacking in CAT.</p>

<sec id="section14-1046878111414486">
<title>Constructivist Elements</title>
<p>Constructivism is applicable to improving intercultural literacy within simulations given that informational communication technologies and three-dimensional online learning systems can facilitate learning without the restrictions of prearranged facts and responses. In addition, these systems promote an environment wherein individuals and groups communicate and interact equally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1046878111414486">Jones &amp; Bronack, 2007</xref>, p. 92; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1046878111414486">Szkudlarek, 2009</xref>, p. 978). Noted recently by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1046878111414486">Lainema (2009)</xref>, constructivism should be seen as a set of design principles and not as an articulate learning theory. Thus, simulations and games designed to improve intercultural literacy should incorporate constructivist principles.</p>
<p>Social constructivism posits that thinking and learning are rooted in societal and environmental frameworks. Furthermore, it suggests that the process of knowing supersedes any anticipated results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1046878111414486">Bélisle, 2008</xref>). Situated cognition is learning as a result of communication or engagement with many human agents and processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1046878111414486">Rimmington &amp; Alagic, 2008</xref>, p. 77). This remains applicable when learning is seen as a process occurring when learners work on authentic tasks carried out in the real world. It implies that learning strategies embedded in authentic situations are necessary for deep learning. Such learning occurs if embedded in the proper social or physical context. Linked to this idea of the social context is the way simulations and games enable systemic learning.</p>

<title>Learning and Systemic Knowledge</title>
<p>Simulation games mirror the way in which the mind visualizes situations and potential interactions, but also promote better learning given their ability to teach systemically. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1046878111414486">Gee (2007)</xref> notes in <italic>Good Video Games + Good Learning</italic> that simulations are built to provide a sense of how things work in the real world. They allow an individual to practice certain actions in a safe environment and to learn the consequences of such actions before trying them in real life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1046878111414486">Gee, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1046878111414486">2005</xref>). Simulations and games also show players (learners) the goals that they should be attempting to achieve. In this way, the mind works like a simulation. We think about the various actions we could take in a given situation, estimate the outcomes, and choose the one that best helps us accomplish our goals. Individuals learn skills, strategies, and ideas when they see how these fit into a larger system to which they give meaning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1046878111414486">Hofstede, de Caluwé, and Peters (2010)</xref> echo this sentiment in stating that simulation games provide opportunities for the development of systemic knowledge especially when participants can use the simulation to try out new approaches or changes. Role-play represents a key area to explore such approaches or changes and is discussed next.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1046878111414486">
<title>Playing the Role</title>
<p>Participants in a digital simulation interacting with synthetic cultures should possess some knowledge about the subject in the simulation and should have some preparation prior to starting the role-play. As mentioned above, using synthetic cultures in simulations prevents participants from deferring to known stereotypes specific to a national culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1046878111414486">Rimmington &amp; Alagic, 2008</xref>, p. 41). However, effective role-play necessitates some specific prior information about the simulated subject; otherwise, the participant may not be able to become engaged with the synthetic cultures in the simulation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1046878111414486">Rehberger (2006)</xref> posits four stages to maximize the utility of an educational simulation employing role-play as a core component. These four stages (readiness, roles, reaction, and reflection) share some similarity in design and definition with the four phases of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1046878111414486">D. A. Kolb’s (1984)</xref> ELC. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1046878111414486">Crookall and Thorngate (2009)</xref> highlight the capacity of simulations and games to give the participant an opportunity to reflect on the simulated experience. For the intercultural simulation, introducing cultural dimensions to participants may serve to educate them about specific cultural traits to be included in the simulation. Prior information provides a context of familiarity whereby the learner is able to participate actively in the role-play, and it connects to the first parts of both Rehberger’s and Kolb’s constructs. Although this introduces some familiarity with the situation, the simulation still challenges learners given that the synthetic cultures only integrate partial characteristics of national cultures. Moreover, the <italic>simulated</italic> becomes <italic>real</italic> for the learner when some amount of prior preparation about the role and the situational environment is presented on starting the simulation. Prior preparation would only accompany the initial stage of the simulation.</p>
<p>Intercultural simulations that employ role-play as part of a decision-making training exercise assist participants to learn the context and culture of the simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1046878111414486">Hofstede &amp; Pedersen, 1999</xref>). Thus, when learners lack information about subsequent simulated situations, they can make decisions based on the learning that occurred in the previous socially situated context of the simulation.</p>

<sec id="section17-1046878111414486">
<title>The Value of Problems</title>
<p>Another relevant contribution of constructivism to simulations gauged at improving intercultural literacy is problem-based learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1046878111414486">Diehl and Prins (2008)</xref> note that individuals enjoy learning about how others generate solutions to problems in the multicultural setting of <italic>Second Life</italic> (SL). However, other research suggests that embedding problems within simulations aid in active and collaborative learning. Furthermore, collaborative learning helps to establish the learners’ perspectives on intercultural matters as they pertain to the context of the simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1046878111414486">Bélisle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1046878111414486">Saatci, 2008</xref>). Although problem-based learning is apparently advantageous in improving intercultural communication in simulations and other e-learning endeavors, it is limited in application and deserves greater consideration when creating future simulations. Case studies often form the content of intercultural training simulations in lieu of problem-based learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1046878111414486">Saatci, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1046878111414486">Tjie, 2002</xref>). Although these are valuable tools, problem-based experiential learning challenges learners to explore new solutions to familiar problems or those that learners have not previously experienced.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1046878111414486">
<title><italic>SL</italic> and Intercultural Learning</title>
<p>As discussed above, intercultural literacy has been defined as the result of acknowledging that culture is not a rigid, unchanging entity. Effective intercultural learning is the sum of previous experiences and is developed through new interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1046878111414486">Heyward, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, intercultural literacy is the result of operating in a socially supportive context wherein collaboration is emphasized over rivalry. However, it must be noted that cross-cultural involvement does not necessarily lead to a yearning for further cross-cultural experiences. Moreover, cross-cultural contact does not lead to or create intercultural literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1046878111414486">Diehl &amp; Prins, 2008</xref>). In their study of <italic>SL</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1046878111414486">Diehl and Prins (2008)</xref> assert that SL has the potential to serve as a useful tool to promote and teach intercultural literacy. However, SL is embedded and architecturally designed with cultural elements unique to Linden Labs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1046878111414486">McMinn, 2009</xref>). As such, it is a technological, structural, and cultural pastiche requiring further inquiry before we advance the notion that it serves as a medium for the enhancement of intercultural literacy. SL notwithstanding, it is imperative that we present models of ideal design as to the components of any simulation or game that aims to advance intercultural literacy and communication.</p>

<p>The ability for individuals to gain awareness of their own culture and how it aids the perception of other cultural traditions should be a desired outcome of simulations that are designed to improve intercultural literacy.

<title>Conceptual Framework: Social Constructivism</title>
<p>Social constructivism belongs in the conceptual framework given its assertion that thinking and learning should be rooted in societal and environmental frameworks. When learners work on authentic tasks carried out in the simulated real world, learning strategies embedded in these situations lead to deep learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1046878111414486">Bélisle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1046878111414486">Vygotsky, 1978</xref>).

<title>Conceptual Framework: Systemic Knowledge, Good Learning, and Empowered Learners</title>
<p>Good simulations use technologies that illuminate how the human mind works, and they incorporate sound learning principles. Simulations often evoke a sense of how things work and interrelate in the real world. They allow the learner to test one’s actions in a safe environment and also to learn the consequences before using them in real life. Simulations also help to demonstrate to players the goals for which they should strive or at least attempt to do so. Thus, the mind works like a simulation game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1046878111414486">Gee, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1046878111414486">2007</xref>). We think about the various actions we could take in a situation, estimate the outcomes, and choose the one that best helps us accomplish our goals. People learn skills, strategies, and ideas when they see how they fit into a larger system to which they give meaning. Put simply, one should be able to see the pieces that make up the puzzle as well as to see the puzzle as a cohesive structure of puzzle pieces.</p>
<sec id="section23-1046878111414486">
<title>Conceptual Framework: Recognition Primed Decision (RPD)</title>
<p>Given that intercultural exchanges are accompanied by variables such as time constraints and stressful environments where not all information is available, inclusion of the RPD model is advisable when conceptualizing intercultural simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1046878111414486">Salas, Rosen, Held, &amp; Weissmuller, 2008</xref>). It is an extension of natural decision making and is useful in simulations whose purpose is to simulate situations where the individual must rely on logic and experience to generate complex decisions made in potentially stressful and risk-prone environments. This is especially the case when all information needed to make a decision is not available. Thus, these are the formative elements of the model’s conceptual framework.</p>

To be interculturally literate implies experience with individuals of other linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Consequently, the focus of simulations aimed at improving this skill must be on learners within the context of experience. Furthermore, placing the focus on human and social experience gives the participant greater “control over the content and form of the simulation events and evolution” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1046878111414486">Crookall, Martin, Saunders, &amp; Coote, 1986</xref>, p. 356).</p>

<title>Conceptual Framework: Third Place Thinking</title>
<p>Recalling the cage metaphor, third place thinking refers to thinking in terms of the ability to observe one’s own cage, or interpretive frame for understanding real-world input, while observing another’s cage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1046878111414486">Rimmington &amp; Alagic, 2008</xref>). The <italic>third place</italic> is essentially that space which emerges from successful communication of two or more viewpoints between interlocutors representing different cultural perspectives.

</sec>
<sec id="section26-1046878111414486">
<title>Simulated Content</title>
<p>The content of the simulation may integrate synthetic or national cultures, or both depending on the needs of the learners. Synthetic cultures offer the following advantages:</p>
<list id="list2-1046878111414486" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>generalizability,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the implied need for learners to be intuitive,</p></list-item>

<p>However, the rationale to use national over synthetic cultures in a simulation may be due to individual needs for quick solutions to short-term problems. In any case, role-play and problem-based learning should form the essentials of the simulated content.</p>

<title>Reflection</title>
<p>Although these elements are integral parts of <italic>this</italic> model, it is important to note that as a model, it requires testing and scrutiny. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1046878111414486">Lederman (1992)</xref> emphasizes the importance of debriefing for experientially based learning. She presents a model for the debriefing process, which contains a similar structure to many instructional design models (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1046878111414486">G. Wiggins &amp; McTighe, 2005</xref>) that analyze and examine the learning objective, consider the confines of the situation, review strategies selected and implemented, and evaluate the experience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1046878111414486">Oertig (2010)</xref> also underlines the importance of debriefing and presents an approach to using the Moodle learning management system as a forum to debrief students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1046878111414486">Crookall (2010)</xref> highlights the perilous dearth of debriefing in the simulation and gaming field, but acknowledges that some scholarship in the areas has begun to discuss debriefing. These insightful contributions stress the importance of debriefing in simulation games. For the model presented in this article, it is imperative that a debriefing occur once a given intercultural simulation has concluded. A worthy choice is Lederman’s Model of Systematic Assessment of the Debriefing Process. The Model for Intercultural Communication in Simulations as presented in this article is a critical attempt in the beginning of the 21st century to promote discussion and debate on issues of intercultural training, awareness, and communication. It has been created based on the theoretical underpinnings present in the literature. It is essential to test this model in some capacity provided proper debriefing is not ignored.

<p>It is essential to analyze at least one currently available simulation or game designed to improve intercultural literacy. For this purpose, the author explored several possibilities, including contacting companies that have an e-learning design department or branch (Nogginlabs, Educational Management Corporation, etc.), corporations that offer intercultural training (Kwintessential, etc.), and universities with an instructional design program. Despite numerous attempts to gain access to online intercultural training simulations, the author was successful in only one endeavor.

<p>By extension, situational and problem-based approaches could be used to solidify conceptually the perceptual differences in time across cultures. Participants could then be prompted to suggest the national cultures with which they have experienced such differences, if any experience exists.

<p>For the concepts demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1046878111414486">Figure 6</xref>, the use of national cultures in an intercultural simulation appears constructive for two reasons. First, it encourages participants to question conceptually how they understand time relative to other cultures. Second, the participants of this simulation likely seek a quick fix to a perceived problem in successful intercultural communication, as surmised above.</p>
<p>A recent research study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1046878111414486">B. E. Wiggins (2011)</xref> presents new information about differences in temporal perception due to preexisting linguistic representations. The results show that the cultural background of simulation or e-learning designers may impact the design of instructional content. Results indicated that the use of a linear (left to right) way of explaining time was not as effective for collectivist students as compared to individualist students. The reason for the difference is likely due to the way native speakers of Chinese (which formed the majority of the collectivist sample) conceptualize time. As noted previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1046878111414486">Boroditsky (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1046878111414486">Fuhrman and Boroditsky (2010)</xref>, Chinese speakers possess both vertical and horizontal cognitive metaphors for time; native speakers of English by comparison only possess horizontal metaphors for time.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Simulations that rely on experiential, performative, and problem-based models, incorporating synthetic and national cultures, seem to be effective tools in improving and enhancing intercultural literacy. However, and as the above analysis and discussion have shown, practical application of national cultures in a simulation appears to have both merits and drawbacks. Perhaps a merging of synthetic and national cultures in a simulation would be effective given an inductive approach at educating participants about nuances of intercultural communication. The ARGONAUTONLINE simulation screenshots did not explicitly suggest the inclusion of neither the RPD Model nor the ELC. Nevertheless, from the little content present in the screenshots, it appears that participants of the ARGONAUTONLINE simulation would likely be expected to make decisions based on less than desirable information.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that a more thorough evaluation of several intercultural e-learning simulations and games was not possible. One may argue that the assessment of the ARGONAUTONLINE simulation is not sufficient to measure the model presented in this article. However, the point of the Model for Intercultural Communication in Simulations, as previously mentioned, is first to promote discussion and debate, but should also act as a design model for simulations whose participants should gain a deeper intercultural literacy. The model is rich in theory; the next step is development and testing.</p>
<p>The model presented in this article is an attempt to promote discussion and debate in designing simulations for intercultural literacy. The Model for Intercultural Communication in Simulations does not contend to be perfect; however, it posits that its core elements should be present in an intercultural simulation educating learners to become more adept at communicating within the complex structures created by linguistic and cultural diversity in an increasingly interconnected and computer-mediated world.</p>
