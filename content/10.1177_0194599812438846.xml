<title>Objective</title>
<p>It is well known that the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses affect the acoustic characteristics of the voice as resonators. Any expansion in nasal valve area, the narrowest segment of the nasal cavity, affects the nasal resistance and therefore has the potential to alter the nasalance. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of nasal valve changes on nasalance of the voice by using an external nasal dilator strip that widens the nasal valve area.</p>

<p>The nasal valve has the smallest cross-sectional area in the nasal passage and is the most important region determining upper respiratory tract resistance during nasal respiration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812438846">1</xref></sup> It is responsible for approximately 50% of total upper respiratory tract resistance by itself.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812438846">2</xref></sup> Even small stenoses that are not noticed during rhinoscopic examination of the region have been reported to cause significant increase in nasal resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812438846">3</xref></sup> Nasal dilator strips widen the nasal valve region sideways and increase nasal lateral wall stability. They are known to increase the volume of the nasal valve area and decrease the nasal airflow resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812438846">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812438846"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812438846">6</xref></sup> This effect is reported to continue for at least 8 hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812438846">7</xref></sup> The raw sound that develops with the passage of air originating from the lungs and passing through the larynx takes its final form with the effect of the supraglottic resonator and articulator structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812438846">8</xref></sup> The velopharyngeal structures close while vowels are formed, and the sound is created in the oral cavity. There is no closure at the velopharyngeal level while nasal consonants are being formed, and the nasal cavity plays a role as an additional resonant region. Voice production is mostly under the effect of the nasal cavity when using the “m” and “n” sounds in Turkish. Obstructions that increase the nasal cavity resistance and cause the sound to be directed toward the oral cavity decrease or eliminate the effect of the nasal cavity in the development of nasal sounds and lead to a hyponasal voice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812438846">9</xref></sup> Measuring the voice energy separately in the oral and nasal cavities during speech by nasometry enables the calculation of the nasalance as the ratio between these 2 values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812438846">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The importance of the nasal valve region for nasal functions is well known. However, there are only a few studies on the effect of the nasal valve on voice quality. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the effects of the volumetric changes of the nasal valve region, the narrowest part of the nasal cavity, on nasalance by using nasal dilator strips.</p>
<sec id="section7-0194599812438846" sec-type="methods">
<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>This study was performed at a tertiary university hospital from April to June 2011. The study protocol was approved by the local ethical committee of Gulhane Military Medical Faculty. Twenty-five consecutive healthy volunteer male subjects (mean age 22.8 ± 1.9 years) who had no nasal or voice-related complaints were enrolled into this before-and-after study. Anterior rhinoscopic and endoscopic nasal and laryngeal examinations were performed, and patients with any pathological findings such as infections, polyps, or benign lesions were excluded from the study. Acoustic rhinometry and nasometry measurements were performed first to obtain baseline data. A nasal strip was applied immediately after the premeasurements were completed, and the measurements were repeated while wearing the external nasal dilator strip. The patients were asked to rate the improvement in nasal breathing from 1 to 10 on a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS). The measurements were consecutive and completed within a short time. Nasal decongestion was therefore not used because no mucosal change-related effect was expected. All measurements were made by the same person in a room free of ambient sound that could affect the results.</p>
<p>Acoustic rhinometry measurements were made separately for each nasal cavity by the Eccovision Acoustic Rhinometry system (Hod Laboratories Inc, Pembroke, Massachusetts). The device was calibrated before the test as recommended by the manufacturer. A suitable nasal adaptor was selected for each nostril, and gel was applied to the edges while ensuring it did not go into the inside section of the nasal adaptor. The cases were seated upright and facing forward with the head supported from behind. Information was provided about the test, and the patients were asked to sit still, not swallow, and hold their breath after exhaling half of it. The wave tube with a suitable adaptor attached to its end was placed with its axis parallel to the dorsum nasi. Care was taken not to disturb the anatomic structure of the nasal valve region during the measurement. The measurement was accepted as suitable for evaluation and recorded when 3 repeatable graphs were obtained. The mean of these 3 measurements was obtained, and the minimal cross-sectional areas (CSA) of the nasal valve region (CSA1), the lower concha anterior end (CSA2), and the total nasal volume (TV) showing the volume of the first 6 cm from the nostril were measured. Acoustic rhinometry measurements were made separately for the 2 nasal passages, and a mean value of these measurements together was used for each case, as both nasal cavities are effective on nasalance.</p>
<p>Nasometry measurements were made with the Nasometer II system (model 6400, KayPentax, Lincoln Park, New Jersey). The subjects were informed about the test before voice recordings, and they became familiar with the text they would read. The subjects were asked to read the 3 Turkish passages that were prepared according to the nasal consonant ratio of the 3 English texts that are commonly used for standard nasometric evaluations. The oral passage had no nasal consonants, while the oronasal and nasal passages had these at a rate of 16.04% and 29.45%, respectively. The “zilli kedi” passage (with no nasal consonants, the equivalent of the “Zoo” passage in English) was used for the oral evaluation, the “dedem” passage (with a combination of oral and nasal consonants, the equivalent of the “rainbow” passage in English) for oronasal evaluation, and the “manav” passage (with a predominance of nasal consonants) for nasal evaluation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812438846">11</xref></sup> The sounds were recorded while these passages were being read, and the nasalance values of the oral, oronasal, and nasal passages were calculated (as percentages) using the nasometry system software.</p>
<p>The skin was cleaned with alcohol and allowed to dry before the nasal dilator strip (Breathe Right nasal stripes sm/med; GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare LP, Moon Township, Pennsylvania) was applied. The small-medium–size nasal dilatator strips that are recommended for subjects with an average-sized nose were used. The middle section of the strip was folded over the alar fold, and the strip was applied to the dorsum nasi as recommended by the manufacturer. Once the strip was applied, the acoustic rhinometry and nasometry measurements were repeated.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS for Windows version 15.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois) software. The mean ± standard deviation was calculated for descriptive statistics. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for the statistical evaluation of the mean CSA1, CSA2, TV, oral, oronasal, and nasal passage nasalance scores with and without the strip. A significance level of .05 was used. To assess the power of the study, we used the power and sample size v2.1.31 program.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 25 volunteering men aged 21 to 28 years (mean 22.8 ± 1.9 years) were included in the study. Following the application of nasal strips, the subjects stated an increase in nasal respiration of 6.24 ± 2.50 on the VAS scale. The mean VAS value was 1.60 ± 1.12 before the application of the strips and 7.84 ± 2.56 while the strips were on. The increase in the VAS values was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>The mean CSA1 value was 0.57 ± 0.16 cm<sup>2</sup> before the application of the strips and 0.67 ± 0.15 cm<sup>2</sup> while the strips were on. The mean value of CSA2 was 1.31 ± 0.35 cm<sup>2</sup> before the use of strips and 1.20 ± 0.45 cm<sup>2</sup> while the strips were on. The mean TV value was 6.93 ± 1.47 cm<sup>3</sup> before application of the strips and 7.10 ± 1.65 cm<sup>3</sup> while the strips were on. The mean changes observed in these acoustic rhinometric measurements were 0.10 for CSA1, 0.12 for CSA2, and 0.17 for TV. The increase in CSA1 values was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .001). There were no statistically significant differences for CSA2 and TV measurements before the use of nasal strips and while the strips were on (<italic>P</italic> = .123, <italic>P</italic> = .093, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812438846"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). To assess the power of the study, we used the sample size as 25, standard deviation as 0.155, change score as 0.10, and the type I error probability associated with CSA1 as 0.05. These samples and estimates of variance provided 0.87 power to detect CSA1 differences.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The nasal valve has an elastic structure, and it is possible to increase the sectional area of this region by pulling it sideways. The Cottle maneuver has been reported to cause a significant increase in the sectional area of the nasal valve while making no change in the posterior part of this region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812438846">12</xref></sup> Nasal dilator strips expand the nasal valve area by pulling the alar cartilages sideways and increase the stability of the lateral nasal wall. The sectional area and volume of the area corresponding to the nasal valve is known to increase significantly after nasal strip application in healthy cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812438846">13</xref></sup> Nasal dilator strips have been reported to significantly increase the sectional area and volume of the first 3-cm section of the nose while having no effect on the 3- to 5.4-cm area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812438846">14</xref></sup> In our study, we found a significant increase in CSA1 with no change in CSA2 after nasal strip application.</p>
<p>There is no consensus on whether the subjective evaluation of nasal breathing comfort by the patient correlates with the objective evaluations of acoustic rhinometry and rhinomanometry. Deliktas et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812438846">15</xref></sup> reported no correlation between objective evaluation methods and the subjective nasal opening sensation with VAS in healthy subjects in their study on 124 cases. However, Roithmann et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812438846">3</xref></sup> found a significant relationship between the sensation of breathing comfortably from the nose and the nasal section areas and nasal resistance when the patient breathed separately from each nostril, although there was no relationship when the subject used both nostrils together. Our patients indicated an improvement in nasal breathing sensation of more than 50% in 84% of the cases and more than 70% in 52% of the cases following the application of the nasal dilator strip.</p>
<p>Nasal dilator strips are reported to decrease nasal resistance by increasing the cross-sectional area of the nasal valve region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812438846">16</xref></sup> The increase in the nasal cavity volume causes a decrease in nasal airflow resistance and therefore increases nasalance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812438846">9</xref></sup> However, the effect of an increase in sectional area and volume only in the front part of the nose on functions involving the whole nose is not as pronounced on functions involving the whole nose. Lindemann et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812438846">17</xref></sup> reported a significant increase in the sectional area and volume of the first 2-cm section of the nose, without a significant difference in intranasal heat and moisture measurements. Similarly, there is no significant change in voice quality with a change in the shape of the front part of the nose. Trindade et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812438846">18</xref></sup> reported a significant improvement in the nasal valve and lower concha anterior end region minimal CSA and volume after septorhinoplasty with no significant change in the nasalance of oral or nasal passages and concluded that improvement in the nasal opening of the anterior part of the nose has no effect on nasalance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812438846">18</xref></sup> We also found no significant effect of the increased CSA at the nasal valve level achieved with nasal strips on nasalance. We assume this result may be due to the lack of a significant effect of nasal dilator strips on CSA2 and TV, and the velopharyngeal port is more responsible for air egress into the nose during phonation.</p>
<p>The nasalance is reported to change with applications affecting the whole nasal cavity such as nasal septal deviation, nasal polyps, anatomic abnormalities, and inflammatory diseases resulting in mucosal concession. An improvement in voice quality and nasalance has been reported in patients who have undergone surgical treatment for septum deviation and nasal polyposis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812438846">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812438846"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812438846">21</xref></sup> However, the relationship between nasal cavity volume and nasalance has not been evaluated in these studies. Birkent et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812438846">11</xref></sup> found a significant improvement in all acoustic rhinometry measurements (the minimal CSA of the anterior, middle, and posterior parts of the nose and total cavity) and nasalance values following nasal decongestant spray administration in healthy subjects. A similar study found a significant increase in the nasalance of both oral and nasal passages following decongestant administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812438846">22</xref></sup> However, both studies found no correlation between the improved nasal opening and nasalance and concluded that the changes in nasalance are not large enough to warrant clinical application.</p>
<p>We evaluated individuals with no nasal breathing difficulty in our study and found no effect of nasal valve region enlargement on nasalance. The nasal valve may affect nasal resonance and nasalance under abnormal conditions versus minimal physiological change in normal subjects. Kirkness et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599812438846">23</xref></sup> found a significant decrease in nasal airflow resistance with the use of nasal strips in individuals with high nasal airflow resistance at rest but no change where the nasal resistance was normal. New studies are needed to determine whether there will be any change in nasalance following treatment in patients with major pathological conditions affecting the nasal valve region.</p>
