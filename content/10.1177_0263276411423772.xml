<abstract>
<p>This paper interrogates the status of the Malthusian couple and the policing and government of reproduction in the first volume of Foucault's <italic>History of Sexuality, Volume I</italic> (<italic>HS1</italic>), and the associated Collège de France lectures. Presented by Foucault as one of the four ‘strategic ensembles’ of the 18th century through which knowledge and power became centered on sex, what Foucault calls the socialization of procreative sexuality (<italic>HS1</italic>: 104) also constitutes a largely invisible hinge between the trajectories in <italic>HS1</italic>: biopolitics (vector of governmentality, management, administration and intensification of life) and sex (vector through which the repressive hypothesis is rejected). Particularly because it is one of the least discussed figures in Foucauldian commentary, my argument is that a reading of <italic>HS1</italic> through the prism of its Malthusian couple produces unexpected results. A text that can be interpreted from the perspective of (a) its debate with psychoanalysis, or (b) its potential debate with those for whom sexual rights belong to a sexual subject, or (c) its status as a watershed text for biopolitical theory, enters into a fourth dialogue with the history of reproduction as politicized and biopoliticized, a problematic to date taken up most directly by Ann Stoler in <italic>Race and the Education of Desire</italic>. This allows for a revisiting of the complex relationship between the vectors of ‘sex’ and ‘life’ in <italic>HS1</italic>. Although reproductive sex, and reproductive life, are not the themes of the strongest importance in <italic>HS1</italic>, they serve as the invisible hinge at the interface of biopolitics and sex in <italic>HS1</italic>. Considering the status of reproductive life from this perspective becomes a departure point for reconsidering the reproductive woman, in her historical role as part of the problematized Malthusian couple and at the intersection of biopolitics and thanatopolitics.</p>

<p>COULD ANY reading of Foucault's <italic>History of Sexuality, Volume I,</italic> have been left untried? This paper looks at the work from the perspective of the role it accords reproductivity. This adds to the extensive ways in which Foucault's Collège de France lectures have shed new light on <italic>HS1</italic>, in this case through an attention to Foucault's interest in 19th- and early 20th-century theories of degeneracy, which intersect with a view of procreation as a threshold of defence. Although Foucault's <italic>dispositifs</italic> usually read most effectively when their elements are understood as overlapping, I argue for a provisional disentangling of the terms: sexuality, life and reproduction – and in fact population, for a specific reason. It allows a closer focus on reproduction as a hinge between Foucault's account of sexuality and his account of biopolitics operating in the society which ‘must be defended’.</p>
<p>Foucault's <italic>History of Sexuality, Volume I</italic> (hereafter <italic>HS1</italic>), has had a number of parallel lives. In refuting the repressive hypothesis, Foucault entered into debate with Freudo-Marxism and more generally with the hypothesis that the least ‘productive’ forms of sexuality are repressed. Lynne Huffer has also commented that ‘without Foucault's <italic>Sexuality One</italic> queer theory as we know it would not have developed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0263276411423772">Huffer, 2009</xref>: 33). And his work has also played a critical role in the unfolding of contemporary continental biopolitical theory – without <italic>HS1</italic>, biopolitics in the form we know it also would not have developed.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0263276411423772"><title>The Double Status of Sex</title>
<p>Looking back 20 years, and considering the figurings of <italic>HS1</italic> by individuals such as Nikolas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0263276411423772">Rose (2006)</xref>, Giorgio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0263276411423772">Agamben (1998)</xref>, Roberto Esposito (2008), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0263276411423772">Robert Bernasconi (2010)</xref> and Donna V. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0263276411423772">Jones (2010)</xref>, on the one hand, and David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0263276411423772">Halperin (1995)</xref>, Didier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276411423772">Eribon (2004)</xref>, Eve Kosofsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276411423772">Sedgwick (1990)</xref>, Judith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276411423772">Butler (1999)</xref><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0263276411423772">1</xref></sup> and Janet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276411423772">Halley (2006)</xref>, on the other, it might seem as if there had been (at least) two, quite different <italic>HS1</italic>s, depending on whether the work has been read through the prism of sex or life.</p>
<p>For the reader approaching <italic>HS1</italic> primarily through the prism of biopolitics, the sexual body has (at least) a double status. It is, on the one hand, just one of many sites (which would also include the healthy social body, the communities and populations conceived in urban planning contexts, in health management contexts, the resulting inoculated bodies, ‘healthy’ pregnancies, and so on), of the biopolitical techniques through which ‘the mechanisms of power are addressed to the body, to life, to what causes it to proliferate’ (<italic>HS1</italic>: 147), techniques which emerged with ‘the problems of birthrate, longevity, public health, housing and migration’ (<italic>HS1</italic>: 140). Sexuality becomes a demographic matter at the level of sexual trends attributed to ‘human masses’, facilitating and facilitated by the knowledges allowing the technics of rates, trends and likelihood of practice, habit, exchange, transmission and identity, and allowing bioadministration of matters relating to sex at the level of population. Among these multiple modes in which power operates not primarily through taking, but enhancing life, sexuality in particular also comes to play a critical role because of Foucault's concurrent claim that ‘sex was a means of access [<italic>accès</italic>] both to the life of the body and the life of the species’(<italic>HS1</italic>: 146).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0263276411423772">2</xref></sup> It is presented as the means of ‘access’ in a number of ways, but one might focus in particular on the stimulated interest in confession, and the will to talk about ‘interior’ desires. Putatively secretive sexual subjects fascinated by the presence of the possibly abnormal interior sexual self talk, and want to talk, as Foucault noted, to all and sundry. Discursive explosion and expert knowledges intersect with the data of statistics and demographics – all critical to the possibility of biopolitical governmentality.</p>
<p>Thus sex is a sub-domain of biopolitics but is also depicted in <italic>HS1</italic>, but not in the prevailing biopolitical literature, as the critical means of power's access to life. Agamben, Esposito and Rose, for example, have not favored the argument that the means of access to the life of the body and the species has been primarily through sex. To consider another occlusion, in the contexts of queer theory, while sex has been recognized as interconnecting with the biopolitical vicissitudes of life,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0263276411423772">3</xref></sup> there is less interest in the biopolitical aspects of <italic>HS1</italic> which seemingly have less to do with sex (biopolitics as interested in inoculation rates, ‘healthy diet’ habits, typical housing conditions or patterns of immigration, for example). Though as components of <italic>HS1</italic> each prism supposes the other, the work is often read more strongly through the one or the other.</p>
<p>There is, arguably, an additional prism through which one can read <italic>HS1</italic>, that of reproductive biopolitics, one of a number of phenomena operating at the nexus between the biopolitical administering of life and the biopolitical intensification of sex. This additional prism brings into stronger focus the role of procreative sexuality in <italic>HS1</italic> and in the interrelated Collège de France lectures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0263276411423772"><title><italic>HS1</italic> and the Procreative Hypothesis</title>
<p>The sexuality with which Foucault opens <italic>HS1</italic> connected immediately with confessional sexual selves – but the possible concerns of procreation were there from the first page.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0263276411423772">4</xref></sup> Foucault's starting point in rejecting the repressive hypothesis involves his rejection of the view that the perversions were subdued when they were deemed illicit or illegal in the apparent interests of a Victorian sexuality oriented to marriage, family and reproduction. According to that view of repression, excessive and non-productive desires, pleasures and symptoms – those of homosexuality, masturbation, and the hysterical woman – are rendered problematic not just because they offend the declared norm but also because of their non-conformity with the requirements of a disciplined, channelled and non-squanderous reproductive sexuality; thus, to return to the first pages of the work, depicting the received narrative of a repression of sexuality with the advent of the Victorian bourgeoisie, ‘sexuality was carefully confined; it moved into the home. The conjugal family took custody of it and absorbed it into the serious function of reproduction’. One single space of sexuality was acknowledged, that of the ‘legitimate and procreative couple’, ‘at the heart of every household … a utilitarian and fertile one’ (<italic>HS1</italic>: 3). The perversions would have to be pursued illegally, or if they occurred in legal heterosexual marriage, silently. The disputed repressive hypothesis is then, from the first page of Foucault's work, concurrently reproductively oriented. Procreation's stakes first are at work in <italic>HS1</italic> in the guise of the replaced or rejected hypothesis.</p>
<p>But when Foucault famously repudiates the repressive hypothesis, to what extent does he repudiate the reproductive hypothesis? He asks, ‘was this transformation of sex into discourse not governed by the endeavor to expel from reality the forms of sexuality that were not amenable to the strict economy of reproduction: to say no to unproductive activities, to banish casual pleasures, to reduce or exclude practices whose object was not procreation?’ (<italic>HS1</italic>: 36) He answers: even if the apparent aim is to deter non-procreative, unproductive sexual activity,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0263276411423772">5</xref></sup> even if ‘all this garrulous attention which has us in a stew over sexuality is … motivated by one basic concern: to ensure population, to reproduce labor capacity … to constitute a sexuality that is economically useful’ (<italic>HS1</italic>: 36–7), ‘reduction has not been the means employed for trying to achieve it’. Here, the ‘it’ in question is the economically useful reproductive sexuality. Though Foucault had rejected the Reichian account of the repression of non (re)productive sexuality, the complex rejection of the repressive hypothesis produces an elaborate account fully able to claim that the ends of (re)productive sexuality are in fact served by the perversions that seem to undermine it.</p>
<p>The ‘implantation’ of perversion is as much an implantation of the possibility of perversion and abnormality (including the life of fantasy) in the most intensely self-identifying ‘normal’ as it is a matter of the proliferation of illegal perversions – and in both cases interrelated with the incited desire to tell. The widespread interest in the possibility of illicit or perverse desire produces a discursive explosion. Knowledge proliferates with respect to sexual habits, producing the kinds of knowledges reliant on self-scrutiny, interest and disclosure. There is an overlap between such practices and the social sciences and the governmentality whose interest is not so much individual births as birthrate, not an individual's possible sexual disease but calculation of rates of transmission of sexual disease, not individual pregnancies but their statistical regularities and variabilities. Foucault does not announce that the ends of perverse sexuality could be understood as a calculably procreative sexuality attributable to that conceptual modality understood as ‘population’ but certainly, by his analysis, these ends are fully consistent. The implantation (in his sense) of pleasures particularly figured in the 19th century as abnormal and perverse – from masturbation to homosexuality – could, in fact, effectively be depicted as an excellent ‘means’ to generate the most fully calculably normative, statistically comprehensible, fully administered, procreative heterosexuality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0263276411423772"><title>The Procreative Hinge</title>
<p>To return to the phrase ‘Sex was a means of access both to the life of the body and the life of the species [<italic>le sexe est accès à la fois à la vie du corps et à la vie de l'espèce</italic>]’(Foucault, 1978: 146), this particular ‘sex’, as referred to in this passage, is the procreative pole of biopolitics. When Foucault considers the formation of sexuality as interconnecting with regimes of truth, expert knowledge, and administration, one can substitute the term ‘procreation’ or ‘procreative sex’ for the word ‘sex’, as in the following passage:<disp-quote>
<p>At the heart of this economic and political problem of population was [procreative] sex: it was necessary to analyze the birthrate, the age of marriage, the legitimate and illegitimate births, the precocity and frequency of sexual relations, the ways of making them fertile or sterile, the effects of unmarried life or of the prohibitions, the impact of contraceptive practices – of those notorious ‘deadly secrets’ which demographers on the eve of the Revolution knew were already familiar to the inhabitants of the countryside. Of course, it had long been asserted that a country had to be populated [<italic>peuplé</italic>] if it hoped to be rich and powerful; but this was the first time that a society had affirmed, in a constant way, that its future and its fortune were tied not only to the number and uprightness [<italic>virtu</italic>] of its citizens, to their marriage rules and family organization, but to the manner in which each individual made use of his [procreative] sex [<italic>chacun fait usage de son sexe</italic>]. (<italic>HS1</italic>: 25--6)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Consider, next, the following citation as encapsulating the peculiar hinge which takes place in <italic>The History of Sexuality</italic> and not in <italic>Society Must Be Defended</italic>, between Foucault's vision of those mechanisms of power addressing themselves to life, and those mechanisms of power addressing themselves to sex or sexuality.<disp-quote>
<p>We … are in a society of ‘sex’ [<italic>du sexe</italic>], or rather a society ‘with a sexuality’ [<italic>à sexualité</italic>]: the mechanisms of power are addressed to the body, to life, to what causes it to proliferate, to what reinforces the species, its robustness its ability to dominate, or its capacity for being used. Through the themes of health, progeny, race, the future of the species, the vitality of the social body, power spoke <italic>of</italic> sexuality and <italic>to</italic> sexuality; the latter was not a mark or a symbol, it was an object and a target. (<italic>HS1</italic>: 147)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Small as it is, I draw attention to this intersection as the reproductive ‘hinge’ in the work, a hinge which is not thematized. Clearly, most of Foucault's references to sex are not procreative. But <italic>when</italic> biopolitics intersects with sex in Foucault's own references in <italic>HS1</italic> (in association with the management of ‘life’), in his own imaginary, they are procreative. For Foucault, (procreativity-oriented) sex and (biopolitically-oriented) population hinge together at the nexus of biopower, as when he describes the formation by which ‘sex was not something one simply judged; it was a thing one administered. It was in the nature of a public potential; it called for management procedures’ (<italic>HS1</italic>: 24). When, introducing the administration of sex, Foucault mentions it becoming a ‘police’ matter (in the sense of administration, of 18th-century meanings of <italic>Polizeiwissenschaft</italic>) and also cites Johann von Justi's 1857 text on the necessity of knowledge of the different assets of those who belong to the Republic, to ‘make them serve the public welfare’, the instance Foucault goes on to give of the regulation of sex is that of population. Though he is the first to stress, here and elsewhere, particularly in <italic>Security, Territory, Population</italic>, that the regulation of population includes concerns with health, diet, habitation, immigration, urban space, employment, etc., at its heart, he says here, is sex – sex thinkable in terms of rates of fertility and sterility, and birthrate.</p>
<p>If, in this one sense, the sex formations discussed by Foucault are somewhat more procreative than they appear – so it is with his biopolitics. When, just as he does in the above passage, Foucault writes about the biopolitical administration of sex, describing sex as a concurrent and highly efficient means of access <italic>both</italic> to the life of the body and the life of the species, biopolitics is primarily considered again through the prism of sex. As we see how this unfolds in the work, we gain access to the procreative hinge if we remember that it is not inevitable. As Foucault would be the first to recall, the biopolitization of sex is not always procreative – it can be concerned with ‘healthy’ sex, trends in unprotected sex, sexual disease rates, patterns of sexual violence in populations, trends in sexual habits of different groups. Not all aspects of the ‘biopolitical administration of sex’ are procreative, but the regimes of calculable birthrates within population and ‘quality’ (‘healthy’, etc.) reproduction to which Foucault is referring with these particular remarks are.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0263276411423772"><title>Abstract Population and Sexual/Procreative Subjectivation</title>
<p>In other words, at several points in <italic>HS1</italic>, Foucault brings together two problematics which do not necessarily fit together. One can, for example, describe the process by which from the 18th century onwards births are increasingly counted and recorded in the registers of churches, parishes, and in medical and local government contexts<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0263276411423772">6</xref></sup> in relation to the rates of death and marriage. The other problematic relates to the conceptualization of ‘population’ and the broader beginnings of demographics. Although Foucault discusses in <italic>HS1</italic> the nexus of the policing of sexual (reproductive) habit and the conceptual formation of an interest in population, perhaps their separability is the more interesting aspect of population.</p>
<p>That non-association is apparent not only in <italic>Security, Territory, Population</italic>, but even in Foucault's <italic>Order of Things</italic>. There, referring to the formation of the concept of population and its movements, Foucault first discusses a 1740 text by Dutot, and the belief that ‘population tends to move in the contrary direction to money … the poorer countries tend to become depopulated’. A number of subsequent accounts referenced in the work describe how population levels might be impacted by stimulation of coinage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276411423772">Foucault, 1970</xref>: 188), by the level of wages (1970: 188, and see 1970: 259); by availability of food and natural resources (1970: 256), movements in levels of industrial profit (1970: 258–9), or the relationship between the value of the commodity and the value of labour (1970: 260).</p>
<p>More in line with these comments, Foucault mentions in <italic>HS1</italic> Herbert's 1753 <italic>Essai sur la police générale</italic>: ‘men multiply like the yields from the ground and in proportion to the advantages and resources they find in their labors’ (p. 20, cited in Foucault, 1978: 25). But in <italic>HS1,</italic> Foucault then continues with the presentation we have just seen of sex as central to the problematization of population: ‘at the heart of this economic and political problem of population was sex: it was necessary to analyze the birthrate, the age of marriage, the legitimate and illegitimate births, the precocity and frequency of sexual relations, the ways of making them fertile or sterile, the effects of unmarried life or of the prohibitions, the impact of contraceptive practices’ (<italic>HS1</italic>: 25–6).</p>
<p>In this citation Foucault is referring specifically to procreative sex. But rather than proposing that sex was at the heart of the ways in which population was problematized, he might alternatively have stressed the striking disconnect between population as a broadly biopolitical phenomenon and population as a concept inflected by procreative sex. In Smith's law of population better wages are conceptualized as the population stimulus: ‘the demand for men, like that for any other commodity, necessarily regulates the production of men’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0263276411423772">Smith, 1994</xref>: 92, and see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276411423772">Foucault, 1970</xref>: 258). Lars Behrisch has discussed 18th-century calculations of how the availability of sufficient looms would stimulate population in Lippe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0263276411423772">Behrisch, 2004</xref>: 56). And even for Malthus, for whom certainly sex takes the rhetorical focus as the critical factor impacting population, other factors are war, emigration, wages, and availability of food.</p>
<p>Even a specific focus on procreation may not be overtly preoccupied with sex, but with an abstract factor, such as (in Smith's case) ‘wages’. Certainly, when the agent impacting population is figured as the ‘wages’ and the tacit idea is that wages stimulate (or deter) procreation/marriage, procreation would seem to require the figuring of a sexual agent. Nonetheless, the determining factor still may not necessarily be depicted as <italic>sexual</italic>.</p>
<p>These are factors in the 18th-century thinking of population mentioned by Foucault. Thus his remark: ‘At the heart of this economic and political problem of population was sex’ (<italic>HS1</italic>: 25) can easily be answered with a turn to a number of the works on population he references, and indeed by a turn to <italic>The Order of Things</italic> and <italic>Security, Territory, Population</italic> for an alternative thinking of population which, by contrast, minimizes the role of sex in its account of how population became an economic, political and administrative apparatus – as in, for example, the discussions in the latter of 18th-century accounts of population varying according to the variables of climate, commerce and currency flows, taxation, wetnursing, availability of subsistence, demand for exports, availability of work, etc. (Foucault, 2007: 70–72).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0263276411423772"><title>Foucault's Sexually-Inflected Population</title>
<p>It is also because sex is otherwise deemphasized in the discussions of population in Foucault's work that it is striking that Foucault's interest in population in <italic>HS1</italic>, an interest which proves in that work to be biopolitical, overlaps not only with the administration of life – covering the interests in hygiene, food distribution, disease rates, urban planning – but focuses on ‘birthrate’ and (again not the same thing) procreative sex in particular.</p>
<p>In the <italic>HS1</italic> trajectory which culminates in the race-inflected depictions of eugenicist biopolitics discussed in the final chapter, Foucault has already in the work described a seemingly early variant seen in the view of aristocratic marriages as reproductively strategic alliances. With the view that desirable family bloodlines arose through heirs produced by arranged marriages, he writes of the phenomenon contemporary with what he suggests were the first ‘eugenicists’. Thus, ‘the first dreams of perfecting the species’ were associated with ‘an extremely exacting administration of sex’ (<italic>une gestion fort contraignante du sexe</italic>), involving the ‘art of determining good marriages, inducing desired fertility, ensuring the health and longevity of children’ (<italic>HS1</italic>: 148). This 18th-century ‘alliance’-oriented variation on eugenics then is connected by Foucault to a 200-year period in which the analytics of ‘sex’, ‘blood’ and the law differentially ‘haunted the administration of sexuality [<italic>la gestion de la sexualité</italic>]’ (<italic>HS1</italic>: 149), including specific formations of racism relating to the concern with protecting blood purity whose beginnings are located in the second half of the 19th century.</p>
<p>Family alliance and the aristocratic bloodline are, as he acknowledges, a different conceptual and material substance than the ‘health’ or interests of the race, the ‘people’ or the ‘population’. Both formations may assume the need to stimulate reproductivity, or, in some cases a highly selective reproductivity, but the one will focus on family, whereas the latter will tend to be concerned with a more abstract, massified, statistical, and trend-related entity; in both cases, these entities (‘family line’, ‘population’) may intersect with the intermittent perceptions that ‘births’, or the overall ‘birthrate’, need to be monitored, depressed or stimulated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0263276411423772"><title>Population, Birthrate, Procreative Agency, and Women</title>
<p>The device of population reconceives of individuals as abstract masses whose trends may be collectively affected by their ‘milieu’ (Foucault, 2007: 21). If we return to Malthus and the factors impacting population, these are, on the one hand, reproduction and its eventual geometric effects and, on the other hand, conditions of subsistence, food production (whose growth can only occur arithmetically), mortality rate and war.</p>
<p>But one starts to see a concurrent phenomenon of – to use a term from <italic>HS1</italic> – responsibilization occurring in these contexts in relation to the type of moral duty he articulates: individuals are imagined as bearing moral responsibility towards abstract collective entities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0263276411423772">7</xref></sup> Malthus does consider it morally reprehensible <italic>towards one's own offspring</italic> to reproduce without the means of supporting those offspring. But he also conceives an individual moral duty in terms of overall population impact of overall collective practice; and this is one of the instances of the interests of ‘population’ becoming a moral substance attached (if incoherently) to individual moral duty.</p>
<p>Now it is possible to ask: does this moral duty have a sex? When Malthus recommends that mindfulness of population impact should cause individuals to delay marriages (with the pre-marriage years to be passed in celibacy), those who would bear this responsibility are male. Malthus advises that one should delay marriage until one can comfortably sustain a family, referring to ‘the exertions that men find it necessary to make, in order to support themselves or families’, and again:<disp-quote>
<p>It is clearly the duty of each individual not to marry till he has a prospect of supporting his children; but it is at the same time to be wished that he should retain undiminished his desire of marriage, in order that he may exert himself to realize this prospect, and be stimulated to make provision for the support of greater numbers. (1992: 313)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Malthus articulates a duty of the ‘individual’ with respect to immediate offspring, but it is also an individual duty articulated as carried by a potential reproductive agent towards both the immediate offspring and a collective future (general happiness), negatively impacted, as he sees it, by the risk of geometrically expanding population. The possibility of conceptualizing this duty is dependent on the possibility of conceptualizing population, specifically through the prism of an abstract algorithm of reproduction in addition to problematizing unregulated individual desire. Francis Galton would repeat, with the notorious alternative focus on procreative ‘quality’, the vision of the moral obligation of a procreative agent towards something conceived as the future of a people. In both cases, the moral duty is presented as male.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0263276411423772">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>These texts offer vivid illustrations of the missing formation of maternal reproductivity understood in parallel terms. Malthus does at one point acknowledge that reproduction is dependent on something specific to women: their childbearing ‘power’. But this arises in a discussion of a natural law:<disp-quote>
<p>The fecundity of the human species is, in some respects, a distinct consideration from the passion between the sexes, as it evidently depends more upon the power of women in bearing children than upon the strength or weakness of this passion.– It is however a law exactly similar in its great features to all the other laws of nature. It is strong and general … it is an object of the Creator that the earth should be replenished and it appears to me clear that this could not be effected without a tendency in population to increase faster than food. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276411423772">Malthus, 1992</xref>: 213–14)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>To return to Foucault, I have noted that elsewhere in his work Foucault stresses the concerns of the biopolitical administration of population distinct from the overlap with sex (overall alimentary needs, hygiene, disease circulation, urban planning, rates of insurance, of immigration, etc.). Once we no longer take the sex-population connection for granted in <italic>HS1</italic>, we can give closer scrutiny to how they come to intersect, and to the role of reproduction at that intersection. Thus, we can direct our attention to one of the least discussed figures of <italic>HS1</italic>, closer scrutiny of the representation in that work of the Malthusian couple.</p>
<p>But, as will be clear from my remarks on Malthus himself, from the point of this scrutiny I would like to read back into <italic>HS1</italic> the status of the woman and maternal reproductivity in relation to population and the overlap with the role of women. That question almost, but does not quite, arise in <italic>HS1</italic>.</p>
<p>So I turn now to those aspects of the conceptual and governmental phenomena discussed by Foucault which do stress the procreative aspect of population through the preoccupation with births and birthrate. I am reading the work in terms of its ‘non-staging’ of a question which can usefully be thought with the resources of his text, particularly given the appearance of the Malthusian couple in <italic>HS1</italic>: what have been the genealogical conditions for the problematization of the procreative practice of women when deemed critical to the future and fortunes of a ‘society’, ‘people’, ‘population’ or ‘race’? Some preliminary questions attach to this.</p>
<p>Women would later assume a status as a reproductive threshold of the future and health of nations, populations and peoples. But the condition for this role for women and maternal reproductivity was the very possibility of reproduction being associated with a shifting field of possible substances, telos, outcomes and obligations: the overall good, the general happiness, the future of the nation, the health of the nation, the competitiveness of the nation, the future of the people, individual flourishing or freedom, individual rights, domestic happiness, the family unit as building block of the nation, the transmission of the bloodline, the family name, transmission of property or family or genealogical transmission, reproduction of the labour force, etc. That reproduction be plausibly thought of in such terms at all was a precondition of it becoming associated with women's role as threshold of futurity.</p>
<p>From the emergence of this possibility, one can interrogate the figuring of maternal procreativity, and its attachment to (female) ‘reproductive duty’, for example towards the nation: the equivalent, in terms of subjectivation, of the biopoliticized concern with birthrate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0263276411423772"><title>Foucault on Eugenics, Population and Alliance</title>
<p>Where Foucault looks first at alliance, and then at population, and what he describes as the earliest variations on eugenics, he is arguably discussing formations <italic>not</italic> conceptually obliged to target women for alliance and reproductive purposes, for the woman of the earliest eugenic trends (those of aristocratic union) and of some of the earliest demographic thinking (those of Malthus) are rarely considered except as chattels of marriage and procreative vessels. They may be given in marriage, and once given, the resulting procreation can be considered a force of nature, rather than procreative choice or ‘duty’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0263276411423772">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>To move to the other pole, in the conclusion of <italic>HS1</italic> the hinge which has been operating between sex and life is rearticulated in terms of the problem of rights. Both those forces understood as ‘infringing’ on rights and those that demand those same rights are described as sharing the problematization that appears to oppose them. Thus, describing a biopolitical context in which ‘what served as an objective was life, understood as the basic needs, man's concrete essence, the realization of his potential’ (<italic>HS1</italic>: 145), Foucault also notes resistances or reactions which could be thought of as ‘turning back’:<disp-quote>
<p>life as a political object was in a sense taken at face value and turned back [<italic>retournée</italic>] against the system that was bent on controlling it. It was life more than the law that became the issue of political struggles, even if the latter were formulated through affirmations concerning rights. The ‘right’ to life, to one’s body, to health, to happiness, to the satisfaction of needs … (etc) this right – which the classical juridical system was utterly incapable of comprehending – was the political response to all these new procedures of power. (<italic>HS1</italic>: 145)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As part of this story, although Foucault does not make this point, a narrative about reproductive rights also plays out. With the advent of ‘population’, the protagonists are not individual and Church but individual and collective, present and future, aggregate and the abstract ‘human mass’. The language will be that of justice, but also that of moral obligation and moral claims. Some degree of subjectivation in terms of individual impact on abstract human mass is possible, producing new notions of responsibility, collective duty, sometimes reproductive or health ‘patriotism’.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is partly figured by Foucault, as he mentions the ‘socialization of procreative behaviour’ as one of the ‘four great strategic ensembles which, beginning in the eighteenth century, formed specific apparati of knowledge and power centering on sex’ (<italic>HS1</italic>: 103, translation modified). Here, incitements and restrictions were, as Foucault notes, ‘brought to bear on the fertility of couples; a political socialization achieved through the “responsibilization” of couples with regard to the social body as a whole’ (<italic>HS1</italic>: 104–5), and the name Foucault gives to the phenomenon is the problematization of the Malthusian couple.</p>
<p>But although this is presented as one of (at least) four strategies at work in the ‘production of sexuality’, the problematization of the Malthusian couple has received little attention in commentary. Moreover, it will slip out of Foucault's presentation, indeed right at the moment where sex reappears as the matter of the rights in question (in the form of Foucault's critical interest in the phenomenon of sexual ‘liberation’, his rejection of Reich, and the association between formations of truth, freedom, interiority, identity, rights, and sex), and even though the sex which has been the hinge of biopolitics has been throughout the work, recurringly, procreative. <italic>HS1</italic> will end with its focus on sex, its mention of bodies and pleasures, but not with some kind of call to the (for imagination's sake) possible procreative pleasures or inventions which might be the alternative to the eventual establishment of ‘reproductive rights’. Thus in the wake of Foucault's work, movements and claims of sexual liberation and their hermeneutics have been put under scrutiny, sometimes under the banner of bodies and pleasures, but the procreative component which by Foucault's analysis has been at work – the rights and duties of that Malthusian couple, for example – will not find some equivalent rhetorical variant.</p>
<p>As a consequence, to whatever extent that Foucault discusses resistance with respect to the problematization of population (a concern, as he presents this, with the sexual body, with ‘the manner in which each individual made use of his sex’; <italic>HS1</italic>: 25–6), such resistance tends to find its role associated with affirmations of sexuality, particularly in terms of a hermeneutics of desire and the association of sex and intelligibility. Foucault does not return, in the context of those famous concluding remarks, to a lurking figure in his text, the Malthusian couple. It is at this point that a discussion of the formation of reproductive rights would have been most plausible. As ‘responsibilized’, this couple had already been described as stimulated, intensified, incited (<italic>HS1</italic>: 104–5), involved in the formation of knowledges and the ‘strengthening of controls and resistances’(<italic>HS1</italic>: 106). This provokes a curious question one can direct at <italic>HS1</italic>, reading with, and not against, its own elements and resources: what forms of resistance might have been theorizable in the context of the Malthusian couple given that it had already been attributed a role in that work?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0263276411423772"><title>Resistance and the Malthusian Couple</title>
<p>This is a challenging question to ask, given that interpretations of <italic>HS1</italic> have become increasingly split between those preoccupied with the thematization of life and interpretations preoccupied with the thematization of sex. If one is interested in the status of reproduction in Foucault's work, the split between interpretations giving predominance to the prisms of sex and life may have occluded the fact that in <italic>HS1</italic> Foucault's ‘<italic>life</italic>’, to the extent that it is ‘sexual’, is procreative<italic>.</italic> This will only be seen where the sex and the life are read together, and as overlapping. Similarly, to the extent that, in <italic>HS1</italic>, Foucault's ‘sex’ is ‘<italic>biopolitical</italic>’ (here in the sense of power's address to life; <italic>HS1</italic>: 147), again this nexus point in fact concerns the procreative. This will, similarly, not be seen if the sex is isolated from the biopolitics.</p>
<p>There are a number of consequences to the odd combination of omnipresence and near invisibility of procreative sex in the work itself. Procreative sex plays no rhetorically decisive role in the work, yet as a preoccupation, it reproduces itself through the work. It is present in something Foucault names as 18th-century early forms of eugenics through the discussion of the concern with blood lines, the neo-Malthusian concerns, the hysterical woman becoming the bad mother in the home, the biopolitical interest in ‘healthy’ sex, or sex intersecting with birthrate, the racist formations of modern concerns with family, marriage and <italic>peuplement</italic>, the eugenics of Nazism.</p>
<p>While there are a number of ways to rethink the overlapping of sex and life as occurring through <italic>HS1</italic> via its procreative hinge, I am curious about the possible consequences for a different kind of feminist reading of the work. Feminist responses to Foucault have spent considerable time with the interpretation of disciplinary power. The Malthusian figure of <italic>HS1</italic> belongs to a different vector of interpretation, oriented towards reproductivity but also towards the phenomenon of reproductive rights.</p>
<p>Think of Foucault's interest in those ‘rights’ claims which become the concern of political strategies – the right to satisfy one's needs, the right to one's body (<italic>HS1</italic>: 154), thought of as some kind of <italic>retournement</italic>. The 20th century has shown that some of the most contentious rights have included the reproductive. The problematized Malthusian couple would overlap with feminist reproductive rights claims. Cross-continental eugenic preoccupations would see figures such as R.S. Steinmetz decrying feminism as bad for optimal eugenic outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0263276411423772">Steinmetz, 1904</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276411423772">Allen, 1988</xref>), and feminists in at least five countries (the UK, the US, Sweden, Germany and to a lesser extent France) would claim reproductive rights in the context of a language that would, as anti-abortionists have not failed to notice, sometimes be both Malthusian and eugenic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0263276411423772">10</xref></sup> At the turn of the 19th century, those both for and against ‘women's rights’ could share this language. Thus anxieties linking Malthusian preoccupations and the vicissitudes of feminism are pertinent to the anxieties around sex, certainly in many of the contexts discussed by Foucault (particularly the eugenic interests in the 19th and early 20th centuries<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0263276411423772">11</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>In short, my point is not to reduce Foucault's evocation of bodies and pleasures to the vicissitudes of procreation. Lee Edelman is one of a number of theorists for whom the least interesting stories to tell about sex and politics are procreatively and future oriented.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0263276411423772">12</xref></sup> Queer interpretations of Foucault may not be those most likely to direction attention to his remarks on reproductive sexuality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0263276411423772">13</xref></sup> Biopolitical readings have also passed over these remarks. Despite his account of the overlap of theories of degeneracy across the concern with perversion and the concern with heredity (Foucault 2003), a reading back through the procreative lens has become one of the more obscure of the possible readings of his work, despite the fact that procreation hinges together Foucault's concurrent and overlapping stories of sex and of life in <italic>HS1</italic>. What are the consequences of an attention to <italic>HS1's</italic> procreative hinge?</p>
<p>Foucault's brief remarks about resistance concern not only sex but also life rights (<italic>HS1</italic>: 154). <italic>HS1</italic>'s procreative hinge allows for an articulation within its terms of the likelihood that resistance would come to be associated with the reproductive body in the form of reproductive rights. The eugenic interests mentioned by Foucault had a wide number of facets: claims by putative experts, new modes of truth and knowledge, claims by the state, doctors, the articulation of the language of reproductive autonomy, and reproductive responsibility. Once reproductivity was associated with moral obligation, there were conflicts over perceived obligation towards conceptual entities understood as those of ‘people’, ‘population’, the ‘new’, the ‘future’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0263276411423772"><title>Reproduction and Racism</title>
<p>Finally, it is noticeable that the phenomenon repeats with respect to the ‘race’ prism in terms of which one can also read <italic>HS1</italic>. In the chapter ‘Periodization’ we see the connections between racism and sex that would overlap with the focus on racism developed in the <italic>Society Must Be Defended</italic> lectures:<disp-quote>
<p>the works, published in great numbers at the end of the eighteenth century, on body hygiene, the art of longevity, ways of having healthy children and of keeping them alive as long as possible, and methods for improving the human lineage, bear witness … to the correlation of this concern with the body and sex to a type of ‘racism’. (<italic>HS1</italic>: 125)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Again, Foucault uses the term ‘sex’, where the more specific term ‘reproduction’ would be appropriate. Noting that the connections between sexuality, biopolitics and racism are not clearly established by Foucault, Ann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0263276411423772">Stoler (1995)</xref> has been one of the few of Foucault's readers<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0263276411423772">14</xref></sup> to stress the role of reproduction in his account of racism, in its interconnection with the problematics of miscegenation, and the defence of peoples or nations from internal biological threats framed with languages such as degeneracy. Again, in these contexts, it is by distinguishing the overlapping problematics of sexuality and reproduction that we understand the more specific role played by reproduction with respect to the biopolitical function of administering life. The argument here is similar to that which I propose above: much about the nexus of biopolitics and racism is unrelated to sexuality. <italic>And</italic> sexuality certainly intertwines with biopolitical racism. But reproduction as a threshold of race defence has played a more specific role, as is made clear in Foucault's accounts of eugenics, and is not reducible to the travails of sexuality. As has been noted by writers such as Stoler, Bernasconi and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0263276411423772">Weinbaum (2004)</xref>, women's reproductive bodies, and women's role, as potentially reproductive, was one of the key threshold figures of race defence logics. Procreation was conceived at one time as revealing hidden physiological or biological secrets relating to race, disease or ‘degeneracy’, and interrelated with an interest in the unique identity of a people and its future as ‘vital’:<disp-quote>
<p>Many of the themes characteristic of the caste manners of the nobility reappeared in the nineteenth-century bourgeoisie, but in the guise of biological, medical, or eugenic precepts. The concern with genealogy becomes a preoccupation with heredity; but included in bourgeois marriages were not only economic imperatives and rules of social homogeneity, not only the promises of inheritance, but the menaces of heredity; families wore and concealed a sort of reversed and somber escutcheon whose defamatory quarters were the diseases or defects of the group or relatives – the grandfather’s general paralysis, the mother’s neurasthenia, the younger child’s phthisis, the hysterical or erotomaniac aunts, the cousins with bad morals. (<italic>HS1</italic>: 124–5)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Reproduction into the next generations was the conduit and so the threshold of transmission. At the turn of the century the vital individuality of the woman was also often associated with and expressed in her role in reproduction, not only in terms of what she could potentially transmit, but in terms of the lives and the contested futures that she bore. This phenomenon becomes obscured in the more general reference to sexuality, and this obscuration took place in <italic>HS1</italic>, <italic>Society Must Be Defended</italic>, and <italic>Abnormal</italic>: in other words, in the discussions of racism, in the discussions of degeneracy, and in the discussions of sex.</p>
<p>Because <italic>HS1</italic> is so strongly remembered for its evocation of bodies and pleasures as a means of dislodging the heuristics of sexuality in terms of identity and the hermeneutics of the self – introspection, individuality, confession, sexual truth, intelligibility and subjectivity – little place has been left for thinking through the role in the work of its procreative hinge. Yet the concerns about identity, introspection, individuality, confession, sexual truth and intelligibility also took place around the imaginaries surrounding the unknown, concealed, suspected, discovered or manifesting truths of heredity, degeneracy, biological truth and identity. Yet it was Foucault's insight that the site of biopolitical problematization would also be the site of the ‘life rights’. For this and other reasons, a counter-reading would suggest that, in their very omissions, and in the invisible hinges within and between these Foucauldian projects, they have had considerably more to say about the formation of reproductive rights than has appeared to be the case. Notwithstanding their interlockings and overlaps, prior to the possibility of such a counter-reading would be the (provisional) disentanglement of sex, life and race in Foucault's work, this to a specific end: dislodging the both omnipresent and invisible role of reproductivity and – eventually – women's fecundity, the politicization and the ‘responsibilization’ of reproductivity in particular as a threshold figure of defence.</p>
