<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Research on the use of home and community-based services (HCBS) by African American older adults suggests that the influential factors in this group may differ from those influencing service use by Whites. Some studies report that African American older adults are more likely to use HCBS than their White counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898264312474038">Henton, Hays, Walker, &amp; Atwood, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0898264312474038">White-Means &amp; Rubin, 2004</xref>). These findings are primarily limited to in-home health care and have been attributed to higher prevalence levels of disability and chronic illness among African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898264312474038">Dunlop, Manheim, Song, &amp; Chang, 2002</xref>). Other studies have found that African Americans are less likely to use formal HCBS than White older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264312474038">Calsyn &amp; Winter, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898264312474038">Houde, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0898264312474038">Wallace, Fields, Witucki, Boland, &amp; Tuck, 1999</xref>). Researchers attribute these lower rates of service use by African Americans to a variety of factors, including a lack of awareness of available services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264312474038">Calsyn &amp; Winter, 1999</xref>), distrust of formal health providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0898264312474038">Musa, Schulz, Harris, Silverman, &amp; Thomas, 2009</xref>), beliefs that community agencies are not knowledgeable of and responsive to their needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0898264312474038">Scharlach, Kellam, Ong, Baskin, Goldstein, &amp; Fox, 2006</xref>), norms of familial responsibility for care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264312474038">Bradley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898264312474038">Connell &amp; Gibson, 1997</xref>), and fewer economic resources, particularly in relation to the use of HCBS that are not covered by Medicare or Medicaid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898264312474038">Dunlop et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Framed by the Behavioral Model of Health Services and Access to Care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264312474038">Andersen, 1995</xref>) and using data from a representative sample of older adults living in Detroit, Michigan, this study addresses gaps in the literature for urban African American elders by examining the factors associated with their utilization of HCBS and exploring whether these factors differ by category of service. Facilitators and barriers to service utilization among older African Americans may potentially differ from those of older Whites and thus should be examined separately. With the exception of a study of urban African Americans two decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898264312474038">Richardson, 1992</xref>) research on HCBS utilization includes predominantly White participants (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898264312474038">Houde, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264312474038">Mitchell &amp; Krout, 1998</xref>) and therefore little is known about African Americans, such as those living in urban neighborhoods.In addition, different factors may play different roles depending on the type of HCBS examined. For example, health status may have the greatest influence on the use of home health care, while other economic and social factors may be associated with the utilization of out-of-home services, such as congregate meals and senior centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264312474038">Johnson &amp; Wolinsky, 1996</xref>). Few studies, however, have explored whether predictors of service use vary between types of HCBS (for exceptions see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264312474038">Johnson &amp; Wolinsky, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264312474038">Mitchell &amp; Krout, 1998</xref>). It is important to understand potential differences in the facilitators of different types of HCBS because, as highlighted in the Older Americans Act, which is a major source of assistance for older adults, a wide array of programs contributes to older adults maintaining their health, independence and dignity, and avoiding unnecessary institutionalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898264312474038">Administration on Aging, 2012</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-0898264312474038">
<title>Background and Significance</title>
<p>Nearly all older adults want to remain in the community and avoid institutionalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898264312474038">Feldman, Oberlink, Simantov, &amp; Gursen, 2004</xref>), and evidence shows that the use of HCBS can delay or prevent nursing home placement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898264312474038">Gaugler, Kane, Kane, &amp; Newcomer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898264312474038">Jette, Tennstedt, &amp; Crawford, 1995</xref>). With the increasing availability of HCBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898264312474038">Shirk, 2006</xref>) and lessened ability of families to meet the assistance needs of older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0898264312474038">Spillman &amp; Pezzin, 2000</xref>), it is important to examine the factors associated with the use of HCBS by older adults.</p>
<p>Current demographic changes call attention to the need to understand the particular facilitators of HCBS use among urban African American elders living in cities such as Detroit. First, the percentage of the older adult population that is African American is expected to increase in the coming decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898264312474038">He, Sengupta, Velkoff, &amp; DeBarros, 2005</xref>). By 2050 a projected 12% of older adults will be African American compared to 9% today, while 58% will be non-Hispanic White, down from 80% today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264312474038">Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, 2012</xref>). Second, evidence suggests that older African Americans, particularly those at a low socioeconomic status, are in greater need of assistance than White older adults. Despite the general decline in disability among older adults, racial and ethnic disparities remain largely unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0898264312474038">Schoeni, Martin, Andreski, &amp; Freedman, 2005</xref>). For example, the proportion of African Americans with limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs) is higher than that of Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898264312474038">Dunlop, Song, Manheim, Daviglus, &amp; Chang, 2007</xref>). These disparities in disability are purportedly the result of variations in income and education levels between these two racial groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898264312474038">Fuller-Thompson, Nuru-Jeter, Minkler, &amp; Guralnik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0898264312474038">Schoeni et al., 2005</xref>). Third, African Americans have typically had lower rates of nursing home placement than Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898264312474038">Akamigbo &amp; Wolinsky, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0898264312474038">Wallace, Levy-Storms, Kington, &amp; Andersen, 1998</xref>), but African Americans have accounted for an increasing percentage of the nursing home population in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898264312474038">Feng, Fennell, Tyler, Clark, &amp; Mor, 2010</xref>). It is possible that this also reflects differences in socioeconomic status, with older Whites better able to afford options such as assisted living, and older African Americans entering nursing homes because they are covered by Medicaid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898264312474038">Feng et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, African Americans and individuals with low socioeconomic status are more likely to live in nursing homes with fewer financial and staffing resources and greater regulatory deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898264312474038">Angelelli, Grabowski, &amp; Mor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898264312474038">Grabowski, 2004</xref>). Fourth, older adults tend to underutilize HCBS, with 30% of disabled community-dwelling elders reporting unmet needs for care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0898264312474038">Zarit, Shea, Berg, &amp; Sundstrom, 1998</xref>). Unmet needs may be even higher for African American elders living in urban neighborhoods in cities such as Detroit. For example, using data from 2000 and 2002, the Detroit Area Agency on Aging identified increasing the availability and accessibility of health and supportive services as a high priority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264312474038">Detroit Area Agency on Aging and Detroit Senior Citizens Department, 2004</xref>). Finally, African American households continue to be concentrated and segregated in inner city neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898264312474038">Goldsmith &amp; Blakely, 2010</xref>). For example, in 2000, more than 81% of the population of Detroit was African American, compared to a little over 14% for the state of Michigan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0898264312474038">United States Census Bureau, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Cultural issues may also be associated with service use among African Americans, such as the belief that HCBS reflect the dominant culture and are therefore uninformed of and unresponsive to the needs of African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0898264312474038">Scharlach et al., 2006</xref>). Past negative experiences with members of other cultures may reduce African American elders’ willingness to access services provided by those who are culturally different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0898264312474038">Yeatts, Crow, &amp; Folts, 1992</xref>). Furthermore, African Americans’ interest in receiving community-based services is impacted by familism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264312474038">Bradley, et al., 2002</xref>), defined as “reliance on family for support, obligation towards family members, and use of relatives as referents” (Magana, 1999, p. 466). Previous research has documented that African Americans believe that family members have the primary responsibility for providing care to aging relatives regardless of the particular needs or circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0898264312474038">Scharlach et al., 2006</xref>). These feelings of obligation, however, have been linked to higher levels of psychological distress among caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898264312474038">Rozario &amp; DeRienzis, 2008</xref>), suggesting that facilitating access to HCBS for African American elders could also benefit their family members.</p>

<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>This study was guided by the Behavioral Model of Health Services and Access to Care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264312474038">Andersen, 1995</xref>), the predominant theoretical framework in explorations of HCBS use among older adults (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264312474038">Bookwala et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264312474038">Borrayo, Salmon, Polivka, &amp; Dunlop, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898264312474038">Henton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264312474038">Mitchell &amp; Krout, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898264312474038">Mui &amp; Burnette, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0898264312474038">White-Means &amp; Rubin, 2004</xref>). According to this model, service use is a function of predisposing characteristics, enabling resources, and need for care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264312474038">Andersen, 1995</xref>). Predisposing characteristics include demographic measures (e.g., age and gender), indicators of social structure (e.g., education), and personal beliefs about health and health services. Enabling resources provide individuals with the means to obtain and make use of services, and include income, health insurance, access to transportation, and social resources. The need for care can be both perceived (e.g., self-rated physical health) and evaluated (e.g., diagnosed health conditions).</p>

<sec id="section4-0898264312474038">
<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>This study addresses two limitations in the existing literature on HCBS use by older adults. First, while researchers have explored racial and ethnic differences in service use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264312474038">Bradley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898264312474038">Henton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898264312474038">Houde, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264312474038">Mitchell &amp; Krout, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898264312474038">Mui &amp; Burnette, 1994</xref>), samples typically include a small number of African American respondents. Race is typically entered in multivariate models as a predisposing characteristic, which allows researchers to determine whether being African American is associated with service use but does not uncover the impact of predisposing, enabling, and need factors for African Americans in particular. When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0898264312474038">Wallace and colleagues (1999)</xref> compared HCBS utilization of African American and White older women, however, they found significant differences between these groups in terms of predictors of service use. For example, the total number of services used by African American women was related primarily to their health conditions, while enabling resources such as being widowed or living with others were significantly associated with service use among White women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0898264312474038">Wallace et al., 1999</xref>). Second, few studies have investigated whether the impact of predisposing, enabling, or need factors vary by the specific type of HCBS, whether for the general population or specifically for African American older adults. Researchers who have constructed conceptually meaningful categories of HCBS report that predictors can differ for services depending on the specific needs they address (e.g., ADL limitations vs. social interaction) and the location of their delivery (e.g., in-home vs. out-of-home). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264312474038">Mitchell and Krout (1998)</xref>, for example, created categories of HCBS based on the extent to which they are discretionary. They found that need variables largely account for whether individuals use the least discretionary services (e.g., medical services), while predisposing and enabling variables play a role in determining whether older adults use more discretionary services (e.g., home-delivered meals). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264312474038">Johnson and Wolinsky (1996)</xref> determined that in-home service use is due primarily to health needs, while the use of out-of-home services is related mostly to factors that could be classified as predisposing or enabling.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was therefore to address the following research questions:</p>

<title>Data and Sample</title>
<p>We explored the above research questions through secondary analysis of data from the Detroit City-Wide Needs Assessment of Older Adults collected by the Center for Urban Studies for the Institute of Gerontology and the Center for Healthcare Effectiveness of Wayne State University (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264312474038">Chapleski, Massanari, &amp; Herskovitz, 2002</xref>). The needs assessment sample was a representative sample of noninstitutionalized persons aged 60 years or older, and was designed to reflect those eligible for Older Americans Act programs to help the city plan more effectively for their service needs. Details about the data collection procedures for the Detroit needs assessment are reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264312474038">Chapleski et al., 2002</xref>). Briefly, data were collected during 2001 via telephone interviews with a stratified random digit dialing sample of 1,310 older adults and via in-person interviews with 100 older adults living in census tracts with low telephone coverage. The stratified sample targeted city-designated neighborhood area clusters, and we used poststratified sampling weights in the present analyses so that that all areas of the city of Detroit were represented in the research analyses in proportion to the total population of eligible respondents.</p>
<p>Because we were interested in uncovering the factors associated with service use among urban African American elders, we restricted analyses to the 1,126 respondent who were African American. We also deleted 22 cases that were missing data on service use, our outcome variable of interest. The final sample, reflecting poststratified sampling weights, was <italic>n</italic> = 1,099.</p>

<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>Based on the Andersen model, we selected predictor variables reflecting predisposing characteristics, enabling resources, or indicators of need.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0898264312474038">
<title>Predisposing characteristics</title>
<p>The three predisposing demographic characteristics were gender (<italic>male</italic> = 0, <italic>female</italic> = 1), age in years, and educational attainment (high school graduate, some college or higher, and less than a high school diploma as the reference group).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0898264312474038">
<title>Enabling</title>
<p>Enabling resources that facilitate or impede the use of services included indicators of financial resources, measures of health insurance, mobility, and social resources. Financial resources at the individual level included a dichotomous measure indicating whether the respondent lived in a low-income household. We constructed this variable by dividing annual household income (reported as one of 12 categories ranging from less than US$5,000 to more than US$50,000) by number of individuals in the household and then determining whether this number was less than 125% of the poverty rate for the year 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898264312474038">Dalaker, 2001</xref>). The needs assessment included 10 questions about the existence of common housing problems (e.g., inadequate heat in winter, nonworking, or leaking toilet) and 9 questions about the existence of common neighborhood problems (e.g., heavy traffic, abandoned buildings), which could both be indicators of limited financial resources at the individual and neighborhood level. We measured these as two count variables and top-coded each to range from 0 to 5 because they had a nonnormal distribution. The specific items included in each of these measures were selected for inclusion in the needs assessment because of their proposed relationship to health, life satisfaction, and the ability to age in place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264312474038">Chapleski et al., 2002</xref>). Medicaid coverage was measured as a dummy variables (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>). We included a measure of whether or not the respondent reported driving as their primary mode of transportation (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>). Social resources included a dichotomous variable indicating whether the respondent lived alone (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>). We measured anticipated instrumental assistance from family and friends using three dichotomous variables indicating someone is available for short term, long term, and emergency help (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0898264312474038">
<title>Need</title>
<p>We selected three aspects of the respondent’s physical health and well-being to indicate potential need for HCBS: total number of health conditions, self-rated health, and limitations in activities. The total number of health conditions was measured by whether the respondent had any of five common serious chronic conditions affecting the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264312474038">Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, 2012</xref>): chronic bronchitis or emphysema, heart problems, stroke, diabetes, and cancer. We transformed the individual measures into a count variable ranging from 0 to 5. Self-rated health came from a single-item Likert-type scale measure in the needs assessment (1 = <italic>poor</italic>, 2 = <italic>fair</italic>, 3 = <italic>good</italic>, 4 = <italic>very good</italic>, 5 = <italic>excellent</italic>). The needs assessment also asked respondents to rate the degree to which their health limited their ability to engage in moderate activities, such as vacuuming, moving a table, bowling, or playing golf (1 = <italic>not limited at all</italic>, 2 = <italic>limited a little</italic>, 3 = <italic>limited a lot</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0898264312474038">
<title>Service Use</title>
<p>The needs assessment included 13 questions (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>) regarding whether respondents had used any of the following services within the past 12 months: senior center, chore/homemaker services, congregate meals, home-delivered meals, home repair, utility bill assistance, home health care, free transportation, health screening, educational services, employment services, legal services, and financial services. The interview included examples of specific services to clarify the different types for respondents (e.g., home health care examples included visiting nurses or health aides, chore/homemaker service examples included light housekeeping or cleaning). Due to the low rates of service use among this sample, which limited our ability to examine the factors associated with use separately for each type of service, we constructed six outcome measures. The first outcome was a dichotomous measure indicating whether the respondent had used any of the 13 services (0 = <italic>none</italic>, 1 = <italic>at least one</italic>). The remaining five outcome measures were constructed to reflect a modified version of HCBS categories devised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264312474038">Bookwala et al. (2004)</xref>: in-home care (home health care), functional care (chore/homemaker services, home-delivered meals), household-related services (home repair, utility bill assistance), out-of-home services (congregate meals, senior center, free transportation, health screening, education services, and employment services), and a separate category for financial and legal services. We coded each of these five outcomes as a dichotomous measure of whether the survey participant had used any of the services included in each category (0 = <italic>none</italic>, 1 = <italic>at least one</italic>). While we initially conducted an exploratory factor analysis to create service categories, we found only modest correlations between service types and decided that a data-driven approach was not appropriate for the present analyses. We therefore chose to use conceptually developed categories informed by the prior work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264312474038">Bookwala and colleagues (2004)</xref>.</p>

<title>Data Analysis Procedures</title>
<p>To obtain accurate statistics and standard errors, all analyses used SVY commands in Stata Statistical Software Release 12 to take into account the needs assessment sampling design. After examining the patterns of missing data and concluding that the data were missing at random, we addressed missing data among predictor variables using the multiple imputations by chained equations (MICE) procedure. This procedure constructed five complete data sets and then adjusted for the effects of missing data on statistical inference. We used logistic regression models to estimate the effects of predisposing, enabling, and need variables for the six dichotomous outcome variables (i.e., any service use, in-home care services, functional care services, household services, out-of-home care services, financial/legal). We assessed goodness of fit using the Hosmer–Lemeshow test, which indicated that the overall model fit for each of the five models was acceptable. Tolerance and variance inflation factor (VIF) results indicated multicollinearity was not a concern with predictor variables. We used an α of .05 for statistical tests.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using a representative sample of elders living in Detroit, the aims of our study were: (a) to examine the predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics associated with the use of HCBS among African American older adults and (b) to explore whether these characteristics differed by the type of HCBS used. While our sample did not allow us to compare differences between Whites and African Americans, it did provide the opportunity for a closer examination of facilitators of HCBS use for older African Americans, who historically have not been the focus of service use research. Furthermore, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264312474038">Bradley and colleagues (2002)</xref>, much of the research on how race influences service use has focused on traditional long-term care services that address health and personal care assistance, rather than the wide range of HCBS examined in the current study, which we selected to reflect the variety of services provided through the Older Americans Act.</p>
<p>In terms of the first aim, with a few exceptions (discussed below) for this sample of African American elders, the use of different types of HCBS was related primarily to the lack of enabling resources. Previous research has reported that need factors (e.g., health conditions, functional status) typically play the largest role in determining whether older adults use services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264312474038">Borrayo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898264312474038">Mui &amp; Burnette, 1994</xref>; Wolinsky &amp; Johnson, 1991). When compared with findings from other studies, the majority of which included predominantly White samples (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264312474038">Borrayo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898264312474038">Houde, 1998</xref>), our results potentially signal that the association between predisposing, enabling and need factors, and HCBS utilization differs for older adults who are African American. Of particular importance were potential indicators of limited financial resources, not driving a car, and the absence of social resources and support.</p>
<p>First, while there was no significant association between low household income and service use, three potential proxies for limited financial resources appeared to serve as facilitators in several of the regression models. Those who reported more neighborhood problems, such as litter, abandoned buildings, heavy traffic, and crime, were more likely to use any services, as well as household services and financial/legal services. While perceived environment is not typically included in studies of service use, recent conceptualization of the behavioral model has called attention to the role community characteristics can play in terms of predisposing, enabling, and need for services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264312474038">Andersen, 2008</xref>). Prior research has found that neighborhood problems are associated with negative individual outcomes, including depression, physical functioning, and unhealthy behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898264312474038">Echeverria, Diez-Roux, Shea, Borrell, &amp; Jackson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0898264312474038">Yen, Yelin, Katz, Eisner, &amp; Blanc, 2006</xref>). Those who live in neighborhoods with more problems may therefore have an increased need for HCBS that was not captured by the need variables we included in our models (e.g., self-rated health). That is, while we categorized neighborhood problems as a potentially enabling resource, the observed relationship may be because more neighborhood problems leads to poor physical and mental health, which in turn leads to more service use.</p>
<p>Another explanation, as suggested by the positive association between Medicaid and service use, is that more neighborhood problems signifies increased access to HCBS. Older adults who are not low income get little assistance with paying for HCBS, because private insurance and Medicare primarily cover acute care services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898264312474038">Komisar &amp; Thompson, 2007</xref>). Those who meet the income and asset requirements for Medicaid, however, may receive HCBS offered through waiver programs, although access can be limited by enrollment caps and restricted availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898264312474038">Komisar &amp; Thompson, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, many of the HCBS in our study may be funded by the Older Americans Act, including senior centers, transportation, and home-delivered meals. While Older Americans Act services are available to all individuals age 60 or older, states are required to target services to persons with the greatest social or economic needs.</p>
<p>Second, those who reported driving as their primary mode of transportation were less likely to use any services, functional care, or out-of-home services, meaning that those who depended on alternative forms of transportation (e.g., friends, public transportation, walking) were more likely to use these services. While it is not possible to determine whether those who reported that they do not drive had to give up driving versus never drove a car in the first place, or the specific reasons why they do not drive a car, this finding may also indicate an increased need for HCBS that we did not capture in our need variables. Older adults consistently report that they plan to continue driving for as long as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898264312474038">Kostyniuk &amp; Shope, 2003</xref>), and typically reduce or stop driving only when health problems (e.g., cognitive limitations, declining vision) impair their ability to safely operate a vehicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898264312474038">Lynott et al., 2009</xref>). Older adults in our sample who were still driving may be less likely to use services because they were less likely to need services. Results could also reflect decreased access to the community, since older nondrivers make 15% fewer trips for medical appointments and 65% fewer trips for social, community, or religious activities than their driving counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0898264312474038">United States Government Accountability Office, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, the potential absence of social resources, as indicated by living alone, increased the likelihood of service use (including any services, functional care, and out-of-home services), while perceived instrumental support, as indicated by the belief that someone would help for a short period of time, decreased the odds of use of in-home services. These results suggest support for the hierarchical compensatory model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898264312474038">Cantor &amp; Little, 1985</xref>), which proposes that older adults do not use formal services unless they either do not have informal sources of support, or their particular assistance needs exceed the ability of informal services. That is, older adults turn to their social resources before seeking professional help. Existing research on the relationship of social resources to support with formal care is somewhat contradictory. For example, some studies report that formal care substitutes for informal care, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0898264312474038">Van Houtven &amp; Norton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264312474038">Johnson &amp; Wolinsky, 1996</xref>) while others report no evidence of an inverse relationship between formal and informal support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898264312474038">Li, 2005</xref>; Penning, 2002). Given that African Americans typically rely on family members for care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898264312474038">Connell &amp; Gibson, 1997</xref>), it is possible that social isolation was a motivating factor for service use in this sample, and future research should explore the relationship between informal support and formal support among older African Americans.</p>
<p>In terms of the second aim, many previous studies have not differentiated services by their location (e.g., in-home or out-of-home) and the needs they aim to address (e.g., health, functional care, household), but our findings suggest that the factors associated with HCBS use differ by service type among African American elders in Detroit. In many ways, these findings were not unexpected. For example, health need, indicated by the number of chronic illnesses and limitations in moderate activities, was positively associated with the use of in-home services and functional care, but not with other categories of services (with the exception of limitations in moderate activities’ negative association with out-of-home services). These findings and those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264312474038">Johnson and Wolinsky (1996)</xref> indicate that the use of more traditional forms of long-term care may not differ between African Americans and other racial/ethnic groups, although it was not possible for us to test this with our sample. Household-related services (e.g., utility bill assistance) as well as financial and legal services address economic needs and therefore use was associated with potential proxies of financial limitations (e.g., Medicaid, neighborhood problems). Out-of-home services, including senior centers, transportation, and employment services, address both social and economic needs, and indeed measures of both (e.g., living alone and neighborhood problems) increased the likelihood of using services in this category.</p>
<p>Findings of the current study should be interpreted in light of its limitations. First, because fewer than 200 respondents in this representative sample of Detroit elders were White, it was not possible to conduct subanalyses to examine differences in the facilitators and barriers to HCBS use between African Americans and Whites. Because previous research suggests that different factors influence service use in these two racial groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264312474038">Bradley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898264312474038">Dunlop et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0898264312474038">Musa et al., 2009</xref>), we decided not to combine African American and White respondents in the same model. Future research should address this limitation by including adequate numbers of White and African American respondents. Second, prior studies using the behavioral model typically report the percent of variance explained by predisposing, enabling, and need factors. It is not possible in Stata 12, however, to compute the pseudo-R2 for logistic models when using SVY commands to reflect the sampling design. Third, the survey data did not include questions about certain factors that may be related to service use (e.g., limitations in activities of daily living), and used self-report, cross-sectional data. Fourth, the needs assessment did not include proxy respondents, and therefore may have excluded older adults who are frail, disabled, or chronically ill. Finally, findings should be compared with research on urban African American populations living in other cities than Detroit.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this study calls attention to the facilitators and barriers to HCBS use among a sample of urban African American elders. Understanding the factors contributing to the use of HCBS by this population is particularly important given the increased focus on keeping elders in the community and out of institutions, which is in response to a confluence of factors, including: (a) the Supreme Court’s Olmstead decision in 1999, which called for an end to unnecessary institutionalization of individuals with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0898264312474038"><italic>Olmstead v. L.C.</italic>, 1999</xref>); (b) the need for local, state, and federal governments to curtail rising long-term care costs, particularly in nursing homes, which cost an average of over US$87,000 annually per resident in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898264312474038">MetLife Mature Markey Institute, 2011</xref>); and (c) the large numbers of older adults who express a desire to age in place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898264312474038">Feldman et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, in cities such as Detroit, high rates of morbidity and mortality among older adults suggest a greater need for health and supportive services, while the closure of 16 nursing homes in the past 13 years indicates fewer options for institutional care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898264312474038">Detroit Area Agency on Aging, 2012</xref>). It is therefore critical that these elders receive a wide range of HCBS to address their health, economic, and social needs. Our findings suggest that targets for intervention differ depending on the particular economic, social, and health needs of older African Americans, and that these differences are not apparent when looking at all the types of services together.</p>
