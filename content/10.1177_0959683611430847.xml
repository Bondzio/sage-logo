<abstract>
<p>The Song Hong (Red River) delta, northern Vietnam, is characterized by huge natural levees in an area of the delta plain known as the West Floodplain where fluvial sedimentation predominates. The natural levees along the Day River, a major distributary of the Song Hong, are comparable in size with those of the main course of the Song Hong. The Day River levees are 3–8 km wide and rise 2–5 m above the adjacent backswamps and have played an important role in human settlements since the late Metal age. We discussed the relationships among the natural levees of the Day River, delta progradation and the distribution of archaeological sites on the delta plain. During the early Holocene, the accumulation of sediment discharged by the Song Hong enhanced both aggradation of the floodplain and river mouth progradation within the drowned valley of the Song Hong. Radiocarbon dates from cores, trench exposures, and archaeological sites record a dramatic slowing of aggradation when sea level stabilized during 6–4 cal. kyr BP (the Holocene sea-level highstand). As sea level fell to the present level during 4–0 cal. kyr BP, the river mouth prograded rapidly toward the Gulf of Bac Bo (Gulf of Tonkin) and the river channels extended seaward. In the West Floodplain, lateral accretion overtook vertical accretion to generate the present longitudinal profiles of the Song Hong and Day rivers. During this period, human settlements spread across the backswamp and Holocene terrace area, lagging around 2 kyr behind the shoreline migration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Alluvial floodplains are very sensitive to both global hydroclimatic changes and variability of local factors such as sea-level change, tectonic movement, sedimentation, and human activities. Natural levees border almost all river channels that are occasionally flooded. Typically, they are wedge-shaped ridges of alluvial sediment that are highest at or near the channel margin and gradually taper downward towards the adjacent backswamps. Because they add height to river banks and tend to be densely vegetated, levees help to stabilize channels, and their physical properties are important for engineering structures, human dwellings, and agricultural activity.</p>
<p>The Song Hong (Red River) delta lies on the western coast of the Gulf of Bac Bo (Tonkin) on the margin of the South China Sea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611430847">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611430847">b</xref>). In terms of area, it is the fourth largest delta in Southeast Asia, after the Mekong, Irrawaddy, and Chao Phraya deltas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683611430847">Sakurai, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959683611430847">Tsubouchi, 1980</xref>). The present Song Hong delta plain has been divided into wave-, tide-, and fluvial-dominated systems on the basis of surface topography and hydraulic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683611430847">Mathers and Zalasiewicz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683611430847">Mathers et al., 1996</xref>). The fluvial-dominated system is in the northwestern part of the delta and is composed of meandering rivers, natural levees, backswamps, and fluvial terraces. The fluvial-dominated area, called the West Floodplain or Casier de Hadong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683611430847">Gourou, 1936</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683611430847">Sakurai, 1979</xref>), contains natural levees along the main Song Hong channel and the Day River, a major distributary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611430847">Funabiki et al., 2007</xref>). Their natural levees on the delta plain are comparable in size with those of other large rivers in Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683611430847">Brierley et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683611430847">Coleman, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683611430847">Oketani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959683611430847">Umitsu, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959683611430847">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). The natural levees are 3–8 km wide and rise 2–5 m above the adjacent backswamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611430847">Figure 1</xref>). The West Floodplain has been a centre of cultivation since the late Metal age (2.5–2 cal. kyr BP) when humans began farming on the delta plain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611430847">Funabiki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683611430847">Sakurai, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611430847">1980a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683611430847">1980b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683611430847">1989</xref>).</p>

<p>In the alluvial plains on large deltas such as the Huanghe (Yellow River), Ganges-Brahmaputra, and Mekong deltas, natural levees formed after the middle Holocene. The Huanghe delta is characterized by huge amounts of sediment, originating from soil erosion in the Loess Plateau in its middle reaches. The river bed has been rising continuously as sediment deposits have caused channel avulsions, and now lies higher than the surrounding land in some reaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959683611430847">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). The width of the levees is ~10 km and their height is 5–10 m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683611430847">Syvitski and Kettner, 2011</xref>). In the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, natural levees were initiated after 4 kyr BP (uncalibrated date), after deltaic sediments filled the subsided Sylhet Basin and formed the present delta plain. The broadest levee, with a width of 20 km and relative height of 2–3 m, was formed by 300 <sc>bc</sc>. Other levees 0.5–2.5 km wide and 2–3 m high were present by the middle of the 18th century, consistent with formation by the shifting of channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683611430847">Goodbread et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959683611430847">Umitsu, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683611430847">1993</xref>). In the Mekong delta, natural levees are 0.5–2 km wide and several meters to 10 m high in relation to the neighboring backswamp along both abandoned and active distributaries in Cambodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683611430847">Oketani et al., 2007</xref>). They were deposited over the last 600–1000 years with accumulation rates of 4.0–6.7 mm/yr. This high accumulation rate is thought to reflect natural levee migration and aggradation associated with channel switching or an increase in sediment discharge due to human activities over the past 1000–2000 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683611430847">Tamura et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The Song Hong delta has a relatively high and wide natural levee system in the West Floodplain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611430847">Funabiki et al., 2007</xref>), and human settlement has a close relationship with these high levees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611430847">Sakurai, 1980a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683611430847">1980b</xref>). The natural levees in the West Floodplain are thought to have formed after 5 cal. kyr BP as a result of sea-level fall and human activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611430847">Funabiki et al., 2007</xref>), like natural levees in other large deltas. Here we discuss the age and history of the natural levees based on radiocarbon ages in and around the levees and we consider their relationships to delta evolution, and the distribution of archaeological sites.</p>

<title>Geological setting</title>
<p>The Song Hong delta is bordered by mountains composed of Precambrian crystalline rocks and Palaeozoic to Mesozoic sedimentary rocks and lies in a Neogene NW–SE-trending sedimentary basin that is approximately 500 km long and 50–60 km wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683611430847">Mathers and Zalasiewicz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683611430847">Mathers et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683611430847">Nielsen et al., 1999</xref>). The NW–SE alignment of the Red River fault system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683611430847">Rangin et al., 1995</xref>) controls the distribution of the mountainous areas, sedimentary basin, drainage area, and the gross trend of the course of the Song Hong within the delta plain. Upstream from the delta plain the sedimentary basin is small, and most sediments flow to the delta plain. The basin is filled with Neogene and Quaternary sediments of more than 3 km thickness and is subsiding at 0.04–0.12 mm/yr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683611430847">Mathers and Zalasiewicz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683611430847">Mathers et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683611430847">Tran and Dinh, 2000</xref>). The Quaternary sequence unconformably overlies the Neogene deposits and is mostly sand and gravel with subordinate lenses of silt and clay; the sequence thickens seaward to a maximum of 200 m at the coast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683611430847">Mathers et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The Song Hong drowned valley, formed during the last glacial maximum, is mainly to the southwest of the present Song Hong channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al., 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683611430847">2003b</xref>) and follows approximately the present course of the Day River (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611430847">Figure 1a</xref>). The narrow, elongate valley is oriented NW–SE; it is approximately 20 km wide and more than 80 m deep at the present river mouth area, and about 20 m deep near Hanoi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611430847">Funabiki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683611430847">Lam and Boyd 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al., 2006</xref>). The present course of the Song Hong was a distributary of the main channel during the Holocene. On the eastern side of the drowned valley there is a buried Pleistocene terrace about 15 m below present sea level (PSL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611430847">Funabiki et al., 2007</xref>). The drowned valley is successively filled with lowstand, transgressive, and highstand deposits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683611430847">Mathers and Zalasiewicz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683611430847">Mathers et al., 1996</xref>), whereas the surrounding sediments are mostly highstand deposits of massive clay intercalated with peaty organic layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683611430847">Lam and Boyd, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683611430847">2003</xref>). During the last glacial maximum, sea level was about 120 m below PSL. It rose to approximately 50, 30, 15, and 5 m below PSL at about 11, 10, 9, and 8 cal. kyr BP, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al., 2003b</xref>). During 15–9 cal. kyr BP, transgressive aggradational and retrogradational fluvial and estuarine sediments were deposited above the coarse-grained lowstand fluvial sediments. Delta formation was initiated near Hanoi at about 9 cal. kyr BP, coinciding with a deceleration of postglacial sea-level rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al., 2006</xref>). Since then, the deltaic sequences have prograded and expanded laterally to form the present-day Song Hong delta. Sea level reached PSL at <italic>c</italic>. 7 cal. kyr BP. Then, after attaining a high of 2–3 m above PSL during 6–4 cal. kyr BP (the Holocene sea-level highstand), sea level fell to PSL over the period 4–0 cal. kyr BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al., 2003b</xref>). As the delta prograded, the river-mouth morphology changed from funnel-shaped to a straight coastline at 6 cal. kyr BP when the hydrologic regime shifted from a tide-dominated bay-head setting to a wave-influenced open-coast setting. The rate of progradation then declined from 22 to 4 m/yr and the river mouth became lobate at 2 cal. kyr BP, largely in response to an increase of sediment discharge from the Song Hong from 17 Mt/yr at 9 cal. kyr BP to 27 Mt/yr at 2 cal. kyr BP, and then to 49 Mt/yr from 2 cal. kyr BP to the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al., 2006</xref>). The increase of sediment discharge during this period was a result of anthropogenic deforestation of the upper reaches of the Song Hong drainage basin.</p>

<title>Climate and hydrology</title>
<p>The Song Hong drains an area of 160 km<sup>2</sup> × 103 km<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683611430847">Milliman et al., 1995</xref>). It originates in the mountains of Yunnan Province, China, at an elevation above 2000 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611430847">Figure 1a</xref>) and flows 1200 km to the South China Sea. The total sediment and water discharges from the Song Hong are 100–130 Mt/yr and 120 km<sup>3</sup>/yr, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683611430847">Milliman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683611430847">Pruszak et al., 2002</xref>), and the average sediment concentration in the river water is 1.08 kg/m<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al., 2006</xref>). The water discharge varies seasonally because of the subtropical monsoon climate over most of the drainage area. At Hanoi gauging station, water discharge reaches a maximum of about 23,000 m<sup>3</sup>/s in July–August and a minimum of around 700 m<sup>3</sup>/s during the January–May dry season. Approximately 90% of the annual sediment discharge occurs during the summer monsoon season, at which time sediment concentration in the river water may reach 12 kg/m<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683611430847">Mathers and Zalasiewicz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683611430847">Mathers et al., 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>Longitudinal profiles of the Song Hong and Day rivers</title>
<p>Longitudinal profiles of two rivers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611430847">Figure 1c</xref>) were compiled starting from Son Tay, where the Song Hong flows from an area of Pleistocene terraces onto the alluvial plain. This figure is based on the elevation of water areas in the river channels as shown in topographic maps, approximating the average water levels.</p>
<p>About 20 km downstream from Son Tay, the Day River emerges as a distributary of the Song Hong at 10 m above PSL. Along the Song Hong in the area of elevated levees, which occupies the northern half of the area between the Song Hong and Day rivers, the average gradient is 1/10,000 and it falls from 10 to 5 m elevation. The average gradient of the Song Hong across the West Floodplain is 1/100,500. The profile of the Day River in the area of elevated levees is similar to that of the Song Hong, and the average channel gradient is 1/12,500 with elevation declining from 10 to 5 m. From the point of divergence of the two rivers to Phu Ly at the southern limit of the West Floodplain, the average gradient of the Day River, at 1/125,000, is gentler than that of the Song Hong.</p>
<p>During 1934–1937, a movable dam and sluice gates were constructed to isolate the Day River from the Song Hong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683611430847">Bureau of Flood Control Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683611430847">Sakurai, 1979</xref>). The dam is usually closed so that the water source of the Day River is limited to the West Floodplain. During severe flooding in 1971, the dam was opened to divert some of the flow of the Song Hong and save Hanoi City from severe flood damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683611430847">Haruyama et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683611430847">Sakurai, 1979</xref>). The water level of the Day River during the 1971 flood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611430847">Figure 1c</xref>) indicates that the river carried more water then than now. In historical documents, the Day River is often referred to as a main shipping route from Hanoi to the South China Sea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683611430847">Sakurai, 1980b</xref>).</p>

<p>Using GIS software TNTmips (MicroImage, Inc.), we plotted the locations of archaeological sites (from the data base of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683611430847">Nishimura and Nishino, 2003</xref>), previously studied cores (PD and DA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611430847">Funabiki et al., 2007</xref>), and trench exposures (HN-1 and CS-LAM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683611430847">Lam and Boyd, 2008</xref>) on a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation map of the study area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611430847">Figure 2</xref>). Although the width of natural levees of both Song Hong and Day River are almost same in the West Floodplain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611430847">Figure 3</xref>), the incised valley course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611430847">Figure 1a</xref>) and longitudinal profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611430847">Figure 1c</xref>) suggest that the Day River should be the former main course of the delta. Thus, we chose the location in the West Floodplain mainly along the Day River, for collection of additional core and trench exposure samples for determination of radiocarbon ages. These data were collected and analyzed during 2003–2006.</p>

<p>During core and trench exposure sampling we compiled detailed logs of lithology and sedimentary structures, which we compared with the results of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611430847">Funabiki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683611430847">Hori et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683611430847">Jusseret et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683611430847">Lam, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al., 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683611430847">2003b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611430847">2006</xref>). Then, we combined the sedimentary facies and radiocarbon dates from our samples and the previous studies mentioned above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611430847">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611430847">3</xref>). We obtained 16 new radiocarbon ages (analyses by Beta Analytic Inc.) from peaty organic material, freshwater shells, and organic sediments in the cores we collected. From these and the data from cores PD and DA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611430847">Funabiki et al., 2007</xref>), we determined calibrated radiocarbon ages by using the CALIB 6.0.1. algorithm of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959683611430847">Stuiver et al. (1998)</xref>. Some samples were too small to determine δ<sup>13</sup>C. However, all conventional radiocarbon ages were corrected for isotopic fractionation effects. All ages are reported as calibrated radiocarbon ages (cal. kyr BP) unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p>We also compiled radiocarbon ages determined in previous archaeological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683611430847">Nishimura and Nishino, 2003</xref>) and those determined from trench exposures by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683611430847">Lam and Boyd (2008)</xref>. They are reported as measured ages and are from peat, wood, and charcoal. For conventional radiocarbon ages, we used δ<sup>13</sup>C of −25±2‰ for wood, organic material, and charcoal and −27±3‰ for peat and organic sediment following other measured data in this area as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683611430847">Polach (1976)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683611430847">Stuiver and Polach (1977)</xref>. The conventional radiocarbon age was calculated using the radiocarbon decay equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683611430847">Stuiver and Polach, 1977</xref>). A spreadsheet with the equation for this calculation was taken from the Calib website at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://calib.qub.ac.uk/calib/manual/chapter5.html">http://calib.qub.ac.uk/calib/manual/chapter5.html</ext-link>. Calibrated radiocarbon ages were calculated from the conventional age using CALIB 6.0.1.</p>
<p>To compare radiocarbon ages from archaeological sites to those obtained from trench exposures and cores, we needed to reconsider the prehistorical chronology defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683611430847">Nishimura and Nishino (2003)</xref>, who described the prehistorical periods of the Song Hong delta as</p>

</list>
<p>These divisions were all based on uncalibrated ages from wood or charcoal at archaeological sites. Considering these divisions and our calibration of the archaeological radiocarbon data of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683611430847">Nishimura and Nishino (2003)</xref> (see Appendix), we defined the early Neolithic, late Neolithic, early Metal, and late Metal ages as early Holocene–4.5 cal. kyr BP, 4.5–3.5 cal. kyr BP, 3.5–2.5 cal. kyr BP, and 2.5–2 cal. kyr BP, respectively. We set the beginning of the early Neolithic in the early Holocene, because the Hoabininian culture, which preceded the early Neolithic age, ended 10–7 kyr BP (uncalibrated) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683611430847">Nishimura and Nishino, 2003</xref>). In our discussion, we use these ages for those archaeological sites that lack accurate radiocarbon ages.</p>
<p>Based on the lithological data from cores and trench exposures, radiocarbon ages, and archaeological data, we compiled cross-sections showing approximate isochrons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611430847">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611430847">3</xref>). Four cross-sections are oriented SW–NE, perpendicular to the gross course direction of the Song Hong and Day rivers and their natural levees, and three are oriented NW–SE, subparallel to the long axes of the levees. Accumulation rates were calculated from the radiocarbon data to examine the rate of formation of the natural levees (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611430847">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<p>From the data described above, we considered the process of formation of the natural levees in relation to shoreline change and the distribution of archaeological sites (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611430847">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611430847">6</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Below, we referred seven cross-sections of the West Floodplain. Each section indicates the present- and paleo-morphology of the natural levees and baskswamp areas.</p>
<sec id="section8-0959683611430847">
<title>Line A</title>
<p>Line A runs through the natural levees of the Day River and Song Hong, which have oxbow lakes and abandoned channels on them. This line crosses the widest part of the Day River natural levees (about 8 km). Both the southwestern and northeastern ends of the line terminate on the Pleistocene terraces at an elevation above 10 m.</p>
<p>On the southwestern Pleistocene terrace, archaeological site HT29 is located at 8.75 m in elevation with a cultural layers of late Metal age (2.5–2 cal. kyr BP, depth unknown). Site HT25 shows evidence of late Neolithic (4.5–3.5 cal. kyr BP) settlement at 8.6 m in elevation on the natural levees of the Song Hong.</p>
<p>On the northeastern part of line A, archaeological site VP28 provides a late Metal age (2.5–2 cal. kyr BP, 10.1–10.2 m above PSL). At site HN3, a late Neolithic settlement was found at 9.0 m in elevation. They are located on the northeastern Pleistocene terrace, which is incised by the Ca Lo River.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0959683611430847">
<title>Line B</title>
<p>Line B is located 15 km south of the point of divergence of the Song Hong and Day rivers. It starts at the Pleistocene terrace and crosses the natural levees of the Day River, adjacent backswamp, and natural levees of the Song Hong. This line ends at the Pleistocene terrace on the left side of the Song Hong. The sediment thickness after the middle Holocene show less than 3 m in the Pleistocene terrace area, while it is 4 m at maximum in the backswamp area. Trench exposure HN extends to a depth of 1.1 m. We drilled core HN to a depth of 0.9 m beyond the bottom of the trench exposure. The core consists of mottled reddish brown clay that has been interpreted as a backswamp deposit (Fsc of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683611430847">Miall, 1992</xref>) or floodplain deposit with lateritic soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683611430847">Collinson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611430847">Funabiki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al., 2006</xref>). We obtained radiocarbon ages of 7.2 and 0.7 cal. kyr BP at elevations of 5.7 and 6.4 m, respectively. An earthenware fragment from the Ly Dynasty (1010–1225) was found in the trench exposure at an elevation of 6.1 m.</p>
<p>Archaeological sites HT42 and HT43 contain cultural layers from the late Metal (2.5–2 cal. kyr BP) and late Neolithic (4.5–3.5 cal. kyr BP) age, respectively, both at elevations higher than 5 m, indicating that less than 3 m of sediment has been deposited since the middle Holocene. HT43 site is covered with yellow soil and gravels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683611430847">Nishimura and Nishino, 2003</xref>) indicating the modern flood sediments from the surrounding Pleistocene terrace area.</p>
<p>In the backswamp, trench exposure LY is composed of a black peaty layer overlain by greyish blue to red mottled clay with abundant rootlets and gypsum crystallization at the top. It has been interpreted as floodplain deposits with lateritic soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683611430847">Collinson, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>We obtained a radiocarbon age of 5.8 cal. kyr BP from the peaty layer at 1 m above PSL. Archaeological site HT40 contains cultural layers of early Metal age (3.5–2.5 cal. kyr BP, 3.2 m above PSL) and late Metal age (2.5–2 cal. kyr BP). Charcoal from 4.4 m above PSL gave an age of 2.9 cal. kyr BP.</p>
<p>In the area of natural levees and abandoned channels, archaeological site HN53 provided a late Neolithic age (4.5–3.5 cal. kyr BP, 7.0 m above PSL), and at site HT26, a late-Neolithic stone artifact was found but its original depth is unknown.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0959683611430847">
<title>Line C</title>
<p>Line C extends northeast from a limestone mountain that marks the western edge of the West Floodplain. The area between the mountains and the Day River is marshy and is often inundated during the rainy season. This line goes through the Ho Tay lake, the widest part of natural levees of Song Hong (about 7 km wide), and adjacent backswamp.</p>
<p>Core TP is composed of reddish brown silt and sand with rootlets and gypsum crystallization at the top, and is intercalated with well-sorted very fine to fine sand beds at the bottom. Because of poor core recovery, sedimentary structures could not be identified. Sand beds in levee sediments, such as these, have been interpreted as possibly representing flood events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683611430847">Miall, 1996</xref>) or crevasse splay sediments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al., 2006</xref>). Sediment at the top of this site is interpreted as backswamp deposits (Fsc of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683611430847">Miall, 1992</xref>), or floodplain deposits with lateritic soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683611430847">Collinson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611430847">Funabiki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>We obtained radiocarbon ages of 9.8, 6.6, 5.7, and 5.3 cal. kyr BP from organic sediment at elevations of 3.7, 5.3, 5.7, and 6.9 m, respectively. The relatively old radiocarbon age of the highest sample suggests that, because this area is very close to the Pleistocene terrace, the Holocene basement might be shallower and the natural levee sediments thinner than in other areas. At site TH, radiocarbon ages were obtained of 6.8 cal. kyr BP from a greyish blue silty clay at an elevation of 0.5 m, and 7.4 cal. kyr BP from a reddish brown mottled silty sand at 2.5 m. This sequence has been interpreted as floodplain deposits with lateritic soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683611430847">Collinson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The lower part of trench exposure TV consists of an upward-fining succession from fine sand layers with climbing ripples to silt to clay, which indicate a high-sediment supply and relatively high-energy environment at the lower part. The succession might be interpreted as cut-off meandering channel fill sediments of a Song Hong distributary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al., 2006</xref>), or crevasse splay sediments. We obtained a radiocarbon age of 7.4 cal. kyr BP from organic silty sediment intercalated with the sand layers at 1.4 m elevation. Radiocarbon ages of 6.7 and 6.6 cal. kyr BP were obtained from wood and organic clay at 2.3 m elevation at site TV. The radiocarbon age of the wood is 0.1 kyr older than that of the organic clay. Two Holocene aquifer channels have been recognized east of the present Nhue River (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683611430847">Jusseret et al., 2009</xref>). They consist of gravel to fine sand and mottled reddish brown clay and are separated by clayey floodplain sediments. A series of abandoned channel courses beside the TV site and along the modern distributary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611430847">Figure 2</xref>) indicate that these sites are located on the filled cut-off meander channel of Song Hong and its distributaries. At archaeological site HN55, burial relics of late Metal age (2.5–2 cal. kyr BP, depth unknown) were found.</p>
<p>Between the natural levees of the Song Hong and Pleistocene terrace area, backswamp lies at the elevation of 5–7 m with archaeological sites, called Co Loa Archaeological sites group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683611430847">Nishimura and Nishino, 2003</xref>). Site HN35 is located on the eastern edge of natural levees at the elevation of 6 m and shows a cultural layer of late Neolithic age (4.5–3.0 cal. kyr BP, depth unknown). At site HN6, cultural layers of late Metal age (2.5–2 cal. kyr BP) located at the elevation of 4.5–4.7 m. The sites HN25, 22, 7 were found at the elevation of 5–7 m and contain the late Metal age cultural layers (2.5–2 cal. kyr BP, depth unknown). At site HN14, cultural layers from late Neolithic to late Metal were found at 5.6–6.5 m in elevation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0959683611430847">
<title>Line D</title>
<p>On line D, the natural levees of the Day River and Song Hong have elevations of 7–9 m, which is 2–4 m higher than the adjacent backswamp. This line runs from the natural levees of the Day River, continues through the backswamp and natural levees of Song Hong, and ends at the adjacent backswamp.</p>
<p>Trench exposure sites BG and DM both show repetitive sequences of fine sand, silt, and clay, interlaminated with peaty layers. Bioturbation or roots have disturbed the laminations in some places. The sequence is typical of the levee sediments classified as facies code Fl by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683611430847">Miall (1996)</xref>. Each sedimentary cycle represents a flood event. They reflect riding-and waning-stage deposits (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683611430847">Iseya and Ikeda, 1989</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611430847">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>At site DM, radiocarbon ages of 5.7 and 3.3 cal. kyr BP were obtained from peaty layers at elevations of 4.0 and 1.8 m, respectively. At site BG, radiocarbon ages of 5.5, 3.9, and 3.4 cal. kyr BP were obtained from organic sediments at elevations of 4.4, 5.4, and 6.1 m, respectively. At 4.4 and 6.1 m, freshwater shell fragments (Viviparidae gen. et sp. indet.) indicate an age of about 0.2 cal. kyr BP. Because these ages are much younger than those of the organic sediments, we concluded that the sediments had been reworked.</p>
<p>At archaeological sites HT54, 55, and 56, a cultural layer of late Metal age (2.5–2 cal. kyr BP) was found (depth unknown). At site HT57, a wood fragment from a late Metal age cultural layer at 3 m elevation gave a radiocarbon age of 2 cal. kyr BP. At trench exposure CS-LAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683611430847">Lam and Boyd, 2008</xref>), a radiocarbon age of 7.4 cal. kyr BP was obtained from peat at 2.3 m elevation. A 2.7 m thick greyish blue clay overlies the peat layer. Late Neolithic (4.5–3.5 cal. kyr BP) cultural layers were identified at elevations of 4.7 m at site HN65 and 5 m at site HN60, but their original depth is unknown. The backswamp area on the left side of the Song Hong are located at the elevation of 4–5 m, relatively lower than the right side. The archaeological sites HN46 and 47 show the late Metal age cultural layers (2.5–2 cal. kyr BP, depth unknown).</p>

<sec id="section12-0959683611430847">
<title>Line E</title>
<p>Line E starts from the Pleistocene terrace at the northern edge of the Song Hong Delta plain. This line crosses the natural levees of the Song Hong and Day River, and backswamp between two rivers. It ends at the backswamp on the left side of the Song Hong.</p>
<p>On the Pleistocene terrace, late Metal age (2.5–2 cal. kyr BP) and late Neolithic to early Metal (4.5–2.5 cal. kyr BP) cultural layers were found at archaeological sites VP50 and 49, but depth is unknown. At site VP54, brick tomb of late Metal (2.5–2 cal. kyr BP) was found at 9.6–9.5 m in elevation. The natural levees of the Song Hong are about 7 km. From the divergence point of two rivers to southward, the natural levees were fed by deposition of both two rivers.</p>
<p>Archaeological sites HT25, HT26, and HN53 show evidence of late Neolithic (4.5–3.5 cal. kyr BP) settlement at 8.6 m, unknown, and 7.0 m elevations, respectively. Along the southern part of line E, Holocene channel-fill sediments lie beneath the natural levees of the Song Hong at site TV. Sediments younger than 5 cal. kyr BP are grey to reddish mottled silty clay with black peaty layers and abundant rootlets, and have been interpreted as backswamp deposits (Fsc of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683611430847">Miall, 1992</xref>), or floodplain deposits with lateritic soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683611430847">Collinson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611430847">Funabiki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al., 2006</xref>).There are no archaeological sites on the natural levees of the Song Hong and backswamps on the left side of the Song Hong.</p>

<sec id="section13-0959683611430847">
<title>Line F</title>
<p>Line F extends southeast from the Pleistocene terrace. After crossing the Day River natural levee, this line runs longitudinally through the approximate centre of the backswamp region between the Song Hong and Day rivers, the natural levees of the Song Hong, and ends at the adjacent backswamp on the left side of the Song Hong.</p>
<p>Late Metal age (2.5–2 cal. kyr BP) cultural layers were found at elevations of 5.5, 1.8, and 4.0 m at sites HT34, HT31, and HT39, respectively. At site HT31, sandy soil covered the cultural layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683611430847">Nishimura and Nishino, 2003</xref>), indicating relatively high energy environment. This sandy soil might be influenced by the modern flood sediments from the Day River and distributaries. At sites HT33 and HT40, cultural layers of late Neolithic age (4.5–3.5 cal. kyr BP) were found at elevations of 5.1 and 3.2 m, respectively. At site HT40, a radiocarbon age of 2.9 cal. kyr BP was obtained from charcoal at an elevation of 4.4 m.</p>
<p>On the southern part of line F, late Metal age (2.5–2 cal. kyr BP) settlements (HT54, HT56, and HT57) can be observed and site HT is shallower than 1 m depth. In core DA, sediment younger than 6.3 cal. kyr BP forms a sequence of bioturbated grey to reddish brown clay, which is up to 3.5 m thick and contains peaty organic layers in its lower part and abundant rootlets in its upper part. This sequence corresponds to a lateritic weathering profile developed in floodplain and channel-levee sediments at the land surface of the core site and has been interpreted as modern floodplain sediments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611430847">Funabiki et al., 2007</xref>) and overlies tide-influenced channel-fill sediments of a deltaic sequence. A radiocarbon date of 6.3 cal. kyr BP was obtained from floodplain sediments from core DA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611430847">Funabiki et al., 2007</xref>) at 2 m above PSL.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0959683611430847">
<title>Line G</title>
<p>Line G runs from the Pleistocene terrace that marks northwestern edge of the West Floodplain. This line crosses the Day River for several times at the elevation of 7.5–10 m and contains natural levee sediments. On the southern part of this line, the center of the West Floodplain lies below 5 m in elevation. The southeastern end of this line reaches the natural levees of the Song Hong and adjacent backswamp.</p>
<p>At archaeological site HT17, the earliest evidence of a late Metal age settlement (2.5–2 cal. kyr BP) is below 7 m elevation. In core PD, mangrove swamp sediments older than 5 cal. kyr BP lie below PSL and are overlain by 7 m of reddish brown floodplain sediments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611430847">Funabiki et al., 2007</xref>). However, the adjacent natural levee sediments gave radiocarbon ages younger than 5 cal. kyr BP at 5 m elevation. Thus, we inferred that there was a local surface depression in the vicinity of the PD site at 5 cal. kyr BP.</p>
<p>The earliest evidence of early Metal age settlements (3.5–2.5 cal. kyr BP) at site HT42 is at an elevation of 5.5 m. Fine reddish brown clay covered this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683611430847">Nishimura and Nishino, 2003</xref>), which is interpreted as floodplain sediments or surface soil. A miniature bronze drum (late Metal age, 2.5–2 cal. kyr BP) was found at site HT51 on a secondary natural levee at 5 m elevation, but the depth from which the drum was excavated is unknown. Bronze drums (late Metal age, 2.5–2 cal. kyr BP) were also found 3 m above PSL on backswamp at sites HT58 and HT98. The excavation depths of the drums are unknown.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>From the radiocarbon dates of the trench exposure and data from archaeological sites, we derived isochrons at the millennial scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611430847">Figure 3</xref>) and sediment-accumulation curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611430847">Figure 5</xref>), but did not take into account sediment compaction. On the basis of these figures, we first discuss sediment accumulation during the early Holocene (before 6 cal. kyr BP) and then discuss natural levee formation since the middle Holocene during a time of stable sea level. Lastly we discuss the relationship between natural developments and human settlement.</p>

<title>Sediment accumulation during the early Holocene</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611430847">Figure 5</xref> shows sediment accumulation and sea-level change during the Holocene. Early Holocene sea-level rise continued until approximately 6 cal. kyr BP. At 8 cal. kyr BP, the sea level was 5 m below PSL and rising, and at 6 cal. kyr BP it reached 2–3 m above PSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al., 2003b</xref>). Before this highstand, accumulation of estuarine and deltaic sediments was very rapid, with rates of 1.9–31.9 mm/yr (average 8 mm/yr), and kept pace with sea-level rise. This high accumulation rate indicates rapid aggradation of estuarine to deltaic sediments into a drowned valley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683611430847">Hori et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al., 2006</xref>). Similar aggradation during Holocene delta initiation is reported from the Mekong delta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683611430847">Tamura et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Floodplain accumulation since the middle Holocene</title>
<p>Before discussing sediment accumulation in the West Floodplain, we will summarize sediment accumulation based on radiocarbon dates and archaeological data for each profile line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611430847">Figure 3</xref>. The archaeological site HT25 in line A indicates low accumulation for the last 3–4 kyr on the natural levees of Song Hong. In the western part of line B, the Pleistocene terrace area, sites HN, HT42 and 43 show that there were very thin sediments from the last 7 cal. kyr. The accumulation rate appears to havebeen high for the last 1 kyr with ~1 m of sediment, which consists of mostly surface soil. The backswamp area in the middle part shows relatively high accumulation rates for the last 5 kyr in low-lying areas. However, the eastern part of the backswamp indicates no deposition for the last 3–4 kyr, which includes natural levees along the Song Hong (sites HN53 and HT26) with relatively high elevation. In line C, the accumulation curve of site TP at the edge of natural levees of the Day River indicates very rapid aggradation before 5 cal. kyr BP, followed by very little or no accumulation for the last 5 cal. kyr. The backswamp area in the middle part shows relatively slow accumulation, less than 1 m/kyr. In line D, although site BG near the Day River shows high accumulation rates at 1–0 kyr BP, this site is located in modern dykes and near main channels, thus it is interpreted as modern processes and reworking. The backswamp area in the middle part of line D shows ages of 2–4 cal. kyr BP for surficial sediments (e.g. sites HT57 and HN65), indicating that sedimentation was active before 2.5–2 cal. kyr BP and not active for the last 2 kyr. In line E, the northern part (Song Hong natural levees) and the middle backswamp area indicate that aggradation was active before ~4 kyr BP. Line F shows more or less continuous accumulation until 2 kyr BP and intermittent accumulation to the present. If the age of the surface of at site DA (elevation 5.5 m) is present, the site shows almost constant and continuous accumulation since 6.5 kyr BP. Line G shows a variety of accumulation patterns. Natural levee areas of the Day River show active accumulation before 6 kyr BP at site TP and 1–0 kyr BP at site BG, and active accumulation before 2 kyr BP for the southern part.</p>
<p>After 6 kyr BP, high accumulation rates of more than 1 m/kyr (1 mm/yr) are only recognized at sites TP (5–6 kyr BP), HT31 (2–0 kyr BP), BG (1–0 kyr BP), and only for natural levees or in-channel sediments. All other sites from sedimentary environments of natural levees, floodplains and backswamps show less than 1 m/kyr accumulation. The contrast in accumulation rates before and after 6 cal. kyr BP demarcates two clear stages in the history of the delta. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611430847">Figure 2</xref>, abandoned channels are located on both of the natural levees and backswamp areas forming the meandering belts. They suggest lateral accretion of the Day River and Song Hong after the middle Holocene.</p>
<p>In general, rivers aggrade in response to relative sea-level rise and degrade in response to relative sea-level fall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683611430847">Mackin, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683611430847">Petter and Muto, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683611430847">Mackin (1948)</xref> divided the causes of aggradation of the river channel into ‘upriver or watershed control’ and ‘downriver or base-level control’. In the incised valley of the Song Hong before the sea-level highstand at 6 cal. kyr BP, the rise in sea level caused aggradation by ‘base-level control’ and created ample accommodation space in fluvial to coastal plains. However, during stable sea level at 6–4 kyr BP and slightly falling sea level for the last 4 kyr, accommodation space was very limited; moreover, sea-level fall induced emergence of Holocene marine terraces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al., 2003b</xref>). Abandonment of the Day River natural levees at site TP site is linked to middle Holocene sea-level fall. The longitudinal profiles of the Day and Song Hong rivers show clear differences in water level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611430847">Figure 1c</xref>). The current Song Hong flows at a low level in relation to middle Holocene marine terraces, evidence of slight incision to fit the present sea level.</p>
<p>However, the Day River shows a higher water level, representing the abandoned natural levee level, therefore it may be occupying a relict geomorphology representing a higher middle Holocene sea level. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al. (2006)</xref>, ‘watershed control’ has occurred mainly after 2 cal. kyr BP, increasing the sediment discharge from 17–27 to 49 million t/yr because of deforestration and human activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683611430847">Li et al., 2006</xref>). As increased accumulation rates for the last 2 kyr are recognized only around sites LY and HT31, other than these local flooding sites fluvial sediments were directly transported to the sea resulting in delta development.</p>

<title>Shoreline change and distribution of archaeological sites</title>
<p>The interpreted palaeogeography of the Song Hong Delta at 8, 4, and 2 cal. kyr BP and the corresponding distributions of archaeological sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683611430847">Nishimura and Nishino, 2003</xref>) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611430847">Figure 6</xref>. Delta formation was initiated near Hanoi at about 9 cal. kyr BP, coinciding with a deceleration of postglacial sea-level rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683611430847">Hori et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al., 2006</xref>). Since then, the deltaic sequences have prograded and expanded laterally to form the present-day Song Hong delta. At 8 cal. kyr BP, the delta was funnel-shaped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611430847">Figure 6a</xref>) and most of the sediment discharged by the Song Hong began to accumulate in the river mouth, causing seaward progradation within the Song Hong drowned valley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al., 2006</xref>). The shoreline was near the site of core DA in the West Floodplain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611430847">Funabiki et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>Archaeological assemblages found in the mountains and on Pleistocene terraces at elevations above 10 m indicate that Hoabinhian (about 30 kyr BP to early Holocene) and pre-Neolithic (Late Pleistocene to early Holocene) settlements existed there at 8 cal. kyr BP. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611430847">Figure 6a</xref>). At the cessation of sea-level rise (6 cal. kyr BP), the river mouth morphology changed from funnel-shaped to a relatively straight coastline because the hydrologic regime shifted from a tide-dominated bay-head setting to a wave-influenced open-coast setting. The rate of progradation had decreased from 22 to 4 m/yr by this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611430847">Tanabe et al., 2006</xref>), which corresponds to the end of aggradation of floodplain sediments including natural levees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683611430847">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<p>After 4 cal. kyr BP, settlements of late Neolithic age (4.5–3.5 cal. kyr BP) were widespread on the West Floodplain, where their elevations above the southern coastal areas made them a suitable human habitat. In the West Floodplain, nine archaeological sites were located on the edge of natural levees, but not between the present artificial dykes, where is most elevated comparing the adjacent backswamp. In backswamp area, there are only three archaeological sites of the late Neolithic age. No archaeological sites can be seen on the eastern side of the present Song Hong. The distribution of archaeological sites indicates that emergence of the western delta plain preceded that of the eastern delta plain. This occurred because the fluvial sediment flux in the west was greater than in the east and the earlier development of natural levees in the west made the floodplain more suitable for human settlement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611430847">Funabiki et al., 2007</xref>). There are also some archaeological sites on beach ridges, where progradation of deltaic sediments began to develop a lobate delta in a wave-dominated open-coast setting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611430847">Figure 6b</xref>).</p>
<p>By 2 cal. kyr BP, land cultivation had commenced at human settlements, which spread across the backswamp area of the West Floodplain and Holocene terraces in the northeastern part of the delta plain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683611430847">Figure 6c</xref>). In the West Floodplain, archaeological sites spread mainly on the backswamp area. Eight of the late Metal age archaeological sites were found on the natural levees and 23 sites were recognized on the backswamp area.</p>
<p>In the coastal areas, settlement sites spread into these lowlands after the shoreline prograded seaward and the natural levees formed by 4 cal. kyr BP. Thus, there is a lag of 2 kyr between the settlement spread and shoreline migration. This time gap may be attributed to the physical conditions of the newly formed delta plain, which were not optimal for settlement because of wetlands, saltwater intrusion, and unstable shoreline.</p>
<p>The Song Hong delta plain was developed earlier than those of other large deltas in southeast Asia, as early as 2 cal. kyr BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683611430847">Sakurai, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959683611430847">Tsubouchi, 1980</xref>). Its broad floodplain and well-developed natural levees may have made it more suitable for agriculture and settlement.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We discussed the age and history of the natural levees based on radiocarbon ages in and around the levees and we considered their relationships to delta evolution, and the distribution of archaeological sites.</p>
<p>During the early Holocene, sediment discharged by the Song Hong enhanced both aggradation of floodplain and river-mouth progradation within the Song Hong drowned valley. Radiocarbon dates obtained from cores, trench exposures, and archaeological sites record a very high accumulation rate (aggradation) before 6 cal. kyr BP, which coincides with a period of sea-level rise, and a low accumulation rate after 6 cal. kyr BP, related to stable and falling sea level. Sedimentary records and topography show that the Day River was more active in the middle Holocene during a highstand of sea level, and the present relatively high topography may be relict topography.</p>
<p>Human settlement along the natural levees of the Song Hong delta started after 4 cal. kyr BP, and continued as sea level fell to the present level and the delta prograded rapidly seaward. During this period, the longitudinal profiles of the Song Hong and Day rivers were extended and vertical accretion of alluvial sediments ceased in the West Floodplain. Settlement sites spread on the lowland as the natural levees formed and extended seaward approximately 2000 years behind the shoreline migration.</p>
