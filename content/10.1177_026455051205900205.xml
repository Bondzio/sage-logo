In First Steps out of Gambling, Lisa Ustok and Joanna Hughes draw on professional experience, to address the issue of gambling addictions. It is therefore aimed at those wanting to develop the self-knowledge and skills to address a gambling addiction of their own or support another person. The authors indicate that they have written the book as they identified a lack of resources and help available for those who suffer with this particular problem.</p><p>The book is divided into ten chapters, each one designed to lead the reader further into self-awareness. It provides techniques and ways of thinking that are designed to enable the problem gambler to make steps towards a lifestyle free from their addiction. It is cognitive behavioural in its approach; designed to change problem behaviour through changing thinking and reactions. It is practical with ‘real-life’ stories of things that have worked for others, which are from different kinds of people which seem to make it more accessible. The book contains workable exercises to engage the reader with challenges to apply the theory to their own life situation.</p><p>It commences with a chapter providing the context, with background information about gambling, addressing the social acceptability of gambling and clarification as to what constitutes an ‘addiction’. It focuses on the prevalence and nature of gambling problems in society. It then moves into an assessment chapter whereby the reader is encouraged to explore what problems and issues gambling had led to in his or her own life. There is exploration of some of the downsides of gambling too much including debt, low self-esteem and relationships being affected. This rings true for those of us who have worked with people with addictive problems, and is backed up by research.</p><p>The next two chapters are designed to increase their motivation to change and to introduce the concept of goal setting. It does this through questions, stories, bitesize information passages and exercises such as listing pros and cons to changing.</p><p>Chapter 5 draws attention to the importance of obtaining and making use of the available support and it considers how to involve others in a positive way and how to avoid negative influences. It provides this in a sensitive way with clarity as to the particular nuances of social situations and settings that often surround the lifestyle of a problem gambler.</p><p>Later in Chapter 6 the focus turns to the importance of keeping a ‘gambling diary’ as a tool in bringing the gambling behaviour from the unconscious into the conscious and increasing self awareness. There is an opportunity to record thoughts, feelings and behaviour in order to provide opportunity to look from a different perspective. In Chapter 7 we are introduced to the cycle of change; well known to probation staff, and this is utilized as a means of measuring and encouraging progress.</p><p>The text provides a welcome resource of this often neglected area, with information about how to avoid relapse back into old behaviour and advice about what to do if the gambler slips. Information is given as to how to avoid using a momentary slip as a reason to totally relapse back to where they first started. This book gives insights into the specific nature of a gambling addiction in a way that does not shy away from the gritty reality of issues such as the strong element of ‘self denial’ in problem gamblers, without being judgmental or ‘preachy’, which means that the reader does not feel patronized or ‘got at’.</p><p>This book provides a lot of useful information and further places to go for help are outlined in the back of the book. It is helpful as a place to find out how to embark on the journey and begin to address a gambling addiction. It provides the initial steps to increase motivation to change and does not avoid the practical concerns that are involved in a major lifestyle change that is required in giving up gambling. Furthermore there is a section at the back of the book designed to be read by those supporting the problem gambler, particularly for family or friends. This acknowledges the difficulty of this role; the supporter may have suffered hurt or other difficult emotions through the problem gambler’s behaviour.</p><p>The publication of this book is timely as recent media reports have suggested gambling to be the fastest growing addiction with the rise of internet poker and online bingo. Certainly we are living in a climate where some have come to see gambling as an escape from life’s pressures, and the possibility of a ‘win’ providing the answer to financial problems. This book provides a great resource for practitioners throughout criminal justice and related fields.</p><sig-block><sig><bold>Elaine Smith</bold><break/><italic>Probation Officer, Gloucester Probation Trust</italic></sig></sig-block></body></article>
