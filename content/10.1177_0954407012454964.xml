<abstract>
<p>Since the homologation drive cycles are not all entirely representative of real everyday driving conditions, additional cycles must be used to properly quantify the energy consumption of electric vehicles. Three methodologies have been developed to objectively determine a limited number of additional drive cycles. The first methodology is based upon a simple comparison of velocity profiles expressed on the same time scale. The second is based on a correlation analysis of various statistical criteria defined for each cycle. Finally, the third methodology is based on an automatic clustering technique (<italic>K-means</italic> algorithm). These three methodologies have been used to analyse 18 drive cycles including official homologation cycles used in Europe (NEDC), Japan (JC08) and in the US (FTP72), and transient non-official cycles representing real world driving patterns (Artemis, Hyzem and Eurev cycles). When applied to these cycles, all these approaches allow the identification of a reduced number of five representative cycles enabling an efficient characterization in terms of the performance of electric vehicles in urban, extra-urban and highway conditions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In addition to optimizing vehicle consumption over homologated drive cycles, it is also important to take into account vehicle use in realistic, everyday driving conditions to characterize vehicle energy consumption. Such an approach is essential to enable car manufacturers to communicate realistic vehicle energy consumption figures to their customers. This is a particularly important topic for hybrid and pure electric vehicles which are currently entering the market and which could represent up to 14% of total vehicles sales by 2025.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407012454964">1</xref></sup> It has notably been reported that the energy consumption of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles greatly depends on driving profiles and conditions, and more precisely on climatic conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407012454964">2</xref></sup> These aspects also have major implications for electric vehicles (EVs). EV manufacturers are already faced with the challenge of having to convince their potential customers over the limited range of their vehicles. It will, therefore, be necessary to ensure that their official range will not be excessively affected by extreme climatic conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954407012454964">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Europe, the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) is still a mandatory step to approve and categorize each vehicle. The stability of this cycle and repeatability of the results have ensured that the NEDC has become a reference, although there is general consensus that this cycle is not representative of real-world driving conditions. To gain a more detailed insight into driver behaviour, it is necessary to consider other drive cycles, particularly in the case of EVs, which are generally designed specifically for urban use.</p>
<p>Numerous drive cycles can be used for the purpose of characterizing experimentally or numerically EV energy consumption. An exhaustive list and some useful statistical indicators regarding the dynamics of cycles can be found in Barlow et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954407012454964">4</xref></sup> A literature review also highlights many representative cycles for real world driving conditions. Tzirakis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407012454964">5</xref></sup> compared, for example, the official European cycles to a typical drive cycle for Athens. Saleh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407012454964">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954407012454964">7</xref></sup> suggested drive cycles for motorcycles in modern cities such as Edinburgh and Delhi. Tong and Hung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954407012454964">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954407012454964">9</xref></sup> have developed specific drive cycles for Hong Kong which were based on real measurements on various routes and on nine statistical criteria used for the comparison with official drive cycles. A similar approach was used by Kamble et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954407012454964">10</xref></sup> to build a representative drive cycle for Pune in India. Lastly, Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954407012454964">11</xref></sup> studied the influence of real world driving conditions on the performance of a Toyota RAV4 EV. Several car manufacturers have also developed drive cycles based on their own particular vehicles, allowing them to establish pertinent databases which are more representative of driver behaviour.</p>
<p>Considering this variety of drive cycles, it is not straightforward to select the most relevant cycles which could be considered representative in terms of the use of the target customer. The selection procedure is further complicated if other constraints associated, for example, with practical characterizations on test beds are to be considered.</p>
<p>Three methodologies are proposed in this paper to address this issue and to allow an objective selection of a reduced number of relevant drive cycles. As will be discussed below, these approaches highlight some similarities between drive cycles that have been developed in different countries and in some cases years apart. The first methodology is based upon a simple comparison of velocity profiles. The second method is based on the analysis of statistical criteria defined for each cycle and correlation analyses are then used to emphasize the underlying links between cycles. Finally, the last methodology is based on an automatic clustering technique (<italic>K-means</italic> algorithm).</p>
<p>More than 35 drive cycles were considered at the start of the study. Some of these cycles are used for vehicle homologation while others are representative of real world driving conditions (generally obtained from on-board measurements). Nevertheless, all of these drive cycles are well known and have been widely used to characterize conventional vehicles. The choice of homologation cycles for EVs is not discussed in this paper. The only considerations taken into account concern features of real vehicle use, mostly under urban driving conditions. Since an EV could also be used in extra-urban conditions, an assumed maximum vehicle speed of approximately 110 km/h is also made. As a result, the total amount of cycles used in this paper has been voluntarily reduced, since some high speed cycles (such as the Artemis Motorway for instance) have not been considered. Only 18 cycles have been used for the illustration of the three methodologies described in the following sections (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954407012454964">Table 1</xref> and Barlow et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954407012454964">4</xref></sup> for more details about these cycles).</p>

<p>Considering that the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954407012454964">12</xref></sup> is not yet officially available, the Worldwide Harmonized Motorcycle Emission Test Cycle (WMTC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954407012454964">13</xref></sup> has been used. The first objective was to compare the main characteristics of the WMTC cycle with other drive cycles dedicated to passenger cars, and it is also considered that this cycle could be useful in the near future to represent the typical use of very small EVs (two or three-seater).</p>

<sec id="section2-0954407012454964">
<title>Comparison of velocity profiles</title>
<p>The first methodology consisted of evaluating the similarities between cycles by computing the differences between their velocity profiles. This is a direct method, since the velocity profiles are considered in their entirety. The aim was not to quantify the links between different cycles, but simply to highlight the similarities that might be present.</p>
<p>To apply this methodology, it was first necessary to scale the velocity profiles and to perform a linear interpolation (step of 0.1 s) since all cycles do not all have the same duration and the same time resolution. This was achieved by using the ECE part of the NEDC cycle as a reference. Consequently, once scaled, all the cycles had the same duration of 195 s. A comparison of the original and scaled NEDC cycles is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012454964">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Subsequently, similarities between cycles were estimated by considering the Quadratic Distances (QD) separating them (expressed in m/s). These distances were computed using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0954407012454964">equation (1)</xref> depending on the speed values corresponding to cycles <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> at time <italic>t</italic> (<italic>N</italic> represents the number of samples and <italic>p</italic> the number of drive cycles)</p>

<p>The following figures schematically present the differences between the high speed cycles Eurev R3 and A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407012454964">Figure 2</xref>), and the differences between the low speed cycles Eurev UF3 and Artemis Urban (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407012454964">Figure 3</xref>). As can be seen with these examples, it would be inappropriate to analyse the absolute values of <italic>QD</italic> since high speed cycles are associated with high <italic>QD</italic> values, and low speed cycles with low <italic>QD</italic> values. Since the mean speed is not taken into account here, a specific <italic>QD</italic> value does not have the same meaning for extra urban cycles as for urban cycles. However, it is possible to identify the closest neighbour of each cycle thanks to a comparative analysis.</p>

<p>The closest neighbours of each cycle are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954407012454964">Table 2</xref>. The results reveal that it is possible to identify several groups of cycles. It can be noted, for example, that the Artemis Road cycle is quite similar to the WMTC, R3 and A1 cycles. In the same manner, the UF3 is also quite comparable to the UDDS, SC03 and R1 cycles. Therefore, based on these observations, it would be interesting to determine whether the experimental characterization of a given vehicle could be based upon on a reduced number of representative cycles for the different groups. Finally, it should be noted that the results presented here would have been similar if a longer cycle had been used as a reference rather than the ECE cycle as used here.</p>

<p>Although this methodology can enable rapid identification of comparable drive cycles, this simple approach can also be prone to inefficiencies in some specific cases. This is illustrated below with the FTP75 cycle, which is derived from the UDDS cycle, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954407012454964">Figure 6</xref>. Subjectively, these two cycles appear to be very similar. However, since they have different durations, there is a resulting phase difference between the two scaled cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407012454964">Figure 7</xref>) and, therefore, the <italic>QD</italic> value computed between the two cycles is quite high. Complementary tools are thus necessary for a correct comparison of the drive cycles.</p>

<title>Statistical criteria</title>
<p>Rather than performing an analysis of the complete velocity profiles, the common approach consists in calculating statistical descriptive criteria related to the speed, the acceleration, the specific power or even the proportion of time spent on specific operating conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954407012454964">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954407012454964">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, more than 60 relevant parameters were calculated. Since each cycle has its own time and speed resolution, linear interpolation was performed to ensure that the same procedure was followed for each cycle. Limits of speed and acceleration used to define each operating condition were set at 5 km/h and 1 km/h.s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively.</p>
<p>A first method consists in analysing the correlations obtained between the cycles when all the statistical criteria are considered. It is thus possible to highlight the similarities between cycles, to group the most correlated and to identify a smaller number of representatives while maintaining the fundamental characteristics inherent to each group.</p>
<p>This is a global approach in the sense that all the cycles and criteria are considered simultaneously. However, the correlations are only established for pairs of cycles. There is neither a combination of cycles, nor a combination or weighting between the various criteria. This type of analysis also requires particular attention to ensure the representativeness of cycles. Indeed, a cycle which is weakly correlated to the others may represent very specific driving conditions. It is, therefore, important to identify groups of correlated cycles, but also isolated cycles which can be considered representative of very specific driving conditions.</p>
<p>Two limits must also be considered for this kind of analysis with so many criteria. Firstly, multiplying the criteria also multiplies the possibility of identifying correlations between cycles, since more degrees of freedom are included in the analysis. Secondly, it is necessary to ensure that there is no discrepancy between criteria associated with the same cycle. The correlation analysis would be incoherent if a subgroup of criteria indicates that a given cycle is representative of urban conditions, while another subgroup indicates that it is representative of extra-urban conditions.</p>
<p>This global analysis is not presented in this paper; only a reduced version is described in the next section. However, it should be noted that the same results were obtained with both approaches (in terms of groups of cycles). It is, therefore, unnecessary to define a large number of criteria to characterize cycles. This has also been underlined by Tulpule et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954407012454964">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954407012454964"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954407012454964">17</xref></sup> and other lists of fundamental criteria can also be found in Kuhler and Karstens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954407012454964">14</xref></sup> and Nam.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954407012454964">18</xref></sup></p>

<p>As indicated previously, similarities between different drive cycles were estimated by exploiting the correlation matrix containing all the correlation coefficients. An illustration of the coefficients obtained with the two subgroups is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407012454964">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407012454964">Figure 9</xref> for which a subjective classification of correlations was made on the following basis:</p>

<list-item><p>‘strong’ correlations correspond to coefficients greater than 0.90 (red circles);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘medium’ correlations correspond to coefficients between 0.85 and 0.90 (black boxes);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘weak’ correlations correspond to coefficients between 0.80 and 0.85 (blue triangles).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Blue stars, representing the inverse correlations with coefficients lower than −0.75 and greater than −1, can also be observed in these figures. These latter show that the correlation analysis can highlight not only similarities, but also the discrepancies between cycles. The first subgroup of criteria shows for example that the UF1 and WMTC cycles are inversely correlated, the first one being representative of urban conditions and the second one including different driving conditions including a high speed section. As for the second subgroup, the R3 and Artemis Road cycles (both representative of extra urban conditions) appear to be inversely correlated to the Artemis Traffic Jam cycle. Although they are not exactly the same, the results obtained with both subgroups appear thus to be coherent and logical.</p>
<p>Regarding the positive correlations, the results reveal that some links are observed with both subgroups, for example between the WMTC and NEDC cycles or between the R3 and Artemis Road cycles.</p>
<p>Additionally, compared to the first methodology (above), the correlation analysis provides some complementary information. The first methodology revealed, for example, that the JC08 and Artemis Urban cycles were quite comparable, while no apparent correlation can be observed in either <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407012454964">Figure 8</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407012454964">Figure 9</xref>. In fact, the similarity previously observed was solely due to the velocity profiles, since the JC08 cycle is mainly representative of urban driving conditions even if the maximal speed exceeds 80 km/h. As a result of employing the correlation analysis, it is now possible to dissociate the different cycles by using more criteria than just the vehicle speed.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the comparison of the results obtained with the two subgroups of criteria, medium and strong correlations are schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407012454964">Figure 10</xref> (solid lines are used for the first subgroup and dashed lines for the second). It is thus more convenient to observe the relative position of each cycle, to explain how groups can be determined and how representative cycles can be selected.</p>

</fig>
<p>Considering firstly slow urban driving conditions, it can be observed that the UL1 cycle is not correlated to any other cycle with correlation coefficients greater than 0.85 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407012454964">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407012454964">Figure 9</xref> also show that the UL1 cycle remains isolated even with a limit of 0.80). Therefore, it seems appropriate to conclude that this cycle is a suitable representative of congested traffic in urban driving conditions.</p>
<p>Regarding the other urban cycles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407012454964">Figure 10</xref> reveals the strong links between the Artemis Traffic Jam, UF1, R1 and NYC cycles. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407012454964">Figure 8</xref> shows that the NYC and the Hyzem Urban cycles are also weakly correlated to one other. In a similar manner, the NYC and Artemis Urban cycles are also weakly correlated, although this correlation does not appear in either <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407012454964">Figure 8</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407012454964">Figure 9</xref> since the correlation coefficients are slightly lower than 0.8 with both subgroups of criteria. Since the Artemis Urban cycle is also correlated to the UF1 cycle, as shown by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407012454964">Figure 10</xref>, the more logical choice would be to replace the UF1, Artemis Traffic Jam, R1, Artemis Urban and Hyzem Urban cycles exclusively with the NYC cycle, which has a central position.</p>
<p>At the opposite extreme, a similar situation was observed with the A1 cycle, which could efficiently replace the R3, CUC and Artemis Road cycles, since they are all linked by strong correlations. Moreover, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407012454964">Figure 9</xref> also shows that the Hyzem Rural cycle is also correlated to the A1 and CUC cycles. Therefore, retaining only the A1 cycle seems to be the optimal solution.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407012454964">Figure 10</xref> also shows that the WMTC cycle is linked to the R3 and A1 cycles. This result implies that even if the WMTC cycle includes urban and highway driving conditions, it could also be replaced by the A1 cycle to a certain extent.</p>
<p>The JC08, NEDC, UDDS and WMTC cycles are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407012454964">Figure 10</xref> as ‘multi-component’ cycles since they include different portions with different speed levels. The JC08 cycle has also been described here as a multi-component cycle since the maximal speed reaches 80 km/h, which is greater than the legal speed limits within cities in the world. It should be noted that this cycle always appeared in this study as uncorrelated with the other cycles, which may be an indication of very particular driving conditions, and as a result may justify it being represented.</p>
<p>Considering the weak correlations between the NEDC, UDDS and WMTC cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407012454964">Figure 8</xref>) and the strong correlation between the UDDS and SC03 cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407012454964">Figure 9</xref>), it can be considered that the UDDS cycle has a central position. Therefore, to limit the total number of drive cycles, it would appear logical to retain exclusively the UDDS cycle in place of the NEDC, WMTC and SC03 cycles.</p>
<p>Consequently, the UF3 can finally be defined as a relevant cycle representative of extra-urban driving conditions.</p>
<p>To summarize, the six following cycles have been identified to represent the entire original set of 18 cycles:</p>
<list id="list2-0954407012454964" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>UL1: congested urban driving conditions;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>NYC: urban driving conditions;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>UF3: extra-urban driving conditions;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A1: highway driving conditions;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>UDDS and JC08: multi-component drive cycles.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As shown before, the objective analysis of correlation coefficients also requires some subjective choices. Here, the main motivation is to exploit this approach to reduce the total number of cycles by selecting the most relevant ones. Other options could have been considered. For example, in some cases, it might be necessary to consider cycles that have already been used to characterize conventional vehicles, so as to compare the performance of different vehicles on the same basis.</p>
<p>To limit these subjective selections, another alternative approach was employed, based on an automatic clustering technique which is described in the next section.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0954407012454964">
<title><italic>K-means</italic> clustering</title>
<p>The third methodology was based on an automatic clustering technique. Numerical clustering has already been used for the analysis of drive cycles, but the approach proposed here differs slightly from what can be found in the literature. Usually, clustering techniques are used to gather similar data recorded on-board over a long period of time. With such techniques, it is possible to classify different sequences into groups characterized by user-defined statistical indicators. Dembski et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954407012454964">19</xref></sup> showed for example how principal component analysis and <italic>K-means</italic> clustering could be combined to identify similar kinematic sequences. Tulpule et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954407012454964">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954407012454964">16</xref></sup> also used a <italic>K-means</italic> approach to group several velocity profiles into classes corresponding to red and green light traffic conditions.</p>
<p>In the present study, the <italic>K-means</italic> algorithm has been used to gather similar cycles according to the statistical indicators described above. This algorithm allows the classification of a given dataset through a user-defined number of clusters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954407012454964">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954407012454964"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954407012454964">22</xref></sup> The mechanism consists in defining a centroid for each cluster and calculating the Euclidean distances between these centroids and each point of the dataset. This way, each point can be associated to the nearest centroid. At this stage, each centroid is set to the arithmetic mean of the cluster it defines and the process of classification can be repeated until the locations of centroids stabilize. At the end of this loop, the final centroids are used to define the clustering of the input dataset. Typically, the number of clusters has to be defined by the user based upon a preliminary observation of the dataset. However, as mentioned before, more than 60 criteria related to time, speed and acceleration have been used to characterize each cycle. Performing a visual analysis of such a large quantity of indicators is not practical, which is why an arbitrary number of five clusters was chosen to represent five kinds of driving conditions.</p>
<p>The resulting clustering is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0954407012454964">Table 4</xref>. These results reveal, first, that the algorithm is capable of automatically identifying a cluster dedicated to multi-component cycles, which include various driving conditions. It can also be observed that the Eurev UL1 cycle has been highlighted as a very extreme drive cycle corresponding to congested urban conditions.</p>

<p>With a <italic>K-means</italic> algorithm, the centroid of each cluster is not a point from the original dataset. For each cluster it is, therefore, necessary to calculate the Euclidean distances between the points and the centroid to identify the best candidate to represent each type of driving conditions. It is thus possible to identify five particular drive cycles, appearing in bold italics in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0954407012454964">Table 4</xref>.</p>
<p>These results also reveal that the most representative cycles for each kind of driving condition were almost identical to those which were identified using the correlation analysis. It is, however, important to note that the choice of cycles determined by employing the correlation analysis was partly based on subjective considerations and not exclusively on mathematical aspects, as was the case with the <italic>K-means</italic> algorithm. Furthermore, it is also important to observe that the correlation analysis was based on nine or ten criteria, while more than 60 were used as inputs in the <italic>K-means</italic> algorithm. The fact that both methodologies resulted in the identification of similar representative cycles is a particularly interesting result, as it means that the underlying links between cycles can be determined with quite different approaches and using differing numbers of criteria. In addition, this result also implies that automatic algorithms could help to make the selection of drive cycles a more objective task.</p>
<p>The five groups are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954407012454964">Figure 11</xref> as a function of the mean vehicle speed and the relative positive vehicle acceleration which is related to vehicle energy consumption during the acceleration phases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954407012454964">23</xref></sup> The relative positions of the five most appropriate candidate cycles might not be easily interpreted, since more than 60 criteria were used for the clustering while only two are used in this figure. As indicated previously, using such a large number of criteria is certainly not necessary since some of these criteria are presumably correlated to one other. To clarify this, complementary tests were performed with a reduced number of criteria and the same results were then obtained, which implies that the algorithm is not affected by the use of correlated criteria, and that there is no discrepancy between all of these criteria. However, further studies are still needed to identify precisely the minimum number of criteria that have to be considered.</p>

<list-item><p>No gear box was used, a single transmission ratio was determined to optimize energy consumption over the NEDC cycle and then used for all of the cycles;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Three levels of power consumed by the electrical auxiliaries were used: 0.3, 0.5 and 1 kW. These auxiliaries consume energy during the entire cycle, even when the vehicle is stationary. These levels have been tested in order to simulate different climatic conditions, and thus different needs in terms of power consumed by the heating, ventilation and air-cooling systems;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The energy recovery during braking was treated in the same manner for all the cycles with complete recovery as soon as driving conditions allowed it.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Firstly, vehicle energy consumption obtained with different levels of power absorbed by auxiliaries is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954407012454964">Figure 13</xref>. According to these results, the impact of the auxiliaries depends on the driving conditions. Urban cycles, generally characterized by low mean vehicle speeds and frequent stationary phases, are more severely penalised when the power supplied to auxiliaries increases. The UL1 cycle shows, for example, a particular behaviour with significant fluctuations in the total energy consumption, this cycle representing an extreme case, since it is characterized by very slow vehicle speeds and because the vehicle remains stationary for 48% of the cycle.</p>

</fig>
<p>Secondly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954407012454964">Figure 14</xref> illustrates the vehicle energy consumption as a function of mean vehicle speed. All of these cycles have been grouped according to the categories obtained above. Particular cycles identified with the correlation analysis and with the <italic>K-means</italic> algorithm are illustrated by black circles and red crosses, respectively. The results reveal that the vehicle energy consumptions of these representative cycles are quite disparate. The implication is that selecting these cycles for experimental characterizations could be expected to result in noticeably different results and thus to a realistic quantification of the vehicle energy consumption for different kinds of use. In fact, the global trend illustrated with a grey dashed line is quite intuitive. For slow urban drive cycles, the power required to propel the vehicle is quite comparable to the power consumed by the auxiliaries and, as a result, the energy consumption increases as the mean vehicle speed decreases. For drive cycles having a mean speed above 30 km/h, the increasing energy demand as the mean vehicle speed increases explains the increase in energy consumption.</p>

</fig>
<p>The ideal approach would thus consist in choosing well-separated drive cycles to capture this global trend, and this has been possible by using the various methodologies presented above. It should also be noted that the groups built in earlier sections cannot be easily identified in this figure, since only the mean vehicle speed appears, while several criteria were used to build these groups.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Results presented in this paper reveal that it is not necessary to systematically use a high number of drive cycles to characterize vehicle performance. Mathematical approaches described here help to make more objective the selection procedure to determine an optimal reduced number of representative drive cycles. The case of an electric vehicle considered here is a restrictive application, since all of the methodologies presented in the preceding sections can be applied to other vehicle types.</p>
<p>Thanks to the analysis of correlations, it has been shown, on the one hand, that highly correlated cycles could be replaced by a reduced number of representatives, and, on the other hand, that isolated cycles could also represent interesting cases, since the lack of correlation with other cycles means that they are potentially representative of highly specific vehicle uses.</p>
<p>The use of the <italic>K-means</italic> algorithm completed this analysis. It can be seen as a similar approach but with fewer degrees of freedom. In fact, using the standard form of the <italic>K-means</italic> algorithm only requires the definition of the number of expected groups within the dataset. Yet, this automatic approach yields the same results as the more subjective correlation analysis. In this way, it has been possible to reduce 18 cycles to only five optimal representatives.</p>
<p>Simulations finally showed that vehicle energy consumption associated with the 18 considered cycles were coherent with the groups of cycles previously identified. These results show that a reduced number of cycles could have been used in parallel for experimental vehicle characterization. Additionally, simulations can help to quantify the evolution of vehicle energy consumption as a function of the power consumed by auxiliaries or even as a function of the gradient, aspects that cannot taken be into account purely by using mathematical criteria based upon the vehicle speed profiles.</p>
<p>The aim of our current studies is to combine an analysis of the drive cycles with the virtual design of hybrid and pure electric vehicles. Indeed, as Wu et al. have recently illustrated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954407012454964">26</xref></sup> the optimal architectural choice depends on the targeted use through the drive cycles used for design optimization. The objective choice of relevant drive cycles is, thus, particularly useful to estimate fluctuations of vehicle energy consumption for different types of real vehicle use.</p>
