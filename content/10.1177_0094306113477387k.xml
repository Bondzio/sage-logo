<p>In the study of intersectionality, scholars examine the relationship between gender and other identities, often race and class. However, there is an absence of scholarship on the relationship between gender and Jewish identity. In <italic>Jewish Feminists: Complex Identities and Activist Lives</italic>, Dina Pinsky fills in the research void by investigating the identities of second-wave Jewish feminists, who participated in the feminist movement in the 1960s and 1970s. Through the use of 30 interviews, five of which are with men, Pinsky asks respondents if they find their Jewish and feminist identities in conflict with one another. What follows is a paradoxical mixture of contradiction, ambivalence, and passion, which seems to highlight the complexity underlying the construction of a Jewish feminist identity.</p>
<p>The study indicates that the ways in which Jewish feminists form their multiple identities varies, leading some to find tension between being Jewish and being a feminist while others find the identities to complement one another. Feminist women who view their Jewish identity as rooted in the Jewish religion appear to face the predicament of participating in a patriarchal religion. While some of these women attempt to create gender equality within the religion, others doubt whether or not anyone can remove patriarchy from Judaism. Another group of feminists view their Jewish identity as a cultural identity, and suggest that Jews and women share a common history of oppression. As a result, these women believe that their Jewish and feminist identities coincide with one another.</p>
<p>For the small number of male Jewish feminists interviewed, they construct a “discourse of Jewish alternative masculinity,” through which they perceive Jewish men to be gentle, nonviolent, and welcoming of gender equality. However, some appear to understand that this general notion of Jewish men is somewhat romanticized. Pinsky illustrates here and throughout the book that the construction of a Jewish feminist identity faces contradictions at times, but nonetheless persists in the lives of these Jewish feminists.</p>
<p>Pinsky’s work introduces the unique cultural experience of Jews into the feminist dialogue with much success. Scholars interested in women’s studies, sociology of gender, and Jewish studies will find the book informative and enjoyable from chapter to chapter.</p>
