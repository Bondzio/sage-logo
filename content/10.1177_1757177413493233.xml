<p>By the time this issue of <italic>Journal of Infection Prevention</italic> is published it will be just over three months since the introduction of big changes to the structure of healthcare services and provision in England and only a little longer since the publication of the ‘Francis report’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.midstaffspublicinquiry.com/report">http://www.midstaffspublicinquiry.com/report</ext-link>). Both of these are having an impact on infection prevention and control teams and their colleagues in patient safety functions, the magnitude of which may not yet be fully apparent to us. These two are in themselves only examples, perhaps current exemplars of the constant change in health care. Such change is driven by many factors other than the emergence of new microbial challenges; societal, such as increased consumerism and the changing relationship between service and users, technological, whether in medicine itself or in society in general, such as the explosion of the internet age or the rise of social media; and of course economic: we can’t ignore the impact of the global economic crisis on health budgets. Benjamin Franklin is often quoted as saying <italic>‘…in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes</italic>’. To that I would add ‘change’ – so if change is a reality for infection prevention and control practitioners and their colleagues and teams, how do they respond?</p>
<p>At the risk of sounding trite, the answer must be that as change is inevitable, infection prevention must also change to respond. This is true at the level of the individual, the teams or organisations in which they work and for the speciality as a whole.</p>
<p>For the individual, change is synonymous with development and, I would argue, lifelong (or at least career-long) learning. Long gone are the days when one would, having secured a post in the infection control team (perhaps the only post), do ‘the course’. In my case that was the old English National Board 329 Foundation Course in Infection Control Nursing. The modern infection prevention practitioner or colleague in a related field is one among a very diverse group. She (or he) may still be most likely to be a nurse but not necessarily so, she may hold a bachelor’s degree, perhaps postgraduate qualifications or an advanced degree before arriving in the speciality. Equally, she may have experience and knowledge in education, change management, general management, quality improvement approaches or any of a myriad other aspects of health-related practice. So how do we assist this diverse group of individuals in developing themselves to respond to the ever-changing healthcare and infection prevention environment? The Infection Prevention Society (IPS) has led the way for many years in the development and publication of supporting tools for the professional and career development of infection prevention practitioners. Competencies for infection prevention and control have been developed and published by the IPS in 2000, 2004 and most recently in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177413493233">Burnett, 2011</xref>); the evidence that there is an appetite ‘out there’ for this support is clear; the most recent version of the competencies is, by a very large margin, the most downloaded article from <italic>JIP</italic> year on year. More recently, in the May 2013 issue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177413493233">Bennallick et al (2013)</xref> responded to the needs of infection prevention practitioners with advice on ‘How to make the most of the IPS Outcome Competences for Practitioners in Infection Prevention and Control’ – some practical suggestions as to how make best use of the competencies as part of a series of activities in support of practitioners. Individual practitioners, depending on the scope of their practice may also want to reflect on similar publications from our colleagues in Europe and the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177413493233">ECDC, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177413493233">Murphy et al, 2012</xref>)</p>
<p>In this issue of <italic>JIP</italic> Jane McNeish and colleagues have published an extension to the existing IPS competencies, with a specific set of competencies that expand on and add detail to the clinical skills domain of the original competencies, in the area of the collection, analysis and reporting of data. This development illustrates the second level of change and response, that of changing teams and organisations. Audit and surveillance staff are just one example of the development of broader and more varied infection prevention and control teams and the colleagues with whom they work. Data handling is a strong theme at this level, as well as audit and surveillance, teams are increasingly looking to the support of specialists in epidemiology, data analysis and reporting as well as information and communication technology. It’s far from limited to data specialists however; many if not most of our colleagues are working collaboratively with antimicrobial pharmacists, some are collaborating with specialists in improvement techniques and others are looking to experts in communications and marketing, including social marketing approaches. Last but certainly not least, infection prevention and control teams and the healthcare organisations they work for and with, have realised and embraced the power of social media, with the emergence of a plethora of Twitter accounts being used to spread the word about #infectionprevention (if this makes no sense to you, make sure you attend an IPS twitter workshop soon!).</p>
<p>So how does the speciality as a whole respond to this constant change? The first answer is of course that it always has, still is now and always will. When the way healthcare is organised in England changed, to a system of purchasers or commissioners, potentially diverse providers and contractual arrangements for assuring performance, safety and quality, infection prevention practitioners responded with a whole new set of skills and knowledge. Recently, IPS, working in partnership with the Royal College of Nursing, developed and published an infection prevention and control toolkit for those involved in commissioning health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177413493233">Allen et al, 2013</xref>). Very recently, IPS, as part of another partnership collaboration, this time with the Health Foundation, responded to the urgent need for the infection prevention community to more fully embrace the science of human factors/ergonomics in the way that colleagues in other areas of patient safety have begun to do. This ‘Thought Paper’, launched at the recent Patient Safety Congress in Birmingham, UK, issued a call to action to infection prevention practitioners to ‘work with human factors experts when designing, implementing and evaluating infection prevention interventions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177413493233">Storr et al, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Change is inevitable in life and in our professional practice. I’d go further and say change is essential if we are to succeed in our vision that ‘no person is harmed by a preventable infection’. Infection prevention practitioners, teams and organisations, working with societies and partner organisations and colleagues from across the spectrum of healthcare, need to welcome every change as an opportunity to improve care and reduce harm.</p>
