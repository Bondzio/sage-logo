<title>2013 WPSA Meeting</title>
<p>The 2013 meeting of the WPSA will be held at the Loews Hollywood Hotel in Hollywood, California, from March 28 to 30. Previous announcements identified the conference hotel as the Renaissance Hotel in Hollywood. In June, Loews Hotels and Resorts purchased the hotel. Gary Segura, Stanford University, is serving as Program Chair for this meeting. Ange-Marie Hancock, University of Southern California (USC), is the Local Arrangements Chair. Christian Grose and Diana O’Brien, both also from USC, will be serving on the local arrangements committee. In addition to the main program, three workshops are being organized for Wednesday, March 27. These workshops focus on Environmental Political Theory, Latino Politics, and Feminist Theory.</p>
<p>Any committees, caucuses, subject matter sections, or other groups wishing to schedule sessions or workshops during the WPSA meetings and who have not already done so should contact WPSA Associate Director, Elsa Favila, as soon as possible at <email>favilaej@csus.edu</email>. Preregistration and hotel information is available now on the WPSA website. It is possible to preregister and pay by credit card at the following site: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wpsanet.org">http://wpsanet.org</ext-link>.</p>

<title>WPSA Newsletter</title>
<p>The WPSA newsletter, <italic>The Western</italic>, continues to expand, providing an important outlet for news about the WPSA and its members. Along with providing association news, <italic>The Western</italic> serves as a forum for scholarly conversations on political science teaching, research, and political events focused on but not limited to the western region. Among other items, the newest edition provides a list of recent books by WPSA members. The list gives a small hint at the broad scholarly diversity and success of the association’s membership. In addition, the newsletter provides information on the forthcoming WPSA meeting, including on the reduced airline rates offered to participants. There are also short biographies of the current WPSA Program Chair, Gary Segura, and the incoming Program Chair, Victoria Farrar-Myers.</p>
<p>Contributions and questions should be directed to either Stephen J. Stambough or Valerie R. O’Regan, both of California State University, Fullerton. The newsletter publishes announcements highlighting career advances, job opportunities, and special events of relevance to our members. The deadline for the spring edition is rapidly approaching, so contact them soon. They can be reached at <email>sstambough@fullerton.edu</email> and <email>voregan@fullerton.edu</email>. The newsletter is available on line at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wpsa.research.pdx.edu/pub/western.php">http://wpsa.research.pdx.edu/pub/western.php</ext-link></p>
