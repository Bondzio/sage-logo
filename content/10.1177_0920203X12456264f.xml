<p><italic>China’s Thought Management</italic> continues and expands upon earlier work by Anne-Marie Brady on China’s efforts to modernize and market its propaganda and ‘thought work’ to fit changing circumstances. Although this is an edited book, it clearly reflects the views of the editor Anne-Marie Brady, since she wrote the introduction, and conclusion, and authored or co-authored three other chapters; she was also the principal investigator of the larger 4-year project on Propaganda and Thought Work in Contemporary China, with two of the authors (Wang Juntao and He Yong) who were post-docs on that project. Her views resonate with a larger debate that has emerged in the literature on state-society relations. Over-simplifying the debate, on one side are those such as Susan Shirk (<italic>China: Fragile Superpower</italic>, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007) and Peter Hays Gries (<italic>China’s New Nationalism: Pride, Politics and Diplomacy</italic>, Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004), who argue that the Chinese state is confronted with an increasingly assertive society with the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP’s) legitimacy more and more dependent on accommodation to popular demands. On the other side are those such as James Reilly (<italic>Strong Society, Smart State: The Rise of Public Opinion in China’s Japan Policy</italic>, New York: Columbia University Press, 2012), who argue that far from being a fragile state overwhelmed by popular nationalism, market forces or information technology, China’s leaders have demonstrated a remarkable flexibility in adapting to new circumstances and effectively managing the increasing demands coming from society. While this debate has often focused primarily on foreign policy issues, it also has relevance to domestic conditions as the work of Andrew Nathan has shown (Authoritarian resilience, <italic>Journal of Democracy</italic> 14(1), 2003: 6–17). Brady’s volume presents data, primarily through case studies, to demonstrate the success of the CCP in weathering a variety of crises since the student movement of 1989 and emerging unscathed, and perhaps even stronger, with a propaganda system that is now ‘market-friendly, scientific, high tech, and politics-lite’ (p. 1).</p>
<p>Divided into two parts – ‘new themes’ and ‘new methods of control’ – the case studies offer chapters on the role of propaganda in various spheres, including the Beijing Olympics (Brady), economics (Brady and He Yong), state Confucianism (Brady), Confucianism and foreign policy (Valerie Niquet), ‘linguistic engineering’, which contains an analysis of Hu Jintao’s ‘Maintain Advancedness’ Campaign of 2004–2006 (Ji Fengyuan), reform of the ‘cultural structure’ (Nicolai Volland), the People’s Liberation Army (Wang Juntao and Brady), prostitution (Elaine Jeffreys), and overseas Chinese (James To). The individual authors are recognized scholars who have contributed well-researched chapters, in some cases in areas that are important, but have thus far received inadequate attention in the existing literature. I was particularly impressed with the contributions of two authors: Volland, who demonstrates how ‘bureaucratic-administrative control’ has been replaced by ‘economic-financial control’, while isolating the cultural sector from external influences (p. 108), and Jeffreys, who offers an enlightening discussion of the debates and controversies that have accompanied national and local decisions on how to deal with the prostitution industry (pp. 146–8).</p>
<p>Despite the strengths of this volume, a number of questions arise. Much of the book presents a persuasive case that the CCP has learned from past mistakes, including an over-emphasis on politics instead of an emphasis on stability, harmony, and the happiness of Chinese citizens. As Brady makes clear in her conclusion, she believes that ‘the collapse thesis has dominated scholarship and journalism outside China throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s’ (p. 200), but that inside China ‘the regime has regained a high level approval rating from the majority of its citizens’ (p. 200). However, as noted above, there has already been a substantial scholarly literature noting the CCP’s success in overcoming a series of challenges and maintaining control.</p>
<p>Moreover, by focusing not just on the CCP’s new strategy of thought management and instead examining bottom–up societal responses to this strategy and regime policies more generally, one could easily offer less sanguine or at least more nuanced conclusions. For example, the number of mass incidents (群体性事件) each year and the cynicism and anger over such issues as official corruption, food safety, environmental pollution, illegal land seizures, and growing inequalities suggest a less than harmonious society. Politics is always the art of the possible. As surveys conducted several months before the student demonstrations of 1989 revealed, virtually no one could conceive of demonstrating in the public sphere as a form of political participation. However, when it became safe to do so, there were a million people on the streets of Beijing. Thus, while one can agree with Brady that a resilient CCP has done far better than many skeptics had predicted, a greater focus on the societal targets of CCP propaganda efforts, and their various forms of resistance, would also have been welcome.</p>
