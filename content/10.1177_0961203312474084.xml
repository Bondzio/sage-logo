<sec id="sec10-0961203312474084"><title>Objectives</title>
<p>Our aim was to audit the outcome of lupus nephritis (LN) at three East Midlands centres.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0961203312474084"><title>Methods</title>
<p>We undertook a retrospective review of all biopsy-proven LN types III–V 1995–2010.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0961203312474084"><title>Results</title>
<p>In total, 61 patients with LN were identified, with a median follow-up of 68 months. LN was present at the time of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) diagnosis in 20 patients. The median time from SLE diagnosis to the first LN episode was 5.3 years. Some 35 patients received IV cyclophosphamide and 17 received mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as induction therapy; 81.8% of those treated with cyclophosphamide and 81.3% with MMF had at least ‘improved’ according to the ACR-response criteria 6 months from induction; 33.3% and 37.5%, respectively, had a ‘complete’ response. MMF and azathioprine were the most frequently used maintenance therapy. We found that 32.8% experienced a flare after a mean post-induction time of 3.5 years, irrespective of the maintenance therapy used, and 43.8% of partial responders flared compared with 4.8% of complete responders. End-stage renal failure developed in 8.2%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0961203312474084"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Overall, outcomes (response, flare-rate, end-stage renal failure) were comparable with European clinical studies. Partial responders are more likely to flare compared with complete responders. The results highlight that LN can occur, and flare, after many years of SLE, emphasizing the importance of continued vigilance for LN in all patients.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961203312474084" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Renal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) – lupus nephritis (LN) – is associated with significant mortality and morbidity, but can be clinically silent. Hence screening for renal disease in patients with SLE is crucial to adequate management. Guidelines for both screening and treating LN exist. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312474084">1</xref></sup> are that patients with persistently abnormal urinalysis or raised serum creatinine should have formal urinary protein quantification, urine microscopy, renal ultrasound and to be considered for renal biopsy. Serum creatinine, urine sediment analysis, proteinuria and blood pressure have a predictive value for the presence and outcome of kidney involvement.</p>
<p>For many years cyclophosphamide and prednisolone have been the gold standard induction therapy; and although many different regimes have been used, a low-dose regime (six fortnightly pulses of a fixed dose of cyclophosphamide 500 mg) appears as effective as high-dose cyclophosphamide (six monthly doses, increased according to nadir white cell count, followed by two quarterly), and with fewer side-effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312474084">2</xref></sup> More recently, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been shown to be as effective as cyclophosphamide, but without any apparent safety benefit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312474084">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have reviewed the outcome of LN in three centres, to compare this with outcome in clinical trials and assess whether improvement could be make in the screening and detection of LN.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203312474084" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-0961203312474084"><title>Design</title>
<p>This was a retrospective longitudinal case-note analysis conducted at three East Midlands, UK, rheumatology units (Nottingham University Hospitals, Royal Derby Hospital, and King’s Mill Hospital). An audit proforma was used at each centre for standardized data collection including age at SLE diagnosis, time from diagnosis of SLE to first episode of LN, urinary protein:creatinine ratio (uPCR) or 24-hour proteinuria and creatinine (and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) where available) at time of LN diagnosis, immunology including anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) detected by immunofluorescence assays using HEp-2 cell substrate; details regarding induction and maintenance therapy, outcome at approximately 6 months (results at 5–7 months from induction accepted) and flares in the follow-up period were ascertained. Where more than one biopsy was taken during the 15-year period, the response to treatment reflects the most recent episode.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203312474084" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>All patients with biopsy-proven LN (types III, IV, V or mixed) between 1995 and 2010 were ascertained from departmental registers or histopathology department biopsy lists. One histopathologist reported for all three centres. Patients who were not biopsied, despite being treated for LN, were excluded. LN types I or II were also excluded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0961203312474084"><title>Analysis</title>
<p>Response to treatment was categorized in retrospect from available clinic visit data, according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312474084">4</xref></sup> A ‘complete response’ was defined as uPCR that has improved by at least 50% and the final result was &lt;0.2 g/mg. This has been calculated to equate to &lt;22.6 mg/mmol. A ‘partial response’ was defined by a uPCR that has improved by at least 50% but the final result was between 0.2 and 2 g/mg (22.6–226 mg/mmol). For patient responses to be defined as ‘improved’, the protein excretion must have improved by at least 50%, or where not available, the eGFR had improved by 25% if abnormal at baseline, or the urinary sediment had become inactive (less than or equal to five red blood cells per high power field, and no cellular casts present). ‘No change’ was when the uPCR or eGFR was unchanged. A ‘decline’ was defined as 100% rise in uPCR, eGFR that has declined by 25% or end-stage renal failure. Where 24-hour proteinuria was measured instead of uPCR, an extrapolation was made as far as possible by dividing the uPCR by 100.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312474084">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312474084">6</xref></sup> Hence, the response was classed as ‘complete’ when the 24-hour proteinuria was less than 0.226 g/24 h, equivalent to uPCR 22.6 mg/mmol, and up to 2.26 g/24 h for a ‘partial’ response. A post-induction flare was defined as deterioration in the above parameters that was judged by the clinician to require a change in treatment.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0961203312474084" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>In total, 61 patients (56 female) were identified and followed up for a median of 68.4 months (range 6–148 months). The median age at SLE diagnosis was 26 years (range 13–80 years). The ethnicity of the patients included 42 (69%) Caucasian, three (5%) Black, two (3%) Chinese, and 14 (23%) of mixed or other ethnic group. The geographical distribution of patients ranged from inner city to urban/suburban. The mean time from SLE diagnosis to the first episode of LN was 5.3 years (range 3 months–31 years). However, LN was present at diagnosis of SLE in 20 patients. For 51 of the patients, the current LN details recorded are for their first episode of LN. In the other 10 patients, they have had a previous episode of LN and current treatment and outcome data relate to their most recent renal biopsy.</p>
<p>The median creatinine at diagnosis was 85 µmol/l (range 53–276 µmol/l). Baseline protein quantification was recorded in 56 patients: 29 patients had a 24-hour urine protein measured and the median was 2 g/day (range 0.5–17 g/day), and 27 had a uPCR measured with a median of 460 mg/mmol (range 14–2211 mg/mmol). The baseline data of the 10 patients who had previous LN appeared to have a higher protein excretion at presentation of the current episode (median uPCR 774 mg/mmol, range 460–1732 mg/mmol; median 24-hour proteinuria of 2.95 g/day, range 1.5–17 g/day) but with a comparable creatinine (median 85 µmol/l, range 63–196 µmol/l).</p>
<p>All patients were ANA positive, 85% were anti-double-stranded DNA positive, and 58% were positive for anti-Ro antibodies; 21% were positive for anti-RNP, 12% for anti-Sm and 25% for anti-La antibodies. The classification of LN changed in 2003 when the International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) classification superseded the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. However, for consistency, the WHO classification was applied retrospectively for those given the ISN/RPS classification. Nine had type III, 28 type IV, 18 type V, and six were mixed (either type III or IV with type V).</p>
<p>For induction treatment, 35 patients received IV cyclophosphamide. The regime varied depending on when patients were treated, and included the modified National Institute of Health (NIH) regime, low-dose Euro-lupus regime, to weekly regimes according to local protocols. Seventeen patients were treated with MMF, five with oral cyclophosphamide, two with azathioprine, and two were given prednisolone alone. The response at 6 months relating to 57 patients (four unknown due to patient compliance or moving out of the region) is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203312474084">Table 1</xref>. The two main treatments of interest are the IV cyclophosphamide and MMF groups, of which 33.3% and 37.5%, respectively, were complete responders, and 18.2% and 43.8% partial responders. However, a further 30.3% of patients treated with IV cyclophosphamide could only be classed as ‘improved’, in six patients because urinary protein quantification was not performed either at induction or at the end of induction, thereby precluding the response to be classified as complete or partial. The number of patients who deteriorated at 6 months was similar in both groups.

<p>For maintenance therapy, 27 received MMF, 20 azathioprine, two IV cyclophosphamide, three methotrexate, and two prednisolone alone, with three receiving no maintenance therapy. Twenty patients (32.8%) experienced a flare after the induction phase. The flare rates according to response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203312474084">Figure 1</xref>) and according to maintenance therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203312474084">Figure 2</xref>) were analysed. Of 21 complete responders, one flared (4.8%) and of 16 partial responders, seven flared (43.8%). Of the 11 that could be classified only as ‘improved’ three flared, and of seven who showed a decline at 6 months, four proceeded to flare. The incidence of flares according to maintenance therapy is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203312474084">Figure 2</xref>. Five of the 20 who used azathioprine (25.0%) and 10 of the 27 (37.0%) who used MMF flared. This was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.615). The mean LN-to-flare time was 3.5 years (range 1–7 years). Five patients (8.2%) developed end-stage renal failure and three patients (4.9%) had died.

<p>Where a diagnosis of SLE was already made prior to the LN episode, screening at the clinic review should have been performed on all occasions. For the 41 patient who developed LN during follow-up, we analysed their surveillance for LN in the preceding visit. Data was missing in three, leaving 38 for analysis. A potential delay in treating 26 of 38 patients may have occurred as renal function was not documented in 5.3%, 15.8% did not have a blood pressure recorded, 21.1% did not have a urine dipstick recorded, and in 52.6% it was not clear that immediate action was taken on an abnormal urine dipstick finding, which may have resulted in a mean delay of 14 weeks. In one patient, a delay occurred between referral to the renal physician and the patient being seen. However, it is not clear that a delay to treatment correlated with a poorer outcome.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0961203312474084" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This retrospective review of patients identified with LN types III to V demonstrates the heterogeneity of time from SLE diagnosis to development of nephritis. This ranged from it being the presenting feature of lupus to decades from the diagnosis of lupus, and so highlights the need for continued vigilance in all patients with lupus. In this group of patients, those who were partial responders were more likely to flare compared with those who were complete responders. A previous study of patients with severe proliferative LN also found the same distinction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312474084">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although there appears to be a larger number of patients who were either in the complete or partial responders group amongst those treated with MMF compared with IV cyclophosphamide, six of the 11 patients in the ‘improved’ group did not have protein quantification either at the start or end of induction and so could only be classified based on creatinine and/or urinary sediment, thereby precluding a classification of complete or partial.</p>
<p>The other result that deserves discussion is that there appears to be a greater number of flares amongst those on MMF maintenance therapy compared with azathioprine. This may be reflective of the fact that there were 10 patients where the current episode of LN was not their first episode. Patients previously treated with cyclophosphamide and azathioprine may have preferentially been given MMF. Five of these 10 patients received MMF as maintenance versus one azathioprine. It is not known whether a previous flare of LN may predispose individuals to further flares through potential cumulative damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312474084">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The limitation of these data is that they are observational and treatments were not decided by a randomized controlled method. Therefore choice of treatment may have been subject to selection bias and clinician variability, which might have influenced the outcome of different drug treatments. However, the strength of observational data is that it allows evaluation of outcome in real practice in relation to benchmark outcomes from randomized controlled trials. The death rate may be an underestimation, as the nature of this observational study did not take into account left censorship – patients who have died prior to a renal biopsy, and indeed those who did not have a renal biopsy performed for various reasons including single kidney or patient choice.</p>
<p>Overall, our results show a response (at least improved) to induction therapy of 84.2%, a flare was experienced in 32.8%, and end-stage renal failure occurred in 8.2%. When comparing against results of randomized controlled trials, it is worth noting the heterogeneity between studies, for instance, the definition of a flare. Our patients were followed for a mean of 68.4 months, but did range from as little as 6 months, making some longer-term data such as flare or end-stage renal failure rates difficult to assess. Furthermore, comparing our data with published studies may be difficult if baseline characteristics are different. For this reason, it is more appropriate to compare with other European studies where the population is predominantly Caucasian, as opposed to Hispanic or Black where response to treatment may vary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312474084">9</xref></sup> Our baseline data are comparable with those of other European studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312474084">10</xref></sup> with their mean age of 33 (mean age of our group at time of current LN diagnosis 35 years), mean baseline creatinine of 1.02 mg/dl, equivalent to 90 µmol/l (mean creatinine for our group 110 µmol/l), mean baseline 24-hour proteinuria 3.35 g/day (mean for our group 3.45 g/day). Thereby our outcome can be interpreted as similar to that of other European studies whereby 80% of patients respond, 35% flare and 10% develop end-stage renal failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312474084">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The results highlight that LN can occur, and also flare, after many years of SLE, emphasizing the importance of continued vigilance for LN in all patients, even in apparently clinically silent disease.</p>
