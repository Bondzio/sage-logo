<abstract>
<p>Despite its tragic dimension, the challenge of disability has the power to serve as the catalyst towards a ‘new humanism.’ This article argues that attention to disability can reveal again the irreducible singularity that is each person, and from this, open a possibility in terms of a reconstruction of the social bond. Reflecting on the inherent mortality of all life and the creative engendering of norms, it proposes as complementary to the Graeco-Christian ‘ontology of privation’ a new and fuller appreciation of the incommensurable singularity of each person.</p>

<body>
<p>The financial, economic, and political crisis that is spreading throughout Europe and the world today is showing itself to be an existential crisis, in which we are lacking a new humanism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021140013484427">1</xref></sup> I am calling ‘a new humanism’ that humanism which is, at the same time, capable of recognizing its source in Christian humanism (and its debt towards this tradition, notably Catholic) and of taking account of new disciplines at the heart of new historic and social conditions. In this spirit, and you know this, the extreme states of human life, such as those of disability, are a testing experience and a possibility: it is this that I will claim before you, in this lecture, drawing on my living with disability as a woman, mother, philosopher, psychoanalyst, and writer.</p>
<p>To begin, I wish to highlight two aspects of the challenge that surrounds disability. The first aspect that I would like to underline is the link between disability and mortality. For me, disability represents the modern face of the tragic in that it confronts us with mortality (both individual and social), which even today we are still incapable of thinking. Mortality that is not only unthinkable on the occasion of a crime or of a war, but even more so when it is foundational, present throughout human existence.</p>
<p>This tragedy, however, <italic>can</italic> become an <italic>opportunity</italic> (and this is the second aspect of my proposal). How? By mobilizing an exceptional creativity in each of the protagonists of the challenge; indeed, the situation of disability allows a revelation of the <italic>irreducible singularity</italic> of the ‘speaking being’ that we are. This is what I call an opportunity, and it is around this that we might reconstruct our social bond.</p>
<p>‘Why are you interested in disability?’ I hear your question; and I am often asked this. Generally, I satisfy such curiosity. Not, however, without having noted that the simple fact of asking this question already reveals the particular exclusion, which strikes persons in situations of disability. Indeed, after two centuries of struggle for human rights, and, whatever may be the inadequacies of what has been achieved in this area, we find it normal that somebody is committed to fighting against racism, anti-Semitism, or other discriminations because of ethnic origin, social class, race, religion, or sexuality. It is not the same, however, when it is a matter of disability: this does not confront us with a ‘difference’ that is the same as these others, nor even with a ‘fragility’ or a ‘vulnerability’ like others. And this explains the persistent surprise: ‘Hey, are you interested in that? And why ever?’ I hope to contribute to explaining something of this particular discrimination, and what is at stake.</p>
<p>The neurological difficulties of my son David, which meant that he followed an atypical schooling, meant also that I have come to know all the variants of disability: motor neuron, sensory, mental, and psychic. In response to the working project ‘Disability’ which President Chirac launched, I wrote an ‘Open Letter to the President of the Republic on Citizens in the Situation of Disability, for the Use of Those who Are and Those who Are Not’ (2003); I then organized the General Assembly at UNESCO in 2006. Anxious to address all the sensibilities of the nation, I invited the Unified Jewish Social Fund (Fond Social Juif Unifié), the Great Mosque, and Jean Vanier, the founder of L’Arche, who agreed to participate on the theme of ‘Family, Affective, and Sexual Life.’</p>
<p>My experience of disability has in reality not only transformed the intellectual in me—I was more abstract in my thinking and on the way to being a psychoanalyst—into a novelist, to a less conceptual and a more sensitive language; it also got me involved, as a mother, in a gigantic task, the urgency and utopian character of which I measure in every moment, because through this task, it is a matter, in reality, of no more or less than re-founding humanism.</p>
<p>How does disability change our experience, and with this, our idea of human being? Can we, from this upheaval, build bridges between <italic>Christian humanism</italic> and <italic>the humanism that stems from the Renaissance and the Enlightenment</italic>? This was the implicit issue—beyond and through the concrete narrative and the day to day of our living with disability—that I dealt with in my correspondence with Jean Vanier, published under the title <italic>Their Look Cuts Through Our Shadows</italic> and now translated into several languages, including Italian with a remarkable Preface from Cardinal Ravasi, President of the Pontifical Council for Culture.</p>
<sec id="section1-0021140013484427">
<title>Secularization and Humanism</title>
<p>You yourself know that an event has occurred in Europe—and, incidentally, nowhere else—since the Renaissance and the Enlightenment: given that the ‘machine for fabricating the beyond no longer functions’ (Philippe Sollers), men and women have ‘cut their connection with (religious) tradition’ (Tocqueville, Hannah Arendt). By rebelling against dogmas so as to liberate their bodies and their minds and to become the only legislators of social bonds, men and women have rejected the idea of God. From agnosticism to atheism, there exist diverse variants of secularization. Far from being a nihilism that leads automatically to the Shoah and to the Gulag (as is often too easily claimed), secularization shows itself to be quite capable of combating obscurantism and religious fundamentalism. In his book, <italic>Do Not Forget to Think of France</italic>, Gilles Bernheim, the chief Rabbi of France, affirms that ‘Religion has entered henceforth into the field of the human sciences’ to the point of these sciences ‘having access’ to ‘that which appeared impossible,’ namely, to ‘the word of God.’ This is to say that secularization is connected again to the ‘broken thread of tradition,’ so as to tame the complexity of the continent of religions, to reevaluate it, to ‘transvaluate’ it (Nietzsche), by clarifying both the limits and the benefits of their incontrovertible contributions. In the course of our correspondence, both Jean Vanier and I—modestly and in complete sincerity—tried to hold to this great challenge, which the human and social sciences, psychoanalysis, and philosophy are following. Today, and I say this without affectation but in measuring rather the length of the path that remains to be traversed, it appears to me that our exchange is one of the rare concrete examples, perhaps the only one, in the debate on secularism that is not taking place.</p>
<p>As a continuation of this initiative, I experienced the recent interreligious meeting, which took place at Assisi on the 27 October 2011, when, for the first time, the Roman Catholic Church invited unbelievers. In concluding this event, Benedict XVI called believers not to consider themselves as the only ‘possessors of truth,’ but to take as a sort of example those who do not believe in an absolute truth, but who ‘look’ for it as a ‘path of being,’ a ‘questioning,’ and an ‘interior struggle.’</p>
<p>How did the experience of disability lead me to this re-founding of humanism, which passes by way of a new secularism (<italic>une laïcité nouvelle</italic>)? A secularism for which the era of suspicion is no longer enough, because in the face of threats and of the escalation of crises, the time has come to wager on the possibility of men and women believing and knowing together. Why is disability not an exclusion or a ‘fragility’ like others, and why from this fact does it call us to revise fundamentally the model that we use when thinking about it—a model that is inherited from Greek philosophy and, under certain aspects, from Christian humanism?</p>
<p>Before presenting you with some philosophical considerations, let me first of all tell you about some steps in my personal journey, by evoking three examples (John, Claire, and a woman seen on television), three different ways of sharing the challenge of disability. I would, thus, like to begin by telling you of these three cases that have made an impression on me and which, I am sure, will not leave you indifferent.</p>

<title>John, Claire, and the Woman Seen on the Television</title>
<sec id="section3-0021140013484427">
<title>(A) John</title>
<p>‘<italic>People say that I am mad</italic>’: This is the title of a television documentary that was broadcast in the United States and which I saw during a recent stay there. The programme claims to teach us how one might succeed in ‘curing’ someone with schizophrenia by ‘integrating’ him. The hero, full of various medicines that are making him ‘obese’—and about which he complains—is saved by his sister, an improvised film-maker, who has the good idea of filming this poor man John, who fortunately adores and practices drawing and engraving. Thanks to the documentary, the works of the disabled person are soon made public; he gets the chance to have an exhibition, and plenty of sponsorship follows. The ‘madman’ is from now on ‘a disabled artist,’ an ‘entertainment worker’ (as we would say in France), a worker like everyone else in ‘modern art.’</p>
<p>After I had seen the documentary, an immense sadness would not allow me to applaud it. Something essential seemed to me to be missing from this ‘integration’ that made up the presentation and the documentary. I had been the witness of a <italic>process</italic>, perhaps even of a <italic>procedure</italic>, but not of a <italic>personal renaissance</italic>; I had seen an exhibition and a commercial transaction, but not an interaction between healthy persons and a disabled person. This person was certainly helped, but it was to help him include the objects that he produced in the circle of consumption, the success of which was being measured by his access to the television screen. The person, the <italic>subject</italic> was absorbed by his objects, and his psychic life was taken as healed because it had simply disappeared.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0021140013484427">
<title>(B) Claire</title>
<p>I would also like to tell you of my meeting with a ‘Mother Courage,’ Claire. Doubtless you know many; there is always a courageous mother in the mother of someone with disability. Right from the birth of her daughter Marie, ‘they’ noticed some indefinable motor neuron difficulties, before ‘they’ announced that Marie, aged three years, was <italic>autistic</italic>. At the time Marie’s father took refuge in his work. He seemed to be saying, ‘With disability, you can do nothing,’ without saying it or in saying it: a way of disappearing to protect himself from depression. This man’s pain weighed heavily on him. Sharing it was inverted, eventually, into flight. There was nothing else for Claire, the mother, but <italic>to take everything on herself</italic>. She became an activist, then president of an association. In response to the father’s rejection, her slogan was: ‘You must just face things, as if there was nothing else.’ Claire found salvation in the bandage of renunciation, in denial. She tried to persuade herself that nothing was lost, that her daughter was not deficient, if only ‘both of them’ could ‘get something’: from assistants, a subsidy, a place in a day nursery, a small school, a CAT [a place in a Work Centre], etc., the list is infinite. Claire’s struggle kept her going. She converted all her energy into demands from public authorities, which she rightly considered indifferent, arrogant, and hostile. Since Marie’s birth she lived in another world, an anti-world, the world of the disabled that is cut off from the ‘world of others,’ which Claire refused to call ‘normal,’ not knowing what to make of this revolting word. She was at her wit’s end, and she came to me to ask for psychoanalysis. I sent her to a colleague who is an analyst.</p>
<p>As chance would have it, I met her three years later. During her analysis, Claire had taken time to lose herself and to find herself with a third party, to cry and to share her anxiety with her analyst at first, then with her work colleagues (work which she had resumed thanks to her therapy). ‘I isolated myself,’ she told me. ‘With Marie, we are not a single body for two. And besides, Marie found a job; she does some photocopying in a solicitor’s office, where everybody respects her as she is. She speaks about her angers and about her loves, because Marie, now, even has a partner.’</p>
<p>I shared her joy knowing all too well, as Claire did, that for all that nothing was settled. And I wondered if it would always require psychoanalysis and the help of a good solicitor in order to ‘demarginalize’ disability? Would it be possible that the democracy of proximity and solidarity, about which so much is said, but which is slow in coming, would realize that the <italic>respect of rights</italic> requires firstly and before anything else <italic>the recognition and the respect for the singular person</italic>?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0021140013484427">
<title>(C) The Woman Seen on Television</title>
<p>Mostly, moreover, the disability that engenders fear also gives rise to shame (and this is the last observation that I would like to share with you). I saw recently in a television programme a mother <italic>admit her shame</italic>. She had failed with her child, and not being able to bring him back to health, always felt guilty (as did the father, even though a man’s defences prevent him most often from admitting shame and culpability).</p>
<p>In the face of this kind of trouble (such autism, and this despite recent campaigns), in the face of such sufferings and such wounds, one feels the urge to hide oneself. How can one not understand this mother, these parents? And yet, in listening to her, I heard the pride, the unconscious need for parental power in the maternal sobs! Because culpability is the daughter of the all-powerful. This tragic and courageous confession touches all parents of children with disability and reveals, at its foundation, the archaic weight of a culture with which we find it difficult to engage: the culture of a theo-morphism, of a theo-morphic humanism, that presents human beings as excellent, enjoying, and performing creatures (in the image of an all-powerful Creator). When it does not exclude it, this culture of the absolute power of parents makes vulnerability guilty: it is the culture of the ‘perfect child,’ who is to repair parental discontent. Perhaps it is the mirage of the Man-God that is hidden in it, but decked in the Greek and Renaissance cult of beautiful nature, as also by a certain rationalism, Christian then republican, that responds perfectly to our narcissistic fantasies, and that continues to live on in us without our knowing.</p>

<sec id="section6-0021140013484427">
<title>Singularity</title>
<p>I am taking up this debate on the ‘life of disability,’ therefore, so as to insist on the right to <italic>irreducible singularity</italic>, because I am convinced that modern and collectivist humanism has failed when it desired to turn its back on singularity. This was the case in the totalitarian regimes. And this could now be produced in different forms with the trivialization that we see of the human species, that certain advances of the sciences, of techniques, and of hyperconnectivity are preparing.</p>
<p>In this context, the person in the situation of disability is this sensitive place in the human chain, where the ‘care by integration/collectivization at all costs’ (as the examples of John, Claire, and of the woman on the television show) can lead to an unprecedented automatization, at the very moment, when one hopes that it will bring reparation and relief. We know today that if the modern sense of happiness is freedom, freedom is not necessarily ‘integrative,’ ‘collective,’ and ‘standardized,’ but that <italic>it is concomitant with the singular</italic>. Duns Scotus (1266–1308) had already maintained this against Thomas Aquinas: truth is not in the universal idea, nor in opaque matter, but in ‘a this one,’ <italic>this man here, this woman there</italic>; whence his notion of ‘haecceitas,’ of <italic>hoc, haec</italic>, or again <italic>ecce</italic>, ‘this,’ the demonstrative indexing an unnameable singularity. Moreover, it is maintained that the discovery of Duns Scotus goes back to his reading of the words that God addresses to Moses: ‘I am <italic>The One</italic> who is.’ The unpronounceable calling of the name would be the index of utter singularity.</p>
<p>Why do we take up this biblical and scotist dream today, and place utter singularity at the heart of the social pact? We all sense that a new historic period is beginning: the Good having lost its bearings in spectacular globalization, Evil is set over against it, or rather the axis of Evil, against which a terrified humanity is asked to mobilize. Others, when they are not striving to reconstruct or deconstruct the divine, are in the search for a new founding myth. And yet, ‘on the ground,’ as we say, in the daily experience of all those outcasts in their unlimited diversity, never has humanity had an ambition so rebellious, so free, so human. It is not about a new mythology of love. I would see in it, rather, a challenge to nature and to the tragic. The acceptance and the accompaniment of the person in the situation of disability express the desire of men and of women, together, to overcome the most insurmountable of fears—the one that confronts us at our limits as living beings. I distrust—you will have understood this—the term ‘integration’ of the disabled: it smacks of charity to those who would not have the same rights as others. I prefer to use ‘interaction,’ which expresses a politics that has become ethics, in expanding the political pact as far as the boundaries of life. And it is not surprising that one finds a majority of women on this new political front of interaction (and perhaps this is the occasion to deculpabilize the part of the feminine in men?). Could this be because after the years of feminism and in prolonging its best ambitions, these know what it is to renew the age-old capacity of women to care for psychic and physical life in making a political act, a political philosophy?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0021140013484427">
<title>Mortality</title>
<p>Let us try to approach more closely the singularity of disability. As regards the disabilities (motor neuron, sensory, mental, and psychic), which appear in a specific way in every person who is affected, we might ask if it is a singularity like the others, a solitude like the others? On this point, Jean Vanier and I had diverging opinions at the outset of our exchanges. I maintain, in effect, that disability cannot be reduced to the category of ‘difference.’ I reject ‘portmanteau words,’ ‘a holdall,’ such as ‘we are all different,’ all ‘others,’ all ‘vulnerable,’ or all ‘fragile.’ No, we are not ‘all disabled.’ And this is perhaps even less so than us not ‘all’ being ‘gay’ or ‘German Jews.’ Why?</p>
<p>Let me repeat this: disability differs from other ‘differences’ in that it <italic>confronts us with mortality</italic>. The non-conformity to the norm, which is the matter at hand in the singularization of disability, is at the cross-over with <italic>biology</italic> (a biological deficit) and with the social response to this deficit: biological and social, nature and culture. But even more than sexual transgressions, for example, the distance vis-à-vis the biological and social norms that disability represents, is perceived as a <italic>deficit</italic>, which (although repairable in certain cases and within certain limits) <italic>lets me die if I am alone</italic> [<italic>me fait mourir si je suis seul</italic>], without prothesis, without human help.</p>
<p><italic>The fear of death</italic>, fear of human finitude, even fear of the limits of the human (in the face of certain severely poly-disabled) are, moreover, the dark side of this iceberg—this block so insurmountable as disabled persons and their families know too well—that is often the attitude of those who are not disabled in the face of disabled persons, this mixture of indifference, shame, and sometimes arrogance. Certainly, all human beings know that they are mortal, but we prefer not to think of this; some place their hope even in the eternal. However, biology has discovered that cellular death (<italic>apoptosis</italic>) is at work at the same time as growth from conception, and it is this that sculpts a living organism (Ameisen). The person in the situation of disability lives with the work of mortality in him or her, it is the companion of his or her solitude, as Baudelaire says of his pain: ‘My pain, give me your hand; come this way.’ The so-called solitude of the disabled person has inevitably an absolute companion, a permanent body-double: the pain of mortality. Even if this person is not sick, even if they do not feel specific pains, their disabilities remind them permanently—them or at least those around them if the deficit deprives them of this consciousness—that they are not like others, who are able not <italic>to will</italic> to know that they are mortal.</p>
<p>Religions and diverse spiritualities introduce this dimension of mortality to the minds of their adherents, although many of those who claim to follow them oppose it in their daily practice through a defensive denial. Secularization, on the contrary, did not construct a discourse on the mortality that is in us. I am not speaking of death; we are experts in celebrations of that. Nor of dependent old age; the longevity of parents and grandparents has us contributing without skimping, because there is a good chance that this disabling ‘great age’ will strike us one day too. I am speaking of the ‘mortality of life,’ from birth or following from these ‘unpredictable biological genetic variabilities’ that can generate disabilities: this mortality that one calls ‘crippling’ is for us still unthinkable. Consequently, a radical change of mentality is needed so that the ordeals of disability might invite us to better assume and accompany the human condition as far as its limits and in its finitude. The consciousness of our finitude and its accompaniment are in effect fully a part of human singularity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0021140013484427">
<title>Norms</title>
<p>Disability has led me, thus, to mark in the unicity of the human person its finitude and the fear of death. But still another revision of our tenacious prejudices is needed with regard to disability: that of the norm. Can we approach it without a romantic refusal, without a servile submission, and with all the seriousness that it requires? The norm is not only a discriminating social, economic, and moral constraint; it is written into the social contract right from language. As soon as I begin to speak, I in fact accept and share norms. To speak is to submit to grammatical norms, and the ‘speaking being’ does not escape common rules, without which there would be no exchange. The compassionate refusal of norms seems equally to ignore the <italic>fundamental biological laws</italic>, which command living organisms (even if our current knowledge in this domain is insufficient, and there exists an unpredictable biological variability). The idea of a norm, of a typical form, of a suitable rule is indispensable in biology as it is for the social bond.</p>
<p>However, bio-politics advances another understanding of the norm, in the face of the development of democracies and also the achievements of the life sciences. In effect, thanks to their active adaptation (that is to say, rebellious and creative with regard to norms), new political subjects are emerging, among them persons who are in the situation of disability, who push back the limits of former norms and engender new ones. Thus, it becomes normal that disabled persons lead a social, family, and love life. The norm is no longer an <italic>a priori</italic> fixed concept but a dynamic one. Where is the mainspring for this mutation? What is it that allows singularities to tear down norms and permit them to develop?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0021140013484427">
<title>Privation Versus Possession: ‘To Have’ or ‘To Be’</title>
<p>Activists for the rights of persons in the situation of disability reject even the term ‘disability.’ Among the numerous reasons for this criticism, I would like to highlight one: our model of disability stems from an Aristotelian conception of human capabilities, which supposes a universal form-<italic>type</italic> (an archetype) for which ‘diverse situations’ or ‘cases’ deviate by <italic>default</italic>—through the <italic>privation of having</italic> (‘<italic>steresis</italic>’). I am blind, because I am deprived of the sensation or the capacity of seeing. In the <italic>Physics</italic> and the treatise <italic>On the Soul</italic>, Aristotle with finesse details these variants, their ‘power’ and their ‘impotence.’ In Matthew’s gospel, the Aristotelian <italic>steresis</italic> will give the category of ‘poverty’ (Matt 25): ‘<italic>because I was hungry and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty …; I was a stranger …; naked …; sick …; in prison. Every time you did this to the least of my brothers, you did it to me</italic>.’ Listen to these: various ‘steriles,’ defective or poor, share powerlessness in suffering and passion, and in our com-passion with the ‘lack of being,’ we establish ‘good living,’ the ethics that will be Christian humanism.</p>
<p>Without being reduced to an <italic>ontology of negation</italic>, this <italic>ontology of privation</italic> finds echoes in the entire history of philosophy, be that of ‘Being’ and ‘beings’ in their ‘finitude,’ from Descartes and Hegel right up to the ‘ontological difference’ in Heidegger.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0021140013484427">2</xref></sup> As regards the specific domain of disability, it is of note that the philosophy of privation includes without distinction the poor, the sick, the lepers, the drifters, and the disabled, all struck by a <italic>lack</italic> or a <italic>defect</italic>. The magnificent works of charity are inspired by it, the foundation of Christian humanism and of the Church understood as ‘a community of the suffering servant,’ who goes out ‘to complete,’ ‘to give’ to those who ‘have not.’</p>
<p>This model of solidarity by means of <italic>poverty</italic> / <italic>privation</italic> / ‘<italic>lack in being</italic>’ has not ceased to show its efficacy. Not only through charitable works, but also on the level of knowledge: is it not often through the study of the ‘empty’ (pathologies) that the sciences appropriate the complexities of the ‘full’ (normal functioning)? It is, for example, in studying aphasias that one can better understand the mechanisms of language. It is not, therefore, a matter of ignoring the pathological and even less of abolishing it—the inevitable of the norm prohibits us from doing this—but rather to complete it.</p>
<p>Because the <italic>paradigm of the lack</italic>—with its counterpart <italic>com-passion</italic> and/or <italic>tenderness</italic>—has its limits also, even its defects, as I did not hesitate to indicate to Jean Vanier in our correspondence. <italic>His theorization is of a Graeco-Christian origin, but the model is from then on unconsciously universal</italic>. As it is, it risks enclosing the disabled subject in a position of being the ‘object of care,’ of being ‘taken care of,’ at best by <italic>tenderness</italic>, often in <italic>neglecting scientific knowledge</italic>, which succeeds in identifying and in treating specific symptoms, and through a self-indulgence that ends up in <italic>infantilization</italic>. Indeed, the intrinsic logic of this model slows down the disabled subject: it prevents them from being open to their ‘powers,’ that is to say to their <italic>singular potentialities</italic>, and prevents them from turning their solitude, always irrevocable, into its <italic>singular creativity</italic>, to its initiative which can be shared within its appropriate limits. When it does not incite to ‘integration’ at all costs, the logic of this model nourishes the fantasy of an ideal pleasure, a claimed fusion-confusion of healthy ‘possessors’ with the ‘bereft/needy,’ a supposed communion, where religious sects easily do business.</p>
<p>I maintain, on the contrary, against the paradigm of ‘having’ and of ‘steresis,’ that that of <italic>the singularity of being</italic>—which goes as far as including the deficit itself, in as much as it is revelatory of the finiteness and the boundaries of living being—is not a <italic>privation, a failure, or a sin</italic>. The contingency of the <italic>singular is positive</italic>; in it ‘Being’ and ‘beings’ are conjoined. The contingency of the ‘disabled’ singular reveals to me my own singularity of ‘possessing’ called ‘healthy,’ that I do not domesticate for the good, beginning with the singularity of the one who ‘lacks.’ It is mortality on the march, which touches me in him or her, I am there, it falls on me, I accompany him or her, I love him or her as he or she is. Through my love for the other singular, I carry him or her to their specific, singular, development—and to mine, equally specific and singular.</p>
<p>Certainly, we no longer, or rarely, associate ‘disability’ with ‘fault.’ But spontaneously, automatically, ‘normally,’ we continue to exclude, to ‘isolate,’ and to ostracize. It is only in a second phase that one claims to integrate, but always with the idea of a ‘privation,’ of a ‘fault’ in the background that ‘we others,’ the ‘possessors,’ could not have, essentially. ‘We possess (aptitudes, powers), but he (she) does not have, he is lacking’: this model of lack remains ‘the’ implicit and indelible allusion of our humanist, Christian, and secular philosophy. It is no surprise that the poet sometimes rebels: ‘No worse deaf than those who possess,’ says Michaux. But it would, nevertheless, be false to say that we are all deaf, because we all possess. As long as we distinguish <italic>essential Being</italic> from an <italic>inessential being</italic> in <italic>want</italic>, we will be tempted to segregate the living. The essential Being is perhaps no longer the Divine, but we have replaced it with Biology, when we understand the disabled person as ‘lacking’ certain biological aptitudes (Biology, with a capital letter, takes then the place of the essential Being: could our ‘divine’ have become the postmodern bio-scientific ‘being’?); or when we understand the disabled person as lacking in cultural and social capacities (Society, always with a capital letter, assuming here the role of our integrative <italic>being</italic>).</p>
<p>On the contrary, in leaving behind this paradigm of ‘poverty’ and of ‘fault,’ and in substituting that of the <italic>incommensurable singularity</italic> of each person, disabled persons included, we are getting closer to what I will call a scotist ethics. What is a scotist ethics? That is ‘the’ question to ask at the crossroads of theology and of philosophy. Is it a more ‘mystical’ ethics (some, such as Gilles Deleuze, have said ‘atheist’), while that of Thomas Aquinas would be more ‘social’? In the ethics that is of a scotist inspiration, at any rate, singularity could be thought of as the only <italic>positivity</italic>, I would say today, the only <italic>value</italic>. Beginning with the positivity of <italic>beings</italic>, Duns Scotus extended it to <italic>Being</italic> itself, to God, as the <italic>causa singularitatis</italic> (cause of singularity). God would be singular, and Christ quite particularly so, because the God-Man develops the density of his singularity through the test of his passion unto death, and as far as his <italic>glorification</italic> as a wounded-crucified survivor: since this is neither a <italic>reparation</italic> nor a <italic>satisfaction</italic> but precisely the evidence of his singularity.</p>
<p>An activist for the rights of disabled persons in the United States, Nancy L. Eiesland, takes up, without knowing it, apparently, this scotist idea in her book <italic>The Disabled God</italic>, when she describes Jesus as the only ‘disabled God.’ Does he not appear to his apostles, even in his glory, with an ‘impaired body,’ a damaged body? Here, the wound is not a lack, because it is an integral part of his Glory, itself given and perceived as a singularity.</p>
<p>The ex-canon Diderot had taken up for himself, in another way, which is that of modern humanism, this ‘positive singularity,’ when he had undertaken to transform the <italic>disabled person</italic> into a <italic>political subject—</italic>for the very first time in the world. In his <italic>Letter on the Blind for the Use of Those who See</italic> (1749), he basically suggests that disabled persons have all the rights, ‘are born free and equal in rights.’ And the <italic>Declaration on the Rights of Man</italic> will need a lot of time to put into practice this principle that transforms, into efficient positivity, finitude in act in the disabled person. The right to ‘personalized compensation’ in the law of France from 2005 is an outcome of this.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to achieve this ambition of modern humanism, political will and jurisdiction are not enough. It would be necessary to reinvent this <italic>corpus mysticum</italic> (mystical body) that Kant himself evokes at the end of the <italic>Critique of Pure Reason</italic> (1781) in order that the singularity of the person with disability would be able to transform the norms into a dynamic, progressive concept: reinvent love as the union with the singularity that is completely other. In other words: <italic>for the inclusive solidarity with the weak, it is a matter of substituting the love of singularities</italic>. What love? Love as desire and will so that the singular might clarify, be recognized, and develop in sharing its own singularity. Much more than solidarity, which has great difficulty sustaining itself, it is only this love that can lead the positive (and not ‘deficient’) singularity of the-one-who-testifies for mortality to blossom in a society, which is founded on the norm without which, as I said, there is no bond, and which can also lead to the evolution of norms.</p>
<p>By bringing up the question of love, ‘continuously clarified transfer’ in the accompaniment of the disabled person, you will have understood that I am thinking of the <italic>formation of the intervening personnel</italic>, and to the place of psychoanalysis in this complex and polemical domain. Please allow me to conclude on a more personal note in recalling the maternal role in this ordeal.</p>

<title>Maternal Reliance</title>
<p>‘I want that you be,’ says the mother to the child. <italic>Volo ut sis</italic> (I want you to be), says scotist ethics. I say to David: ‘I love that you be.’ My empathy, my loving fusion with him, has thus allowed me to discover that, with his perfect pitch, he is able to make music despite his neurological deficits. However, I only really accompany him in giving him the means of separating himself from me, in individualizing to the maximum his languages, his means of expression, and/or the bond with others. He will make music, multimedia, we shall create an artistic ESAT, and he will participate in it in his own way, not as <italic>I</italic> want it, but as <italic>he</italic> wants it and is able. We shall open a new ‘working space’—that of ‘sexual and affective life’—with his friends and those who accompany him, whose training will need to be refined. He is joining a ‘personalized’ living-space: thanks to Jean Vanier, it is called ‘Simon of Cyrene.’ He will fall in love; it is difficult—is it possible, I doubt it—and I say to him: ‘David you are dreaming!’ ‘But mum, I dream, therefore I am,’ he replies to me. And the norm itself is beginning to be adapted to his being. It is even becoming ‘normal’ that it is spoken about at UNESCO and at Maynooth.</p>
<p>In this central role of <italic>empathy</italic> and of this <italic>love, that is continuously clarified and questioned</italic>, which, for my part, I call <italic>vigilant transfer</italic>, the exceptional experience of Jean Vanier is pioneering. We have recently seen a secular version, which honours republican secularism, in the film <italic>Untouchables</italic> (produced with the support of the association Simon of Cyrene). The love, with the humour and gaiety that result from it, this roar of laughter, which breaks through pain, this joyful alchemy, all this embodies marvellously the philosophy of sharing in the singular, which I am exploring with you, and leaving behind a certain postmodern and gloomy humanism which, when it is not exalting the theo-morphism of its integrative all-powerfulness, wallows in a depressive and protesting despair. We can see an example of this in another film, that is, besides, instructive: the Iranian cinematic saga <italic>A Separation</italic>, the anti-<italic>Untouchables</italic>.</p>
<p>We are, therefore, in the process of substituting another mode of life for the <italic>habitus</italic> of com-passion of the ‘well-off’ with and in the ‘powerlessness’ of those who are without: going beyond the ‘deficient self’ through the <italic>corpus mysticum</italic> of singularities. You know it: the capacity for survival of these disabled bodies is extraordinary, when they are revitalized and jubilant in the transferential encounter. This reminds me of Spinoza’s surprise: ‘no one has yet determined what the body can do.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0021140013484427">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>This secular and stimulating <italic>corpus mysticum</italic>, which I am now talking about, which Jean Vanier practises in his way, which the film <italic>Untouchables</italic> brings to the general public, is a horizon and a hope for all, parents and professionals alike. It is easy, it is easy for me, to deck it with ironic scepticism. I know that many of you share this philosophy, its energy, and its expectations, and try to put it into practice, in spite of the obstacles, the delays, the regressions of all kinds, which a hostile climate of tension over identity and economic austerity oppose to us. Thank you, once again, for giving me the opportunity of sharing this vision with you, and thank you for your attention.</p>
