<p>The past two decades have witnessed a remarkable growth in research and scholarly work in South African Psychology. This is evident in the increasing number of academic publications by South African scholars and researchers in journals around the world, and, of course, in the <italic>South African Journal of Psychology</italic>. Clearly, psychological research and authorship in this part of the world is alive, well, and headed in the right direction. Academic institutions are considerably more focused on research output than previously. There is also a greater awareness and interest among those in the early stages of their careers, and a much more progressive agenda is visible in scholarly writing. These are encouraging signs for Psychology in South Africa, and augur for a vibrant future for the discipline.</p>
<p>The successful hosting of the 30th International Congress of Psychology (ICP 2012) by the <italic>Psychological Society of South Africa</italic> (PsySSA) together with its partners, notably the National Research Foundation (NRF), further attests to the heights of development and the coming of age of South African Psychology, post-apartheid. This flagship event saw an unprecedented number of South Africans presenting their work, and taking their place on the world stage. Of over 6000 accepted abstracts, almost 20% were authored by South African academics, researchers, and practitioners. In the run-up to the congress, the scientific committee and abstract reviewers noted, with unanimity, the high standard of abstract submissions by South African psychologists.</p>
<p>In the course of its existence of over four decades, albeit under different titles, the <italic>South African Journal of Psychology</italic> has played a role in national and international developments of the discipline. The latter half of the Journal’s history has reflected the country’s transition to democracy, showcasing a more progressive approach to research and its scholarly dissemination, as well as insightful reviews and critical commentaries. Not only has the Journal published work in the traditional fields of experimental psychology and related areas, it is also increasingly addressing the psychological and mental health issues affecting South Africans, especially those in vulnerable and marginalised positions. In addition, the Journal has been chosen as an outlet for the works of an increasing number of psychology researchers and scholars abroad, further confirming the position of South African Psychology in the international arena. That the national Journal has substantially enhanced its scholarly profile over the years, with editors striving to provide readers with cutting-edge material, is without doubt.</p>
<p>It has also been gratifying to note the periodic analyses of the Journal’s content, authorship, and related variables (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0081246313477773">Duncan, van Niekerk, &amp; Townsend, 2004</xref>). Such critical reflections serve to enhance the publication, and heighten the awareness and resolve to tackle issues of concern in aligning the Journal with national and international agenda. As a discipline, Psychology must move forward in a manner that justly reflects the people of South Africa, the democratisation of the country, and its preparedness to grapple with the national challenges. It is also a time when crucial questions must be asked, especially on the psychological and social issues that threaten our young democracy. As a scholarly publication, it is vital that the <italic>South African Journal of Psychology</italic> not only mirrors the discipline, its issues, and challenges but also furthers the relevant debates, of which there have been rather lively examples over the years.</p>
<p>It is fair to say that psychological research in South Africa has come a long way, traversed different socio-political contexts, endured multiple challenges, and made room for the various theoretical positions that have evolved. However, knowledge production must increasingly address the problems affecting the masses. While the discipline’s early history is embedded in experimental roots, it is vital that we continue to apply and expand the experimental techniques and theoretical developments to the current challenges facing our society. Critical issues such as poverty and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0081246313477773">Petersen, Swartz, Bhana, &amp; Flisher, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0081246313477773">Seedat, Bawa, &amp; Ratele, 2010</xref>), among others, must be interrogated within the context of the psychological and social correlates that perpetuate them. It is also crucial that Psychology trainees relate to these priority focus areas to ensure continued and increased responsiveness to social issues.</p>
<p>The country is fortunate to have both individual and group-based excellence in psychological research and scholarship, boasting leaders in various specialty areas. While these individuals and groups are carving out well-deserved names for themselves, it is vital that their skills and expertise are also channelled to assist in the development of newcomers or ‘emerging scholars’ in the field. These efforts include encouraging collaborative research within their work contexts, mentoring junior colleagues, identifying potential in students or colleagues, and nurturing the talent. A programme of dedicated focus on developing ‘emerging scholars’ is an idea whose time has come, and is probably long overdue. The concept was evident in the ICP 2012 ‘Emerging Psychologists Programme’, which focused on individuals from around the world, but such initiatives are perhaps even more relevant in Africa and other poor nations.</p>
<p>The mentoring of early career professionals should be viewed as serious programmatic developments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0081246313477773">Daniel, 2009</xref>), rather than casual endeavours or simply left to the ad hoc initiatives of a few well-meaning senior professionals. Formalised, systematic, and targeted mentoring programmes are necessary in a country such as South Africa, where there are numerous challenges in the training of psychologists, the development of research competencies, and very significantly, the quest to reach a critical mass. In plotting the development of the discipline in post-apartheid South Africa, such support programmes need to be considered a vital component in the broader plan to empower and equip young professionals for academic and scholarly roles.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that psychologists in South Africa receive more research training than many other professionals (certainly among the health professions), the body of psychology researchers is a relatively small one, albeit quite prolific in some cases. This may appear at odds with the extensive investment in research methodology teaching in the training of psychologists. For various reasons, a relatively small proportion of the more than 7400 registered psychologists in the country is actually involved in research and publishing. One of the reasons is the primary career goal of ‘practitioner’ rather than ‘scientist’ or ‘scientist-practitioner’. Another factor is the apparent reluctance and anxiety about embarking on research and related scholarly work. A colleague once remarked that some students are probably so ‘traumatised’ by the master’s dissertation experience that it may ironically put them off future research! Certainly, if that is anything near the case, then steps need to be taken to address it, because the future of Psychology as a discipline that is relevant to South African society is dependent on students’ positive experiences of and attitudes towards research. While it is accepted that not all psychologists need necessarily be involved in research endeavours, the competency development research argues strongly for the acquisition of foundational level skills in ‘scientific knowledge and methods’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0081246313477773">Rodolfa et al., 2005</xref>). These are critical in understanding and interpreting research, and keeping abreast of developments in all of the specialty fields in Psychology.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, the <italic>South African Journal of Psychology</italic> has initiated steps to encourage scholarly works and especially their dissemination in academic journals. In attempts to encourage academic publishing and demystify the issue among early career psychologists in South Africa, the Journal hosted publishing workshops. The programmes were aimed at those young (and not so young) colleagues for whom publishing research or other scholarly works in academic journals is a daunting prospect. The importance of providing recent graduates with the basic skills of preparing manuscripts for submission to academic journals cannot be sufficiently emphasised. It is often not realised that there is little or no teaching on the academic and technical issues involved in conceptualising and preparing a manuscript for submission to a journal. As a result, many novice authors come unstuck, and a potentially publishable manuscript could receive adverse reviews and even rejection. Manuscript preparation skills for journal publication are not generally taught in the basic training of Psychologists (i.e., those in professional categories other than ‘research’) nor is it essential at that level, considering the range of other immediate training priorities. It is, therefore, envisaged that such support programmes will continue as a way of assisting young professionals’ entrance into the realm of academic publishing. In this context, the help of senior and well- ublished colleagues around the country will be most welcome and necessary, considering our common aim must be to empower and equip recently qualified psychologists to confidently delve into this domain.</p>
<p>The outgoing Editor, Professor Kobus Maree, has been an integral part of the team presenting the publishing workshops, together with the present Editor. As Editor, Professor Maree has done a sterling job in taking the <italic>South African Journal of Psychology</italic> to new heights in quality, presentation, and efficiency. His tireless efforts have seen the Journal improve its impact factor. The incoming editorial team and the PsySSA are sincerely appreciative of his efforts, and wish him well in his new ventures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0081246313477773">1</xref></sup> In addition, the commitment and contributions of associate editors, Dr. Willy Nel and Professor Linda Theron; consulting statistical editor, Professor Tyrone Pretorius; book review editor, Professor Kopano Ratele; publishing editor, Ms. Erna Kinsey; and editorial assistant, Ms. Moipone Williams are gratefully acknowledged. Thanks are also expressed to the Journal’s editorial board members, many of whom have made valuable contributions. Of course, manuscript reviewers are the unseen backbone to any academic journal, and they have played a major role in ensuring that the Journal maintains a high standard, while also providing valuable feedback to authors to enable the crafting of academically acceptable articles. The new editorial team is hopeful that Psychology colleagues would continue to invest in the Journal by willingly assisting with manuscript reviews, thereby contributing substantively to the development of scholarly psychology in South Africa. The review input from experienced researchers and senior academics will be especially helpful in the further development of the Journal and its authors.</p>
<p>As the Journal’s incoming editorial team receives the baton from Professor Maree and his team, it strides forward with confidence, while counting on the support of all Psychology colleagues in order to consolidate the gains thus far, and to ensure favourable positioning at the next change.</p>
