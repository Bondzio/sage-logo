<abstract>
<p>Bogotá, Colombia, has been a pioneer in the development of efficient, low-cost urban transportation networks with its innovative bus rapid transit system. As the TransMilenio enters its second decade of operation, the long-term sustainability of the system has come into question. The current mayoral administration supports the construction of a subway network, which it claims will elevate Bogotá to the status of a “global city.” An examination of transportation development in Bogotá using interviews, field research, and primary source data in addition to extensive theoretical and comparative research reveals the ways in which politics and neoliberal policies have limited this development.</p>

<p>Now that more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X12468867">UN News Centre, 2008</xref>), it is important to consider and implement innovative infrastructure policies and practices that will contribute to efficient and sustainable development as cities continue to grow. Reflecting on the current global economic crisis, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0094582X12468867">United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP, 2009)</xref> has argued that “an investment of 1 percent of global GDP over the next two years could provide the critical mass of green infrastructure needed to seed a significant greening of the global economy.” Among the priorities of the proposed fiscal stimulus is investment by transnational financial institutions (such as the World Bank) to allow local and national governments to “develop more energy-efficient, less polluting transport modes and infrastructure, improve public transportation,” and use greener vehicles. Specifically, the policy brief recommends bus rapid transit.</p>
<p>The population density in a city demands mobility networks that effectively move large numbers of people. Cities seeking to improve transportation efficiency and capacity have long struggled with the false dilemma of choosing between the car and the subway (Jaime Lerner, interview, New York, December 19, 2009). Traditionally, city governments have created streets and streetscapes that favor the car, but today’s cities demand a rethinking of the calibration of these transportation networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094582X12468867">Hall, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X12468867">Mees, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0094582X12468867">Urry, 2008</xref>). For public transit, the ideal is subterranean or light rail. Buses have often been excluded from the agenda for their perceived lack of efficiency (due in large part to irregular service and low vehicle speeds) and the stigma they carry as the transit mode of the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094582X12468867">Hall, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X12468867">King, 2009</xref>). This has been detrimental to the development of effective public transit in many cities because subway construction can be prohibitively expensive and sometimes structurally impossible. Existing road infrastructure can, however, be easily adapted and repurposed to create efficient multimodal networks. Surface transit systems such as bus rapid transit, which make use of existing traffic thoroughfares, are the easiest to implement and most affordable in many cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0094582X12468867">Levinson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0094582X12468867">Rodriguez and Targa, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In Latin America, a lack of adequate transportation infrastructure has been cited as impeding the development of the region’s full economic potential and exacerbating social problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094582X12468867">Keeling, 2008</xref>). Policy makers in the region must contend with the particular challenge of financing urban transit when historically there has been a deficit of funds for public expenditures. Estimates of the funds needed to cover the investment deficit for transportation infrastructure in the region have climbed to US$3 trillion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X12468867">Fay and Morrison, 2007</xref>). Traditional funding streams, such as taxation, are problematic in the region because a large percentage of the economy is informal.</p>
<p>Pioneered by Chile in the 1970s, neoliberal economic policy had become the norm for most Latin American governments by the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X12468867">Baer and Maloney, 1997</xref>). This set of market-driven policies calls for less intervention by the state and an increased role for the private sector. The region has seen relatively steady economic growth since these policies have been put in place, but critics are quick to point out that many other factors account for this growth. At the turn of the twenty-first century, many leftist politicians became leaders of the region’s largest economies, including Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, Luiz Inacio “Lula” da Silva and his successor Dilma Rousseff in Brazil, Evo Morales in Bolivia, and Rafael Correa in Ecuador. Despite this political shift, many previous economic policies have remained in place (especially in Brazil but specifically not in Venezuela), while expenditure on social programs has also increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094582X12468867">Goldfrank and Schrank, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Today the tide is turning away from pure neoliberal policies, as is apparent from the failure to establish the Free Trade Area of the Americas and the rise of regional organization with the establishment of Union of South American Nations (formalized in 2008). This new institution can contribute a powerful voice to the global economic conversation by developing policies that support the growth of countries both economically and socially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0094582X12468867">Kellogg, 2007</xref>). Despite political leadership and economic changes, the region still faces immense financial problems in funding transportation infrastructure projects.</p>

<title>Bus Rapid Transit in Colombia</title>
<p>Bus rapid transit systems have gained global favor from cities and urban regions seeking to develop high-efficiency, high-capacity, low-cost transit networks. These systems have their roots in Latin America, where the first system was developed and implemented in Curitiba, Brazil, in 1974. The city’s visionary mayor, Jaime Lerner, improved mobility through an innovative transit system marrying the high efficiency of a subterranean rail system with the low cost of a bus network. This coordinated system centers on the creation of exclusive right-of-way lanes for buses that allow them to travel at higher speeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0094582X12468867">Rodriguez and Targa, 2004</xref>: 587). Another facet of the system is the spacing and design of stops, which are farther apart than traditional bus stops, employ off-vehicle fare collection, and move passengers on and off the vehicle at the same time. When all appropriate infrastructure pieces are in place, the level of service provided is comparable to that of a rail-based transit system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0094582X12468867">Levinson et al., 2002</xref>). Today, the world’s premier bus rapid transit system is Bogotá’s TransMilenio.</p>
<p>For the past half-century Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, has maintained a complex and interesting relationship to transit. In 2009 the city had a population of just under 7.5 million, around four times more than in 1965 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X12468867">Alcaldía Bogotá DC, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X12468867">DANE, 2010</xref>). This rapid population growth was due to large-scale migration to the capital from rural areas of the country in pursuit of economic opportunity. During the final decades of the twentieth century, the city’s physical infrastructure, which had remained stagnant, was increasingly unable to keep up with the influx of new residents. The transportation system in Bogotá was haphazard, disorganized, and often dangerous. By the decade’s end, the need for transportation reform was evident.</p>
<p>The investment in TransMilenio was a vision and a 1997 campaign promise of Enrique Peñalosa, who was elected mayor on a platform of transportation reform. Bogotá’s late-twentieth-century investment in bus rapid transit was “part of a broader, integrated strategy to address mobility challenges, reclaim public spaces for pedestrians, and increase access of city residents to green space” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0094582X12468867">Rodriguez and Targa, 2004</xref>: 593). Peñalosa quickly created a district development plan for 1998–2000 called “Por la Bogotá que Queremos” (For the Bogotá We Want). The plan prioritized public space and transport. Peñalosa launched an extremely effective campaign informing residents of his ideas and inviting them to participate in reimagining their city. At first his proposals were met with skepticism and opposition; one of the first projects his administration undertook was to reclaim the sidewalk for pedestrians by installing physical barriers to prevent cars from being parked on the sidewalk. Drivers and storeowners were outraged at being denied space to which they considered themselves entitled. With time, however, people began to see the beneficial results of his ideas.</p>
<p>TransMilenio was by far the most complex of Peñalosa’s projects, and it has transformed the face and functionality of Bogotá, the third-largest city in Latin America and the densest (with 3,900 persons / km<sup>2</sup>). According to the researchers of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (interview, Bogotá, September 15, 2009), Bogotános make an average of 6 million trips daily on public transit, about 60 percent of all trips made. This is a reflection of the quality of TransMilenio; research demonstrates that the number of trips taken on public transit increases when a system is reliable and efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094582X12468867">Hall, 2007</xref>: 11). TransMilenio was expected to transport 80 percent of the city’s population by 2015 with a service quality and speed similar to that of an underground metro system (Echeverry et al., 2005: 3). Only about 25 percent of residents own cars; the remaining residents rely on mass transit, which was not formalized until the first phase of the TransMilenio opened in 2000 (interview, Institute for Transportation and Development, Bogotá, September 15, 2009).</p>
<p>For car owners, public transportation is synonymous with chaos and poverty. In Bogotá and other cities in Colombia, this association can be attributed to <italic>flotas</italic>. A flota is a private minibus used for urban transit; flota drivers often use dangerous and disruptive tactics as they compete fiercely for fares and to entice customers. The flotas presented the largest obstacle for the Peñalosa administration’s ability to implement the TransMilenio. Controlled by organized crime, which “owned” the routes and rented out the right to use them, more than 700 lines of flotas run by 68 private bus companies and more than 20,000 bus owners strangled the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X12468867">Ardila, 2007</xref>). This oligarchy did have its rules, with little intervention from the public sector; organized crime groups rented out multiple rights to a single route, while the oversupply of buses clogged the streets.</p>
<p>Drivers were paid by the number of passengers, and this encouraged them to engage in <italic>guerras del centavo</italic> (penny wars), recklessly speeding through the streets while battling with competing drivers for passengers (Edgar Sandoval, interview, Bogotá, September 29, 2009). The lack of coordination between bus owners and the various drivers meant that the supply of buses remained constant throughout the day, with insufficient buses during rush hour and too many during off-peak times. This system is slowly being replaced by efficient bus systems overseen by the government. While car drivers still endure long commutes and congestion, people who take the TransMilenio have left congestion behind.</p>
<p>Under Peñalosa, the government began by buying the flotas off the street. His administration received criticism for negotiating with organized crime groups, but Peñalosa contends that drastic action was needed to overhaul the transit system. Through cash buyouts, which took flotas off the road, the government replaced them with new TransMilenio buses. Part of the buyout deal was the creation of a one-kilometer buffer surrounding the new TransMilenio route in which no flotas could operate. The buyout cost rose over time; while in 1999 the government purchased and disposed of 2.7 flotas for each new TransMilenio bus, by 2003 it had to purchase 7.8 (Carlos Felipe Pardo, interview, Bogotá, Sepember 15, 2009).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the government appropriated some structuring tactics from the old system. For the TransMilenio, the government owns the routes and rents the rights to contracted private bus operators for a specific length of time, usually seven years. Countless improvements and changes have been made under the new system, perhaps foremost among them that drivers are no longer engrossed in “penny wars” because they are now paid by kilometer traveled rather than number of passengers.</p>

<title>Transmilenio Backlash and Future</title>
<p>The success of TransMilenio has brought forth critics who question the effects of this transportation development on the city’s poorest residents and its role as a gentrifying agent. Former Mayor Enrique Peñalosa touts TransMilenio as the ultimate egalitarian transit solution—uniting the poorest and the richest as they ride to work side-by-side, avoiding traffic and reaping the environmental benefits of less car-borne pollution. In a city with a stark, often-violent history of poverty, Peñalosa’s vision is ambitious and idealistic, and he is not alone in his thinking; over US$1.7 billion has been poured into transport infrastructure and related urban projects in Bogotá in the first years of this millennium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12468867">Cervero, 2005</xref>). This investment comes as urban transit investment practices are changing globally. Facing criticism for past investment in expensive metro systems that predominantly benefited the upper class, the World Bank now requires the transit projects it funds to “meet a ‘poverty alleviation’ litmus test” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12468867">Cervero, 2005</xref>: 24).</p>
<p>In Peñalosa’s eyes, TransMilenio is perhaps the ultimate poverty alleviator, since the poor cannot afford cars and must walk, bike, or use public transit. Without sufficient access to transit, their mobility is challenged and they are hindered from obtaining employment and economic gain. A functional, efficient public transit system not only mobilizes the city’s residents but attracts investment, particularly in transit corridors (Enrique Peñalosa, interview, Bogotá, September 30, 2009; Oscar Diaz, interview, Bogotá, September 15, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12468867">Cervero, 2005</xref>). Statistics support Peñalosa’s theory; within a year of its opening, property values along TransMilenio corridors were higher across the board, and it has been suggested that this is because of the “enhanced access” and lower crime rates that resulted from increased pedestrian presence and lower noise and pollution levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12468867">Cervero, 2005</xref>: 26) and the construction of the public plazas, parks, libraries, shopping malls, and other facilities around many stations. Peñalosa argued that public pedestrian places are the only spaces on our planet that are truly accessible. At each TransMilenio station there is a park, a community facility, or a shopping center, and these improvements help to encourage other development.</p>
<p>Quantifying a connection between property values and transportation infrastructure is, however, nearly impossible because of the large number of variables involved. Even very comprehensive studies yield mixed results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X12468867">Bowes and Ihlanfeldt, 2001</xref>). Examining the effect of bus rapid transit co-location on property values is made even more difficult by the fact that the vast majority of studies of this kind focus on rail transit. The handful of studies conducted so far on TransMilenio and property values have yet to produce clear conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0094582X12468867">Mendieta and Perdomo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0094582X12468867">Muñoz-Raskin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0094582X12468867">Perdomo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0094582X12468867">Rodriguez and Mojica, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0094582X12468867">Rodriguez and Targa, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Also controversial is Peñalosa’s “If you build it, they will come” strategy. Scholars and critics charge that the poor, rather than being the beneficiaries of this development and the rise in property values, are the ones who bear the cost of these “experiments in physical determinism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12468867">Cervero, 2005</xref>: 27). For example, in some neighborhoods, old-style informal marketplaces catering to the poor (both as vendors and consumers) were razed in order to make room for the TransMilenio infrastructure and the new public and consumer spaces. Critics contend that these changes have led to the creation of an “elitist cityscape” that overlooks the importance of certain spaces to the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12468867">Cervero, 2005</xref>: 28). Increased property values make it challenging for small-scale vendors to find places to set up shop, and the general crackdown on informal marketplaces—part of Peñalosa’s strategy to make Bogotá appealing to investors—has made business challenging for many small-scale merchants.</p>
<p>From the start, Peñalosa has also emphasized the egalitarianism of the free feeder-bus system (<italic>autobuses alimentadores</italic>), which connects residents of hard-to-access peripheral neighborhoods (<italic>barrios marginales</italic>) with the exclusive busways (<italic>troncales</italic>) of the TransMilenio. In 2001 these peripheral, hillside neighborhoods, often informal settlements with unpaved roads, “housed 22 percent of the city’s population on 18 percent of its land area” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12468867">Cervero, 2005</xref>: 29). Almost all of these barrios lack public services, and travel in and out of them is challenging and slow. Peñalosa argues that before TransMilenio, people from these neighborhoods had extremely long commute times and often had to pay multiple fares on unsafe and unreliable flotas in order to reach their jobs (interview, Bogotá, Sepember 30, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12468867">Cervero, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As part of Peñalosa’s TransMilenio-grounded quality-of-life improvement strategy, the city developed Metrovivienda, a land-banking project that purchases or uses eminent domain to acquire privately owned open space on the urban periphery. These large tracts are then sold to experienced developers to be improved, parceled, and sold as “market-rate” housing affordable to low-income families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X12468867">Cullen-Cheung, 2005</xref>). Ideally, this program improves the quality of life for the impoverished residents of the barrios while creating an incentive for developers to improve access to transit and other public services. In practice, however, at market rate, this land is unaffordable for families in the lowest income strata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12468867">Cervero, 2005</xref>: 29). Thus, rather than being beneficiaries, the lowest-income residents have been forced out by the arrival of TransMilenio.</p>
<p>Critics have pointed out that three of the four completed Metrovivienda projects have been built near TransMilenio terminus stations. Peñalosa contends that by moving from peripheral illegal settlements into transit-served Metrovivienda projects low-income people gain both legal, serviced housing and better access to the city’s economic hubs (interview, Bogotá, September 30, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12468867">Cervero, 2005</xref>). However, critics maintain that this land-banking and development strategy excludes the lowest-income groups; a 2004 study found that people residing close to TransMilenio stations paid higher monthly rents than others with comparable incomes living in similar neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12468867">Cervero, 2005</xref>). While it is inarguable that transit costs are lower than before, critics maintain that Metrovivienda has developer interests at heart and has pushed people from the lowest income strata farther out, doing little to meet the housing needs of the millions living in slums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X12468867">Cullen-Cheung, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Peñalosa’s commitment to building public facilities at TransMilenio stations is harder to attack. More than 400,000 people a month visit the libraries and other public community facilities built near TransMilenio lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X12468867">Peñalosa, 2010</xref>). The libraries initiative has meant a significant improvement in the quality of life for low-income residents.</p>
<p>Despite the controversy surrounding aspects of Peñalosa’s comprehensive program, public transportation has certainly become safer, more reliable, and more affordable. TransMilenio buses are held to safety standards and inspected regularly; they operate on a regular, posted schedule, which makes commutes more predictable and easier to plan; and, perhaps most important for Bogotá’s poorest residents, people who previously had a two-bus commute, paying an average of 1,300 pesos per ride or 5,200 pesos (US$2.87) daily round trip, now pay 3,000 pesos (US $1.65) daily (prices reflect 2010 fares and conversion rates).</p>
<p>The comprehensive TransMilenio initiative creates affordable transport, improving intracity travel and access to better housing, jobs, and services while regulating service and reducing transit costs. Prior to TransMilenio, housing and transport absorbed about two-thirds of the income of Bogotá’s poorest residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12468867">Cervero, 2005</xref>). TransMilenio and its related initiatives have improved the quality of life and safety in the city as well as making it more appealing to investors.</p>
<p>Peñalosa left office at the end of his term in December 2000 with high approval ratings. Mayors cannot be immediately reelected, but the next two mayors, Antanas Mockus and Luis Eduardo Garzón, continued the TransMilenio project by planning and beginning to implement its second stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X12468867">Ardila, 2007</xref>). At the same time, that Peñalosa lost his 2007 reelection campaign perhaps speaks to the question of the sustained popularity of his tactics.</p>

<sec id="section3-0094582X12468867">
<title>The Rise of Rail and The Transit Future of Bogotá</title>
<p>Mayors Antanas Mockus (2001–2003) and Luis Eduardo Garzón (2004–2006) struggled with the issues of overcrowding and efficient service provision that emerged as the TransMilenio system grew and became increasingly successful. They also championed other social investment projects, and while TransMilenio was not their favorite neither of them abandoned the objectives of the system. This all changed in 2007, when Samuel Moreno Rojas was elected mayor; his very well-received platform centered on the construction of a subway system. He argued that a subway would propel Bogotá to a new level in its development and sophistication, with transit infrastructure comparable to the well-known systems of London, New York, Paris, Tokyo, and other major global economic and cultural centers. His proposal was at least in part a response to ever-increasing criticism of TransMilenio.</p>
<p>Locals have come to call the system the “TransmiLLENO” (from the Spanish for “full”) because of the crowded conditions, which are sometimes up to seven or eight people per square meter at peak times (Edgar Sandoval, interview, Bogotá, September 29, 2009). Another challenge to the sustainability of TransMilenio is that the exclusive busways have not been adequately maintained and repaired. In the decade since the system opened, the city government (the body responsible for infrastructure maintenance) has sometimes been neglectful as mayors pursued other budgetary priorities, thus causing this infrastructure to suffer. This deterioration presents safety and efficiency problems as well as damaging the system’s reputation. Because of the shortage of funds, the government turned to the private sector, and the privatized financing structure of the TransMilenio has prevented it from adapting to high ridership levels. All revenue comes from fares; without public financial subsidy, the private bus operators function solely on the incentive to turn a profit from fare collection. It is not profitable to run the number of buses needed to provide comfortable service during rush hour and frequent, rapid service during off-peak hours. Therefore the system has overcrowding during rush hours and not enough buses running during off-peak times. With the implementation of the neoliberal policies instead of public subsidy, the system has limited options. The private sector has no financial incentive to improve conditions, and this is why it is important that mass transportation be a public service rather than a profit-driven private endeavor.</p>
<p>In response to overcrowding and declining service, Rojas presented a costly new idea: abandoning expansion of the TransMilenio and constructing a subway. Unfortunately, the cost of building a subterranean rail system is at least 20 times that of bus rapid transit: up to US$20 million per kilometer, depending on bedrock conditions. In Bogotá the cost is prohibitive, given that the city collects only US$400 million a year in property taxes. The corridor proposed for the subway is La Septima (Seventh Avenue), which goes through one of Bogotá’s wealthiest neighborhoods. The intent behind this proposed subway is unclear. During Moreno’s campaign and afterward, Peñalosa argued that wealthy people who drive their own cars would never switch to public transportation; recent research in the United States and Europe corroborates this view (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094582X12468867">Hall, 2007</xref>). He contends that the wealthy support the idea of the subway not because they plan to use it but because they want less competition for road space. If the TransMilenio were to run in this corridor as proposed under the current expansion plan, it would operate at grade, taking away road space from cars.</p>
<p>In the globalized economy of today, Bogotá is competing for investment with other cities. In order to attract investment and harness transnational capital flows, a certain level of infrastructure is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0094582X12468867">Sassen, 2006</xref>). Large multinational corporations demand Class A office buildings with connectivity to reliable, powerful digitized communications networks and up-to-date, functional infrastructure. Safety, mobility, and quality of life all factor into the decision of a company to locate in a specific place. Local politicians and business leaders worry that without a traditional rapid transit system Bogotá might be considered to lack a functional transportation network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X12468867">Peñalosa, 2010</xref>). For some, the development of rail transit would demonstrate to the global community that Bogotá is a global city. This goal of attracting international capital sometimes clouds public policy and compromises social development. This questionable prioritization has social costs; sustained economic growth is possible only with equitable distribution of benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X12468867">Jensen-Butler, 1999</xref>). In short, the misperception of what makes a city “global” is negatively influencing the choices of policy makers in Bogotá.</p>
<p>The reality is that subway construction is slow and expensive. In Bogotá, it would divert funds from a planned next phase of TransMilenio to build a comparatively limited subterranean rail line serving only the wealthiest area of the city (Oscar Diaz, interview, Bogotá, September 15, 2009). Furthermore, Peñalosa (interview, Bogotá, September 30, 2009) contends, the subway is intended to get the poor people who rely on public transit off the street, hiding their presence in wealthy areas by creating an underground transit network and leaving the streets to private cars. With TransMilenio, the city changed the definition of a transportation system fit for a global city. Instead of opting to continue with it and support innovation, Rojas proposed to reverse this progress for his own political gain. The pursuit of “cosmopolitanism” would interfere with the functionality of the system and its long-term success and sustainability.</p>
<p>Moreno’s vision will, however, never be realized. In May 2011, during the last year of his term, he was suspended from office for three months for negligence in overseeing public contracts. Several political leaders called for his resignation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094582X12468867">Romero, 2011</xref>). He stepped down, and in January 2012 the progressive Gustavo Petro was elected mayor of Bogotá. In his governance plan, Petro outlined his commitment to moving forward with the original expansion plan for TransMilenio without laying out a specific strategy for its execution. The prospects for a successful future for TransMilenio remain unclear.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>From its inception, TransMilenio was a political project, an innovative idea born during Peñalosa’s 1997 campaign. Because transportation reform visibly changes the face and functionality of the city, it often becomes a hot-button issue and a powerful negotiating device in the political landscape. Politicians can use transportation projects as tools for gaining sufficient popularity to be elected to office. As mobility, interconnectivity, and efficiency become increasingly valuable in the rapidly growing and changing global city, innovation becomes increasingly crucial. Not only in its design but also in its financial structuring the TransMilienio is innovative in many ways. It achieved the status of the world’s premier bus rapid transit system, but it has been hampered by neoliberal policies that limited service and improvement potential.</p>
<p>TransMilenio can become competitive in a global world, showcasing a new way for urban mobility networks to develop. It changed the face of Bogotá, but its success had the unintended consequence of turning the populace against it. Mayor Petro is throwing renewed support behind the system, and with him at the helm the planned expansion may be realized, with the potential of making TransMilenio one of the most comprehensive mobility networks in Latin America. The history of the project calls attention to the complexity of the challenges involved in even the most celebrated success stories of transportation innovation.</p>
