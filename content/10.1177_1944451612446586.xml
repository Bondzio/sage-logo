<p>In this issue of <italic>ICU Director</italic>, we take on the liver. In my view, the liver is the third most important organ in the body, behind the brain and the heart (apologies to Woody Allen). The liver occupies a central position in the circulation, situated between the gastrointestinal tract and the cardiopulmonary system, acting as the guardian of the body with its detoxifying capability, its role in metabolism and its ability to synthesize important proteins and hormones.</p>

<p>“Modern medicine now fully appreciates the remarkable regenerative capacity of the liver and exploits this characteristic when we do radical liver resections and living donor liver transplantation.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The ancients must have appreciated the importance of the liver because of the stark mythology that arose about it. The myth of Prometheus is always worth a retelling (for a recent Hollywood take on the story see the current Ridley Scott movie).</p>
<p>Prometheus, who himself was a god, felt a strong allegiance to us sub-godlike humans. In Greek mythology he is credited with giving us writing, mathematics, agriculture, medicine, and science. For this he was not a favorite of his fellow jealous gods. His most treasonous act was to give humans the secret of fire—a bit of knowledge that had been the exclusive domain of the Olympians. When vengeful Zeus found out about this leak of vital information, he was angry . . . very angry and he wanted to make an example of Prometheus. Zeus ordered Prometheus chained to a rock on Mt. Sinai, where each day an eagle would fly down from Mt. Olympus to come and feed on his liver. This ritual was carried out day after day for eternity.</p>
<p>Implicit in this story of repeated trauma is a concept that may have been grasped by ancient mythmakers: that the liver can regenerate itself. Daily consumption of the liver by an eagle cannot continue very long without there being some mechanism for the liver to bounce back.</p>
<p>Modern medicine now fully appreciates the remarkable regenerative capacity of the liver and exploits this characteristic when we do radical liver resections and living donor liver transplantation. Skilled liver surgeons can resect or “harvest” more than two thirds of the liver safely, knowing that within a few weeks it will regrow back to its steady-state size (about 2% of body mass). There are few major organs in the body that can do that! And so, the daily torture prescribed for Prometheus by Zeus was also daily shrugged off by his liver.</p>
<p>The liver does have its limits for recovery from injury. It can be acutely overwhelmed by poison or other conditions, leading to acute liver failure. It can be subjected to chronic injury that produces inflammation, fibrosis, and ultimately cirrhosis. Both of these may require liver transplantation for survival of the patient and thus the need for a viable donor liver.</p>
<p>In this issue of <italic>ICU Director</italic>, we present articles about these 3 aspects of liver care: (<italic>a</italic>) management of acute liver failure, (<italic>b</italic>) use of ultrasound to avoid complications during biopsy of the cirrhotic liver (with portal hypertension), and (<italic>c</italic>) care of the organ donor in the ICU prior to donation. The issue also contains significant articles on the problem of right ventricular dysfunction in sepsis and a well-documented case report of severe eosinophilic drug reaction. There is also an excellent bench-to-bedside update from a leading research group about the emerging understanding of the role of a particular molecular marker in pulmonary pathophysiology. Finally, we round out the issue with a perspective on how the ICU can fit into your hospital’s emergency preparedness plan. I hope you enjoy this issue of the <italic>ICU Director</italic>.</p>
