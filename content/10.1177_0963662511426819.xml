<p>This article examines the longitudinal development of environmental news reporting in Swedish television over an extended period of time, 1961–2010. It returns to Anthony Downs’s (1972) seminal article on issue attention cycles when analyzing the cyclic nature of environmental news reporting and advances the issue attention cycle framework by introducing the concept of metacycles as it explores the trajectory of environmental news reporting. Metacycles refers to the major fluctuations in attention to the entire domain of environmental issues over time, while issue cycles refer to the oscillation in attention pertaining to single issues. The article analyzes the pattern of the metacycles, and investigates how cycles of attention to individual issues contribute to the shaping of the environmental metacycles in the news.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>The fact that public attention to environmental issues tends to fluctuate and that individual issues come and go on the agenda is often referred to as issue attention cycles. This concept was originally conceived by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662511426819">Anthony Downs (1972)</xref> in a seminal article, where he claimed that public attention rarely remains focused upon any one issue for very long. Instead, “a systematic ‘issue-attention cycle’ seems strongly to influence public attitudes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662511426819">1972</xref>: 38). Using environmental issues as his empirical case, the concept of issue attention cycles has proven to be particularly useful to scholars interested in unraveling the trajectories of the attention to environmental issues in the media.</p>
<p>It is now forty years since Downs published his article on issue attention cycles and more than fifty years since the environment first found its way on to the agenda of the news media. Over the years a number of studies on media attention cycles for environmental issues have been published.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963662511426819">1</xref></sup> This article contributes to this field of research by examining five decades of environmental reporting in Swedish television news and by advancing the concept of metacycles when exploring the cyclic nature of environmental news. A metacycle refers to the major fluctuations in attention to the domain of environmental issues over time, while issue cycles refer to the oscillation in attention pertaining to single issues. To what extent is attention to environmental issues in the news really cyclic and does the pattern of the metacycles change over time? How do cycles of attention to single issues contribute to the shaping of the metacycles of attention to environmental issues as a whole?</p>
<p>The remainder of the article is organized as follows. First, it offers an overview of the research field, pinpointing its key conceptual and empirical challenges. It then proceeds to present an empirical analysis of metacycles in environmental reporting in Swedish television news over five decades, followed by an inquiry into the categories of issues that have displayed the highest levels of attention over the years. A discussion on the relationship between metacycles and single issue cycles closes the article.</p>

<title>2. Reassessing the “issue” “attention” “cycle” framework</title>
<p>Research on issue attention cycles in the media is, indeed, a diverse field comprising a range of approaches. Most studies to date show support for the existence of attention cycles in the news, but conclusions on the cyclic nature of reporting vary owing to differences in the definitions of key concepts and in the empirical research focus (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662511426819">Newig, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Any study on issue cycles must begin by defining what constitute <italic>issues</italic> in the first place. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662511426819">Downs’s (1972)</xref> article, issues referred to social problems turning into matters of public concern, prompting political leaders to “do something” to address the problem. Most studies on issue cycles in the media, however, apply a wider definition, adhering to the (constructivist) sociological definition of issues as matters of public concern that involve contending views/interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662511426819">Molotch and Lester, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662511426819">Hilgartner and Bosk, 1988</xref>), as opposed to the political science notion of issues as public matters involving political institutions.</p>
<p>Downs obviously referred to environmental issues broadly defined in his analysis, speaking of “ecological matters,” “the quality of our environment,” and “pollution.” However, so far most studies on issue cycles in the media have focused on single issues (mostly climate change), and attempts at applying the attention cycle framework on the entire domain of environmental issues are few and scattered (see<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0963662511426819">2</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662511426819">Brooks et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662511426819">Schoenfeld et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662511426819">Bowman and Fuchs, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662511426819">Einsiedel and Coughlan, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662511426819">Suhonen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662511426819">Ader, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511426819">Shanahan and McComas, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511426819">Atinmo and Jimba, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662511426819">Mazur, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662511426819">Chan, 1999</xref>). In the latter category of studies, however, inconsistent definitions of issues tend to render true comparisons among countries, media, and across time difficult. For instance, natural disasters, energy issues, and workplace environment are issues that appear in some studies but not in others.</p>
<p>Secondly, with regard to the definition of <italic>attention</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662511426819">Downs (1972)</xref> conceived of cycles of public attention as a catch-all concept for the attention displayed in a range of public arenas: the media, political parties, and among the public. All the studies reviewed here are selected on the premise that they focus on the media attention to issues, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511426819">Hansen (2010</xref>: 21) even advances the concept of media attention cycles to distinguish media attention studies from Downs’s all-inclusive model. Still, in some studies issue attention cycles are used synonymously with media attention cycles (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662511426819">Brossard et al., 2004</xref>: 359; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662511426819">Newig, 2004</xref>). However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511426819">Hansen (2010</xref>: 21) points out, they are not identical and the “socio-political career” of an issue cannot be deduced from studying its media career only.</p>
<p>Finally, the viability of the key concept of <italic>cycle</italic> has also been questioned. Scholars have taken issue with Downs’s claim that there are natural stages or cycles that issues go through. They argue that instead of natural histories (stages, phases), environmental issues are socially constructed and that the oscillating patterns stem from the dynamic competition and interaction among claims-makers in various institutional arenas (invariably quoting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662511426819">Hilgartner and Bosk, 1988</xref>). Consequently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511426819">Carvahlo and Burgess (2005)</xref> chose to refer to environmental journalism as part of a cultural-political circuit instead of cycles, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662511426819">Nisbet and Huge (2006</xref>: 3) speak of “mediated issue development.”</p>
<p>There are also contending views on how to define a cycle. The common ground among scholars here is that a cycle represents a period of heightened attention. An attention cycle can then refer either to a single peak in attention after which the issue fades away, or to a series of attention peaks producing a wave-like pattern (i.e. recurring cycles). When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662511426819">Downs (1972)</xref> defined the issue attention cycle he took the single-peak pattern as his point of departure; once an issue has reached its peak the attention will never again return to the same level. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662511426819">Suhonen (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662511426819">Trumbo (1996)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662511426819">McComas and Shanahan (1999)</xref> also focus on the single-peak model in their analyses while others (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662511426819">Nisbet and Lewenstein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511426819">Carvahlo and Burgess, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662511426819">Nisbet and Huge, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662511426819">Boykoff, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662511426819">2008</xref>) clearly allow for repeated cycles or recurring waves in their approach.</p>
<p>The diverging viewpoints on the nature of media attention cycles do, furthermore, come from the empirical focus in existing studies. Recent longitudinal studies have typically dealt with single issues, most notably with climate change (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963662511426819">Ungar, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662511426819">Trumbo, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662511426819">McComas and Shanahan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662511426819">Brossard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511426819">Carvalho and Burgess, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662511426819">Boykoff, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662511426819">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511426819">Boykoff and Boykoff, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662511426819">Carvahlo, 2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963662511426819">Wilkins, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963662511426819">Weingart et al., 2000</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0963662511426819">3</xref></sup> The case studies on climate change have provided valuable insights into how issue cycles are created by the power relations and interactions within and between the news media and the institutions of environmental science and politics. When researchers find evidence of cyclicality in climate change reporting however, it is hard to know for sure which phase in the cycle of an issue the period studied actually represents. The early peaks in attention identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662511426819">Trumbo (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662511426819">Brossard et al. (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511426819">Carvahlo and Burgess (2005)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511426819">Boykoff and Boykoff (2007)</xref> were apparently just the initial stages before the major peak for news on climate change in 2006 onwards (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662511426819">Boykoff, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662511426819">2008</xref>). On the other hand, a study of a less celebrated issue, plant biotechnology, over a longer period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662511426819">Nisbet and Huge, 2006</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662511426819">Nisbet and Lewenstein, 2002</xref>) shows that issues can go through attention cycles without ever being “the talk of the day.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662511426819">Newig (2004</xref>: 179ff.) also finds issue attention cycles in his study of the attention to three environmental issues in German newspapers: acid rain, summer smog, and BSE.</p>
<p>Longitudinal studies addressing the entire domain of environmental issues do generally substantiate the presence of cycles, but they are few and mainly cover the first decades of environmental reporting (see above; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511426819">Hansen, 2010</xref>: 22ff.). We know much less about the attention to the environmental domain in the news from the 1990s onwards. Also, several studies in this strand of research are based on samples of years (or time periods), thus disallowing the continuous tracing of individual issues over time.</p>
<p>Partly due to the lack of empirical evidence, there are contending views about the universal nature of attention cycles. Most studies to date have been conducted on US or British media, and typically on the press. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662511426819">Brossard et al. (2004)</xref> critique the Anglo-American bias, suggesting that there may be cultural differences in media attention patterns (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662511426819">Hansen, 1991</xref>). Investigating the case of global warming in France and the United States (comparing <italic>Le Monde</italic> and <italic>The News York Times</italic> 1987–1997), they claim that journalistic regimes will offer “different opportunities, standards, and guidelines for assessing potential audience interest in a story” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662511426819">Brossard et al., 2004</xref>: 363). The journalism of neutral and informative “objectivism” emphasized in an American context is thus more prone to cyclical patterns than the French “journalism of opinion.” The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662511426819">Brossard et al. (2004)</xref> provides fuel for the argument that a universal theory of cyclical media attention clearly cannot emerge from studying American or British coverage only. However, there is clearly also a need for analyses of a wider range of environmental issues and for studies over longer periods of time.</p>
<p>This brief research review identifies several research questions worthy of further investigation. The first issue is whether the attention to the environment in the news actually is cyclical when examined over an extended period of time and focusing on a country representing a “democratic corporatist” media system typical of Scandinavia and Northern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662511426819">Hallin and Mancini, 2004</xref>). To what extent are cycles of attention present in the Swedish media as well, and to what degree has environmental reporting become more or less prone to cyclical patterns over time?</p>
<p>The second query is how cycles of attention to single issues contribute to the shaping of the cycles of attention to environmental issues as a whole. Previous research on media attention cycles uses the framework of issue cycles both to describe fluctuations in media attention to the entire domain of environmental issues and to capture similar patterns of attention to single issues. To address this problem, this article introduces the concept of metacycles when referring to the attention to the entire domain of environmental issues in the news. This allows for a longitudinal measurement of the attention to all issues dealing with “the environment”—the metacycles—while simultaneously measuring the single issues contributing to those metacycles.</p>

<title>3. Research design and methodology</title>
<p>The research strategy guiding the study is to investigate the daily flow of topics on the news agenda over a very long period of time. This type of analysis must, for all practical reasons, focus on a single news outlet. The outlet chosen is the main newscast in public service television (PST) in Sweden, where the content of the news programs <italic>Aktuellt</italic> and <italic>Rapport</italic> were analyzed over a 50-year period. All the main (prime-time) newscasts from January 1961 until June 2010 were examined and <italic>all news stories on the environment</italic> broadcast during these years were registered.</p>
<p>Most studies on media attention cycles have focused on the press. A problem when analyzing newspapers is that the volume and format of papers have changed considerably, making it difficult to find consistent measures of attention that are comparable over time. The present study makes television news the object of investigation and by focusing on a specific news program that has displayed basically the same “format” (30 minutes news program free of commercials, led by an anchor and mixing news bulletins and longer stories) for over fifty years, consistent and comparable measures of attention are attainable.</p>
<p>The choice of making Swedish <italic>public service</italic> television news the main focus of the study is primarily based on its wide reach and societal significance. Public service television is no doubt the main news source for national and international news in Sweden. This comes from the character of the media system where television is predominantly national, while the press is local and regional. Sweden typifies what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662511426819">Hallin and Mancini (2004)</xref> call the democratic corporatist media systems, where the strength and cultural importance of public service broadcasting is a fundamental feature of the system. Despite the fact that the monopoly was broken and privately owned television was introduced in the early 1990s, PST continues to have an immense impact on social and political life and public service newscasts still have the widest reach among the television channels.</p>
<p>Swedish public service television started broadcasting on one channel in 1956 and the first news magazine <italic>Aktuellt</italic> began in 1958. In 1969, a second PST channel went on air, carrying a news program of its own, <italic>Rapport. Aktuellt</italic> still had the largest audience, but from the early 1970s <italic>Aktuellt</italic> became more geared towards commentary and public affairs. <italic>Rapport</italic> soon became the main news program in public service television and established its position as the most watched news show in the country. In the 2000s, the two news desks were merged but both programs kept their brand names. Focusing on what can be considered the main news show in public service television, <italic>Aktuellt</italic> was chosen for the analysis from 1961 to 1969 and <italic>Rapport</italic> for the rest of the period 1970–2010.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0963662511426819">4</xref></sup> All the programs broadcast during the prime-time slot in these years were surveyed for environmental news stories.</p>
<p>To actually watch all newscasts over a 50-year period was deemed an impossible task. Instead the analysis is based on the written documentation produced in association with the airing of all newscasts. These so-called “day-after-lists” are recorded the day after the broadcast and contain detailed information on the content of the news show; including all stories covered in the order they appear in the show, the type and length of news items (including telegrams, live, studio), descriptions of the content of all news stories, and accounts of all interviewees that appear in the program (their name, position and affiliation).</p>
<p>The search for environmental stories was done manually, i.e. no archival search engine was used, by examining all lists and judging each news item separately. The coding scheme was revised and data recoded several times, so that all major news topics would be included from the first story and onwards. All the coding and analysis were conducted by the present author to ensure consistency in coding principles.</p>
<p>The study departs from a constructivist approach and suggests that environmental news is constructed when journalists frame certain topics and events as “environmental.” Since the domain of environmental issues is both dynamic and expanding, it is difficult to find a “timeless” definition to identify environmental news over such an extended period of time. The solution is to use a definition that departs from the common denominator of all major environmental discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662511426819">Dryzek, 1997</xref>); the growing public concern over the negative and unwanted effect of human activity on the natural world, and the notion that environmental problems comprise the anthropogenic impact on living organisms (humans, animals, plants) and the natural environment in which they exist. Thus, environmental news (is framed as to) concern the negative impact or the risk for such an impact of human activities on the natural world, but also all the societal processes and activities related to these problems (including research, technical innovation, opinions, activism, protests, politics, policy, decision making, etc.). Energy issues (e.g. nuclear, fossil, and renewable energy) are included when stories focus on the environmental implications of energy production and consumption (including nuclear waste disposal and energy conservation). Natural disasters such as flooding, hurricanes, and droughts are part of the environmental domain if and when they are framed as caused by human activities. The same goes for major pandemics, such as when the spread of bird flu was framed as a consequence of the industrialization of farming.</p>
<p>Using this strategy for selection, 8867 environmental stories were found during the search. These stories were subjected to a quantitative analysis. All news topics were classified into main thematic categories consisting of similar and related issues/topics (broad problem areas, cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662511426819">Newig, 2004</xref>: 155), and the categorization was done in a way that facilitates for comparisons both over time and across countries. The main categories are chosen as to cover the main themes in the environmental debate since the 1960s onwards. For instance, “industrial pollution” (the general category) is present in all countries, but the specific industries or production processes that are the targets of the debate obviously vary (the specific topics). All news stories that were identified as “environmental” according to the chosen definition of environmental news (above) were coded, and the few issues and topics that would not fit into any of the predefined thematic categories were classified as “Other issues/topics.”</p>
<p>The main thematic categories of the study are:</p>
<list id="list1-0963662511426819" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Air pollution</italic> and quality, including smog, general emissions, regulations and management of air pollution</p></list-item>

<p>To be able to compute and compare “attention” over the years it was necessary to develop a consistent measure of the level of attention. Two initial measures were produced: (a) the number of stories on environmental news, and (b) the time allotted to environmental news. The latter is the number of stories weighted by their duration. Since the length of the stories changes considerably over time, this measure provides the best comparative estimate of “attention.” Both measures are then divided by the number of newscasts each year to generate two measures that are consistent and comparable over time: (1) <italic>the number of environmental stories per newscast</italic>, and (2) <italic>the broadcast time for environmental news per newscast</italic>. Lists for the year 2005 were not available in the archive when coding was conducted in 2010, and 2005 is excluded from the analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0963662511426819">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>4. Five decades of environmental news: Recurring cycles of attention</title>
<p>The attention to the environment in Swedish public service television news has indeed displayed a series of significant ups and downs over the years. When all environmental stories are included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963662511426819">Figure 1</xref>) and the attention is measured as seconds per newscast, a wave-like pattern is evident. Environmental reporting started at a very low level in the first years of the 1960s, but has since displayed three major peaks in attention: 1986, 1979 and 2007. However, 1967, 1969, 1972, 1977, 1984, 1988, 1997 and 2001 were also years when attention took a jump and reached high levels. On the other hand, 1982, 1991, 1999 and 2003 are years when attention dropped considerably. There is clear evidence of recurring metacycles of attention to environmental issues, as the waves in attention come and go quite regularly over the 50 years that were analyzed.</p>

</fig>
<p>If, however, a trend line (a regression line) is fitted to the data it is rising steadily, which means that over the 50 years—despite the rise and fall in attention in certain years—there is an overall positive trend in the attention to the environment. The trend line shows an increase from less than 40 seconds per newscast to over 80 seconds per newscast fifty years later. On average, attention to environmental issues has increased by one second per newscast each year. If, on the other hand, we exclude the first years of environmental debate and calculate the regression line from 1969 onwards, the increase in environmental attention is considerably smaller—only 0.3 seconds per year. The observed increase in environmental attention in the news is mainly related to the fact that environmental news has become less prone to plummet when the attention curve is descending. There is no evidence of higher peaks in attention over time, but the decreases in attention in the news cycle have become somewhat smaller. When the global financial crisis struck in 2008, the curve dropped. However, the years 2008–2010 saw a relatively high interest in the environment and the drop in attention was not as severe as previous low marks in 1982, 1991, 1999 and 2003.</p>
<p>With regard to the variation and composition of issues on the agenda it is obvious that the metacycles in Swedish television are closely related to international streams of environmental debate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0963662511426819">Table 1</xref>). The major peaks in reporting are similar to those found in previous—albeit limited in numbers and comparability—studies, both in time and in their thematic content (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511426819">Hansen, 2010</xref>: 22ff.). Here we find the focus on environmental conservation and biocides in the 1960s; the attention to industrial pollution in the 1970s; the intense nuclear power debate in the 1970s and 1980s spurred by Harrisburg (1979) and Chernobyl (1986); acid rain in the early 1980s; the environmental impact of food production (particularly GMOs, “mad cow disease” and the mistreatment of animals in industrialized meat production) in the late 1990s and early 2000s; and finally the heavy focus on climate change in the late 2000s. This clearly suggests that national metacycles are part of the global flow of public attention, often by focusing on the same global crises events (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662511426819">Cottle, 2009</xref>). To be sure, some of the noticeable surges in attention in Swedish television have appeared in conjunction with catastrophes occurring overseas. In 1986, when environmental reporting reached an all time high (441 stories were aired, comprising 117 seconds per newscast), the peak was mainly caused by the massive attention to the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in the Ukraine.</p>

<p>Furthermore, real-world events and developments influence the pattern of the environmental metacycle of attention. A common notion in both scholarly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662511426819">Downs, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662511426819">Inglehart, 1990</xref>) and public debate is that public concern for the environment is linked to economic affluence and growth and thus curtailed in times of economic stagnation or crisis. An in-depth empirical analysis of how the coverage of environmental issues and other topic areas in news are related to real-world economic growth and the level of international conflict is provided in another paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662511426819">Djerf-Pierre, 2011a</xref>). This analysis suggests that environmental coverage seems to be displaced when exposed to highly impacting and obtrusive real-life developments pertaining to crises in international relations and the global economy. The downswings in attention to the environment follow the economic cycle, i.e. attention decreases in times of recessions (early 1980s, early 1990s, and the late 2000s) and increases in periods of economic growth. War and international conflicts—such as the Falklands war in 1982, the Gulf war in 1991, the war in Kosovo in 1999, and the war in Darfur and the invasion of Iraq in 2003—also contribute to reducing environmental attention in the news.</p>

<sec id="section5-0963662511426819">
<title>5. Metacycles and issue cycles: The catastrophe, scandal, alarm and controversy</title>
<p>Although environmental catastrophes repeatedly attract attention, environmental news is not all disaster news. In fact, of all the 8867 stories identified over the 50 years of reporting, only about 15 percent are related to various forms of accidents and catastrophic events. If all stories on accidents and catastrophic events are excluded from the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963662511426819">Figure 1</xref>, the general pattern of ups and downs in attention remains the same. It is only in 1986 (Chernobyl) and in 2010 (Deepwater Horizon oil spill) that the omission of accidents and catastrophes significantly alters the general pattern of the attention curve.</p>
<p>The results so far highlight two important features of environmental news reporting. The first is that the attention to catastrophic accidents and disasters does not crowd out other environmental issues from the agenda, except in extreme situations (such as Chernobyl). On the contrary, the intense coverage of specific environmental disasters seems to promote environmental issues in the news by sensitizing the newsrooms to similar and related issues and increasing the general attentiveness to other issues in the environmental domain as well. Secondly, a close investigation of 50 years of reporting reveals that there are four different categories of issues that have produced the wave-like pattern of a heavy surge followed by a sharp decline in attention: catastrophes, scandals, alarms and controversies. As a matter of fact, <italic>all the major surges in attention to single environmental issues</italic> observed over these years have belonged to one of these four categories.</p>
<p>The four categories share a pattern of cyclical attention, appearing in single or recurring waves of intense news coverage, but they have different <italic>trigger events</italic> and <italic>trajectories</italic>.</p>
<p>With regard to the first category, <italic>environmental catastrophes</italic>, the news wave is triggered by suddenly occurring and rapidly evolving events, usually accidents. That is not to say that all catastrophic events are reported or even noticed by the news media, or that all catastrophes will develop into issues of public concern (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662511426819">Masel-Walters et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662511426819">Cottle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511426819">Hansen, 2010</xref>). It just implies that this particular type of news wave occurs simultaneously as the “real-life” occurrences play out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662511426819">Boin et al., 2005</xref>). Catastrophes reporting typically displays a single-peak pattern, starting with a quick and sharp rise in attention. News is—at least in its initial stage—heavily events-based (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963662511426819">Wilkins and Patterson, 1987</xref>), but can later also include thematic risk stories on the general subject matter of the disaster. One of the most frequently reported catastrophes in the news is the oil spill (5 percent of broadcast time over the years), and serious spills are often followed by stories investigating the risks of similar accidents elsewhere or reports on previous and related incidents. Major catastrophes that have commanded a lot of attention in the television news include the Torrey Canyon oil spill outside the UK in 1967, the Seveso industrial accident in Italy in 1976, the Amoco Cadiz oil spill outside France in 1978, the Bhopal industrial disaster in India in 1984, the nuclear accident at Chernobyl in the Ukraine in 1986, and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill outside Louisiana in the US in 2010.</p>
<p>Catastrophes result in a news wave that displays an immediate-peak pattern which then rapidly fades away. The cleanup may, however, take considerable time and catastrophes of greater magnitude are frequently followed by a public debate on whom or what to assign responsibility for events. This means that catastrophes often continue to produce news, sometimes years after the original events. This includes the annual commemoration on the day of the outbreak, when previous events are reassessed often in combination with stories on “what happened after.” In the most reported environmental catastrophe on Swedish television, the Chernobyl disaster (279 stories over the years), there was a sharp peak in attention in 1986 followed by a steep decline, but also a small increase in attention every tenth year after the original accident, when the disaster area was revisited and the events recapitulated.</p>
<p>In the <italic>environmental scandal</italic> the trigger event is the public disclosure of actions or activities that are morally and/or legally questionable, and where the actors involved would rather have dealt with them in more opaque ways (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662511426819">Thompson, 2000</xref>). Scandals involve transgressions of norms, and when revealed cause offense, indignation, and public expressions of disapproval. Some scandals involve illegal activities (such as dumping hazardous substances and chemicals or allowing emissions above legal standards) and may result in lawsuits, but it is not the legality but the morality of the actions that is the heart of the matter in the scandal. The logic of the scandal requires that someone is held to account, and the assignment of blame and the hunt for culprits are key news themes in the process. The catastrophe can, to be sure, also develop into a scandal, as the investigations following the accident may disclose administrative malfeasance, outright neglect or even criminal intent among those responsible for the facility where the accident occurred.</p>
<p>The trigger might originate in a police investigation or a government inquiry, made public through the media. It can also be the result of investigative reporting. Other disclosures are the work of concerned citizens or environmental groups that inform the news media of suspicious activities. In the 2000s, a series of disclosures of the mistreatment of animals in the meat industry were provided by animal rights activists, who secretly had filmed the severe conditions inside meat factories and slaughter houses. In the case of <italic>BT-kemi</italic> (1976–1982)—the first major environmental scandal in Sweden—the disclosure was the result of the relentless struggle of local citizens who joined forces with environmental activists in revealing that hundreds of barrels of toxic waste had been dumped and buried at the grounds of the company. The <italic>BT-kemi</italic> scandal led to a lawsuit and, eventually, the closure of the factory.</p>
<p>The two major environmental scandals appearing in the present analysis have involved private corporations with industry executives as culprits: <italic>BT-kemi</italic> (66 stories over the years) and the scandal surrounding the <italic>Hallandsåsen</italic> (1997–). The latter concerned the building of a tunnel through the <italic>Hallandsåsen</italic> ridge and the scandal came about when it was revealed that the toxic substances used in sealing the tunnel were leaking, both poisoning the tunnel workers and contaminating the water in the surrounding area. The attention was massive as the scandal burst in 1997, but a key feature of a scandal is that reporting tends to extend over a long time, producing multiple waves of attention over several years. Usually there is a huge surge of interest and reporting at the time of the disclosure, but reporters often come back to follow the process as the litigation may take several years to be settled. In the <italic>Hallandsåsen</italic> case, new events engendered several stories each year for more than ten years (99 stories over the years).</p>
<p>In the <italic>environmental alarm</italic> the trigger event typically originates from science or other legitimate institutions of scientific knowledge and occurs when scientific evidence of serious environmental risks or proof of an ongoing environmental degradation are presented. Scientists and experts are, obviously, key contributors here and the initial phase of the alarm often involves assessments of the risks and dangers uncovered by research. Climate change provides important examples in this category and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662511426819">McComas and Shanahan (1999)</xref> show how the initial stories in an issue cycle tend to focus on the consequences and implied dangers exposed by research. Later there are more stories about controversies among scientists and after that the economic implications and costs of remedies become more prominent. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662511426819">Trumbo (1996)</xref> concludes that scientists dominate the news in the initial stages of reporting whereas in the latter stages politicians and interest groups dominate as the issue becomes politicized. Several studies have highlighted the interplay between claims-making activities (including scientific debate) and “real” environmental events such as a series of extreme summer temperatures and droughts in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511426819">Carvalho and Burgess, 2005</xref>: 1466), the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963662511426819">Ungar, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662511426819">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662511426819">Shanahan and Good, 2000</xref>) and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662511426819">Hamilton, 2007</xref>: 193ff.) in promoting climate change on the news agenda. On the other hand, in the case of Sweden climate change came to dominate the news without major scientific controversies (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662511426819">Olausson, 2009</xref>) and without dramatic, domestic weather scares.</p>
<p>An alarm often concerns long-term risks or evolving environmental degradation and the ongoing strategic interactions among various claims-makers tend to produce recurring cycles of media attention. This pattern is present in all the major alarms present in the analysis of Swedish television news, including mercury pollution (a biocide) (1964–1968), the risks concerning chemical substances in industrial processes (PCB, vinyl chloride) and the use of pesticides in forestry (1970s), asbestos (1975–1978, 1985), acid rain and acidification (1971, 1984–1985), eutrophication of oceans (mainly 1987–1988), BSE (“mad cow disease”) (mainly 1996–1997, 2001), overfishing and depleted fish stocks (mainly 2002–2008), and obviously and most prominently the series of alarms on global warming and climate change in the 2000s. In the case of climate change and global warming (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963662511426819">Figure 2</xref>), we can see a series of minor surges in attention in 1990, 1997, and 2001, leading up to a major peak in 2006–2008. When comparing climate change to other major alarms in the news over the last 50 years, it stands out as the category that has commanded the greatest level of attention. For instance, the mercury biocide alarm in the 1960s and the issues concerning acid rain in 1980s generated only a fraction of the attention in their respective peak year.</p>

<p>The <italic>environmental controversy</italic> is typically initiated in the realm of politics. The trigger event may come from policy initiatives by political parties, governmental proposals, or from decisions made by government authorities or agencies. A common cause for controversy is a permission granted to industry to utilize, build on or otherwise exploit a specific resource or piece of land. The proposal or decision then triggers a reaction of opposition, accompanied by public criticism and protest. The role of environmental protests and activism is crucial in attracting attention to the issues and sometimes organized demonstrations or actions serve as trigger events that gain media attention in the first place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662511426819">Lester, 2010</xref>: 110ff.).</p>
<p>The core concern in a controversy is the risk of irreversible damage when exploiting nature in order to boost economic growth. Facility sitings and land use controversies are one major form, including disputes over the sitings of industries, power plants, nuclear waste disposal facilities, and the building of traffic routes. Other controversies relate to the management of common pool resources, such as fisheries and water resources. A third category concerns the actual policies to solve an ongoing environmental problem, such as the debate on carbon pricing and emissions trading; this means that an alarm certainly can develop into a controversy.</p>
<p>Controversies can be of short duration but may also continue over an extended period of time depending on how the claims-making activities in the dispute proceed. Usually the main surge in attention comes when the controversy is closing in to reach a conclusion. A feature of the major controversies to date is, however, that media attention tends to disappear as soon as the controversy has reached a settlement—no matter which is the victorious side. For instance, despite the years of intense protests and loud criticism over the building of the <italic>Öresundsbron</italic> (a bridge connecting Sweden and Denmark), once the bridge was built the debate came to a complete halt and the issue vanished from the news.</p>
<p>Polarization and conflict are the driving forces in the reporting of a controversy. Even though controversies involve a variety of interests, they tend to form two opposing sides in the news, promoting the “pro” and “con” arguments of the dispute. This can be the conservationists vs. the exploiters, or the proponents vs. the opponents of a specific policy or proposition.</p>
<p>The series of major environmental controversies reported in Swedish television starts with the damming of rivers to produce hydroelectric power at the <italic>Vindelälven</italic> in the 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s, there were several additional damming controversies, but also a series of intensely contested sitings of oil refineries and industries in different areas of Sweden. The opposition against the building of traffic routes such as the <italic>Scan Link</italic> highway (1989), the intense debate on the protection of wolves (1984–), the contested plans for building the <italic>Öresundsbron</italic> (mainly 1991–1994), the controversial <italic>Nordstream</italic> proposal to build a gas pipeline from Russia via the Baltic Sea (2006–) followed suit. The one controversy generating the most attention in the news is, however, the long-standing struggle over the use of nuclear power, including the debate on the disposal of nuclear waste that has been going on since the 1970s.</p>
<p>The single issues identified here as major cases of catastrophes, scandals, alarms and controversies are the ones that have received the highest level of attention in the five decades of reporting that were analyzed. This means that the catastrophe, scandal, alarm and controversy are the four main contributors to the metacycles in the news. It is not possible to calculate the proportion of attention to each of the four categories on a yearly basis; when it comes to individual issue cycles, some extend over several years (even decades), while others play out in just a couple of weeks. It is clear, however, that the different categories can appear in parallel and that no category completely dominates the news, with the exception of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 (which accounted for 43 percent of the environmental stories that year). The rest of the issues mentioned generated attention levels ranging from 15 to 20 stories to over a hundred and the proportion of attention to each in a single year varied from around 6–7 percent to about a third of all environmental news stories. This implies that while attention surges pertaining to individual issues account for a substantial part of the metacycles, there are also contributions from single and scattered stories on a broad variety of environmental topics and issues.</p>
<p>The mechanisms that produce metacycles are clearly complex and it is not as simple as to say that they are the plain aggregate of single issue cycles. Most importantly, the interactions among issues appear to create various synergic effects in the patterns of attention. Firstly, when a single issue cycle is triggered by a key event it establishes a “news theme” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662511426819">Vasterman, 2005</xref>) that lowers news thresholds to similar and related topics, creating a self-reinforcing spiral of attention. Such “news spirals” or “news waves” are surges of attention brought about by chain reactions among the news media and environmental claims-makers. Secondly, when the spiral of attention to one issue accelerates it sensitizes the newsroom to other environmental issues as well. The level of issue-interaction among the different sub-domains of environmental issues is explored in greater detail in another paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662511426819">Djerf-Pierre, 2011b</xref>), but a general observation is that in many cases news attention to one issue area also seems to spread to other areas. To be sure, attention clearly drives attention. This process continues until issue fatigue (among journalists and the public), the exhaustion of news sources and other issues competing for attention reverse the process and the spiral turns downward.</p>

<title>6. Conclusion: Green metacycles of attention</title>
<p>This article advances the concept of metacycles when analyzing the trajectory of environmental news reporting in Swedish television over an extended period of time, 1961–2010. Metacycles refers to the major fluctuations in attention to the entire domain of environmental issues, while issue cycles refer to the single news waves pertaining to single issues.</p>
<p>The main conclusion of the analysis is that recurring metacycles have been a key feature of environmental news reporting over the last five decades. Four different categories of issues—the environmental catastrophe, the environmental alarm, the environmental scandal and the environmental controversy—are identified as main contributors to the metacycles. However, contributions from individual issues vary and a metacycle is never a plain aggregate of single issue cycles, not least due to interactions among issues that create various synergic effects in the patterns of attention.</p>
<p>The extent to which reporting occurs in cycles and the degree of volatility in news attention can, hypothetically, be seen as indicators of the level of institutionalization of environmental concern in the public sphere. The study shows that environmental reporting has become somewhat less prone to cyclical patterns over time and in this respect the present study substantiates an ongoing, long-term institutionalization of the environmental domain in television news journalism. However, this pattern is mainly produced by smaller drops in attention when the metacycle is descending; there is no evidence of higher peaks in attention over time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the metacycles of environmental attention have proven to be inversely related to the economic metacycles of growth and to the level of international conflict so that environmental coverage decreases in periods of economic recession and in situations of serious international conflicts and war.</p>
<p>The analysis substantiates the presence of metacycles of environmental attention in a democratic corporatist media system such as that in Sweden where journalism is neither that of opinion (Southern Europe) nor that of market liberal objectivism (the US). Previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662511426819">Brossard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511426819">Boykoff and Boykoff, 2007</xref>) has indicated that the emphasis on “attraction” values— personalization, polarization, dramatization and novelty—in US journalism seems to be a key driving force behind the significant cyclical patterns in reporting. The commercial pressure on Swedish public service broadcasting is, to say the least, less critical and reporters do not suffer from the cogent need to deliver an audience to advertisers. The journalistic style is rather that of “interpretation,” combining a high degree of professional independence with a critical stance towards power-holders, and assuming the role of ombudsmen of the public in explaining the issues of the day.</p>
<p>Consequently, the present study provides evidence for the claim that metacycles of attention are not just US or British phenomena but rather key features of the news in all mediatized societies. The argument can, however, also be extended to include the individual issue cycles and the four issue categories identified in the study. Catastrophes, scandals, alarms and controversies are hardly unique to the Swedish news media, albeit that the specific environmental cases reported obviously vary in different national contexts. Still, this does not necessarily preclude cultural variations in the patterns of attention. The metacycles may play out differently in other countries and the actual trajectories of the four issue categories in the news may vary as well.</p>
