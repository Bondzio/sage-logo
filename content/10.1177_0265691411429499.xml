<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>It is with great pleasure that we write to introduce ourselves as the new editorial team at the EHQ as we will be taking over from Lucy Riall and Laurence Cole for the first issue of 2012.</p>
<p>As I am sure you will agree, Lucy and Laurence, together with Managing Editor Francis King, have done a tremendous job, and the Journal is currently attracting increasingly large numbers of high quality articles and carries an extremely impressive and extensive range of reviews. Lucy and Laurence have both agreed to serve on the Editorial Panel and we are also delighted that Francis is to continue in his role as Managing Editor.</p>
<p>Over the last seven years, the outgoing editorial team has built substantially on the traditions of the EHQ as a forum for debate on the history of Europe from the fifteenth to the twenty-first centuries, and they have done so with a clear determination to promote comparative and interdisciplinary study. We hope to continue that tradition and also to emphasize our commitment to early modern as well as modern history. We should also like to add that the Journal has a very broad definition of ‘European’ history, and articles addressing the complex relationship between Britain and the Continent of Europe on the one hand and World history on the other are welcome.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions for new initiatives do not hesitate to get in touch.</p>
<p>We shall look forward to working with you.</p>
<p>Julian Swann (Editor)</p>
<p>Jan Rüger (Co-Editor, Reviews Editor)</p>
<p>Evangelisti Silvia (Reviews Editor)</p>
