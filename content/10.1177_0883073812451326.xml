<abstract>
<p>Sturge-Weber syndrome is a heterogeneous neurocutaneous syndrome with facial and leptomeningeal angiomas, glaucoma, seizures, stroke-like episodes, and mental retardation. The authors critically evaluated the clinical manifestations, outcome, and natural history in 30 patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome followed up from January 1985 to May 2010. Of the patients, 15 were males, age at diagnosis ranged from 1 month to 43 years. Typical port-wine stain nevus occurred in 26 (86%), it was bilateral in 2 (8%), and it was absent in 4 (4%). Nine patients had glaucoma (30%), 3 required surgery. Four had transient hemiparesis. All patients had seizures; they were well controlled in 22 (73.3%); in 8 they remained drug resistant. Three patients underwent surgery and became seizure-free. Of the 17 who had mental subnormality, 14 (82.4%) had seizure onset before 2 years. An early age at seizure onset and those with drug-resistant seizures had more severe degree of mental subnormality. Uncontrolled seizures, mental subnormality, visual handicap, and cosmetic disfiguration were the major impediments in life.</p>

<body>
<p>Sturge-Weber syndrome is a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by cutaneous facial angioma with angiomas involving the leptomeninges (leptomeningeal angiomas), glaucoma, seizures, stroke-like episodes, hemiparesis, and mental retardation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812451326">1</xref></sup> It is quite heterogeneous in its manifestations with wide variability in the age of onset of symptoms and natural history. Depending on the location of the leptomeningeal angiomas, and the secondary effects of the angioma, the neurologic manifestations vary. Sturge-Weber syndrome is classified into type I (facial and leptomeningeal angioma with possible glaucoma), type II (facial angioma without evident endocranial involvement), and type III (exclusive leptomeningeal angioma). Sturge-Weber syndrome can present without facial nevus also. Gyriform pattern of calcification involving mostly the occipital and parietal area and enlargement of choroid plexus on the side of pial angioma are the characteristic radiological features. Seizures are the most common neurological manifestation of Sturge-Weber syndrome, with nearly 75% of patients presenting in the first year of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812451326">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812451326">3</xref></sup> Seizures in Sturge-Weber syndrome are thought to be drug resistant especially if they occur during the first year of life with emphasis on early surgery for better outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812451326">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812451326">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>We critically evaluated the clinical manifestations with special emphasis on their seizures, their refractoriness to various drugs, clinical features if any which predicted outcome, and the natural history of a sizeable cohort of patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome who had a long follow-up in our center.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073812451326" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Thirty patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome who were longitudinally followed from January 1985 to May 2010 formed the study cohort. Inclusion criteria were (1) presence of facial nevus and (2) calcification typical of Sturge-Weber syndrome on computed tomography scan (CT scan) or leptomeningeal angiomas on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We analyzed in detail the clinical, ophthalmological, electroencephalographical (EEG) and neuroimaging studies of these patients. Seizures were classified based on the semiology into simple partial (focal motor or sensory seizures without loss of awareness), complex partial (with loss of awareness), and secondary generalized seizures. Complex partial seizures were divided into temporal or extratemporal. Presence of one or more seizures in a month despite adequate trial of antiepileptic drugs as serial mono or duo therapy for at least 2 years were considered as drug-resistant epilepsy. Status epilepticus was defined as one continuous unremitting seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes, or recurrent seizures without regaining consciousness between seizures for greater than 5 minutes. Presence of status epilepticus, stroke-like episodes, and hemiparesis during the course of illness were noted. Visual acuity, visual fields, presence of glaucoma, need for medical or surgical management of glaucoma, and progression of visual loss were also studied. Intelligence quotient was measured using Wechsler’s Intelligence Scale for children and adults. Any other behavioral or psychiatric abnormalities were also noted. We also assessed the quality of life of both children and adults using a structured questionnaire comprising questions pertaining to schooling, education, social isolation, anxiety, depression, social interaction and adjustment skills, marital status, and employment.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 30 patients, 15 were males, age at diagnosis ranged from 1 month to 43 years (mean, 11 years; standard deviation, 10.43). Typical port wine stain nevus was seen in 26 (86%); it was bilateral in 2 (8%). Eight had port wine stain in V1 (first division of trigeminal) distribution alone; 14 in V1 and V2 (first and second division of trigeminal) distribution; one in V2 and V3 (second and third division of trigeminal), and only one patient had it in all the 3 divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812451326">Figure 1</xref>). Glaucoma was present in 9 patients (30%), of which 3 required surgery and 6 were managed medically. Five patients had impaired vision with constricted visual fields. Four patients had transient hemiparesis during the course of illness. Out of 30, 13 patients had normal intelligence quotient (&gt; 70), 11 had borderline intelligence quotient (60-70), and 6 had moderate to severely low intelligence quotient (&lt; 60). Three patients had attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.</p>

<title>Seizure Characteristics</title>
<p>All patients had seizures; 9 (30%) had simple partial and 21 (70%) had complex partial seizures. Age of onset of seizures ranged from 1 month to 21 years (mean, 3 years 2 months; standard deviation, 60.80). Out of 21 patients, 19 (90.4%) had extratemporal and 2 had both temporal and extratemporal seizures. Twelve (42.9%) had secondary generalized seizures. Six (20%) patients had 1 seizure in 6 months, 3 (10%) had 1 in a year, 6 (20%) were seizure-free for 2 or more years, 9 (30%) had more than 1 seizure but fewer than 3 in 6 months, 1 patient had seizures daily, 2 had seizures weekly, and 5 had monthly seizures. Three patients presented as status epilepticus, while 2 patients developed status epilepticus during the time course of the disease. The follow-up ranged from 2 to 20 years (mean, 3.8 years; standard deviation, 4.82). All underwent EEG.Spike, spike and waves or sharp waves were called interictal abnormalities. Interictal abnormalities were described as frontal when they were present over Fp1,Fp2 or F3,F4 electrodes; occipital when over O1,O2 electrodes; parietal if P3,P4 electrodes showed them; T5,T6 when it is over posterior temporal and posterior head region if P3,P4,T5,T6,O1,O2 electrodes were affected. Interictal abnormalities were described as multifocal when both hemispheres were affected with involvement of &gt;3 areas. Asymmetry and/or slowing of background of affected hemisphere was observed in 19 (63.3%), interictal epileptiform discharges were seen in 16 patients (8 posterior head region, 3 occipital, 3 frontal, 2 multifocal). Seizures were well controlled in 22 patients (73.3%), and in 8 they remained drug resistant. Patients were treated with anticonvulsant drugs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbitone, valproate, clobazam, topiramate, and levetiracetam. The most commonly used anticonvulsant was carbamazepine, followed by clobazam. Fifteen patients (53.6%) received monotherapy, 7 (25%) received 2 drugs, and 5 patients received 3 drugs. Three (10%) patients were not on anticonvulsants. Lorazepam and/or phenytoin were used as emergency drugs in patients who presented with status epilepticus. The patients received anticonvulsant after the first seizure. Male sex was associated with uncontrolled seizures (<italic>P</italic> = .035, Fisher’s exact test). Four children out of 17 younger than 2 years and 4 children out of 13 with age of onset more than 2 years had uncontrolled seizures (<italic>P</italic> = .697, Fisher’s exact test). Three patients underwent surgery at 6.6,14 and 32 years of age respectively. Two patients had preoperative field cuts, while one patient was not cooperative for examination. One patient had preoperative hemiparesis, which did not increase postoperatively. Two had moderate mental retardation, while one had normal intelligence and was a final-year graduate. None of the patients required a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. One of them was off anticonvulsants, and the other 2 were on a single drug each after surgery (they were on dual duotherapy before surgery) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073812451326">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-0883073812451326">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Sturge-Weber syndrome manifests commonly with a unilateral nevus flammeus, although its presence is not always required for diagnosis. Peterman et al reported 5 patients without facial nevus out of 35 patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome, while we had 4 out of 30 patients without facial nevus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812451326">6</xref></sup> Therefore around 6% to 7% of patients may present without the classical cutaneous manifestation characteristic of this neurocutaneous syndrome. Also, the gyriform calcification, which was classically reported earlier in occipital region on the same side as the nevus, is now known to occur in other locations as well in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome with and without facial nevus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812451326">6</xref></sup> All this makes the clinical diagnosis at times difficult unless a high index of suspicion is present. Hence, it would be worthwhile to undertake descriptive studies from different parts of the globe.</p>
<sec id="section6-0883073812451326">
<title>Electrophysiological Characteristics</title>
<p>Seizures have been reported in 60% to 90% of patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome with variable age of onset, early infancy being the most common age manifesting seizures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812451326">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812451326"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812451326"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812451326"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812451326">10</xref></sup> Seizures have been reported before the age of 1 year in 75% of patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812451326">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812451326">3</xref></sup> In our study, 50% of patients had seizure onset before 1 year, but it occurred as late as 21 years of age, thus pointing towards the heterogeneity of the syndrome. All patients in our study had seizures, most commonly complex partial seizures (66.6%) of occipital semiology, as expected. EEG showed spindle asymmetry, hemispheric asymmetry, and/or slowing in the affected hemisphere in 19 patients. Interictal epileptiform abnormalities were seen in 16 (53.3%) patients, with posterior head region (occipital, parietal, and/or temporal; 50%) being the most common, followed by occipital interictal epileptiform abnormalities; sometimes interictal epileptiform abnormalities can be falsely expressed over the contralateral hemisphere, as in 5 of our patients (31.2%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073812451326">Figure 2d</xref>, e). A better frontal expression of interictal epileptiform abnormalities (with maximum amplitude over the frontal regions) was seen with suppression of the background activity in the posterior head region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812451326">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812451326">12</xref></sup> Seizures were well controlled in 22 patients (73.3%) with antiepileptic drugs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073812451326">Table 2</xref>). Seizure control was variable with some patients having refractory epilepsy requiring surgical treatment. In our cohort, 3 patients underwent surgery. Various types of surgeries have been tried, including hemisperotomy, hemispherectomy, lesionectomy, and lobectomy with good seizure control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812451326">5</xref></sup> The worst seizure outcome was observed in patients with bilateral cerebral lesions and early onset of seizures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812451326">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812451326">13</xref></sup> On the contrary, no relation exists between distribution of nevus and severity of seizures or brain abnormality. Of the 8 patients in our series with uncontrolled epilepsy, 1 had bilateral facial nevus with diffuse cerebral atrophy, 2 patients had multifocal interictal epileptiform discharges, and 1 patient did not have facial nevus. As per new International League Against Epilepsy definition, <italic>medically controlled seizures</italic> means no seizures for a year, which was seen in 9 (30%) patients. So epilepsy is refractory in around 70% of patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome, demonstrating the need for further improvements in therapy for these patients. Male sex was associated with uncontrolled seizures (<italic>P</italic> = .035, Fisher’s exact test). However, this needs to be substantiated in a larger group of patients. Besides male sex, we could not identify any factor including presence of bilateral nevus as well as age of onset before 2 years of age predicting refractoriness of seizures. However, in any patient with seizure semiology of posterior head region origin, even in the absence of facial nevus, a possibility of Sturge-Weber syndrome needs to be considered and carefully looked for.</p>

<title>Mental retardation</title>
<p>Mental retardation was reported in approximately 60% of children in one large series of 40 patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812451326">9</xref></sup> In our series of 30, 13 (43.3%) patients had normal intelligence, 11 (36.6%) had borderline mental retardation, and 6 (20.0%) had moderate to severe mental retardation. Out of the 17 who had subnormal intelligence quotient in our series, 14 (82.4%) had age of onset of seizure before 2 years of age. Of them, 5 (29.4%) who had severe mental retardation had uncontrolled seizures. An early age of onset of seizures and those with drug-resistant seizures had a more severe degree of mental subnormality, as was also noted in another series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812451326">15</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section8-0883073812451326">
<title>Glaucoma</title>
<p>Glaucoma has been reported in 30% to 70% of patients with a bimodal age onset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812451326">8</xref></sup> Anterior chamber angle abnormalities in infantile glaucoma and raised episceral pressure caused by arteriovenous shunts are the proposed mechanisms for development of glaucoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073812451326">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073812451326">17</xref></sup> In our cohort, 9 (30%) had glaucoma. Glaucoma characteristically does not occur in the absence of a nevus in the V1 distribution. In our study, out of 9 patients with glaucoma, 6 had isolated V1 and 3 had V1, V2 distribution of facial nevus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073812451326">18</xref></sup> Glaucoma resulted in visual loss impairing activities of daily living in 5 patients over a period of 2 to 6 years. Visual field charting could be done in 10 patients, and field defects favoring glaucoma were noted in 3 (33.3%) patients.</p>

<title>Neuroimaging features</title>
<p>CT head is usually the modality of choice in view of better delineation of calcification; however, calcification may be absent in the early stages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073812451326">19</xref></sup> MRI helps in assessing the location and extent of leptomeningeal angioma, underlying parenchymal abnormalities seen as hyperintensities (due to underlying gliosis), and hypointensity due to excessive myelination. A susceptibility-weighted imaging sequence can be useful in delineation of the mineral deposition and associated abnormal choroid plexus and venous drainage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883073812451326">Figure 3a</xref>, b, c), which may be the only neuroimaging abnormality as in 3 of our patients. The presence of these transmedullary collaterals in Sturge-Weber syndrome that develop secondary to insufficient superficial drainage has been demonstrated in various studies in the past.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073812451326">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073812451326"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073812451326">22</xref></sup></p>

<p>Unlike other congenital and developmental vascular malformations of brain, the underlying process is progressive in Sturge-Weber syndrome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883073812451326">Figure 3d</xref>, e). It is thought to be due to venous stasis and repeated thrombosis, resulting in progressive recurrent infarction, resulting in underlying neurological dysfunction contributing to hemiparesis and transient ischemic attacks. We had 4 patients with hemiparesis; one patient developed transient hemiparesis and improved subsequently. Aspirin has been reported to be useful in prevention of transient hemiparesis and improved seizure control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812451326">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812451326">15</xref></sup> One of our patients is presently on aspirin following transient hemiparesis and did not have recurrence of hemiparesis after 2 years of follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073812451326">23</xref></sup></p>

<title>Social aspects</title>
<p>Social handicaps include limited intelligence and social skills, poor aesthetic appearance, and seizures, which are known to hamper social interaction and employment prospectives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812451326">14</xref></sup> Large nevus or bilateral nevus causing disfigurement of the face causes significant social disability, as in one of our patients who locks himself in his room during the daytime. In our series, the majority of children (64%) were disabled due to facial disfigurement and experienced social isolation in school. School performance was also affected due to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in 12%, recurrent seizure (8%), and associated cognitive disturbances (7%). Adults reported a significant negative impact in their life due to seizures (64%) and unemployment (42%).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Sturge-Weber syndrome is a neurocutaneous syndrome that has a very heterogeneous spectrum of manifestations. Uncontrolled seizures, mental subnormality, glaucoma with visual handicap, and above all cosmetic disfiguration imparted by the cutaneous nevi are the major impediments caused by this syndrome complex. One has to be very vigilant of the various types of presentations of Sturge-Weber syndrome, especially when the cutaneous manifestations are characteristically lacking in a minority of patients. There are no ways of predicting the outcome of seizures; each patient behaves in a different way. Nevertheless, one has to have a very high index of suspicion whenever confronted with a patient with seizures of posterior head region semiology. Defining more and more cases from different parts of the globe would help in elucidating this syndrome better.</p>
