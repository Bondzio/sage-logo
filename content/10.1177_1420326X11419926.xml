<abstract>
<p>This study was conducted to propose a method of identifying glare sources from windows. Discomfort glare from windows of a classroom was evaluated in the experiments involving subjects, and the features that made the subjects recognize the glare sources in the windows were explored. The results of the evaluation led to the realization that the subjects regarded the patches that were causing discomfort glare as the glare sources on windows. It means that the patches having low luminance were not the causes of discomfort glare and were excluded from glare sources for the discomfort glare evaluation. There was a linear relationship between the average luminance of the visual field and the average luminance of the glare patches. The linear relationship has been expressed by a formula. The proposed formula has made it easier to identify the glare patches from windows. The approach as suggested in this study is distinctive to the others by the fact that the glare source was determined based on the average luminance of the visual field.</p></abstract>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11419926" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Windows of buildings can be a channel through which daylight comes in but at the same time they are the source of the glare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11419926">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11419926">6</xref>]. Too much daylight coming through the windows can increase the heating load for indoor cooling and cause glare, so it is necessary to control it to a proper level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11419926">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11419926">15</xref>]. In order to control discomfort glare of windows, however, it is essential to have a reliable method to evaluate discomfort glare first [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11419926">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1420326X11419926">18</xref>].</p>
<p>One of the most representative approaches proposed to evaluate discomfort glare from windows is the Daylight Glare Index method (DGI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11419926">1</xref>] developed by Hopkins. This approach, however, is not in its completion phase yet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X11419926">19</xref>].</p>
<p>In 1972, Hopkinson conducted an experiment in order to verity his DGI method. He measured discomfort glare coming from the windows of classrooms and hospital wards. The discomfort glare value actually measured were lower than what was estimated using the DGI formula. He failed to identify the reason for the gap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X11419926">20</xref>]. So it came to a conclusion that the actual discomfort glare of windows could not be accurately measured using the DGI method. It meant more research was required in order to find the right approach that could accurately measure discomfort glare coming through windows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1420326X11419926">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X11419926">23</xref>].</p>
<p>This study focused on developing a method of identifying the glare sources from windows, which was a fundamental basis on which the discomfort glare could be accurately evaluated. Experiments were conducted in which observers evaluated discomfort glare coming from classroom windows, and the features that led them to identify glare source were identified.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X11419926"><title>Luminance of the Glare Source from Windows</title>
<p>Luminance of the glare source can be calculated using the luminous intensity measured at the point where the observer would make observation and the size of the area projected.
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1420326X11419926"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11419926-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>

<list-item><p><italic>A<sub>p</sub></italic>: Size of the area to which the glare source is projected (m<sup>2</sup>).</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>The light source of the discomfort glare of windows was daylight. Windows become a source of discomfort glare when daylight comes through it, which turns a window into a big source of the lights with irregular luminance distributions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X11419926">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Unlike artificial lighting, the skylights have a very wide range of different luminance depending on the time of the day. The causes of the discomfort glare from the skylight include the contrast in the luminance levels between the window surface and the surface of the interior, inadequate distribution of luminance in terms of the space and time and excessive luminance on the surface of the window.</p>
<p>In most cases, discomfort glare from the window comes from part of the window not the entire area of it. When the luminance distribution of the window surface is extremely uneven, it would be improper to use the average luminance of the entire surface of the window as a parameter of discomfort glare.</p>
<p>When it comes to the evaluation of discomfort glare, defining the luminance and size of the area where glare source is generated is of great importance. Therefore, it is necessary first and foremost to identify the features that make the observer recognize the glare source coming from the window.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1420326X11419926"><title>Research Approach</title>
<sec id="sec4-1420326X11419926"><title>Windows for Evaluation</title>
<p>Windows of classrooms were evaluated for discomfort glare. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11419926">Figure 1</xref> shows the scene where the experiment was conducted. The experiment was done with the window sized 2.98 m × 1.85 m in a rectangular shape located at a classroom on the third floor of the Engineering College Building, Kyung Hee University.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11419926">Figure 2</xref> shows the window divided into small zones, the place where the subject sat for evaluation. The wall of the classroom where the experiment was conducted was painted white while the window frames were painted deep blue. The observer was placed 3 m horizontally away from the centre of the window. The size of the solid angle of the window was 0.6 sr.

<sec id="sec5-1420326X11419926"><title>Criteria of Evaluation</title>
<p>Four-step measures were used in order to evaluate discomfort glare. The subjective feelings that the observer had were classified into detailed categories in an attempt to reduce the margin of error. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11419926">Table 1</xref> shows the criteria used for evaluation.

<sec id="sec6-1420326X11419926"><title>Features of Subjects</title>
<p>The total number of subjects who participated in the experiment was 44, of which 20 were males and 24 were females. They were aged from 20 to 31, and the average age was 24. During the experiment, those who wore glasses were asked to take them off while making evaluation, whereas those who wore contact lens were evaluated with the lens on. The data were evaluated without taking such factor of wearing glasses or lens into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X11419926">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1420326X11419926">26</xref>].</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1420326X11419926"><title>Procedures of the Evaluation</title>
<p>A total of 11 rounds of experiment were conducted during the period from July 8, 2010, to September 5, 2010: four times in clear sky, three times intermediate sky and 4 times overcast sky.</p>
<p>Three aspects were evaluated at a high level. First was the level of discomfort glare of the entire glass. Second was the exact zone of the window which was recognized as the glare source. Third was the level of discomfort glare of each divided zone of the window.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11419926">Figure 3</xref> shows the sequence of evaluation that each subject went through. Four observers were teamed up into one group. First of all, the observer sat on a chair located 3 m away from the window. They were requested to evaluate the discomfort glare of the entire window and then indicate the area where they believe the glare came through. Following this, they evaluated the level of discomfort glare starting from zone 1 down to zone 40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11419926">Figure 2</xref>).

<p>Prior to evaluation, the experimenter measured the luminance of the window along with the illuminance of the perpendicular plane from the place of the observer’s eye. The luminance meter used for the measurement was Minolta CS-100 and illuminance meter was Topcon IM-5. It took about 15 min for a team to complete the experimental process.</p></sec></sec>

<sec id="sec9-1420326X11419926"><title>Relations between the Average Luminance of the Entire Window and the Evaluated Values</title>
<p>The results of evaluation of discomfort glare of the entire window are summarized as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11419926">Table 2</xref>. While the average luminance of the window changed from 611 to 7,286, the average evaluation values ranged from 1.33 to 2.75. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11419926">Figure 4</xref> shows the change in the evaluation depending on the change in the average luminance. The solid line in the Figure represents the regression line of the evaluation, which indicates that the average luminance of the window surface was proportional to the evaluation values.

<p>In a nutshell, this means that the level of discomfort glare generated from windows can be predicted using the average luminance of the window surface as a parameter. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11419926">Figure 4</xref>, the regression formula is the degree of discomfort glare (DDG) = 1.05 logLw – 1.73. Using the formula, the average luminance of the window surface which corresponds to DDG Values of 1, 2, 3 and 4 can be computed, which are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1420326X11419926">Table 3</xref>.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1420326X11419926">Table 4</xref> shows the discomfort glare values measured in dots for each zone. In the figure, DDGp dots represent the values evaluated for 40 zones while DDGall refers to the value of the discomfort glare evaluated for the entire window. The DDGp dots and DDGall dots are recorded together in order to find the co-relation between the values against the entire window and the counterparts for each zone.

<p>The results of the 11 rounds of experiments are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1420326X11419926">Table 4</xref>, which have demonstrated that the slope of the regression line can differ greatly from the minimum of -–0.49 to the maximum of 2.1. The value of <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> is also very small. This has led to a conclusion that the luminance of each zone and discomfort glare of corresponding zone is not proportional to each other.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1420326X11419926">Table 4</xref> shows that the average value against the entire window (DDGall) was in most cases smaller than the maximum of the values for each divided zone (DDGp). In addition, as shown in the result of the experiment round number 7, the value of overall evaluation was above 1 when there was at least one zone where the value of evaluation was above 1. In other words, the observer excluded those zones where no glare was generated from the evaluation itself.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the evaluations done for the entire window are the ones done for the areas that generate luminance level at which people start to recognize the glare (step 1 in the evaluation criteria).</p></sec>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11419926">Figure 5</xref> shows the luminance of the zones that the observers picked as the glare source and the discomfort glare values that they gave. As shown in the Figure, the points representing the values have no direct relationship with the luminance of each zone (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.06). This was because the values that observers gave for the zone with the same luminance were different due to their eyes being exposed to different conditions of compliance with luminance when they evaluated the discomfort glare from the light source on the window.

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11419926">Figure 6</xref>, average luminance of the zones recognized as glare source (Ls) and average luminance of the visual field (Lb) has the following functional relationship.
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-1420326X11419926"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11419926-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Using the formula (2), in other words, using the average luminance of visual field, the luminance of the zone which is a candidate of glare source can be projected.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1420326X11419926">Figure 7</xref> indicates that the discomfort glare values (DDGall) of the entire window was in proportion to the log value of the average luminance of visual field (Lb). Such relation can be expressed as follows in formula (3).</p>
<p>
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-1420326X11419926"><label>(3)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11419926-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1420326X11419926">Figure 8</xref> tells that the discomfort glare values (DDGall) of the entire window was in proportion to the log value of the average luminance of glare source (Ls). Such relations can be expressed as follows in formula (4).
<disp-formula id="disp-formula4-1420326X11419926"><label>(4)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11419926-eq4.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Combination of formula (2), (3) and (4) would lead to the conclusion that the luminance of the possible glare source and the discomfort glare of the entire window can be projected as long as the average luminance of visual field is identified. In addition, using the luminance of glare source, the discomfort glare value of the entire window can be projected.</p>
<p>In general, the most effective approach to control the discomfort glare from windows would be by direct measures taken to control glare source. This would necessitate an approach that can identify glare source out of the window with an uneven luminance distribution.</p>
<p>For the sake of convenience, 1.01 which is the index of average luminance of visual field (Lb) in formula (2) is rounded off into 1.0 and 8.74 into 8.7 to create the following formula.
<disp-formula id="disp-formula5-1420326X11419926"><label>(5)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11419926-eq5.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Any part of the window that has 8.7 times more luminance than average luminance of visual field (Lb) would be recognized as a glare source. This study suggests formula (5) as a simple approach to identify the glare source of a window.</p></sec>

<p>In order to verify the formula (5), the zones generating glare were projected using formula (5) and then these were compared with zones that the observers picked as the glare source. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1420326X11419926">Table 6</xref> shows the expected luminance of the glare source calculated by using formula (5).

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1420326X11419926">Table 7</xref> compares the zones that the observers picked as the glare source and the zones forecasted as the glare source using the formula (5). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1420326X11419926">Table 7</xref> has two columns: response and projection of glare source zones. Since the window has 40 small zones, having one zone matched each other would represent 2.5% rate of match. The rate of match in 11 experiment rounds was 63% on the average. Therefore, the formula (4) could be said to have an accuracy rate of 63%. Taking into account the fact that there was a great variation in discomfort glare values evaluated by observers in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1420326X11419926">27</xref>], this level of accuracy was relatively high.

<p>Defining the luminance level and scale of the zones where glares are generated is of great importance when it comes to the evaluation of discomfort glare. An approach to evaluate discomfort glare from a large window with an uneven luminance distribution was reviewed in this study. Among others, a method to predict glare source has been fully studied through experiments.</p>
<p>Subjects were requested to evaluate discomfort glare from classroom windows and features that led them to recognize glare sources were identified. The results of the experiments led to the conclusion that the physical conditions of the light environment and values of evaluation of discomfort glare have the following features.
<list id="list1-1420326X11419926" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The average luminance of the window and evaluation results were in proportion to each other.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The luminance of the small zones of a window and the discomfort glare values of such zones are not proportional to each other. And the observers excluded those zones where no glare was generated from the evaluation itself when they evaluate the entire window.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There was no direct relationship between the luminance of the zones picked as the glare source and evaluation values of discomfort glare of such zones. This was because even those zones with the same luminance could have different values when their adaptation luminance was different.</p></list-item></list></p>
<p>In general, discomfort glare was generated from parts of the window, not from its entire surface. Methods to identify the glare source were studied in this research. There was direct proportional relationship between the luminance of glare source and average luminance of visual field. Any part of the window that has 8.7 times more luminance than average luminance of visual field (Lb) would be recognized as glare source.</p>
<p>The experiments identified the zones of the window with the luminance of 8.7 times average luminance of visual field, which were compared with the zones that the observers picked as the glare source. The results of the comparison showed that there was relatively high level of match between the projected glare source and the glare source that the observers picked as glare source. So it is concluded that the window zones of glare source are the areas where the luminance was more than 8.7 times the average luminance of visual field. The approach as suggested in this study is in distinction to the others by the fact that the glare source was determined based on the average luminance of the visual field.</p></sec></body>
