<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although it seems likely that some notion of individual responsibility is an essential feature in rationing decisions, this is rarely articulated or evaluated in the context of health policy. The main objective of this paper is to operationalise a conceptual framework for exploring when health services contain characteristics that facilitate individuals’ ability to take responsibility for their own health care through private financing.</p>
<p>As in most countries, the Swedish healthcare system faces an increasing gap between demand and available resources. This financial shortage is most often ascribed to: (i) rapid advancement of health technology, which on the positive side creates opportunities to improve quality of care and treat “new” patient groups; (ii) demographic changes where a declining proportion of working-age population contribute financially to the tax-funded healthcare system; (iii) increased incidence of chronic disease related to lifestyle, and (iv) the general development of health inequality. In addition, the system is continuously facing higher public expectations as people become more accustomed to the wide range of options in the healthcare system. It is against this background of a declining tax base and increased public demand that policy makers need to consider how to finance health services in the future and how to create a fair and sustainable framework for dealing with the delicate issue of limiting the scope of the publicly funded system, i.e. healthcare rationing.</p>
<p>Healthcare rationing is a concept that is used and defined in many different and ambiguous ways. When allocating resources in public health care, rationing in its widest sense simply implies limiting the possibility to optimally satisfy the need for health services to bridge the gap between needs and available collective resources. However, an in-depth discussion of rationing requires distinguishing between different types of healthcare rationing. Traditionally, three subcategories of rationing have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812462459">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812462459">2</xref>]. These are: (i) rationing by denial, which implies the general exclusion of particular health services; (ii) rationing by dilution, which means that a particular healthcare need is only partly met; and (iii) rationing by delay, which implies that patients must wait longer than necessary before receiving adequate treatment. Moreover, as rationing takes place throughout the entire healthcare system it is also important to recognise the structural difference between bedside rationing and administrative rationing. Bedside rationing occurs at the patient level when medical professionals withhold services that could potentially benefit the patient. Administrative rationing is a more abstract type of rationing that occurs outside of individual physician-patient encounters, where decision makers use general policies to withhold services that could potentially benefit groups of patients. This article focuses primarily on administrative rationing by denial through private funding.</p>
<p>Despite a consensus among most experts that some form of administrative rationing of health care is necessary to uphold a functioning healthcare system, it has been difficult for decision makers to explicitly acknowledge the inevitable need to ration health care at the administrative level. In the USA, attempts to discuss rationing at the administrative level have been met by forceful resistance. The creation of infamous concepts like “death panels” has made rationing a topic that cannot be discussed openly – arguably contributing to the most inefficient and unequal healthcare system in the developed world. In other parts of the developed world, the idea of explicit rationing has also met resistance. In Sweden, an explicit “not-to-do list” that was introduced in 2003 was promptly labeled the “blacklist” and invoked a public outcry, forcing politicians to retreat and once again rely on implicit rationing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812462459">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812462459">4</xref>]. During the past few years, however, a new wave of initiatives has arisen in Sweden to engage in explicit rationing at the regional level. A handful of county councils have created lists including hundreds of services and have decided to exclude some of the services with the lowest ranking to create funding space for more important services. These more recent initiatives have met surprisingly little objection and appear to have gained public support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812462459">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812462459">6</xref>]. Although these recent experiences give hope for a more structured and explicit approach towards rationing in the future, we cannot deny that explicit administrative rationing of health services is associated with a political “cost” since it could negatively affect the re-election possibilities of political officials. Consequently, services are still most often rationed implicitly at the bedside rather than explicitly at the administrative level, thereby clouding the rationale underlying such decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812462459">7</xref>]. The absence of transparency with respect to the value judgements that rationing inevitably involves could, in the long run, undermine legitimacy of the publicly funded healthcare system. Hence, it is essential that pubic healthcare systems construct applicable tools to facilitate structured debate on why specific services are more or less appropriate for private financing.</p>
<p>Sweden has defined and legislated priority-setting principles based on ethical core values intended to guide local and regional authorities when setting priorities in clinical practice. The idea was that openness and transparency would create legitimacy for such difficult decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812462459">8</xref>]. The principles are: (i) the principle of human dignity, i.e. everyone should have equal rights regardless of personal characteristics and position in society; (ii) the principle of need and solidarity, i.e. resources should be used in domains (or patients) where needs are considered to be greatest; and (iii) the principle of cost effectiveness, i.e. resources should be used in the most effective way without neglecting fundamental duties concerning improving health and quality of life. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812462459">9</xref>] Although these principles have been in force for almost two decades, Sweden still subjects a wide range of health services to administrative rationing through private funding, which cannot be fully explained by any of these principles. These services include, e.g. dental care for adults, eyeglasses, some vaccinations, over-the-counter drugs, and many assistive devices (ADs). Broad evidence indicates that access to many of these of preventive and therapeutic health services is associated with major gains in life expectancy and quality of life at what is usually considered a reasonable cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812462459">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812462459"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812462459">12</xref>]. ADs, in particular, illustrate a medical arena where private and public funding are frequently mixed. Many ADs are available to those with the financial ability to pay privately out-of-pocket, but many ADs are also commonly funded publicly. It has been suggested that the possibility of individual financial responsibility constitutes a significant, albeit implicit, aspect in rationing decisions in the Swedish healthcare setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812462459">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Tinghög, Carlsson, and Lyttkens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812462459">14</xref>] present a conceptual framework for exploring when health services contain characteristics that facilitate individual responsibility through private financing. The framework identifies six core concepts to explore the suitability of private financing for specific healthcare commodities (sufficient knowledge, individual autonomy, positive externalities, sufficient demand, affordability, and lifestyle enhancement). However, these concepts were not fully operationalised to differentiate the suitability of private financing for health services. Consequently, the main objective of this article is to further operationalise this conceptual framework into a measurement scale so the framework can be applied as a replicable rationing tool. Moreover, we aim to apply this framework in the context of ADs to investigate if the levels of out-of-pocket payment for ADs (ADs) in Sweden are in line with the proposed framework. We also discuss potential deviations.</p>
<p>In this paper, we first introduce the conceptual framework upon which this paper is based. We also present some initial remarks on the suitability for private financing of ADs in the light of the concepts. We then describe the methods used to operationalise and assess the conceptual framework. Next we present the operationalised conceptual framework and the results of the empirical survey designed to investigate if levels of out-of-pocket payment for ADs in Sweden are in line with the proposed framework. Finally, we discuss the potential use and limitation of the conceptual framework.</p>

<title>Conceptual framework to assess individual responsibility for healthcare financing</title>
<p>Tinghög, Carlsson, and Lyttkens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812462459">14</xref>] present a conceptual framework that identifies six core concepts/attributes, essential when considering the appropriateness of private financing for health services. A key aspect of the framework is that it enables assessment of health services as a heterogeneous group of goods and services instead of viewing health services as a homogenous group, as is generally the case with literature on healthcare financing. It is well established that health services in general share many attributes that make them less suitable for distribution through traditional markets compared to most other goods and services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812462459">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812462459"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812462459"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812462459"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812462459">19</xref>]. Such concerns about market failures are, however, not equally pressing for all health services. The same is true for concerns related to equity and equality of access.</p>
<p>The first concept of the framework is <italic>sufficient knowledge</italic>. This concept focuses on whether or not healthcare consumers are able to value benefits and burdens of the service both before and after its consumption. An important aspect for further operationalisation of this concept is the extent to which healthcare consumers are able to assess a given service or good and instantly access information about its quality and effect. Most ADs share this characteristic, whereas health services such as cancer chemotherapy might illustrate the opposite. Without medical expertise, individual patients generally have little possibility to independently assess chemotherapy and acquire adequate information about its quality and effects. Consequently, ADs would be more suitable for private financing since individuals can more readily value the need and quality both before and after utilisation.</p>
<p>The second concept, <italic>individual autonomy</italic>, does not focus on the specific service or good, but on the ability of a typical group of healthcare consumers to demand and assess the service. For instance, healthcare consumers with low levels of autonomy, who have deficient reflective capacity, may fail to demand treatment supplied on a free market. Individuals requiring emergency treatment are another group of “consumers” frequently not in a position to express well-reflected consumer preferences. Decisions to consume ADs typically involve a comparably low level of emergency, and patients in general are able to make autonomous choices. Hence, it could be argued that ADs (in general) are more suitable for private financing from the perspective of this attribute.</p>
<p>The third concept, <italic>positive externalities</italic>, focuses on the presence and level of external effects associated with the consumption of health services. Individuals, although behaving perfectly rational, might not consume sufficient health care in the opinion of other individuals in society since many of the positive effects fall on others. In the context of ADs, these effects may enable some individuals to keep a regular job, generating positive effects for society at large instead of merely the individual consuming the service. The case of vaccination for infectious diseases is another example where most of the positive effect falls on others. Following this logic, ADs associated with low levels of positive external effects should be more suitable for private financing.</p>
<p>The fourth concept, <italic>sufficient demand</italic>, focuses on market conditions. An important aspect when operationalising the concept is whether demand is predicable and large enough to establish any level of provision without public subsidies. If a certain service is to be financed privately, irregular and unpredictable demand could create problems to ensure sufficient capacity for those who do not currently require the service, but might require it at some later date. For example, it is difficult to ensure availability through private financing for treatments against rare conditions where there is no possibility to keep a specific good or service in stock. Many ADs could, however, be sold by local retailers if financed privately. Following this logic, ADs associated with sufficient demand to generate a reasonable private market are more suitable for private financing.</p>
<p>The fifth concept, <italic>affordability</italic>, addresses whether payments associated with a certain service are affordable for most individuals. But since wealth and income are distributed unequally in all societies it is difficult to define a boundary for what constitutes an affordable price. Nevertheless, if society wishes to limit the influence of uneven economic distribution on access to health care, then affordability is an essential aspect affecting the suitability of private financing. If a financing system lacks a functioning arrangement for exemptions and/or protection against high cost, many individuals will face unaffordable and catastrophic healthcare payments, and this is likely to violate the general public notion of fairness. Consequently, ADs associated with affordable costs are more suitable for private financing.</p>
<p>But, where do we draw the line for what constitutes an affordable cost? To the average person, an affordable price for a product usually refers to a price that is lower than most other market prices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812462459">20</xref>]. In conventional economics, however, an affordable price typically refers to cases where benefits exceed costs. Unfortunately, neither of these definitions seems very helpful when trying to operationalise affordability. Ultimately, defining affordability is as much a political and normative task as it is an economic one. Hence, in the absence of careful deliberation it would be difficult to directly operationalise affordability in the context of this framework without appearing to be arbitrary.</p>
<p>The sixth concept, <italic>lifestyle enhancement</italic>, differs to some degree from the other concepts in the framework since it focuses on what needs to be privately financed to avoid excessive consumption that could threaten the financial sustainability of public healthcare systems. For instance, health services that do not address a specific disease or injury, e.g. cosmetic treatments and medication against erectile dysfunction, are often excluded from public funding on the grounds that they constitute luxuries, or pleasure seeking, rather than necessities. Consequently, ADs associated with lifestyle enhancement rather than medical necessity are more suitable for private financing. Deciding what services should be considered lifestyle enhancement is, however, heavily influenced by social and cultural norms that could change over time. This makes it difficult to set a definite boundary regarding what constitutes luxury health care. ADs for leisure activities could be examples of devices used for pleasure rather than necessity. However, this boundary could differ between consumer groups. Older people, for example, probably have a lower reference point than do younger people as regards many health states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812462459">21</xref>]. A service that aims to increase mobility for a 20-year-old is unlikely to be considered pleasure seeking, while in many cases it might be considered pleasure seeking if an 80-year-old would demand the same service.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>To achieve our stated objective, we divided data collection into three separate parts. The first part of data collection aimed to operationalise the analytical framework into a replicable rationing tool by using focus groups. In the second part, we utilised this framework as a measurement scale to investigate variability in the suitability of private financing among 28 selected ADs. For the third part, we collected data on the actual level of private financing for these ADs to investigate whether this empirical result was in line with what the framework suggested. Procedures describing each of these data collection parts are presented in greater detail below.</p>
<sec id="section4-1403494812462459">
<title>Operationalising the analytical framework</title>
<p>Focus groups were used to operationalise the core concepts of <italic>sufficient knowledge, individual autonomy, positive externalities, sufficient demand, affordability</italic>, and <italic>lifestyle enhancement</italic> into a measurable and replicable rationing tool. More specifically, focus groups were asked to construct three levels (low, medium, and high) related to each concept that could be utilised as a measurement scale for the concept. A high level indicated high suitability for private financing regarding the specific concept under consideration. This aim was clearly stated at the beginning of the session. Two focus group sessions lasting approximately 2 hours were conducted. Participants in the first session (<italic>n</italic>=5) were individuals with professional experience in the provision of ADs. Participants in the second session (<italic>n</italic>=8) comprised a multidisciplinary group of scholars with experience in issues related to healthcare priority setting and health economics.</p>
<p>Each focus group session followed a three-part structure. First, prior to the group discussion, participants independently formulated their ideas on how to operationalise the framework into three levels. This was done to increase the number of suggestions generated by the group and to foster equal participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812462459">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494812462459">23</xref>]. Background material consisting of the general conceptual framework had been available beforehand. Second, the facilitator encouraged participants to share their ideas and discuss them while taking a back seat, allowing for a type of “structured eavesdropping”. In the third and final part, the facilitator presented a tentative proposal, drafted by the authors beforehand, on how the levels could be defined and urged the participants to identify inconsistencies or potential improvements. Before the session ended, the independently formulated ideas on how to operationalise the framework were collected. The independently formulated ideas and the input from the group discussion were then used to adjust and improve the operationalisation of the general framework.</p>

<title>Grading assistive devices according to the operationalised framework</title>
<p>To investigate the applicability of the operationalised framework, the measurement scale was used to grade 28 selected ADs according to their suitability for private financing. Although the authors of this paper did most of the grading, the initial grading was continually modified and validated through discussion with experts in the AD field. This validation followed a procedure similar to that used when operationalising the general framework. First, participants were asked to independently grade all ADs according to the framework, i.e. to score the suitability for private financing as high, medium, or low for each individual concept. Second, these grades were compared with the grades given by the authors of this paper, and discrepancies were discussed. If the participant could give what we perceived to be a convincing reason or rationale for why his or her grading aligned more closely with the proposed framework, the initial grading would be changed. This procedure was also applied when we performed our initial grading. Grading was done independently, and discrepancies were discussed until a consensus could be reached.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1403494812462459">
<title>Surveying out-of-pocket payments for assistive devices</title>
<p>To investigate if the levels of out-of-pocket payment for ADs in Sweden were in line with the grading of suitability for private financing, we constructed a questionnaire containing direct questions about the level of out-of-pocket payment for 28 selected ADs. Questionnaires were sent to managers (or equivalent staff members) of AD-related health services in all 21 county councils in Sweden. Since it was unlikely that any single person within a county council would have sufficient knowledge to answer questions about the full range of ADs, we divided the questionnaire into four separate parts. The different parts focused on ADs intended for individuals with visual impairments, hearing impairments, orthopaedic impairments, and ADs most often supplied by regional “AD Centres”. The respondents and the ADs under investigation were identified by collaborating with representatives from the Swedish Institute of Assistive Technology. In selecting ADs we aimed to include devices having slightly different characteristics as commodities. The first question posed in regard to every AD was if that “specific AD” was prescribed in the respondent’s county council. Respondents who answered “yes” were then asked if this AD required any out-of-pocket payment. If so, they were asked to specify the amount of out-of-pocket payment. Finally, the respondents were given the opportunity to clarify the arrangement of private payments for each AD and list any patient groups that were granted exemptions or reductions in the level of out-of-pocket payment. To increase the response rate, respondents were reminded both by e-mail and telephone to return the completed questionnaire.</p>
<p>Based on the answers to the questionnaire, each AD was categorised into three groups based on level of public funding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494812462459">Figure 1</xref>), taking into account both the share of county councils that subsidised the AD and the share of the price that was subsidised. Responses showed that the financing of ADs in Sweden varies widely across county councils as regards co-payment and discretionary payment for certain healthcare consumer groups. Consequently, it was not possible to create an exact algorithm that could be used to calculate the level of public funding for specific ADs. However, in some instances we used “rule of thumb” estimates. For example, if less than 25% of the county councils subsidised a specific AD, this was taken to indicate that the AD was commonly being funded privately. If more than 75% of the county councils subsidised a specific AD this was taken to indicate that the AD was commonly being funded publicly. If county councils commonly subsidised an AD, but the share of the cost subsidised was consistently low (i.e. less than 25% of full price) the AD was categorised as commonly being funded privately. ADs with considerable variation in private/public funding arrangements were categorised as the “in-between group”. Finally, we examined the extent to which the empirical results on the level of private financing for the 28 selected ADs were in line with the predictions that had been based on the analytical framework. This was done by comparing the overall averages from the grading process for the three groups.</p>

<p>In addition to the general results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494812462459">Table I</xref>, the operationalisation of affordability deserves further explanation. Strong reluctance was expressed against discussing the concept of possible levels of affordability. Participants in the focus group of AD experts strongly argued that any price associated with ADs should be considered unaffordable. The major reason for this position was that many patients need multiple ADs, and the total cost of numerous “low-priced” ADs would quickly add up to an unaffordable cost for many patients. Given the difficulties in reaching any form of consensus when trying to operationalise the concept of affordability, we chose to use the established maximum self-pay levels (i.e. annual deductibles) associated with user fees for health care in Sweden as reference points when constructing levels of affordability. The low affordability level was set at €100 to coincide with the maximum yearly fee for outpatient care in Sweden, which was 900 SEK (€101) at the time. The medium affordability level was set at €200 to coincide with the yearly price-cap for prescribed medicine in Sweden, which was 1800 SEK (€202) at the time.</p>

<title>Surveying out-of-pocket payments for assistive devices</title>
<p>The overall response rate to the questionnaire containing direct questions on the level of out-of-pocket payment was 82% (83/101). The questionnaire focusing on ADs for individuals with hearing impairments had the highest response rate (91%), while the questionnaire focusing on ADs for individuals with visual impairments had the lowest response rate (71%). Based on the responses to the questionnaire we were able to roughly establish the level of public funding for the ADs included in the survey and divide them into three groups, i.e. ADs commonly funded privately, ADs commonly funded publicly, and ADs with wide variation in private/public funding. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494812462459">Figure 1</xref> presents the empirical results. The vertical axis represents the share of regional authorities that subsidise each AD, while the horizontal axis represents the share of the total cost for a particular AD that is subsidised. ADs in the upper-right box are largely financed with public funds, while those in the lower-left box are largely financed out-of-pocket. ADs in the remaining boxes include a mix of public and private financing. The box in centre of the figure contains the ADs where we found the greatest differences between counties. Hence, the level of public funding is summarised in two dimensions: breadth describing the scope of population covered, where variations reflect geography and medical indications, and height describing the extent to which costs of a service are funded publicly as opposed to cost-sharing requirements.</p>
<p>Responses showed that the financing of ADs in Sweden varies widely across county councils as regards both breadth and height. Also, among our selected ADs the results clearly show a tendency towards out-of-pocket financing for ADs used in preventive treatment and public financing for ADs that compensate for functional disabilities. ADs intended for curative treatment appear to fall in the group showing considerable differences between regional authorities.</p>

<p>Calculated averages in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494812462459">Table II</xref> show that ADs commonly funded privately have a slightly higher score compared to ADs commonly funded publicly and ADs with wide variations in private/public funding arrangements. In our survey, the ADs commonly funded publicly had the lowest average score as a group. Consequently, ADs commonly funded publicly were generally considered to be less suitable for private financing according to the framework. The largest discrepancy in grading between the groups was found for affordability and lifestyle enhancement. However, grading showed little difference with respect to the concepts of sufficient knowledge and individual autonomy, where the grades indicated high suitability for private out-of-pocket payment for almost all ADs. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494812462459">Table II</xref> also presents examples of ADs that, although unsuited to private financing according to the analytical framework, are in fact often financed through out-of-pocket payments. Surprisingly, ADs (e.g. dictating devices, automatic pill dispensers) for healthcare consumers with cognitive impairments often appear to be excluded from public financing, although we consider them less suitable for private funding compared to many other ADs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The potential role of individual responsibility in healthcare policies is not a new topic. However, the debate surrounding individual responsibility for health has revolved mainly around three philosophical issues: When do causal factors constitute effort or circumstance? When should choices relating to health be regarded as genuinely deliberate and free as opposed to being socially conditioned? What constitutes socially acceptable risk taking as regards one’s own health? These interrelated issues centre on a retrospective notion of individual responsibility, i.e. the moral relevance of holding people responsible for past health-related behaviour. However, so far, no widely accepted answers on how to incorporate retrospective responsibility into actual policies have emerged. The framework presented and operationalised in this paper applies a prospective notion of individual responsibility for health care, focusing on responsibility in terms of the health services that individuals are capable of financing and managing without public involvement or subsidies – a conception of individual responsibility that some argue is more policy relevant in welfare-promoting societies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494812462459">24</xref>].</p>
<sec id="section12-1403494812462459">
<title>Main findings and study limitations</title>
<p>The funding of ADs in Sweden is disorderly and varies widely across county councils as regards co-payment, full payment, discretionary payments for certain healthcare consumer groups, and full reimbursement. Our survey to investigate the level of public funding for the selected ADs illustrates these variations. Response rates were surprisingly high. This could be taken as an indication that our questionnaire mirrors a desire among concerned health professionals to raise the actual situation for open discussion. Regarding limitations, an uncertainty should be noted concerning the reliability of the responses. In speaking with individuals working with AD provisions and respondents that had to be reminded via telephone, we learned that it is not uncommon for out-of-pocket AD payments to be decided on an ad-hoc basis with payments varying by occasion, i.e. patient encounter. Hence, it is important to acknowledge that the results from our questionnaire may give a simplified picture of reality. Therefore, we view our empirical findings mainly as an empirical departure point to facilitate further discourse on the policy applicability of the analytical framework that is presented and further developed in this paper.</p>
<p>A major finding in this paper is that it was possible to classify services according to an operationalised framework. As with any form of classification system, stakeholders in our study found it difficult at times to classify the selected AD in line with the proposed framework. Occasionally, specific stakeholders had difficulty agreeing that any AD could ever be appropriate for out-of-pocket payment. This of course complicated the grading process. Scholars with previous experience from health technology assessment and (surprisingly) patients could more easily discriminate between ADs according to the proposed framework.</p>
<p>Tentative grading based on the analytical framework in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494812462459">Table II</xref> indicates that the attributes concerning sufficient knowledge, individual autonomy, and sufficient demand do not appear to influence why certain ADs are financed privately out-of-pocket. In retrospect, this is not particularly surprising since high scores on these attributes could be considered a general feature among most ADs. These three attributes might not be able to explain any differences within the field of ADs, but compared to services in other medical areas they might influence the potential for private financing. The level of positive externalities, affordability, and lifestyle enhancement appears to be somewhat higher for ADs financed out-of-pocket, even though the differences are not staggering. Affordability seems to be the most influential attribute of the three. Although we found a general tendency to consider privately financed ADs as being more suitable for private financing according to the analytical framework, it should be noted that this result is based on unweighted averages. Given that some criteria may be more important than others, this finding should be interpreted with caution.</p>
<p>While acknowledging the limitations of this study, we may nevertheless conclude that regional authorities in Sweden differ considerably as regards out-of-pocket payment for ADs. This would suggest room for potential improvement in both effectiveness and fairness. The analytical framework used to analyse the suitability of private financing is constructed to analyse the wide range of existing health services, not ADs exclusively. Hence, this might be a contributing factor why no staggering differences appeared in our grading of ADs. Since grading ADs according to the proposed attributes is a delicate task, we need to be careful when interpreting the results and avoid drawing hasty conclusions.</p>

<title>Final remarks</title>
<p>Some argue that ethical principles are of little or no use as general tools for rationing since they are unlikely to be followed in practice. Instead, many emphasise the importance of better procedures for making decisions and broadening public participation as solutions for dealing with rationing of health services. We agree that identifying legitimate procedures for decision making is a vital aspect for increasing the acceptance and perceived fairness of rationing. However, to sustain any decision-making process it is important for decision makers to have the support of substantive principles so they can openly discuss and explain the logic behind the difficult decisions they are forced to make. The analytical framework applied in this paper may offer such a supportive tool when prevailing ethical principles are too vague and too inclusive.</p>
<p>Ultimately it is up to the political process in democratic societies to determine which services to exclude from the publicly funded healthcare system. Consequently, decision makers are faced with two options – they can either shut their eyes and ignore the fact that publicly funded health care cannot afford everything and simply let rationing take its course by default, or they can make explicit decisions to ration by design. For politically appointed decision makers, rationing by default is probably the most alluring since it constrains the level of conflict, thereby facilitating re-election. To make intricate rationing decisions appear acceptable and fair, even for those negatively affected, the rationale behind such decisions must be intuitive and understandable. Decision makers need to have a framework that they can understand and explain to others in simple terms if they are to make healthcare rationing decisions by design rather than by default.</p>
