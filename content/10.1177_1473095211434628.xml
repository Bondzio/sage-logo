<abstract>
<p>During the recent symposium ‘<italic>Is Planning Past Politics?</italic>’, the notion of postpolitics and the question what the proper political could be in relation to planning became the main topic. The issue concerning the practices of politics in planning is pertinent, particularly when democratic politics is not necessarily seen to derive its legitimacy only through institutional and procedural arrangements. However, this article identifies a danger in the binary of postpolitics/proper political that it might develop into a kind of ‘postpolitical correctness’.</p>

<p>What role does planning have in a world where everything is political, yet not much of it seems to be democratic in nature? This question was posed at the recent symposium Is planning past politics?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1473095211434628">1</xref></sup> Three strands framed the discussion of the state of politics in planning at the symposium, which was organised by Jonathan Metzger, Philip Allmendinger, and Stijn Oosterlynck, who did a great job of promoting discussions on the topic. Presented as the postpolitical theory, the displacement of politics, and the agonistic theory, these three strands were introduced as dealing with how to think about planning and politics when not everything is political. Central to the motivation behind the symposium was thus that on the one hand planning is always political, pace <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1473095211434628">Wildavsky’s (1973</xref>: 132) claim that ‘Planning is politics’; on the other hand politics is perhaps not what it used to be, if we consider thinkers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473095211434628">Honig (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473095211434628">Rancière (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473095211434628">Mouffe (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1473095211434628">Žižek (1999)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473095211434628">Latour (2005a)</xref>, who were loosely grouped together as representing post-foundational theory. These interlocutors (as the sample of theorists were quickly dubbed at the symposium), the organisers state,
<disp-quote>
<p>are all united in their ambition to articulate a more disruptive or at least transformative understanding of the meaning of ‘the political’, through questioning the cavalier contemporary usage of the terms within the public debate and the social sciences (quote from the invitation to the symposium)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The intuition drawing together the three strands, then, seems to be that genuine political activity and democratic achievements rely on something more than just formal procedure in the sphere of politics. This essay is a reflection on this point and a call for a degree of caution in the effort to rescue a more substantial sense of politics and political practices, as this simplification may too easily suggest that there are two sides (only). In the light of this, should we be wary of a new kind of political correctness in planning studies? I do not mean the kind where we avoid certain expressions or actions which might ‘exclude, marginalize, or insult groups of people who are socially disadvantaged or discriminated against’, as my laptop dictionary defines the conventional kind of political correctness. Rather, should we be concerned with a kind which works through theoretical positions?</p>
<p>The many papers presented at the symposium (too many to give proper mention of here) and the discussions that followed drew on this framing and were highly interesting, pertinent, and unsettling. A strong undercurrent was the theme of how to do planning and how we study this activity, questions which will hopefully never be settled absolutely. For instance, Karin Bradley and Moa Tunström discussed Swedish sustainability discourse and negotiations in planning practice, a theme which Maria Håkansson elucidated as well, and Cathy Wilkinson presented on planning practices ‘greening’ urban sprawl in Melbourne. Many of the interventions presented about how planning and politics deal with specific issues communicated the outrageousness of democratic deficits and simply bad (or evil) planning. Here, Oren Yiftachel on the grey spacing of land in Israel, Mike Raco and the hyper-pluralism of decision-making and public health issues in London, UK, and Guy Baeten on the depoliticised ‘neo-Modern’ development schemes in Malmö, Sweden, were pertinent. Lastly, the symposium brought together many strands in the search for how to talk about what is wrong in current and past Western planning. Among others, Philip Allmendinger and Graham Haughton discussed the role of planners in making postpolitics work; Richard Ek and Mekonnen Tesfahuney elaborated on the relation between values and planning as war by other means; Juan Velasquez explicated the role of women in the radicalization of democracy in Venezuelan ‘Social Battle Rooms’; and Barbara Czarniawska asked questions about central planning in Poland in the 1980s in comparison with big firms in the USA, and whether planning can be seen as being ‘pre-political’.</p>
<p>Hence, it is not surprising that the notion of the postpolitical set the register early on for the three days of discussions. The establishment of a framing vocabulary is not uncommon in planning studies or elsewhere in academe, and it is of course inescapable if the intention is to discuss a certain topic. Now, I want to make it perfectly clear that I do not want to throw out the baby with the bath water. Rather, if anything it is an effort of hyperbolic thinking.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1473095211434628">2</xref></sup> The intuition and aspiring work in post-foundational theory – a more inclusive label, stressed by Oosterlynck during the symposium, which can be used instead of something like ‘the postpolitical turn’ – is much needed. What follows in this article is a comment about hesitation and responsibility concerning the academic dynamics of coinage, of notions as hard (hitting) currency in knowledge practices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1473095211434628">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Re-sounding postpolitical diagnosis</title>
<p>Postpolitics is a collector, a regime, a condition, and it is coming to your local theatre; soon it will be everywhere. All political activity is up for colonisation at the moment, it seems. It will transform all politics – and in effect planning – into a rigged game of sycophancy, so to speak, in which decision-making space is made so narrow as to allow only a minuscule debate in a highly restricted discourse. Since there has after all been a debate, it can shamelessly be called democracy by its instigators. Such at least was the dominant characterisation of contemporary ‘apolitical’ politics in the symposium.</p>
<p>This diagnosis gains strength from a resonance among ‘ordinary people’, or rather ‘ordinary voters’. In Sweden, widespread contempt of politicians (politikerförakt) was a big worry for the legitimacy of the idea of a democratic state during the 1990s and was influential in commissioning a large-scale public enquiry, simply called <italic>The Commission on Democracy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1473095211434628">SOU, 2000</xref>), which among other things had the task of studying the low rate of voting and suggesting measures to increase citizens’ participation in and enthusiasm for the democratic system. Recently, the biggest party in the right-conservative-neoliberal alliance in Sweden, <italic>Moderaterna</italic>, simply hijacked the Social Democrat traditional add-on of ‘the workers’ party’ and is now claiming to be ‘the workers’ party for our times’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1473095211434628">4</xref></sup> – thereby perhaps also articulating a common sentiment of a substantive lack in the conventional distinction between left and right in Swedish parliamentary debate. Similarly, Mike Raco’s presentation at the symposium was introduced with the observation that most ‘people on the streets’ interviewed for the study recognized and agreed to the postpolitical diagnosis.</p>
<p>However, as a characterization of politics this is nothing new. The postpolitical diagnosis can be seen, to keep with the bathing baby metaphor, as the latest incarnation of the critique of <italic>democracy deficits</italic> and <italic>agenda setting</italic> in political theory. This tradition, simplified, holds that democratic deficits occur when politics are displaced out of an arrangement of democratic procedures. This happens when an issue or a public affair ‘evades the mechanisms of democratic legitimacy and accountability that may be in place in a given site’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473095211434628">Marres, 2005</xref>: 5; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473095211434628">Beck, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473095211434628">Habermas, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473095211434628">Held, 1999</xref>). In this literature, the typical situations are transnational environmental politics; one might add technoscientific practices described by science and technology studies (STS) as frequently resulting in such displacements as well (for instance, by the now common approach that science and technology is politics by other means [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473095211434628">Latour, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1473095211434628">Winner, 1980]</xref>). In the agenda-setting literature, politics is simply understood as ‘a set of strategies for the displacement of issues’, since the main point of politics is to control what is allowed to be an issue and hence the organization of choice and balance of power in a political community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473095211434628">Marres, 2005</xref>: 26; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473095211434628">Heclo, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473095211434628">Lukes, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1473095211434628">Schattschneider, 1960</xref>).</p>
<p>Further resonances, to continue this detour over spheres of interest for planning studies, are in the field of political ecology. Here, the diagnosis has much in common with the frequently noted problem of framing people as ‘rational resource users’ in participatory community-based management. Although these kinds of programmes are intended to increase democracy and offer development opportunities, they often seem to have quite the opposite effect, as these modes of governing cannot acknowledge the messy practices which make up everyday human life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473095211434628">Saunders, 2011</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095211434628">Law, 2004</xref>). In the recently established ‘big science’ programme of the Earth System Governance Project, the old issue of ‘usefulness of participation’ in environmental governance is stated in the equally old terms of trade-offs between efficiency and accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473095211434628">Biermann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473095211434628">Dombrowski, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The list of resonances in different academic disciplines and fields, not to mention practices, could no doubt be made much longer. Returning to planning studies, we may sense that the notion of postpolitics is on the verge of becoming a generic shorthand for our understanding of much urban and regional planning, in the sense that there is not much room allowed for divergent or radically different things to happen. Particularly salient is perhaps reflection on and sometimes disillusionment with participatory, communicative, and deliberative procedures in planning studies, with a sense that it is ‘not as easy as we thought’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473095211434628">Cooke and Kothari, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473095211434628">Fainstein, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473095211434628">Hillier, 2003</xref>). When characterized simply as a failure of democracy, and not primarily projects from which we can learn, it is easy to label this as postpolitical (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473095211434628">Oosterlynck and Swyngedouw, 2010</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473095211434628">Allmendinger and Haughton’s (2010</xref>: 808) discussion on how to characterize spatial planning in the UK highlights the (disappointing) feature of neoliberal postpolitical consensus which seems to take the place of a (formerly hopeful) ‘forum for meaningful debate over radically different alternative visions of development futures’.</p>
<p>The antidote, as far as I understand the symposium discussions, is to take care of and nurture the rare and fragile proper political irruptions, which are ascribed the potential to destabilise (at least for a while) postpolitics (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473095211434628">Swyngedouw, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Binarism</title>
<p>Ironically, one can wonder whether the genre of postpolitical diagnosis is itself at risk of attracting a postpolitical condition? That is, soon any kind of action in formal or informal decision-making settings or statement to characterise them that does not try to take account of any voice, any articulation that claims that it has bearing on an issue, will be condemned as acting postpolitically.</p>
<p>To repeat, my concern is not the diagnosis of postpolitics per se. It is about the risks inherent in the vocabulary, which might, due to academic dynamics in debate and writing that most of us are familiar with, take us far from the clarifying insights of post-foundational theory. It is a matter of ‘discourse 101’: I remember a keynote by David Harvey at the International Conference of Critical Geography in Mexico City, 2005. It was an analysis of neoliberalism and its philosophy. It was the first presentation of a five day long conference; it became very hard to discuss critical geography without relating it to that particular keynote – or, rather, to the particular notion dealt with in it. This is, of course, the point of a keynote address: to set the key in which a conference can ‘jam’. However, there were also a perception among many scholars of being forced into using the concept ‘neoliberal’ and its derivatives. Many seemed to feel that there was no escaping – for better or worse – that version of the world in whichever particular setting was up for critical enquiry. To the point of self-ridicule, trying not to say the word every other sentence, some participants started using formulations like ‘the NL-word’ instead – even in paper presentations.</p>
<p>In academe, in research, and perhaps especially in the social sciences, we often see the same kind of dynamics: a notion, a concept signifying a topic in a particular way, a framing, seems to colonise the discourse (or at least establish posts for the slave trade) and aspires to be a fix-point (to use Gunnar Olsson’s terminology from the symposium; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473095211434628">Olsson, 2009</xref>). In terms of vocabulary, what about ‘killing our darlings’ when something becomes too easy to say? Gunder (a bit out of context but in my view related to the academic dynamics alluded to here) recently wrote in this journal that:
<disp-quote>
<p>Our ideological slogans and labels, our sublime objects of ideology, channel and stifle our thinking along predictable rigid paths in a manner that largely precludes innovation and change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473095211434628">Gunder, 2011</xref>: 207).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hence, if we are not cautious, the postpolitical correctness means following a rule, a sorting principle, rather than using the insights as something to provoke thinking; in Deleuzian terms (via <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095211434628">Stengers, 2010</xref>), it becomes a device for <italic>‘la droit’</italic> rather than <italic>‘la gauche’</italic>!</p>
<p>Often it is possible to acknowledge terminology or vocabularies but still ignore ‘the game’, so to speak. The postpolitical diagnosis may be a bit different, as it not only draws on ‘categorisation’ but seems wide open to a very Modern mechanism of setting up clearly ‘good’ and ‘bad’ sides of a subject matter. Dualities such as these, according to much STS thought and other thinkers such as Deleuze, tend to freeze thinking rather than open it up (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1473095211434628">Woolgar, 2002</xref>, on the critique against conceptual binaries in the social sciences). In human geography, the critique against dualisms often converges around statements such as:
<disp-quote>
<p>Binary structures … establish relations of opposition and exclusion rather than of sameness and interconnection between the two terms involved. Much of human geography, then, has potentially accepted uncritical accounts of power relations simply by endorsing binary thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473095211434628">Cloke and Johnston, 2005</xref>: 12).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like Herman Melville’s Bartleby, who unto his master’s command says ‘I would prefer not to’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1473095211434628">Melville, 2004</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1473095211434628">Stengers, 2005</xref>), a choice of not using the vocabulary could be one way to enhance the critique, perhaps. How do we learn this lesson without having everything pushed through the postpolitical/proper political grinder?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1473095211434628">5</xref></sup> These very effective categories can indeed hinder creative diagnosis with different answers about possible solutions (i.e. both analytical and normative statements). Otherwise, and here is the ironic twist to these two operators (postpolitical/proper political) which make up the sorting principle in postpolitical correctness: in the worst case, articulations which prefer not to use the vocabulary of postpolitics and the proper political – the first principles in the grammar package – will be considered to be noise, not ‘realist’, and thus made irrelevant by a mechanism not dissimilar from that which is the main target of critique in the ‘genre’. A proper political attitude could very well be to encourage many different languages, vocabularies, and practices of making diagnosis and propose possibilities which do not even use the words ‘political’ or ‘politics’ – just as there are ways to make a social analysis without really using the term ‘the social’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473095211434628">Latour, 2005b</xref>).</p>

<title>Dare to fail</title>
<p>A problem with the academic dynamic is that as one particular notion or binary grows, i.e. is seen to be an effective explanatory category, by way of harvesting particular cases to make a synthesis and a general diagnosis, it frequently runs the risk of losing something else, perhaps what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095211434628">Stengers (2010)</xref> called ‘minority techniques’ and ‘ecologies of practice’, which are destroyed when translated into terms such as ‘stakeholders’ and ‘empowerment’. Many might hasten to ‘monorationalize’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473095211434628">Davy, 2008</xref>) by using a notion and miss the oddities and strange fits in what they want to discuss. Massey seems to argue that this academic dynamic has much to do with the lack of ‘time to think’ and ‘the tyranny of the immediate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473095211434628">Massey, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The ‘taking care of and nurturing the rare and fragile proper political irruptions’, in Swyngedouw’s proposition at least, always has to do with equality (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473095211434628">Swyngedouw, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1473095211434628">2011</xref>). However, from another point of view, that of emerging publics for instance, a political irruption need not necessarily be about equality. Equality might be a matter of concern, but it is not strictly necessary for, say, a public to emerge and contend formal politics. In this view following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095211434628">Marres (2010)</xref>, publicization, the emergence of a public to deal with an affair, an issue, a politically charged problem, may be a lot more visible if we do not restrict our assessment of democracy to only proceduralist standards. It <italic>may</italic> happen that the ‘proper political’ irruptions, although fragile as many emergent things (ecologies, new ideas, art, humans, and what-have-you), are not that rare at all. It <italic>may</italic> happen that there is nothing but a ‘false’ problem similar to the ‘problem’ of the relations between nature and culture (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473095211434628">Braun, 2004</xref>): instead of unintentionally (?) supporting ‘postpolitics’ by acknowledging its ‘dead hand over democracy’ one might focus on the practices of heterogeneous publics, which seem to require more, not less, displacement of issues.</p>
<p>The democratic deficit <italic>may</italic>, frankly, be a mirage constituted by political science and other ‘utilitarian’ proceduralist versions of what planning practice (for example) is. Contrary to the sense in much postpolitical talk, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095211434628">Marres (2010)</xref> conveys a sense that publics emerge everywhere at all times and, of course, it is hard work for them to make a difference (and I frankly do not think all of them should – yes, <italic>should</italic> – succeed, particularly not the ‘Black(shirted ones)’. Thus, from this point of view, much commentary on postpolitical conditions amounts to wondering something akin to ‘why is hard work so hard?’. It might be a question of style or attitude, but it seems a bit odd to mount the high ground of postpolitical critique on procedural shortcomings (which is not particularly news to the ‘shop floor’ in planning practice nor in Western thinking on rhetorics and the art of persuasion) and at the same time be indignant that the ‘democracy machine’ fails to deliver, instead of directing all energies towards helping the multitude of ways in which the machine can be problematized – in theory and in practice.</p>
<p>Academic dynamics may also hit in a personal way. To reconnect to the poor baby in the now lukewarm bath: when we develop notions, concepts, and theoretical tools, or texts in general, for me at least they seem like babies; we try to allow them to explore the world, learn how to deal with bullies and how not to be kidnapped, etc. This is at the same time something of a collective socialization of them. If we want this particular baby to grow and be all it can be, it might be fruitful to fend off the risk of postpolitical correctness, a situation in which there is just the true exegesis of words and not many empirical problems left in the discussion. I have seen (sadly, most of the time in leftist groupings in various European countries) activists and radical researchers who have become terribly anxious and insecure, and too entrenched to act because of a fear of not thinking and talking the true way (this perhaps common observation is also corroborated by personal communication with people both active now and ‘back then’ just after 1968; it is yet another instance of <italic>le droit</italic> rather than <italic>la gauche</italic> in effect). It never seemed very ‘productive,’ either in terms of understanding or changing the world.</p>
<p>So, what is the role for planning when everything is politics but not much of it deemed proper? To at least try, even in the face of postpolitical correctness? This is perhaps what Eric Swyngedouw meant – or could mean? – in the comment on the summation of the symposium’s first day: ‘dare to fail’, which is also an encouragement perhaps to try to do something, even in the face of being accused of recreating postpolitics.</p>

<p>Although the intention of this essay is not to find scapegoats for the ‘binary split’, such kind of ‘justice’ is precisely beside the main point made here, the two-sidedness is quite remarkable in Swyngedouw’s recent work on the topic (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473095211434628">Swyngedouw, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1473095211434628">2011</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473095211434628">Isin (2005)</xref>, for instance, explicates the difference between ‘politics’ and ‘political’ as the impossibility to see the political without studying politics. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473095211434628">Dikeç (2005)</xref>, for example, clearly argues against reading Rancière as developing a binary opposition. Still, there is a historicity here, that in the career of the ‘postpolitical problem’, somewhere diffuse, sometime slowly, it has been chopped up and attached to ‘fake’ and ‘genuine’, ‘bad’ and ‘good’ sides of democracy.</p>
