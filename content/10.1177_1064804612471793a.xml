<p>This comprehensive overview of human factors/ergonomics considerations that are specific to control room operations includes a concise but thorough overview of relevant British standards and pertinent HF/E literature. The authors highlight where research is lacking or noncohesive. In each chapter, information is compiled cogently but somewhat repetitively for the experienced human factors professional. Nevertheless, this repetition within chapters will serve students in an HF/E degree program well, or the reader who is using the text as a reference, both of whom are the intended audience.</p>
<p>Despite its title, the book emphasizes <italic>evaluation</italic> of completed control rooms; little attention is paid to <italic>design</italic> activities. Descriptions of mostly abstract evaluations provide more information on the output than on the process of the evaluation. A discussion of the iterative design and evaluation process for each chapter would have expanded the audience for this text.</p>
<p>Because each chapter was written to stand on its own, there is little discussion of the interaction between topics or the trade-offs among different factors while designing. The organization of the chapters bounces back and forth between the personnel-related aspects and the technical and environmental aspects of central control rooms. Dividing the book into sections or including a summative chapter at the end describing the connections between chapters would have been helpful. Without a connecting section in each chapter, the book is difficult to read straight through. However, that was not the authors’ intent.</p>
<p>This book does accomplish its intended purpose: The essential HF/E knowledge (i.e., relevant standards, literature, evaluation techniques) of control rooms is thoroughly documented. I know of no other text that documents concisely the applicable HF/E standards for a domain. This is valuable information to both student and practitioner alike. As such, this should serve as a model for other human factors domain-specific texts. When I teach an HF/E course for command and control, I will use this book to supplement my lectures. I anticipate that it will become a reference book on my shelf to which I will turn in reference to my other work as well.</p>
