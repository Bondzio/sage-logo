<abstract>
<p>This article explores the role of the Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC) in facilitating and encouraging a collaborative community of junior and senior scholars on issues of technology and humanistic learning. As a result of its emphasis on collaboration and discussion, HASTAC encourages a form of collective intelligence that can serve as a model for future iterations of online communities formed to address problems and highlight advances in teaching and technology. Written from the perspective of a graduate student who also is a HASTAC scholar, the article discusses the positive impact HASTAC can have in terms of opportunities for professional advancement for junior scholars, as well as encouraging collaboration across disciplinary boundaries on issues relating to teaching methodologies, the humanities, and technology.</p>

<p>T<sc>o tell the truth</sc>, I was not prepared for the isolation that graduate work naturally requires. As a journalism major and then as a communications student in a terminal Master of Arts program, where networking was as integral to the program as learning to think critically and reflexively, the sea change in person-to-person interaction that happened when I stepped onto my third campus to begin my PhD took me by surprise. For my part, I chose an education in the humanities because of the opportunity for interaction with the very people about whom I was writing. The humanities provide an outlet for me to tackle the algorithms of social interaction, yet the work I do in solving those social equations often takes place alone. As I write this, for instance, I am sitting in my favorite noisy café, and three other humanities PhD students in different programs from my university have set up camp near my table. We are each sitting alone, working on our respective projects. Although we chat amiably about our work when we get refills of tea or coffee, talk of collaboration on a project does not often arise, precisely because our projects seem so vastly different.</p>
<p>From what I can tell by the frequent conversations I have on the subject with other graduate students, the social isolation is not an altogether welcome change for them, either. Part of this job-related isolation is, of course, entirely welcome. The process of PhD acquisition is a process of learning to work and think in solitude; it is impossible to analyze, incorporate, or produce complicated concepts when one is constantly surrounded by people. That said, the independent nature of much PhD work in the humanities can mean that anxieties about scholarly production and progress, a natural part of the educational process, can be exacerbated when the majority of one’s time after finishing coursework is spent in silent contemplation, not social settings such as classroom discussions or group study sessions. When opportunities to bounce ideas off others for papers or presentations are decreased, job-related anxiety can increase, leading to a work/life imbalance – we begin to work so much we cease to have a life. Although web-enabled communication systems make it easier to create social bonds outside the library carrel, they too can seem a frivolous use of time when the day’s writing yield was less than 250 words. The question then becomes, how do we step out of the espresso-fueled universe that we have created to not only reclaim that social part of ourselves, but also remain or become productive junior members of the Academy? This article will explore the role the Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC) has in facilitating avenues by which junior scholars can contribute to and help bolster the digital future of the Academy.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1474022211427363"><title>Building networks</title>
<p>For the past two years, HASTAC has been a key component of my intellectual and professional socialization. As a HASTAC scholar, I write blog entries on race, rhetoric, and the role of technology as they relate to issues of Otherness. My contributions to the site often center on how images in the everyday are manipulated in ways great and small, and how audience members use those images to make sense of themselves and others around them. As a network of junior and senior scholars, and community members, HASTAC is a hub of intellectual contact in the online community, with a directed focus in ways that positively impact the field of the humanities. HASTAC scholars are undergraduate or graduate students nominated by their respective institutions to participate. The HASTAC network, comprised of individuals and institutions, is more than 7,000 strong with over 120 participating institutions; contributions to the site range from discussions on theoretical lessons of the digital humanities to real-time applications of innovations in pedagogy and technology. Founded in 2002 by Cathy Davidson, John Hope Franklin Humanities Institute Professor of Interdisciplinary Studies, and David Theo Goldberg, Director of the University of California Humanities Research Institute, HASTAC was meant to respond to concerns about ‘the diminished role of humanistic learning in the Information Age’ (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.hastac.org/history">www.hastac.org/history</ext-link>). It also provides an intellectual outlet for those who might be ‘isolated, marginalized, sometimes even underappreciated within their departments or institutions access to a distributed community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474022211427363">Davidson and Goldberg, 2010</xref>: 149). That the idea of the social was built into HASTAC’s original equation is important; it rewards those who are looking for a community outside of their particular department, in order to broaden the academic discussion in relation to their work, as well as those whose projects may push the envelope of what their department expects or even desires. In highlighting alternative modes of creation, thinking, and critique, HASTAC challenges traditional forms of knowledge organization and production.</p>
<p>In 2004, Davidson and Goldberg stressed the various ways the humanities are vital to society, even as insights and advances produced by humanities scholars are overlooked or given short shrift in comparison to advances in the hard sciences by those outside the field.
<disp-quote>
<p>[The Humanities] offer critical civic competencies, ways of comprehending cultural and technological values, and the worlds such values conjure; in short, ways of world making. A world without the humanities would be one in which science and technology knew no point of social reference, had lost their cultural compass and moral scope. It would be a world narrowly limited and limitlessly narrow. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474022211427363">Davidson and Goldberg, 2004</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>One cannot determine which field of study is ‘worth more’ by counting tick marks; various disciplines have fundamentally improved and changed our perception of the world around us. What HASTAC provides is an opportunity for scholars of various backgrounds and with varying interests to meet in a common space where an interest in the topic at hand takes precedence. In other words, one’s specific training is meant to enhance, not restrict, conversations. In facilitating collaboration across geographical or pedagogical boundaries, HASTAC provides several ways for members to interact with one another. A community member might join or create groups, spaces where members can discuss current projects, receive feedback, and discuss developments in the field. Just recently, I joined the ‘Pedagogy’ group, where members discuss particular challenges in, and opportunities of, teaching. HASTAC’s search function also shifts the way we access information. Members can search the website through broad topics: academia, community and policy, culture, HASTAC, multimedia, and technology; by clicking on the topic, they can find recently posted content related to one of those broad groups, or can find more detailed information in subgroups. This creates an opportunity to find various related articles without having to do an additional search. There are job and fellowship postings, calls for papers, news and updates, and various other means by which HASTAC creates a community of committed, engaged scholars, who often, as has been my experience, become friends outside the HASTAC network as well.</p>
<p>The promise located within online collaboration networks that bring together scholars from different disciplines under a similar banner – pedagogy and technology, for example – is the expanded opportunity to see the means by which one’s research can improve or be improved by another’s suggestions or ideas. On the HASTAC site, organizers have described the impetus for the project as driven by a desire to explicate how the technological and the humanistic can be successfully and fruitfully merged:
<disp-quote>
<p>We are motivated by the conviction that the digital era provides rich opportunities for informal and formal learning and for collaborative, networked research that extends across traditional disciplines, across the boundaries of academe and community, across the ‘two cultures’ of humanism and technology, across the divide of thinking versus making, and across social strata and national borders. (‘About HASTAC’, n.d.)</p>
</disp-quote>Separate from my day-to-day work as a semi-sequestered graduate student and from my home life as a stressed-out graduate student, HASTAC is, for me, a generative third space, where my interactions with other community members have meaningfully impacted my work. Simply put, my participation with HASTAC has made me a more engaged and aware student and teacher. While discussing the student-led creation of a graduate society to strengthen students’ collective voice, Lynn McAlpine and Cheryl Amundsen outlined the idea of a third space as ‘newly constructed activities that bring together people who would not previously have interacted collectively . . . Individuals may have different personal intentions, but they are drawn to working together because they can perceive a collective shared motive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474022211427363">McAlpine and Amundsen, 2007</xref>: 76). HASTAC is a hub for participants from various fields and intellectual interests to work together toward a common interest in discussing the role of technology in humanities. Collaboration across disciplinary boundaries is a fundamental component of HASTAC. Perhaps HASTAC fits most with Randall Bass and Dan Bernstein’s assertion that ‘the key location for scholarship of teaching and learning’ might best be situated in a ‘middle ground’ located between the ends of a spectrum identified as ‘individual’ and ‘cosmopolitan’, with the former relating to an individual’s ‘engaging in reflection for the improvement of his or her own practice’ and the latter as ‘the individual published work available for others more generally’. Their conception of a middle ground reflects ‘work that falls between individual practice and the world of generalized knowledge about teaching and learning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474022211427363">Bass and Bernstein, 2008</xref>: 304). As a community of practice, HASTAC comprises members from a range of educational and professional backgrounds; HASTAC scholars are graduate and undergraduate students who act as on-the-ground reporters, relaying new approaches to pedagogy and technology as we see, use, or imagine them in our classes. Hierarchies of learning, teaching, and working that exist in our daily lives as students, teachers, and mentors take a backseat to open discussion among community members where a desire to learn, communicate, and discuss takes precedence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1474022211427363"><title>Collaborative spaces</title>
<p>HASTAC scholars participate in and encourage conversations often by blogging, tweeting, podcasting, or co-hosting forums with HASTAC scholars from other universities, among other various means of connection. Forum organizers are encouraged to invite guests from outside HASTAC to weigh in on the topic at hand, thereby broadening the discussion beyond the immediate HASTAC community. For instance, in November 2009, the forum ‘Grading 2.0: Evaluation in the Digital Age’ tackled issues of assessment in student work, standardized testing, and grading. Arguing that ‘traditional “teach to the test” evaluation procedures are disconnected from all of the creative production, remixing, and networking skills that students are developing through their everyday engagement with new media’, the forum organizers asked community members to weigh in with suggestions as to how to assess and structure the educational experience for current and future students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474022211427363">HASTAC Scholars, 2009</xref>). As of spring 2011, the forum generated 118 responses and more than 29,300 page views. That forum is one of several that have generated more than 10,000 views. ‘Queer and Feminist New Media Spaces’, which launched in February 2010, generated 152 replies and more than 32,100 views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474022211427363">HASTAC Scholars, 2010b</xref>). The forum I co-hosted in April 2010 with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474022211427363">HASTAC scholars (2010a)</xref> from three other universities prompted 126 responses and more than 24,000 page views. Our forum ‘Blogs and Beyond: Teaching With Technology and Curiosity’ discussed challenges and opportunities in incorporating new technologies in meaningful ways that could enhance our students’ understanding as well as our ability to convey information clearly to those with varying skills and experiences with technology. We encouraged participants to reflect on their often dual experiences as teachers and students and respondents to post links, wikis, syllabi, or websites they felt could enhance the discussion. The responses and conversations reflected a range of experiences and ideas and highlighted the ongoing issues and concerns community members felt as they devised or revised their future and current courses. Inasmuch as the forum was meant for collaborative contemplation of the role that technology should have in the classroom, it also opened a space for participants to work through particular teaching concerns relating to incorporating technology in their classroom settings. HASTAC forums are an example of directed collaboration, while individual blogs written by HASTAC scholars are an individualized means of encouraging discussion. Having a space within which to show growing expertise and to contribute to a learning community of one’s peers not only adds to the professionalization process, but allows one to feel like a valued member.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1474022211427363"><title>A collective intelligence</title>
<p>What online learning communities provide is a space to build collective intelligence – not a community that thinks as a monolith, but rather a community in which each participating member has the potential to contribute expertise and engage in discussions, increasing the possibility to solve more complex problems and tackle thornier issues than would be possible with one solitary individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474022211427363">Davidson, 2010</xref>). HASTAC exemplifies the concept of collective intelligence, what Thomas W. Malone, Robert Laubacher, and Chrysanthos Dellarocas of the Center for Collective Intelligence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology broadly define as, ‘groups of individuals doing things collectively that seem intelligent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474022211427363">Malone et al., 2009</xref>: 2). In their study of collective intelligence systems, Malone et al. identify what they call the genes of collective intelligence systems, outlining the conditions under which each gene is ‘useful and the possibilities for combining and re-combining these genes to harness crowds effectively’ (2009: 3). They examined nearly 250 web-enabled collective intelligence systems, discerned a core set of ‘building blocks’ that are variously combined among different collective intelligence systems and devised two sets of questions: ‘Who is performing the task? Why are they doing it?’ and ‘What is being accomplished? How is it being done?’ They deemed that the ‘crowd gene’ associated with the former set of questions was utilized as a central component of web-enabled collective intelligence systems. ‘In the Crowd gene, activities can be undertaken by <italic>anyone in a large group who chooses to do so</italic> without being assigned by someone in a position of authority’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474022211427363">Malone et al., 2009</xref>: 4). In the first set of questions, the authors identify three basic ‘why’ genes that lead people, in general, to contribute to collective intelligence systems: money, love and glory. Money includes a promise of enrichment and glory, the promise or hope of recognition. Love, on the other hand, can enhance participants’ ‘intrinsic enjoyment of an activity by the opportunities it provides to socialize with others, or because it makes them feel they are contributing to a cause larger than themselves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474022211427363">Malone et al., 2009</xref>: 5). Although it is impossible to guess what drives each individual HASTAC contributor to continually upload, post, and discuss, one might argue that, while various factors may have introduced them to the site, including a small stipend from their host institutions, scholars continue to participate on HASTAC because of the opportunities for intellectual enhancement as well as opportunities for social engagement that participation in the network provides.</p>
<p>In terms of my experience with HASTAC thus far, I use the site as both a teaching and learning tool whereby I feel my personal blog entries can introduce alternate viewpoints on topics that are far from novel, but so familiar that we might no longer process the ways the topic might be read differently by different actors. In addition to my public participation on the site, I also have been able to discreetly enhance my own knowledge of certain advances in technology and pedagogy; these issues interested me before I began my current research, but because I am concentrating on finishing my degree they do not receive as much of my attention as they once did. As my dissertation project, which combines principles of rhetoric with critical race theory to examine images of US blackness in contemporary German public culture, has taken shape and taken me in new directions, I have had to step away from previous work I did relating to technological development in low-income communities. Before I began my PhD program, I was actively involved with charities or worked for organizations that addressed digital divide issues. But when I resumed full-time graduate work, the number of hours I could donate to problems outside of my research dwindled. Taking time to explore outside intellectual interests that did not directly help me finish papers or write conference presentations seemed too much to ask. HASTAC, however, has the potential to mitigate that problem as the site advocates technology for education’s sake, lowering the concern that one is not focusing enough on work; HASTAC is a reminder that there are other, equally important aspects to our job besides publishing and the dissertation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1474022211427363"><title>Professionalization through participation</title>
<p>For many if not most graduate students, the long hours one puts in at the computer are building blocks for creating a lasting presence in our chosen fields. A great deal of our graduate education involves the process of professional identity formation, where those long study sessions become our way to avoid making the ‘wrong’ moves; we are creating ourselves professionally as we write and think for ourselves as students and future educators. The production of subjectivity, Bill Green asserts, ‘is always a more or less fragile, precarious achievement, endlessly at risk and hence always needing to be reconstituted. In this sense, subject formation is a never-ending story, played out compulsively over and over again.’ Subjectivity production is ‘a process of (un)becoming . . . fraught with tension, uncertainty, ambivalence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474022211427363">Green, 2005</xref>: 154). Graduate students especially, are caught in an in-between space of completing the process of becoming a fully independent scholar, while still needing the guidance of professors and mentors. The desire to produce a strong identity, therefore, can be one that adds to the already high levels of stress that graduate students experience. Graduate students have made a conscious choice to remain in school to realize our professional goals, but because we are at an age when our peers are moving up the career ladder, acquiring the outward markers of success – homes or condos, automobiles manufactured later than the mid-90s (most likely with electric windows and a built-in CD player), clothes at brand-name retailers instead of brand-name clothes at consignment shops – and we are engaged in a years-long apprenticeship program that may or may not result in a PhD, our identity becomes intertwined with what we produce as students. Often that professional identity becomes fused with our personal identity, where ‘graduate student’ is not just our current job title, but also the means by which we communicate key aspects of ourselves to others: studious, learned, dedicated. Participating in learning communities allows us to express multiple intellectual interests and can play an important role in our professional development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1474022211427363" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Perhaps when people think of the idea of a Digital Future, they imagine the myriad possibilities of new applications, tactics, and advances in teaching that can – and will – positively impact our classrooms and teaching methodologies. The first thing that comes to my mind, however, is the role of the digital in helping one construct a future. Being a HASTAC scholar has helped me surpass the limits of my imagination when it comes to ways I might better incorporate technology into my classroom, not to mention my own research. HASTAC provides a space for me to bolster my knowledge of new technologies and think more creatively about how it should impact my current and future teaching methodologies. I can keep abreast of current discussions on access to technology and low-income communities as well as work through apprehensions I may have of introducing technology into my classroom where my teaching assignment requires that I focus on traditional principles of rhetoric and public speaking. Aside from the professional aspect of the site, the social component of HASTAC – the promise inherent in connecting with others with similar interests – and the possibility for intellectual interaction are something that should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>In a presentation on new directions in the humanities in 2004, Jacque Caesar and Thomas MacCalla highlighted aspects of what they described as the ‘new’ citizen, one who responds to societal more than individual needs. ‘Attention is called to a new age that requires a new type of citizen, a person who is an active participant/observer, who is capable of making a commitment to a higher order of humanity. The new citizen is a contributor who places the needs of society ahead of the person or the collective needs of a state or nation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474022211427363">Caesar and MacCalla, 2004</xref>: 2). What online networks like HASTAC offer their members is a means by which to expand one’s knowledge and contribute meaningfully to a group of peers equally dedicated to becoming, or remaining inspiring, inquisitive, excellent educators. Individualized learning often veers toward a ‘winner-take-all’ mentality, in which the level of cooperation is directly related to the ability to improve one’s own position (rather than an initial goal of improving the position of oneself and others); as Davidson and Goldberg argue, ‘networked learning is committed to a vision of the social – stressing cooperation, interactivity, mutuality, and social engagement for their own sakes and for the powerful productivity to which it more often than not leads. The power of 10 working interactively will almost invariably outstrip the power of one looking to beat out the other nine’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474022211427363">Davidson and Goldberg, 2010</xref>: 63). HASTAC provides a forum in which students and teachers can engage on a level playing field, whereby interactions between professor and student, technology neophyte and advanced user, are those of partnership, not hierarchy. A Digital Future would necessarily entail encouraging and nurturing these new citizens, so that they begin to see and continue to see knowledge and collaboration as necessary to an open and intelligent society. It would entail a commitment to sustainable practices that approach knowledge dissemination as participatory and not proprietary.</p>
