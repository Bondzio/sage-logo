<abstract>
<p>This article examines diverse visions of an alternative society articulated by individuals and groups in the Global Justice Movement (GJM). It finds that many dissenters of globalization tend to converge on the idea that localization, economic descaling and political devolution would foster social conditions favourable to a just and sustainable society. Critiquing this idea, this article identifies a number of foreseeable problems associated with a descaled, localized economy with a decentralized political structure. With a notable silence on the issue of the movement of people, local-centred economic models may provide an ecological ground for anti-immigration and trade protectionism of the rich countries. Small-scale farming and small scale eco-technology are far too inadequate to meet the food and energy needs of the populace in huge urban areas. Given the fast growing rate of urbanization globally, localizers must address the issue of how to go about restructuring the economy without infringing on people’s occupational aspirations and their preference for certain modes of living (rural or urban). In short, the presumed positive correlation between a descaled local economy and social justice is challenged throughout the article.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Global Justice Movement (GJM) or the Anti-Neoliberal Globalization Movement (ANGM)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0896920511411319">1</xref></sup> here refers to concerted collective efforts made by a global network of individuals and groups who oppose some or all aspects of neoliberal globalization that result in the removal of barriers to the movement of capital. The anti-neoliberal globalization movement (ANGM) contends that neoliberal measures such as free trade agreements, deregulation of global financial markets, and privatization of the commons produce adverse impacts on environment, biodiversity, workers and farmers’ rights, women, and democracy. Against the neoliberal measures, millions of people all over the world have taken to the streets to challenge the main power base of neoliberal globalization, namely, the World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and G8/G20.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0896920511411319">2</xref></sup> A direct result of this global contestation is the creation of the World Social Forum (WSF) and its regional variations such as the European Social Forums (ESFs) and Asian and African Social Forums, as well as its action-centred Social Movement Assembly. Certainly not limited to but mainly through these venues, global civil society groups have debated the root cause of the current economic and ecological crisis in pursuit of feasible alternatives to the existing global economic order.</p>
<p>Despite their common opposition to neoliberal globalization, however, ANGM is not a unified force. Its political demands are varied, complex and often contradictory. For instance, with the issue of WTO, some activists advocate reforming and working with the WTO while others call for complete abolition. Although scholars from various disciplines ranging from sociology to international relations have discussed various aspects of globalization, little attention has been paid to a systematic mapping of competing alternatives to neoliberal globalization. Not surprisingly, alternative models are discussed only within a few activist milieux and rarely trigger constructive criticisms or serious debates from academics. Some scholars have noted political tensions and ideological differences within the WSF. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0896920511411319">Pätomaki and Teivainen (2004)</xref> document tensions surrounding the future direction of the WSF. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0896920511411319">Van den Anker (2005)</xref> compares different approaches to international trade, one made by the United Nations Development Programme and the other by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Yet even when scholars discuss ANGM’s proposals for change, their focus is limited to only a small number of issues, such as free trade and third world debts, and they rarely deal with potentially divisive issues such as economies of scale, political devolution and property rights. Given the lack of systematic and comparative analysis of alternative economic models, this article attempts to fill a gap by mapping out diverse visions of an alternative economy. At the political level, it is also important to differentiate leftist responses from xenophobic right-wing populist approaches to neoliberal globalization. As shown in the recent elections and referenda in Europe, far-right political parties, although less than their left-wing counterparts, gained increasing support from the disgruntled populace of Europe. In order to arrive at a differentiated stance from the right-wing populist forces, it is also urgent to identify areas of similarity as well as difference between the two with regard to alternative policy proposals and their wider societal implications. This article is structured in the following manner. First, it gives an overview of varied economic models in ANGM as alternatives to neoliberal globalization. The overview is then followed by a critique with a special focus on problems with economic descaling, political devolution and small-scale technology favoured by many dissenters of globalization. The final section suggests broad frameworks within which activists and scholars can flesh out better alternatives.</p>

<sec id="section2-0896920511411319">
<title>Alternative Economic Models: An Overview</title>
<p>The following models of alternative economy are discernable in the publications of ANGM groups and their affiliate members:</p>
<list id="list1-0896920511411319" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><bold>Eco-capitalist Globalization model</bold>: This model is drawn from policy suggestions made by major trade unions like ETUC (European Trade Union Confederation), ILO (International Labour Organization), ICFTU (International Confederation of Free Trade Unions), International Trade Union Confederation (ICTU) and environmental and aid NGOs such as Green Peace, the Friends of the Earth, Oxfam and the International Fair Trade Organization.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Alternative Regionalism of Solidarity Economy model:</bold> The idea of building an alternative regional bloc of solidarity economy is being discussed among activist scholars associated with the Focus on the Global South, the Transnational Institute and the La Via Campesina.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Nation-state Centric Localization model</bold>: Key ideas of this model come from the International Forum on Globalization (IFG) and its member organizations such as the Polaris Institute (Canada), and the Council of Canadians (Canada) as well as many of the same environmental organizations associated with the eco-globalization camp.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>De-growth Subsistence Economy model</bold>: This camp houses various shades of radical greens including bioregionalists, spiritual eco-feminists, eco-socialists, eco-anarchists and autonomists who are steeped in the tradition of deep ecology.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>S<bold>ocialist Planning model:</bold> This model is based on the ideas of socialist organizations with Trotskyist pedigree.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Eco-socialist model</bold>: This model draws on the work of scholar activists associated with the International Eco-socialist Network.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Anarcho-communist model:</bold> This model is constructed based on ideas of anarchists associated with Bookchin’s social ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511411319">Bookchin, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920511411319">1995</xref>), Albert’s Participatory Economics and Fotopoulous’ Inclusive Democracy.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The boundary of the aforementioned categories is not always clear-cut since many activists can be cross-located in more than one economic model. To arrive at a more nuanced understanding of complexities concerning alternatives, I have first simplified divergent positions by accentuating differences and similarities based on some selected issues. For instance, the eco-capitalist globalization and the nation-state centric localization models share many policy alternatives and constituent organizations. Different nuances, however, exist. Eco-capitalist globalization stresses large-scale green technology and an equitable, eco-friendly global framework for international trade. The localization model stresses the utilization of local resources and small-scale green technology, while moving away from export-oriented production and international trade. In other words, the above models contain differing emphases on any of the following features of a future society: property ownership, eco-technology, economies of scale, the agency of coordination (the nation state, transnational institutions), the scope of the market and cross-border trade.</p>
<sec id="section3-0896920511411319">
<title>Equitable Eco-capitalist Globalization Model</title>
<p>Global trade unions and many regional labour organizations (ILO, ITUC, ETUC) suggest the creation of decent, green jobs as a solution to ecological crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0896920511411319">ILO, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0896920511411319">Lee CP, 2010</xref>). Green jobs involve developing and manufacturing products that save energy as well as products that make energy from renewable sources such as wind, solar, geothermal and hydropower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920511411319">Cleary and Kopicki, 2009</xref>). Concrete examples would include: ‘retrofitting buildings, expanding mass transits and freight rail, construction of smart energy grids and expanding production of wind power, solar power, and advanced biofuels’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0896920511411319">Pollin et al., 2009</xref>). Concerned that green jobs can be exploitive if not properly regulated, they therefore stress that a transition to a green economy must ensure the protection of workers’ rights with a binding global framework for protecting labour rights such as the inclusion of a ‘just transition’ clause in the UN framework on climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0896920511411319">ITUC, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Supporting the notion of ‘Green Jobs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0896920511411319">Lee CP, 2010</xref>: 124), major environmental NGOs like the Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and the Sierra Club work with trade unions. For instance, in 2008, trade unions, environmental groups, local governments and some businesses in the USA founded the ‘Apollo Alliance’, a blue-green coalition to develop a synergy to protect both jobs and environment<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0896920511411319">3</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0896920511411319">Lee CP, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511411319">Apollo Alliance, no date</xref>). The Canadian version of the Blue-Green Alliance movement is the Green Economy Network (GEN) that consists of major environmental groups and trade unions as well as social justice organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0896920511411319">4</xref></sup> The GEN advocates that the governments should encourage policy measures that favour public transit, public investments in renewable energy sources, green manufacturing, building retrofit and energy conservation programs.</p>
<p>To finance the transition to a green economy, many groups in this camp suggest a transaction fee on banks and financial institutions as a source for an eco-fund (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0896920511411319">ITUC, 2010</xref>). Organizations such as the Association of Transaction to Aid Citizens (ATTAC) campaign for the implementation of the Tobin Tax and the abolition of tax havens to stop speculative capital movement. ICTU hopes that the eco-fund will be used to ‘facilitate innovation, research and development of green technologies, technology transfer to developing countries and promote the development of social protection schemes and public services’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0896920511411319">ITUC, 2010</xref>: 2).</p>
<p>Oxfam and the International Fair Trade Association maintain that international trade can be beneficial to both developed and developing countries as long as it is properly regulated with enforceable agreements on environment protection and workers’ and farmers’ rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0896920511411319">O’Brien et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0896920511411319">Nicholls &amp; Opal, 2005</xref>). A new regulatory framework of international trade should have measures such as ‘social clause’ provisions,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0896920511411319">5</xref></sup> fair trade marketing, social labelling (green seals) and the adoption of a corporate code of conduct. The International Fair Trade Association campaigns for a ‘fair trade certified’ logo for coffee, tea and cocoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0896920511411319">O’Brien et al., 2000</xref>: 99). The ‘green seal’ program ensures that products follow environmental standards from production to disposable process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511411319">Broad, 2002</xref>: 133). Closely connected to the ‘fair trade’ movement are the ideas of ‘ethical business’ and the code of conduct. A number of NGOs argue that companies should adopt policies (the code of conduct) that require them to produce goods in a socially responsible manner. Taking this idea of ethical business further to a mandatory level, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0896920511411319">Monbiot (2003)</xref> suggests the creation of a Fair Trade Organization that has a coercive power to bring a company to the International Criminal Court if it violates rules concerning workers’ rights and environmental standards.</p>
<p>To aid the development of the poor countries, Oxfam suggests that developing countries must have free access to the markets in the North while they retain their rights to protect their budding national industries. This differential approach (free trade with the North and protectionism for the South) is justified on the grounds that in order to have a level playing field, developing countries need more time to catch up with the North until they are fully ready to compete in the international market. Likewise, Monbiot suggests an ‘International Clearing Union’ as an enforcement mechanism. It will ensure that developing countries enjoy export surplus for a certain time period until they are ready to compete on an equal footing, then the Union penalizes any country whose export exceeds its import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0896920511411319">2003</xref>: 238). It should be noted, however, that most trade unions in Europe and North America do not support the differential approach (free trade with the global North but protectionism for the South). Despite some internal disagreements, however, a common idea shared by people in the equitable globalization camp is that economic growth does not necessarily lead to environmental degradation. This ‘decoupling’ approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0896920511411319">Han, 2010</xref>: 99), delinking development from ecological destruction, is an important divide that separates this camp from other models that favour a descaled economy.</p>

<title>Alternative Regionalism Based on the Solidarity Economy Model</title>
<p>Alternative regionalism based on solidarity economy is promoted by the Focus on the Global South, the Transnational Institute (TNI) and La Via Campensina. People in this camp share many ideas with the eco-capitalist camp but they differ on the reformability of the existing global framework of governance. The Focus on the Global South believes that the existing international framework of governance via the IMF, the World Bank and the WTO are deeply flawed and biased toward free trade and unfettered movement of capital. At the same time, they see problems associated with existing regionalism (e.g. ASEAN, ASEAN–China Free Trade, among others) based on the ecologically destructive developmentalist model pursued by the elites of the Third World. Instead, they believe that the existing global and regional institutions should be replaced with alternative regional institutions that promote alternative regional centres of power based on ‘complementarity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0896920511411319">Focus, no date</xref>) and a regional network of solidarity economy. Examples of alternative regionalism of this sort would be the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA), Trade Treaty of the Peoples in Latin America and SAARC in South Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920511411319">Bello, 2009a</xref>). Considering ALBA and UNASUR (the Union of the Nations of South America) as positive examples for alternative South–South alliances, Dot Keet, a fellow researcher of TNI, hopes that an alternative regional bloc would provide necessary space and support for countries experimenting with ‘anti-globalist and anti-capitalist-or non-capitalist-alternatives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0896920511411319">Keet, 2010</xref>: 3). Bello lays out some key features of a solidarity economy. First of all, the new economy must encourage production for the domestic market rather than for export. Emphasis should be placed on ‘the quality of life’ rather than on economic growth. Secondly, under the new economic model, people should use trade and industrial measures (tariffs, quotas, subsidies) to protect the local economy against transnational corporations. Thirdly, with equitable redistribution of income and land, the property ownership should be ‘transformed into a “mixed economy” that includes community cooperatives, private enterprises, and state enterprises, and excludes transnational corporations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511411319">Bello, 2009b</xref>: 1–2). Finally, the new alternative economy must encourage the development of ‘environmentally congenial technology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511411319">Bello, 2009b</xref>: 2). Likewise, la Via Campensina, the world biggest peasant organization, rejects the use of large-scale bio-technology in agriculture. As to climate justice and emission reduction, people in this camp stress the notion of ecological debt and argue that there should be differential requirements for the developing and the developed countries. In short, people in this camp favour regionalism for a number of reasons. The most important one would be the belief that alternative regionalism based on South–South alliances can better challenge unequal North–South power relations embedded in the existing global framework of economic governance. For instance, measures such as regional development funds can help individual countries move away from their dependence on export to Northern markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511411319">Chavez, 2011</xref>: 2). At the moment, activist scholars explore ways in which countries can benefit from regional trade policies based on complementarity rather than profit maximization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920511411319">Bello, 2009a</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-0896920511411319">
<title>Nation-state Centric Localization Model</title>
<p>Activist scholars affiliated with the International Forum on Globalization (IFG) and the Institute for Local Self-reliance (ILSR) advocate localization (localism) measures. It should be noted that the first two economic models also support many of local protectionist measures. However, differences exist in the areas of technology, economies of scale and international trade. Major environmental groups (Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the Worldwide Fund for Nature) and Green parties are split between localization and eco-globalization. The Green parties of England and Wales, Ireland and South Africa broke with their European, German and US counterparts in supporting localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920511411319">Buckman, 2004</xref>). The New Progressive Party (<italic>Jinbo-shindang</italic>) and the Coop networks<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0896920511411319">6</xref></sup> in South Korea support the notion of green jobs and fair trade although the Coop movement stresses localizing practices such as community co-ops and LETS (Local Employment and Trading System), favoured in the nation-centred localization model. Similarly, the Friends of the Earth can be cross-located between the equitable globalization and the nation-centric localization model.</p>
<p>To sketch out the strategy of the nation-state centric localization, I analyzed the publications of the International Forum on Globalization (IFG), a think tank of anti-globalizers, along with the publications of its constituent groups and leading members. <italic>The Manifesto on Global Economic Transitions</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0896920511411319">Mander, 2007</xref>), the centrepiece of IFG strategy, holds that the root causes of environmental degradation are overproduction, consumerism and overpopulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0896920511411319">Mander, 2007</xref>). IFG’s alternatives, then, are informed by the principles of less production, less consumption and less population. IFG envisages an alternative society based on a ‘non-global, powered-down, pro-local’ economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0896920511411319">Mander, 2007</xref>:11).</p>
<p>The localization model argues that the current global economic order encourages an export-based economic growth that is harmful to the environment and the local economy. The export-oriented production, IFG scholars argue, necessitates environmentally destructive, large-scale energy and transportation infrastructures such as dams and fossil fuel plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0896920511411319">Norberg-Hodge et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, transformed into monoculture producers, local communities become disempowered as they become highly dependent on the vagaries of international markets. To reverse this trend, IFG scholars argue that we must return to local production (using local resources) for local consumption (local markets). For environmental reasons, cross-border trade should be discouraged and only those items that are not available locally, ‘some cash crops and minerals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0896920511411319">Hines, 2000</xref>: 242), will be allowed to be imported.</p>
<p>For the purpose of building a self-reliant local economy, the activists in this camp stress that the state should play a crucial role in creating new rules and legal frameworks to support localization. For instance, the state should impose tariffs and import quotas for selective protectionism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0896920511411319">Hines, 2000</xref>) and take measures such as ‘higher tax breaks for longer term investment in the local economy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0896920511411319">Hines, 2000</xref>: 95) and ‘performance requirements’ that force foreign companies to use ‘a given level of percentage of domestic content’ by using locally produced goods and employing local workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0896920511411319">Hines, 2000</xref>: 131). Other measures for local grounding of capital would include: ‘Site-here-to-sell-here policies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920511411319">Cavanagh and Mander, 2004</xref>: 83). To facilitate the reduction or near elimination of international trade, the localizers demand that the state should implement a new cost calculating system that ‘reflects the full costs of production, including a living wage and all environmental costs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0896920511411319">Norberg-Hodge et al., 2002</xref>: 264). This new pricing system will further discourage cross-border trade while encouraging local production.</p>
<p>As for technology, IFG members are sceptical of large-scale technology even if it is eco-friendly. Instead, they advocate ‘appropriate technology’ that is oriented toward small-scale production and capable of meeting energy needs of small communities. IFG believes that future energy policies should not favour mass production and urbanization but rather encourage ‘small scale, decentralized renewable energy infrastructures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0896920511411319">Norberg-Hodge et al., 2002</xref>: 264). Rejecting ‘technological fixes and market incentives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0896920511411319">Mander, 2007</xref>: 7) such as carbon trading, IFG calls for ‘less resource use, less consumption, more conservation’ (p. 8) based on ‘small scale renewable energy systems’ (p. 12). As for environmental measures at a global level, the IFG calls for a ‘contraction and convergence’ mechanism in which developed countries reduce their production and consumption level while poor countries are exempt from economic contraction ‘until convergence or equity’ (p. 14) is reached ‘within realistic planetary limits and at an agreed global standard of “sufficiency” for all’ (p. 15).</p>
<p>At the individual and community level, advocates of localization encourage citizens to buy local goods and invest in local economies. For instance, citizens are encouraged to use farmers’ markets and local food co-ops instead of transnational food and retail outlets. They are advised to use community banks and local economic transactions such as the Local Employment and Trading Systems (LETS) in which people use community tokens, instead of the official state currency, to trade goods and services<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0896920511411319">7</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0896920511411319">Norberg-Hodge et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920511411319">Cavanagh and Mander, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0896920511411319">Hines, 2000</xref>). Like IFG, the institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR), a Minnesota based think tank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ilsr.org">www.ilsr.org</ext-link>), proposes a set of rules that foster ‘humanly scaled politics and economics’ (www.newrules.org/agriculture).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0896920511411319">
<title>De-growth Subsistence Economy Model</title>
<p>Groups and individuals who are steeped in deep-ecology,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0896920511411319">8</xref></sup> eco-feminism,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0896920511411319">9</xref></sup> eco-socialism and autonomism<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0896920511411319">10</xref></sup> tend to advocate a post-capitalist society based on a de-growth subsistence economy. Like those who favour the nation-state centric localization model, they also believe that overproduction, overconsumption and overpopulation are responsible for the ecological crisis. Like the former, they too stress the importance of small-scale agriculture, local production for local consumption, and participatory democracy in local communities. The degrowth model, however, goes even further with economic descaling and political devolution. Arguing that ‘large-scale economic and political structures are both inherently dehumanizing and deadly to nature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0896920511411319">Lewis, 1992</xref>: 82), the proponents of the degrowth model believe that self-reliant small communities <italic>without</italic> repressive state apparatuses should be the main locus for an ecological and just society. They are federalist and autonomist in their political orientation. As for economy, they reject all development and growth-oriented strategies including eco-friendly productivist ideas of ‘<italic>alternative</italic> growth and <italic>alternative</italic> development’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0896920511411319">Latouche, 2009</xref>: 89). They advise peoples in the developed capitalist countries to de-develop by reducing their material consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0896920511411319">Lewis, 1992</xref>). As for peoples in the South, they suggest that they ‘simply bypass industrialism’ and go back to a subsistence economy based on ‘the rural production of craft goods’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0896920511411319">Lewis, 1992</xref>: 194).</p>
<p>Shunning a society based on large-scale industrial production, eco-feminists like d’Eaubonne envisage a society where production is self-managed by ‘small groups overseeing a small grouping of means of production belonging to a reduced and miniaturized industry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0896920511411319">d’Eaubonne, 1990</xref>). Sakar, an eco-socialist, makes a similar argument that economies must contract to the point that people can directly participate in all aspects of decision-making in regard to economic matters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0896920511411319">Sakar, 1999</xref>). Simultaneously, polities must devolve into small entities to allow a face-to-face participatory democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0896920511411319">Sakar, 1999</xref>). As an eco-socialist, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0896920511411319">Magdoff (2010)</xref> envisages that an ecological society should strive to be self-sufficient in regard to ‘food, water, housing and energy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0896920511411319">Magdoff, 2010</xref>: 17) and that it should use ‘relatively small-scale local forms of renewable energy’ (p. 17). He further states that an ecological society should ‘stop growing when basic human needs are satisfied’ (p. 16) and that ‘self-sufficiency’ should be one of the crucial elements of ‘ecological civilization’ (p. 16). Autonomists like Starr and Adams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0896920511411319">2003</xref>: 39) hold that a federated system of autonomous local communities or self-sufficient ‘bio-regions’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0896920511411319">11</xref></sup> would spontaneously emerge ‘through the peaceful interactions of autonomous villages’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0896920511411319">Lewis, 1992</xref>: 86). In short, similar to the nation-centric localization model but going even further, the degrowth model regards economic descaling and political devolution as prescriptions for negative ecological and social effects of industrialism and neoliberal globalization.</p>
<p>Envisioning essential elements of an alternative society, many who disapprove of neoliberal globalization categorically reject the viability of capitalist reform to serve humane purposes. It is argued that the market system, even if ‘ethically’ regulated, is ‘irrational, archaic, driven by an insatiable greed for profits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0896920511411319">CWI, 2009</xref>). As long as the prerogatives of capitalism (production for profit) are allowed to operate, it is inevitable that institutions will serve the interest of capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511411319">Callinicos, 2001</xref>). On this ground, anti-capitalist dissenters call for the elimination of private property ownership and the free market. The remaining three models of alternative society are anti-capitalist. They stress the elements of planning and communal ownership of the means of production as crucial ingredients for building a just and sustainable society. Although there seems to be a consensus around the need to build a planned economy based on the social ownership of the means of production, there are different ideas about how to manage it. The following section of the article discusses the three variants of the coordinated planning model: socialist, anarcho-communist and eco-socialist.</p>

<sec id="section7-0896920511411319">
<title>Socialist Planning Model</title>
<p>Today’s socialists criticize the central state planning model of the former USSR and Eastern Europe. Instead, they propose a coordinated planning model that leaves more room for grass-roots participatory democracy. Though contemporary socialist and communist groups are vociferous about the need to create an alternative society, they tend to leave the blueprints or general outlines of the alternative society unexplained. Most socialists believe that concrete forms of alternative institutions and new rules will emerge from contentious interactions between political forces and that drawing up a blueprint based on an unknown future or the ‘circumstances we cannot know until we are part of that active process’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920511411319">Barker, 2001</xref>: 331) is a pointless mental exercise. An exception to this general, anti-prescriptive trend is the work of Pat Devine and Alex Callinicos.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511411319"><italic>An Anti-Capitalist Manifesto</italic> (2003)</xref>, Alex Callinicos, a leading figure of Britain’s Socialist Workers Party (SWP), supports Pat Devine’s ‘negotiated planning (NC) model’. In a NC model, representatives of the workers, consumers and advocacy groups negotiate the <italic>whats</italic> and <italic>hows</italic> of production through various institutional venues including peoples’ assemblies, production units (workers’ councils), planning commissions, negotiated coordination bodies, and governments at all levels (local, regional and national). The planning commissions draw up economic plans in consultation with all sectors (workers, consumers, suppliers and concerned interest groups) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511411319">Callinicos, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511411319">Devine, 1988</xref>). Economies of scale and the perceived effects on society (such as savings in labour, energy and money) determine the scope of negotiation and mandates of production and negotiating units. For instance, national production units provide services such as communications, energy and any production that is too large to be handled by regional units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511411319">Devine, 1988</xref>). Small-scale local activity, including ‘maintenance and repair services, professional services, cafes and restaurants, arts and crafts, music and recreation, alternative medicine and personal growth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511411319">Devine, 1988</xref>: 229) is exempt from planning because it is too time consuming to plan such small-scale activities. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511411319">Callinicos (2003)</xref> believes that the scope of small enterprises can be democratically negotiated. In a NC model, public expenditures are supported through taxation measures. For instance, the national negotiated coordination body takes a portion of wages and prices to finance social investment and public expenditure; so too do the local and regional NC bodies for minor investments. As to ecological justice, Callinicos argues that since market prices do not adequately measure the real social and environmental costs, the state should set the broad parameters for prices after taking into consideration factors such as the production costs, the surplus for future investment and environmental costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511411319">2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Anarcho-communist Model</title>
<p>Activists in the tradition of anarcho-communism<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0896920511411319">12</xref></sup> seek to build a moneyless and stateless cooperative economy based on communal ownership and workers’ self-management. Under the rubric of anarcho-communism, this article discusses only the ideas of anarchists associated with Social Ecology (Murray Bookchin), Parecon (Michael Albert), and Inclusive Democracy (Fotopoulous). Anarchist alternatives overlap with the degrowth economy model in many areas (de-growth, localism, small-scale technology). The main differences would be that anarcho-communists favour organizations such as workers’ co-ops, workers’ councils, and community assemblies and that they emphasize the element of planning, albeit decentralized, while disparaging the market activity.</p>
<p>Social ecology anarchists, like Murray Bookchin, envision a society of eco-municipalism, made up of self-managed, ecologically sustainable small communes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0896920511411319">Latouche, 2009</xref>) where direct democracy, instead of representative democracy, rules all decision-making over all communal affairs. Anarchists affiliated with Bookchin’s Institute for Social Ecology (ISE)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0896920511411319">13</xref></sup> propose that workers’ councils administer production but ‘local assemblies of all residents (in cities at the neighbourhood level and in rural areas at the township level)’ make a final decision as to economic policy (ISE, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.social-ecology.org">http://www.social-ecology.org</ext-link>).</p>
<p>In <italic>Parecon: Life after Capitalism</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511411319">2003</xref>), Michael Albert, a member of World Social Forum’s International Council, envisages a Participatory Economic (thereafter Parecon) model based on communal ownership of the means of production and worker and consumer councils. In the Parecon model, decisions about collective consumption and budget allocations to each council member are made through a referendum of all community members. Parecon will be built on the basis of a political system of ‘nestled councils’ that combine face-to face decision-making in a lower council with consultation and limited decision-making by delegates in a higher-level council. Important decisions are made primarily by the workers and consumers’ councils in local communities.</p>
<p>Similar to Albert’s Parecon is Fotopolous’s Inclusive Democracy (ID) model. In the Inclusive Democracy model, the means of production belong to each community (demos) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0896920511411319">Fotopoulos, 2005</xref>). In the ID model, everybody has to work for a minimum number of hours to meet citizens’ basic needs that would be identified through demotic assemblies. For non-basic needs, people work extra hours if they wish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0896920511411319">Fotopoulos, 2005</xref>). The economic planning involves a feedback process between assemblies of workplace and demos. Fotopoulos believes that any form of ‘statist’ democracy (representative or parliamentary ‘democracy’, etc.) is undemocratic in the sense that it separates society from polity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0896920511411319">2005</xref>: 293). To be truly democratic, the ultimate policy-making decision body in each self-reliant community should be the demotic assembly. He envisions that communities (the demoi) should be co-ordinated through regional and confederated administrative councils of mandated, recallable and rotating delegates. To counter the shortcoming of planning such as a lack of competition and poor consumers’ choices, Fotopoulos proposes an artificial market where anyone can start a demotic enterprise (i.e. an enterprise owned and controlled by the demos), as long as their proposal for production is approved by the demotic assembly. In the ID system, the incentive for competition is not monetary but ‘the moral satisfaction’ that producers would feel if their work is appreciated by consumers. How does he know this? Like many anarchists who believe mutualism or altruism are essential to human nature, he claims that people would not be egoistic free riders in a future society.</p>

<title>Eco-socialist Planning Model</title>
<p>Despite socialists’ call for the eco-pricing system and the development of renewal energy, the socialist planning model (if advocated by Leninist-Trotskyist groups like SWP) is not so popular among greens who are suspicious of the developmentalist and productivist ideology of Marxism. Against this background, a red-green coalition, aka eco-socialists, has emerged. Eco-socialists reject ‘productivist socialism’ which stresses industrialization and economic growth. Some prominent eco-socialists such as Joel Kovel, Michael Löwy, Derek Wall and Ian Angus founded the Ecosocialist International Network (EIN) in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0896920511411319">Löwy, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the differing stance on economic growth, the eco-socialist planning model significantly overlaps with the socialist planning model. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0896920511411319">Kovel (2002)</xref>, a leading figure of EIN, envisions a future society very similar to the SWP’s NC model. One minor difference would be Kovel’s emphasis on workers’ co-operatives as the political and economic unit of society. For the need to coordinate economic activities of various regions, the workers’ co-ops will send delegations to regional, state, national and international bodies which have executive councils with rotating leadership, recallable by votes from the level below. These central assemblies coordinate ‘social activities, the provision of society-wide services like rail systems, the allocation of resources, the reinvestment of the social product, and the harmonization of relations between regions at all levels, including the international’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0896920511411319">Kovel, 2002</xref>: 244). In fact, the central assemblies would perform a ‘state-like function’ (p. 244). As for a small scale business, Kovel argues that they may hire wage workers but this situation would be only temporary and no profitable exploitation of labour would be allowed (p. 245).</p>
<p>To summarize, except socialists and eco-globalizers, many dissenters of globalization converge on the idea of economic descaling (reduction of production and consumption) and the primacy of decisions taken at the level of decentralized local/communities (political devolution). As for the agency of transformative power, some groups stress the role of the state and global (or regional) institutions, while others (radical greens, anarchists and eco-socialists) prioritize small local communities. As to scales of economy, many groups call for a combination of small and large scale production to complement each other, while eco-centric groups tend to favour a radically descaled, self-reliant local economy.</p>

<title>Limitations of Alternative Models: A Critique</title>

<title>Eco-capitalism: Free from the Economic Crisis Inherent in Capitalism?</title>
<p>Many critics of globalization believe that economic expansion, regardless of resource regimes, is ecologically unsustainable. They presuppose a mutually exclusive, destructive relationship between economic growth and the use of natural resources. But as an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) demonstrates, environmental quality improves with the use of better production technology. Some environmentalists argue that with technological developments, we need fewer primary resources to produce goods and services while expanding the range of recyclable goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0896920511411319">Field and Olewiler, 2005</xref>). If so, economic growth can be de-linked from the use of non-renewable energy and waste. Indeed, the eco-capitalist globalization model is premised on the notion of decoupling economic growth from ecological degradation.</p>
<p>Although the proponents of eco-capitalist globalization are optimistic about green growth, they fail to address its limit under capitalism. Many critiques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0896920511411319">Lee CP, 2010</xref>) doubt that even the eco-capitalist economy will escape from the boom and bust cycle inherent in capitalism. Indeed, the trade union component of ANGM never addresses the issue of the cyclic crisis of capitalism (competition-induced overproduction followed by economic recession and mass unemployment). The Apollo Alliance or the Just Transition is a case in point. The Apollo Alliance, a blue-green alliance, stresses the need to protect domestic jobs in order to export green energy products. American trade unionists, complaining about overseas outsourcing of the manufacturing of American wind turbines and solar panels, demand that American workers manufacture them so that they can expand American share of green products exports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511411319">Apollo Alliance, no date</xref>). As demonstrated above, trade unions in the developed countries are concerned predominantly with expanding their countries’ export shares and thus expanding the number of their national jobs. If countries all seek an export advantage, international trade is going to be a zero-sum game. Eco-globalization, as long as it stays within the framework of capitalism, will eventually lead to inequitable globalization. With this problem in mind, the global trade unions as well as regional labour organizations should seriously consider Monbiot’s suggestion for the International Clearing Union or Oxfam’s suggestion for the differential trade policy for the global South.</p>

<title>Localization and Self-sufficiency: Anti-immigration and Trade Protectionism of the Rich in the Name of ‘Local’?</title>
<p>According to Heins, ‘the term “local” mainly applies to part of a nation but can also apply to a whole nation or even, on occasion, to a regional grouping of nations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920511411319">Buckman, 2004</xref>: 153). In so far as localization is applied to agricultural products, this may have positive impacts on the environment and the livelihood and cultures of small-farming communities. Given the fact that heavily subsidized agricultural products of Europe and North America have devastated agriculture in the global South (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0896920511411319">Liu, 2005</xref>), agricultural localism may be a means of protecting small farmers in the South. Localization, however, depending on who is applying it to which economic sector, may have negative consequences for the movement of people and cultural diversity. In other words, localization measures, if applied to all areas of goods and services in the rich countries, may signify trade protectionism and anti-immigration policies of the rich.</p>
<p>The nation-state centric localizers tend to be silent on the issue of immigration and the movement of people while clearly opposing the movement of goods and capital from an ecological viewpoint. With a notable silence on the issue of population and the movement of people, anti-globalizers inadvertently provide an ecological cover for xenophobic populist politics centred on anti-immigration and trade protectionism. Today’s right-wing groups use an ecological argument that the relationship between population and resources is strained by increasing numbers of immigrants beyond ‘the carrying capacity of regions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920511411319">Bandarage, 2008</xref>). Far right-wing organizations that advocate strict immigration control for environmental reasons include: the British National Party (BNP), the Carrying Capacity Network (USA), the American Immigration Control Foundation (USA) and the Independent Ecology Movement (France) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0896920511411319">Wall, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0896920511411319">CWPE, 2006</xref>). It is noted that they draw on the ideas of right-wing environmentalists such as Edward Goldsmith (UK), Jonathon Porritt (UK) and Antoine Waechter (France), as well as the ideologue of the New Right movement, Alain de Benoist (France).</p>
<p>The Carrying Capacity Network (CCN) argues that a reduction of the number of immigrants to the USA is necessary to ensure ‘economic sustainability and resource conservation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920511411319">CCN, 2011a</xref>: 1) and ‘community self-reliance, tradition and national unity’. Blaming immigrants for a whole range of issues from deteriorating social services to unemployment, CCN argues that ‘American workers suffer $133 billion in wage losses resulting from immigrant competition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511411319">CCN, 2011b</xref>: 1) and that ‘mass immigration results in the displacement of almost 2 million U.S. workers from their jobs annually’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920511411319">CCN, 2011c</xref>: 1). It should be noted that the Foundation for Deep Ecology, one of organizations that financially supported the project of the International Forum on Globalization to develop alternative frameworks on global economy, has also founded the Coalition for United States Population Stabilization (CUSPS) that advocate a reduction in immigration and birth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0896920511411319">CWPE, 2006</xref>). The Foundation for Deep Ecology also donated $10,000 each to Carrying Capacity Network and Negative Population Growth, anti-immigration organizations in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0896920511411319">CWPE, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Like the CCN, the British National Party (BNP) argues that overpopulation via immigration leads to a host of social and ecological problems. Posing as anti-globalizers, BNP members criticize economic exploitation by transnational corporations and, as a solution, demand control of local economies by ensuring local ownership (British ownership), the use of local resources (British workers instead of foreign workers), and the reduction of foreign imports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511411319">BNP, 2010a</xref>). The BNP also advocate tax measures to penalize off-shore outsourcing companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511411319">BNP, 2010a</xref>). It demands the imposition of ‘a bulk transport tax regime that pushes supermarkets to supply more local and seasonal produce’ and ‘the encouragement of organic and low fossil fuel farming techniques’. In short, the BNP argues that it is Britain’s ‘only true Green party’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920511411319">BNP, 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>It should be underlined that the left wing of the international ecology movement does not support the xenophobic policies of the far right-wing movement. Instead of focusing on immigration, they seek to draw attention to the issues of overconsumption and unequal resource distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0896920511411319">Smith, 2003</xref>). The root cause of the ecological crisis, they argue, comes from the systematic over-consumption of the industrialized world. As long as resources are unevenly distributed among the global population, migration at a global level can not be stopped. Although the stance of the mainstream ecology movement appears to be a more balanced view, they still evade the issue of the movement of people. Are they in favour of an open border policy? If not, to what extent should the movement of people be controlled?</p>
<p>As to the trade protectionism of the rich, localism does not necessarily mean national protectionism. In fact, many leftist opponents of neoliberal globalization use the term ‘local’ to signify autonomous space free from the constraints of the pro-capitalist state and national boundaries. The concept of local, and/or a bioregion, however, is too vague to be used as a unit of governance. What are the boundaries of a bioregion? How will a bioregional federation of autonomous communities sustain themselves and meet challenges arising from a transitional dual-power situation in which the nation-state is still a major political authority in resource governance. What can be the future forms of bioregions? Are they institutionalized systems of governance that would eventually replace the nation-state as an ultimate political authority in resource governance? If <italic>Another World</italic> is supposed to transcend a nation state in terms of an ultimate territorial boundary, bio-regionalists must explain how to deal with age-old traditions and sentiments of nationalism that bind people to their own particular ‘imagined community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920511411319">Anderson 1983</xref>), rather than a particular eco-region.</p>
<p>Although advocates of a degrowth society deny that autarky is their ideal, in reality, that is what their proposals boil down to if we follow the prescription that each locality must produce its own necessities while eliminating international trade, except a few scarce natural products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0896920511411319">Lewis, 1992</xref>). And what does localization mean for countries lacking resources (natural, financial, technological)? How can resource-deprived countries become self-reliant and self-sufficient? And what does self-reliance mean? Does it entail producing almost everything from an aircraft to Kimbob (Korean seaweed rice rolls) without importing necessary raw materials? If it is necessary to import certain raw materials, what can be done to reciprocate in return? Given the fact that international trade has been around for many millennia and has shaped our cultures as they currently exist, it is unreasonable to expect that people should radically alter their lifestyle within the natural limit of the existing national (local) resources.</p>

<title>LETS: Right-wing Libertarian Objection to Taxation and Common Goods?</title>
<p>Many in ANGM support the Local Employment and Trading System (LETS) as a means for creating a moneyless, cooperative community. Contrary to the goal, LETS may be the system for individualistic libertarians who reject any form of taxation. In many countries, the maintenance of certain common goods (e.g. education, health, public utilities) is financed by the state fund through both direct and indirect taxation (e.g. income tax, value added tax, goods and sales tax). The elimination of taxation may have profound negative implications for society. For one, the vital services may not be available in an economy based solely on the LETS system. One can perfectly envisage a situation where teachers provide educational services and in return earn community tokens (tax free local money). But would there be community tokens available for children, elderly and disabled people whose economic participation is limited or non-existent? Would parents with dependent children and/or elderly people be given extra community tokens as the recognition that they provide vital community building services by raising children and looking after the sick and the old? Through taxation, most governments provide some support, although far too insufficient, to those mentioned above. The issue of taxation also relates to resources necessary for the maintenance of public infrastructure and safety. Can a LETS system support large-scale construction projects (roads, railways and public transportation system) and R&amp;D projects for technological upgrade without resorting to some form of taxation? The bottom line is that those romanticizing LETS would have to seriously think about these implications if LETS were to be the governing mode of economic transaction.</p>

<title>Economic Descaling and Political Devolution: Anti-urbanism, Anti-technology, and the Barrier to Global Justice?</title>
<p>Many dissenters of globalization argue that ecological sustainability and justice require a descaled and decentralized economy. The presumed positive correlation between the two (a small-scale economy and justice) is not empirically well grounded. There is little convincing evidence that small-scale production fosters greater economic equality and eco-responsible practices. Small enterprises can be just as exploitive and ecologically damaging as large-scale centralized ones. Constrained by financial resources to adopt expensive eco-technologies and to provide decent employment benefits (shorter working hours and longer paid holidays), small enterprises may resort to measures to cut costs. Likewise, decentralized and descaled economic communities may not have the resources and infrastructures to adopt eco-friendly technologies, let alone to fund the development of such technologies.</p>
<p>Large-scale, cutting edge eco-technologies including hydrogen technology<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0896920511411319">15</xref></sup> require a huge amount of R&amp;D expenses and public investment in building appropriate infrastructures; it is not difficult to foresee that a small community could not afford to carrying out expensive R&amp;D projects. Most localizers favour so-called ‘appropriate technology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0896920511411319">Lewis, 1992</xref>: 84) that does not require a centralization of authority because it is small-scale. ‘Appropriate’ technology may work for small towns but will not be sufficient to meet the energy and food needs of the large urban populace.</p>
<p>Relating to the aversion to large-scale and centralized endeavours (from production to political structures) is the issue of apparent anti-urbanism. It is not clear how cities, highly dependent on agricultural goods from rural areas, are supposed to restructure themselves to become self-sufficient units. This relates to the question of large-scale urban provisioning. Large cities with double digit millions of inhabitants can not adequately obtain all necessary food from urban gardens and community-supported agricultures. Countries with a high rate of urbanization and low employment in the agricultural sector may find that small-scale farming practices are grossly insufficient to feed urban workers and their families unless people are either forced or persuaded to return to a rural life. Let’s take South Korea, for example, to underline the critical importance of urban provisioning. As of 2005, 32.3 million out of the total 47 million people in South Korea live in urban areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0896920511411319">Kim, 2010</xref>: 114; 117). Only 13.9% of the total labour force in South Korea participate in the agricultural, forest or fishery industries. The manufacturing sector accounts for 24.0% of the labour force and the rest are engaged in the managerial, service, sales sectors as of 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920511411319">Lee SH, 2005</xref>: 202). Unless there is a radical restructuring of the composition of the labour force as well as restrictions on people’s movement, localization is grossly insufficient to deal with the basic needs of the urban population in South Korea. Related to this point is also the issue of one’s preference for an urban lifestyle. Unless the movement of people is seriously restricted along with people’s occupational choices, we have to find ways to provide agricultural goods to the urban populace.</p>
<p>According to localization advocates, cross-border trade should be discouraged in favour of local production and a new cost-calculating system should be put in place to ‘reflect the full costs of production, including a living wage and all environmental costs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0896920511411319">Norberg-Hodge et al., 2002</xref>: 264). This proposition contradicts their penchant for political devolution. To make the new calculating system viable and binding, there will be a need for an instrument of global governance that is powerful enough to enforce the new rules so that corporations do not take an advantage of countries that do not follow the new eco-calculating system. Otherwise, a decentralized power structure in this case may pose a barrier to a global justice.</p>

<title>Reducing Consumption: Toward an Eco-ascetic Society?</title>
<p>Many in the ANGM believe that the consumerist culture of capitalism contributes to ecological destruction. As eco-feminists, Sydee and Beder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0896920511411319">2001</xref>: 300) state:<disp-quote>
<p>In order to sell its products, capitalists feed on profitable aspects of patriarchal domination. The underlying drive of these magazines is consumerism – they tap into patriarchal behaviour as a selling point. Beauty is narrowly defined and fetishised in order to sell products, and the early sexualisation of girls is promoted to expand markets, both in readership and products.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Likewise, Magdoff, a Marxist scholar, views capitalism to be incompatible with ‘ecological civilization’ due to capitalism’s inherent tendency to promote ‘consumption beyond human needs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0896920511411319">Magdoff, 2010</xref>: 14). Anti-capitalist dissenters in ANGM seem to converge on the idea that an ecological and just society must address the problem of overconsumption. To reduce wasteful consumption, some suggest that society should find ways to reduce the consumption of non-essential goods and services. For instance, a deep ecologist, Latouche, proposes that there should be a distinction between consumerist mass tourism and legitimate educational tours. Similarly, some socialists (the Fourth International) advocate a carbon rationing system that limits individuals’ air travel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0896920511411319">International Viewpoint, 2007</xref>). A critical question, however, that needs to be addressed is <italic>who</italic> is to decide what is essential and what is not. Today, drinking coffee might be a basic necessity for many while others consider coffee as a non-essential good. Various religious practices are essential metaphysical needs for some, but non-essential for others. Cosmetics and varying types of tight-fitting clothes are patriarchal products for some, but self-indulging aesthetic needs for others. What happens when individuals disagree with ‘society’ (embodied in community councils, communes, or workers and consumers councils in alternative society models) on the evaluation of their needs? Would there be a possibility for ‘non-essential’ goods to be available? Would ‘society’ stigmatize those who seek non-essential (bourgeois, consumerist) needs? Would there be a sort of ‘Cultural Revolution’ against capitalist consumerism?</p>
<p>From deep ecologists to anarcho-communists, there seems to be a general inclination toward a hyper-ethical, ascetic society, revealed in their almost religious preaching about the need to reduce consumption and minimize human desires. It is relatively non-contentious to state that many human wants have been artificially created and manufactured by capitalist advertising. But to find ways to separate essential needs from non-essential ones is highly problematic. Even if we agree on essential needs, they come in varying shapes and sizes. Think about numerous types of food, clothes and housing. Democratic votes would be unsuitable for identifying them because the issue here is about people’s preferences, their taste. As Nove considers the popular vote on consumption needs, he raises the following question:<disp-quote>
<p>What of minority rights in matters of consumption? Is it proper for the citizens of a town or a country to vote by a 3–1 majority in favour of <italic>not</italic> providing anything – from string quartets to pumpernickel – which happens to be a minority taste? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0896920511411319">Nove, 1983</xref>: 225)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Who has the right to judge the intensity of one’s desire in a way to deem that desire essential or non-essential? The shaming culture of material goods in pursuit of some higher spiritual need (therefore essential?) may be popular in many religious circles but I wonder whether this is the same path leading to a very anti-cultural ‘Cultural Revolution’ of the sort. In this sense, I fully agree with Nove as he put it: ‘There is not and cannot be anything anti-socialist in the notion that the citizens should seek to satisfy their varied needs and tastes to the fullest extent consistent with the productive capacity of society and the welfare of their fellow citizens (i.e. avoiding pollution and other species of external diseconomies)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0896920511411319">1983</xref>: 225).</p>

<title>Planning versus the Market: A False Dilemma?</title>
<p>Proponents of a planned economy argue that we need to produce for social (or human) needs instead of profits. But this assertion requires further explanation as to how this can be achieved. As Nove put it, ‘dogmatists’ or ‘fundamentalist-millenarians’ evade practical challenges arising from the complexity of planning by invoking a ‘non-existent species of direct economic-political democracy, in which “society” decides’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0896920511411319">Nove, 1983</xref>: 226). Democratic votes or referendums can be utilized to determine broad societal priorities of using economic resources. But this type of democratic planning is different from people’s vote or referendum to decide the numbers and types of clothes. Since millions of goods and services exist in varying shapes and colours, incorporating microeconomic consumer choice through a political voting process is not only impracticable but also undesirable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0896920511411319">Nove, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>Eco-socialists criticize capitalism for being inherently wasteful because capitalism has an inherent tendency to overproduce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0896920511411319">Pepper, 2010</xref>). Unless there is only one type of goods and services available, however, overproduction of certain goods and services (thus some waste) may be inevitable to some extent if we were to allow consumer choices. As Nove explains:<disp-quote>
<p>The more choice there is, the less the predictability. The less choice, the less waste. How can the user influence what is produced, in detail, in a planned economy? This is <italic>not</italic> a simple question. By ‘detail’ I mean not ‘footwear’, but the shoes one actually wants, not ‘food’, but a dish one prefers. Plans are aggregated, they have to be, to reduce to a ‘manageable’ number. Needs are specific. An aspect of choice is <italic>competition</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0896920511411319">1983</xref>: 41)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is not feasible to plan products like clothes, cosmetics, household utensils, office suppliers, etc. that come in millions of variants. If we were to disregard people’s tastes and preferences (use value), people would be forced to wear only a few limited varieties of clothes and use equally limited selections of goods and services. The market plays, in this regard, the role of matching people’s varied tastes with actual products. Competition is simultaneously wasteful and innovative. It is innovative because it enables people to meet their needs in a variety of ways and this spurs creative innovations. Competition, however, is wasteful since it may duplicate production efforts. To counter the shortcoming of competition, Nove proposes a mixture between planning and market as an ‘ingredient of any feasible or tolerable socialist economy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0896920511411319">1983</xref>: 43). Seen in this light, a perceived choice between the market (production for profits) and planning (production for social needs) is a false dilemma since the market activity can also be planned through various mechanisms (taxation, environmental regulations, labour laws, government subsidies, etc.). Which one is preferred in certain situations depends on the effects of economies of scale. As Nove put it,<disp-quote>
<p>Everyone benefits from large-scale generation of electricity, it would be idiotic to decree that every household fetch water from well, or that pipelines be condemned as inappropriate labour-saving technology: if large scale offers only a modest savings in costs, one’s predisposition should be to opt for small scale. The choice must depend on whether shortage of labour or unemployment is the main problem, and whether the labour that is saved is agreeable or disagreeable, skilled or repetitively boring. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0896920511411319">1983</xref>: 200)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Dogmatic opposition to the market goes hand in hand with the refusal to see foreseeable challenges stemming from the complex relationship between economies of scale and diverse forms of democracy. Complexity of planning, especially in large-scale economies, requires not only specialists with technical knowledge but also ‘a line of command, responsibility and authority (i.e., a hierarchy)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0896920511411319">Nove, 1983</xref>: 33–35; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0896920511411319">Lewis, 1969</xref>). It is also foreseeable that decisions concerning environment, technology and societal infrastructure have to be co-ordinated at multi-levels. The multi-level co-ordination work may not be feasible under the system of direct democracy but works better with an elaborate administrative body and organs of representative democracy. Undesirable things, whatever their names are, do not simply disappear just because we wish them to vanish. As Nove put it, we should not ‘build an economic system on the assumption of high-minded altruism; no more than should we assume that no one would wish to abuse authority’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0896920511411319">1983</xref>: 206). As long as socio-economic conditions necessitating coordination and competition exist, a state-like organization and a market-like venue will remain, even if we call them by different names (a federated assembly instead of the state, or ‘artificial’ market as opposed to a ‘real’ market).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article examined diverse models of an alternative economy and rendered criticisms to some selected approaches. The equitable eco-capitalist globalization model makes two major policy changes: public investment in the green economy and a global framework that can ethically and ecologically regulate a global capitalist economy. The alternative regionalism model sees a better chance of success for the global South if likeminded governments form an economic bloc to protect local economies. The nation-state centric localization model rejects the use of large-scale technology geared toward mass production and urbanism. For ecological reasons, it promotes localism (local production using local resources for local consumption). The remaining three models (socialist, anarchist and eco-socialist) stress the elements of planning and communal ownership of the means of production. Pointing out a number of shortcomings associated with the alternatives above, the author calls for a further examination of and debates on the issues identified in the second part of the article. Furthermore, in order to avoid the shortcomings of the existing models, future discussions about alternatives should take the following issues into consideration. They certainly do not constitute an exhaustive list but rather represent some key issues that many leftist dissenters have so far failed to address clearly.</p>
<list id="list2-0896920511411319" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><bold>Technology:</bold> Since small-scale eco-technologies and small farming may not be sufficient to satisfy the energy and food needs of the urban populace, what should be an ‘appropriate’ scale of eco-technology and farming practice for the large urban population? Some scholars argue that given adverse impacts of large-scale eco-technologies, a mixture of varying scales of technology is preferred. If agreed, then what guiding principles should determine people’s choice of appropriate scale of technology?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Global Inequality:</bold> Since the poor countries spend a large portion of GNP on importing technology (paying royalty on patents), any global framework on climate change must take into account the tools necessary for a country to reduce emissions. How can we make large-scale eco-technology freely available to the poor countries? How can we ensure that freely available technology does not dampen financial and intellectual incentives that foster scientific innovation?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Capitalism:</bold> How can people avoid the cyclic economic crisis of capitalism (excessive competition driving overproduction and economic downturn)? If anti-capitalist alternatives are preferred, then how can people plan the <italic>whats</italic> and <italic>hows</italic> of production with least waste and overproduction but most choices? Should people plan the scope and contents of international trade so that a country’s import–export ratio is equitably and ecologically balanced?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Immigration and Citizenship:</bold> Should the movement of people be restricted? If so, on what basis? On what basis and under what forms of democracy (direct or representative) should people be given political membership and thereby exercise their citizenship rights and responsibilities?</p></list-item></list>
<p>The objective of this article was to pique people’s interest in various responses to neoliberal globalization and to further provoke constructive criticisms of the alternatives so that better policy suggestions can be formulated. The challenge of the anti-neoliberal globalization movement should be more than just ‘to criticise society and imagine a blissful alternative’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0896920511411319">Lewis, 1969</xref>: 250). It should be also about suggesting realistic plans and strategies for building a just and ecological society for as many people as possible, including those who prefer an urban mode of living and those who do not wish to spend all of their time devising production plans for their consumption needs.</p>

<p>Throughout this article, I will use GJM and ANGM interchangeably. It should be noted that the movement goes by other names: the alternative globalization movement, the anti-capitalist movement, the autonomous movement, the anti-globalization movement, and the anti-corporate movement. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0896920511411319">Starr and Adams (2003)</xref> lump many contemporary social movements (ranging from the Zapatista in Mexico to <italic>Seochulhyup</italic> in Korea) under the name of the ‘autonomous’ movement. Interestingly, many of the same ‘autonomous’ struggles are regarded by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511411319">Bircham and Charlton (2001)</xref> as examples of the anti-capitalist movement. In my opinion, although certain segments of dissenters in the said examples may have anti-capitalist or autonomist orientations, characterizing the movement in that narrow manner ignores a great array of political strategies advocated by diverse groups and individuals involved in the same struggle. For organizations involved in the ANGM, see Leite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0896920511411319">2005</xref>: 209–229) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0896920511411319">Gautney (2010)</xref>.</p></fn>
