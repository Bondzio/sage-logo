<abstract>
<p>The relationship between male rape myth acceptance, female rape myth acceptance, attitudes toward gay men, a series of gender role and sexism measures, victim blame and assault severity were investigated. It was predicted that men would display more negative, stereotypical attitudes than women and that male rape myth endorsement would be related to, and predicted by, the other attitude and attribution scales. Respondents comprised 323 undergraduates (146 males and 177 females) from a large University in the Northwest of England. Results broadly conformed to predictions, with men generally more negative than women, and male rape myth acceptance significantly related to female rape myth acceptance, negative attitudes about gay men, gender role attitudes, and victim blame. Furthermore, male rape myth acceptance was predicted by female rape myth acceptance, gender attitudes, and victim blame. Methodological issues and implications for future work and those working with victims are discussed.</p>

<p>Traditionally, male rape has been a neglected area of study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512438281">Davies, 2002a</xref>). However, recent years have seen a flurry of research activity examining the effects of male rape, and in how people think and feel about this crime (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512438281">Davies &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref> for a review). Past research on the effects of male rape has shown that many men display serious psychological disturbances, even years after their assault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512438281">Davies, 2002a</xref>). Male survivors of rape experience an array of psychological problems, such as depression (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512438281">Mezey &amp; King, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438281">Walker, Archer, &amp; Davies, 2005a</xref>), loss of self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512438281">Myers, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438281">Walker et al., 2005a</xref>), posttraumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438281">Coxell &amp; King, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512438281">Myers, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438281">Walker et al., 2005a</xref>), sexual dysfunction, loss of masculinity or confusion about their sexual identity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438281">Coxell &amp; King, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438281">Walker et al., 2005a</xref>), and anger and revenge fantasises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512438281">Davies, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438281">Walker et al., 2005a</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512438281">Walker et al.’s (2005a)</xref> qualitative analysis of 40 male survivors’ reactions to rape in the United Kingdom outlined in the words of men themselves, how personally devastating rape can be. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260512438281">Walker, Archer, and Davies (2005b)</xref> compared the psychological functioning of this group of 40 male rape survivors with a matched control group of nonraped men. The survivor group showed consistently more negative psychological functioning than controls. In a more recent analysis of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260512438281">Walker et al. (2005b)</xref> data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438281">Davies, Walker, Archer, and Pollard (2010)</xref> split the original rape data by assault type, comparing the psychological effects of those who had been raped by either a stranger or an acquaintance. Findings showed that being a victim of rape was devastating regardless of assault type. Interestingly, although the stranger rapes were not more violent, based on survivor self-reports, than acquaintance rapes, the stranger rape group considered themselves less likely to be able to fight back against their attacker.</p>
<p>The feeling of not being able to fight back or protect oneself is a particularly pertinent issue for male victims of rape, not only in terms of their recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438281">Davies et al., 2010</xref>) but also in how people perceive men who are judged not to have fought back against their rapist. Research on attributions of blame toward male rape victims has shown that men are blamed more when they are judged not to have fought back sufficiently or failed to escape (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512438281">Davies, Pollard, &amp; Archer, 2001</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512438281">Davies, Rogers, &amp; Bates, 2008</xref> for empirical work; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512438281">Davies &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref> for a detailed review). Moreover, the limited research on myths about male rape indicates that myths about this crime in part surround issues relating to the perceived lack of masculinity in men who are raped, because they failed to fight back and thus fail to behave like “real men” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512438281">Struckman-Johnson &amp; Struckman-Johnson, 1992</xref>). The literature on myths relating to the rape of women, sexism, and stereotypical views about gender relevant to work on rape myths will now be reviewed and then what is currently known about male rape myths will be considered, before the rationale of the current study is outlined.</p>
<p>In comparison to the lack of research on male rape myths, the academic literature on the myths surrounding female rape is extensive. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512438281">Burt (1980)</xref> defined female rape myths as “prejudicial and false beliefs about rape, rape victims, and rapists” (p. 217). Pinpointing the underlying ideologies that develop and maintain female rape myth acceptance has generated ongoing research over four decades. Studies have shown that in general men are more likely to endorse rape myths than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512438281">Burt, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512438281">Lonsway &amp; Fitzgerald, 1995</xref>) and do so in part because they endorse hostile views of women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512438281">Lonsway &amp; Fitzgerald, 1995</xref>). Furthermore, individuals who maintain rigid gender role stereotypes are more likely to believe it is natural for men to dominate women (even if by force) and tend to hold more negative attitudes toward female rape victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512438281">Burt, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>There has been a great deal written about sexist attitudes in recent years. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512438281">Glick and Fiske (1996)</xref> argued that sexist attitudes toward women reflect both hostile <italic>and</italic> benevolent values. Hostile sexism reflects denigrating attitudes that punish women who fail to conform to traditional gender roles, whereas benevolent sexism comprises reverent attitudes that reward women who are traditionally feminine and who enjoy “being put on a pedestal.” Individuals who have conflicting feelings about women resolve their cognitive dissonance by categorising individual women as either a “good girl” (worthy of chivalry and protection) or a “bad girl” (who should be disparaged and denied patriarchal protection).</p>
<p>Relating sexist attitudes with negative attitudes about rape, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512438281">Glick and Fiske (1997)</xref> found that hostile—but not benevolent—sexism correlated significantly with rape myth acceptance regardless of respondent gender. However, it appears that individuals who score higher in benevolent sexism are more likely to blame female rape victims in circumstances where the victim failed to maintain “ladylike” standards following acquaintance—but not stranger—rape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512438281">Abrams, Viki, Masser, &amp; Bohner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512438281">Viki &amp; Abrams, 2002</xref>). Abrams and colleagues concluded that individuals who hold more benevolently sexist views about women may blame female victims of acquaintance rape to protect their own “just world” beliefs (i.e., that they live in a fair, just, and controllable world, where the same fate would not happen to them; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512438281">Lerner, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, there is little research on the conceptual factors underlying the acceptance of prejudicial and false beliefs about the rape of men or the specific attitudes that might predict them. In an early study on the structure of male rape myths, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512438281">Struckman-Johnson and Struckman-Johnson (1992)</xref> highlighted three generic myths about male rape, namely, (a) male rape does not happen (e.g., “it is impossible to rape a man”), (b) male rape is the victim’s fault (e.g., “men are to blame for not escaping or fighting back”), and (c) men would not be traumatized by rape (e.g., “men do not need counseling after being raped”). Consistent with research on female rape myths, these authors found men were more accepting of male rape myths than women.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512438281">Davies and McCartney (2003)</xref> used selective items from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512438281">Struckman-Johnson and Struckman-Johnson’s (1992)</xref> scale and factor analyzed them in a model comprising both these male rape myth items and items relating to victim blame, relating to the behavior of the victim during the rape (such as how much he was perceived to fight back and blamed because he did not). Davies and McCartney found that male rape myths and victim blame were closely conceptually related.</p>
<p>In a more recent analysis of the structure of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512438281">Struckman-Johnson and Struckman-Johnson’s (1992)</xref> Male Rape Myths Scale, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512438281">Chapleau, Oswald, and Russell (2008)</xref> found this scale highly correlated with acceptance of female rape myths, with male respondents particularly accepting of rape myths about victims of either gender. In the same study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512438281">Chapleau et al. (2008)</xref> examined the relationship between male rape myth acceptance and ambivalent sexist attitudes toward men; measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512438281">Glick and Fiske’s (1999)</xref> Ambivalence Toward Men Inventory (AMI). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512438281">Glick and Fiske’s (1999)</xref> work suggested that as well as ambivalent attitudes toward women, people also endorse conflicting attitudes toward men that are both hostile and benevolent. Accordingly, individuals high in benevolent sexism toward men may believe men are supposed to be invincible and that if a man is raped, he must have showed some “unmanly” weakness to provoke, or otherwise fail to resist or fight back from his attacker (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512438281">Davies et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512438281">2008</xref>). The inherent implication throughout this work is that by failing to resist or fight back, male victims of rape somehow deserve all they get (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512438281">Lerner, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512438281">Chapleau et al.’s (2008)</xref> work not only extended conceptual knowledge about male rape myths but also highlighted problems associated with Struckman-Johnson and Struckman-Johnson’s three-factor model. Other work on male rape myths has used other measures or individual rape myth items not associated with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512438281">Struckman-Johnson and Struckman-Johnson (1992)</xref> scale. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512438281">Kassing, Beesely, and Frey (2005)</xref>, for example, investigated male rape myth acceptance and its relationship with negative attitudes toward gay men, using a measure developed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512438281">Melanson’s (1999)</xref> doctoral thesis—the Male Rape Myth Scale (MRMS). This is a one-dimensional scale which, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512438281">Kassing et al. (2005)</xref> noted, is a more rigorous measure of male rape myth acceptance than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512438281">Struckman-Johnson and Struckman-Johnson’s (1992)</xref> multidimensional alternative. In their 2005 study, Kassing et al. found a strong relationship between male rape myth acceptance and negative attitudes toward gay men. This is consistent with previous literature in which negative attributions toward male rape victims, such as victim blame, relate to both homophobic attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512438281">Burt &amp; DeMello, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512438281">Davies, 2002b</xref>) and the particularly negative evaluation of gay victims of male rape (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512438281">Davies et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512438281">Davies, Pollard, &amp; Archer, 2006</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512438281">Davies &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref> for a review). Finally, in relation to the current literature review, a very recent study on male rape myths and victim blame toward male rape victims, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438281">Sleath and Bull (2010)</xref> found that there was a strong relationship between victim blame and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512438281">Melanson’s (1999)</xref> MRMS, consistent with previous work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512438281">Davies and McCartney (2003)</xref>.</p>
<p>There is considerable scope for more work in this area to further investigate the structure and nature of male rape myths in relation to other potentially related constructs. The present study builds on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512438281">Kassing et al.’s (2005)</xref> work by investigating potential predictors of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512438281">Melanson’s (1999)</xref> MRMS. It also furthers the work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512438281">Chapleau et al. (2008)</xref> by investigating the extent to which several measures relating to female rape myths and sexism predict male rape myth acceptance. This study used the ASI and AMI, plus an additional measure of gender role stereotyping, namely, the Social Roles Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512438281">Baber &amp; Tucker, 2006</xref>); homophobia, namely, the Affective Reactions Toward Gay Men Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512438281">Davies, 2004</xref>); and female rape myth acceptance, namely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512438281">Payne, Lonsway, and Fitzgerald’s (1999)</xref> Illinois Rape Myths Scale. It was predicted that men would score more negatively on these measures than women. It was also predicted that male rape myth acceptance would be predicted by female rape myth acceptance, negative attitudes toward gay men, and negative, sexist attitudes toward men and women as measured by the ASI, AMI, and SRQ, respectively.</p>
<p>Finally, past studies suggest male rape victims who are gay tend to elicit more negative attributions—particularly from men—than do their heterosexual counterparts (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512438281">Davies &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>). As such, the current study furthers current knowledge by investigating the relationship between male rape myth acceptance as measured by the MRMS and attributions of blame and perceptions of assault severity toward gay male rape victims. This was achieved by using hypothetical scenario methodology to assess blame attributions relating to a specific, hypothetical, case (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512438281">Davies &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512438281">Pollard, 1992</xref> for an outline of this methodology in rape attribution research). It was predicted that men would assign more victim blame and perceive the sexual assault of a gay male victim to be less serious than would women. It was further predicted that the rape myth acceptance would be predicted by victim blame and perceptions that male rape is not such a serious event.</p>

<sec id="section4-0886260512438281">
<title>Male Rape Myth Scale (MRMS)</title>
<p>This 11-item questionnaire measures stereotypical/prejudicial beliefs about male rape and includes items such as “male rape is usually committed by homosexuals” and “a man who has been raped has lost his manhood” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512438281">Melanson, 1999</xref>).

<sec id="section6-0886260512438281">
<title>Affective Reactions Toward Gay Men Scale (ARGMS)</title>
<p>This nine-item scale assesses negative and highly emotive attitudes toward gay men and includes items such as “gay men are disgusting,” and “male homosexuality is a perversion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438281">Davies, 2004b</xref>).

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Potential respondents were approached individually by the second author (JG) in social areas of the main University campus and asked to participate in a study of attitudes toward sexual crime. All volunteers were handed a study booklet and asked to complete questionnaires privately and in their own time. Completed booklets were placed in the appropriate School of Psychology pigeon-hole or else returned via (internal) post. No form of payment was made, with all aspects of the study adhering to School and British psychological Society (BPS) ethical guidelines. Overall, 72.0% of distributed questionnaires were returned.</p>

<title>Principal Components Analyses (PCAs)</title>
<p>Questionnaire items were reverse coded where appropriate. A series of PCAs with Varimax rotation were then performed—one for each set of associated attitudinal/attribution items. Factors were extracted in line with Kaiser’s criterion with factor loading restricted to those above .30. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512438281">Table 1</xref> shows, the male rape, MRMS, IRMS, and ARGMS all had unidimensional structures, whereas the SRQ, ASI, AMI, and the attribution scale each had bidimensional structures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886260512438281">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0886260512438281">2</xref></sup> All measures had acceptable levels of internal reliability.</p>

<title>Gender Differences</title>
<p>Respondent gender differences were explored on all measures via a series of independent samples <italic>t</italic> tests (with alpha was set at .01 to account for multiple testing). As expected, male respondents were more accepting of both male and female rape myths and displayed more negative affective attitudes toward gay men than did female respondents. Predictions relating the gender role and sexism (sub) scales were mixed, with partial support of predictions. Specifically, male respondents endorsed more hostile sexism, although men and women were equally endorsing of benevolent sexism. Moreover, male respondents endorsed more stereotypical attitudes regarding gender transcendence, whereas females held more stereotypical views about male dominance. Men and women were equally endorsing of attitudes toward male and female relationships. Finally, and as predicted, male respondents assigned more victim blame and deemed the sexual assault (of a gay man) to be less severe than did their female counterparts. These differences are also summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886260512438281">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Correlations and Multiple Regression</title>
<p>Pearson’s correlations examined the predicted interrelationships between male rape myths and scores on female rape myths, affective reactions toward gay men, and the measures of social role conformity and sexism (as measured by the SRQ, ASI and AMI) and attribution items (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260512438281">Table 3</xref>). Consistent with previous research and as predicted, male rape myth acceptance correlated positively and, in this case, very strongly with female rape myth acceptance, affective reactions toward gay men, and with both attribution measures. Evidence of multicollinearity was attained between male rape myths and female rape myths, with a correlation greater than .9. Both scales were retained in further analysis, but this issue is raised again in the discussion section. Male rape myth acceptance was also moderately and positively associated with hostile sexism and both subscales of the SRQ. Interestingly, there was no relationship between benevolent sexism and male rape myths. Finally, although there was a small but significant positive relationship with the male–female relationship scale of the AMI, a negative relationship was revealed between the endorsement of male rape myths and the male dominance scale of the AMI.</p>

<p>Other significant correlations worthy of note, though out of the scope of discussion of this article, are those between the endorsement of negative affective reactions toward gay men with victim blame and assault severity, both of which were strongly positive. Moderate but significant relationships were also revealed between victim blame, assault severity, and the various gender role measures, which again are out of the scope of this article but worthy of future consideration in their own right.</p>
<p>These relationships were explored further using a stepwise multiple regression model, with the total scores of the MRMS serving as the criterion and female rape myth acceptance, affective reactions toward gay men, the SRQ (gender-linked and gender-transcendent), ASI (hostile and benevolent sexism), AMI (male–female relationship and male dominance), victim blame, and assault severity entered into the model as predictor variables.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0886260512438281">Table 4</xref> shows, a highly significant model (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) explaining 86.4% of the variance in ratings of male rape myth acceptance (adjusted = 86.0%) was revealed. There were four significant predictors of male rape myth acceptance, namely, female rape myth acceptance (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), AMI relationships (<italic>p</italic> = .021), victim blame (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and assault severity (<italic>p</italic> = .008), all in line with expectations. However, contrary to expectations endorsement of negative affective reactions toward gay men did not predict male rape myths in this model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0886260512438281">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current findings broadly supported the predictions. Specifically, and in line with previous conceptual work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512438281">Chapleau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512438281">Davies &amp; McCartney, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512438281">Kassing et al., 2005</xref>), men endorsed more negativity toward rape myths than did women. They were also more endorsing of female rape myths, more negative toward gay men, displayed more hostile sexism, and were less likely to believe gender should be transcended. Moreover, as predicted, men were more blaming of a hypothetical male rape victim and considered his sexual assault to be less severe than did women. These trends are consistent with previous work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512438281">Davies et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512438281">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512438281">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512438281">Davies &amp; McCartney, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512438281">Davies &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>) and again, suggest men express more negativity toward male victims of rape. However, men were not exclusively more negative, with men and women equally endorsing of benevolent sexism and in attitudes toward male and female relationships. Furthermore, men held significantly fewer stereotypical views about male dominance than women did. These latter results are interesting as they indicate that it is women, more so than men, who believe that men should hold a dominant role over women. Although it is not the purpose of this study to explore these issues specifically, this is certainly an avenue for further investigation as to why women are particularly endorsing of these specific beliefs, why they are as equally likely as men to believe that women should be cherished and treated in a preferential way, and why they are as likely as men to endorse stereotypical views about male and female relationships.</p>
<p>The present study aimed to explore how male rape myth acceptance related to, and was predicted by, a series of attitudinal measures. As predicted, male rape myth acceptance as measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512438281">Melanson’s (1999)</xref> MRMS correlated with the IRMS. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512438281">Chapleau et al. (2008)</xref>, who found the IRMS was strongly associated with male rape myth acceptance, as measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512438281">Struckman-Johnson and Struckman-Johnson’s (1992)</xref> male rape myths scale. The authors of this study acknowledge that the correlation between the MRMS and the IRMS in this study was so high that there was evidence of multicollinearity, and the implication here is that rape myths about men are so strongly related to those about women that they are basically the same construct. However, the authors chose to retain both scales in the analysis, rather than merging them into a single scale, to retain face validity. Given this issue, however, future researchers should investigate the constructs relating to male and female rape myths further and more specifically.</p>
<p>The present study also supported previous work in that the MRMS related to homophobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512438281">Kassing et al., 2005</xref>) and, furthermore, improved on this earlier work by incorporating a specific measure of affective, emotional responses toward gay men—the ARGMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438281">Davies, 2004b</xref>). Some scales purporting to measure homophobia measure more diverse or outdated attitudes that may make results unclear (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438281">Davies, 2004b</xref> for a further discussion on the measurement of homophobia), which was not the case in the present study.</p>
<p>Male rape myth acceptance also related moderately positively with hostile sexism and both scales of the SRQ. Interestingly, there was no relationship with benevolent sexism. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512438281">Glick and Fiske’s (1997)</xref> finding that hostile—but not benevolent—sexism related to rape myth acceptance. Thus, current findings can be seen as an extension of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512438281">Glick and Fiske’s (1997)</xref> work on female rape myth acceptance in that hostile—but not benevolent—sexist attitudes also relate to endorsement of myths toward male victims.</p>
<p>Finally, although there was a small but significant positive relationship with the male–female relationship scale of the AMI, a negative relationship was revealed between the MRMS and the AMI’s male dominance scale. This is inconsistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512438281">Chapleau et al.’s (2008)</xref> claim that all three subscales were positively related. In the present analysis, AMI subscales evolved from PCA and thus may represent a slightly different construct to those reported by the original authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512438281">Glick &amp; Fiske, 1999</xref>) and by Chapleau and colleagues. Likewise, one should also recall that Chapleau et al. used a different male rape myths measure than that used in the present study. Future research is needed to clarify if measurement issues are the source of any trend inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Subsequent multiple regression analysis examined potential predictors of male rape myth acceptance. The final model explained a large amount of variance which gives credibility to the measures used here. As expected, given their sizeable correlation, IRMS was the strongest predictor of MRMS, followed interestingly by the AMI male and female relationships subscale, victim blame, and assault severity. These results support previous evidence of a strong relationship between male rape myths and victim blame toward a hypothetical male rape victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512438281">Davies &amp; McCartney, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438281">Sleath &amp; Bull, 2010</xref>). Future education programs could use these findings to reduce the amount of victim blame and male rape myths currently endorsed by the society.</p>
<p>Contrary to expectations, ARGMS ratings did not predict male rape myths in the multiple regression model despite the clear correlational relationship. The authors are unsure why this measure dropped out of the model, given that the correlation was high between the MRMS and ARGMS. Future research should clarify this position.</p>
<sec id="section17-0886260512438281">
<title>Methodological Issues</title>
<p>By employing a hypothetical scenario to elicit attributions of victim blame and assault severity, the ecological validity of the current study may be somewhat compromised. That said, the use of vignette methodology is widespread and remains the best approach for this type of work (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512438281">Davies &amp; Rogers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512438281">Pollard, 1992</xref>). However, use of a student sample does limit the generalizability of current findings, and future research should endeavor to widen participation to nonstudents. The authors also acknowledge that due to problems with PCA several scales (namely, those from the ASI and AMI) were not used in their entirety. That said, all scale that were used here demonstrated very high internal reliability and thus appropriate measures in their own right.</p>

<title>Implications and General Conclusion</title>
<p>This and similar research has implications for professionals working with victims and/or employed to educate the public about rape. Current findings suggest that individuals who adhere to male rape myths are also more likely to endorse myths about female rape, to hold negative views about gay men, to maintain sexist attitudes, and to attribute more blame to male rape victims for their own assault. The implication here is that secondary victimization—which is often severe, long lasting, and detrimental to victim recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260512438281">Williams, 1984</xref>)—may take a variety of forms, reflected in the types of negative attitude rape victims often experience and perhaps even come to expect. Service providers and those working to educate the public about rape need be mindful of the possibility that negative attitudes about rape are both wide-reaching and diverse, relating to more general beliefs about gender and sexuality than, say, attributions of blame for one’s own victimization.</p>

<p>All items except one loaded onto a specific factor highly and unambiguously. In contrast, Item 7 (pertaining to male sexual behavior) was moderately loaded onto both factors. Reliability testing revealed this item was more suited to Factor 2 “gender-transcendent roles.” As such, it was included in all Factor 2 computations.</p>

<p>Principal components analysis on the 22 ASI items initially extracted five orthogonal factors with eigenvalues greater than one, explaining 27.21%, 14.61%, 11.65%, 9.65%, and 7.58% of the total ASI variance, respectively. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512438281">Glick and Fiske’s (1996)</xref> original data, the ASI yielded only two factors pertaining to hostile and benevolent attitudes toward women. As a consequence, for simplification, and due the ambiguity of the five-factor structure, it was decided that only two factors closest to the original concepts of hostile and benevolent sexism would be retained. A similar two-factor solution was adopted for PCA on the 20 AMI items which initially extracted five factors explaining 25.22%, 24.24%, 10.14%, 9.02%, and 5.98% of total AMI variance, respectively, and which was also inconsistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512438281">Glick &amp; Fiske, 1999</xref>).</p>

<p>For completeness, a second stepwise multiple regression was performed this time including respondent gender and respondent sexual orientation (heterosexual vs. homosexual/lesbian/bisexual) as predictors. Neither gender nor sexual orientation was significant and the overall predictors did not change. As such, only the initial model is discussed.</p>
