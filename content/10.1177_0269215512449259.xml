<p>Simple clinical tests are my preference, and the sit-to-stand test must be among the most simple and has great face validity and will be appreciated by patients. Two studies in this issue investigate ways of increasing sensitivity. <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra1-0269215512449259" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511426889">The first</related-article> measures speed: how long does a child with cerebral palsy take when asked to do five ‘as quickly as possible’? <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra2-0269215512449259" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511427323">The second</related-article> measures the lowest starting point someone can reach and still do the test. Simple tests like this are much more convincing to patients and to cynical funding agencies that more sophisticated, technologically-based measures. <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra3-0269215512449259" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511427748">The third measurement study</related-article> in this issue adapts a widely used measure for application in mainland China – and gives a Manadarin translation also; I have always felt it important, as far as possible, to make tests available so that a reader can actually see the items within a questionnaire or test. A second theme in this issue is the longer term benefits of interventions. <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra4-0269215512449259" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511426159">A study of botuinum toxin</related-article> for plantar fasciitis suggests that the benefit at six months is greater than at three months, when compared with steroid injections. And a 12 year follow-up (magnificent that it was tried and succeeded) of people within a <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra5-0269215512449259" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511429161">trial of cardiac rehabilitation</related-article> suggests a residual benefit 12 years later. The size and persistence of the effect of rehabilitation will determine the size of study needed (or the power of small trials). <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra6-0269215512449259" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511427749">A study here</related-article> shows that a total of 1300 people would be needed to determine whether physiotherapy after knee arthroplasty had a beneficial effect. As the authors suggest, perhaps a more sensitive (and relevant) outcome measure should be developed first! Another very underpowered <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra7-0269215512449259" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511426803">pilot study</related-article> investigated a combination of electrical stimulation and passive movement of the legs after stroke on gait; it is probably worth doing a larger study. The authors of two other small studies with no statistically significant differences between the groups nonetheless suggest positive effects from <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra8-0269215512449259" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511423946">leisure-centre based groups exercise</related-article> (for people with multiple sclerosis) and <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra9-0269215512449259" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215511427414">from electrotherapy</related-article> (for people with lymphoedema related to breast cancer). I am sometimes criticised for accepting and publishing small, underpowered trials. One part of my defence is that such trials show that it is at least possible to undertake randomised controlled trials – so often someone will say that research simply is not possible. The second part is that it should encourage properly conducted full scale studies by giving initial data. Any comments?</p>
