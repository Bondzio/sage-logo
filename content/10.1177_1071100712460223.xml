<p>The medical records of 7 foot-and-ankle orthopaedic surgeons at 1 institution were reviewed by Current Procedural Terminology (code 27650) and International Classification of Diseases–9 (code 727.67) to establish all Achilles tendon ruptures seen and/or treated by these surgeons.

<p>A total of 468 patients were identified, of whom 358 had acute ruptures: 302 male and 56 female (5.39:1).

<body>
<p>The Achilles tendon is the most commonly ruptured tendon in the human body. It is accepted that it is a common injury in orthopaedic practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712460223">5</xref></sup> In fact, some authors have noted an increased incidence over the past few decades attributed to increased sports participation in the occasional athlete.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460223">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460223">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712460223">18</xref></sup> The precise reasons why the tendon ruptures remain somewhat elusive, although predisposing factors have been identified. An eccentric load is typically necessary for the tendon to actually rupture, as many of these injuries occur in sports that require quick bursts of energy. Moreover, it does appear that preexisting tendon pathology plays a role.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712460223">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712460223"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712460223">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1071100712460223">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The incidence of Achilles tendon rupture certainly appears to be less in women, although this fact has not been specifically investigated in the literature. Several authors have looked at Achilles tendon ruptures in certain regions in Europe and Canada and have reported on a male:female ratio.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460223">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460223">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712460223">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460223">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712460223"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712460223"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712460223"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712460223">21</xref></sup> Also, Davis et al looked at Achilles tendon rupture from a demographic standpoint in the US military.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460223">6</xref></sup> However, no authors have studied the injury in females to try to establish demographic and potential precipitating factors. Moreover, no study has specifically looked at demographic factors associated with Achilles tendon rupture in a civilian population in the United States.</p>
<p>The goal of this study was to better define the demographic factors of Achilles tendon rupture in women at a busy foot-and-ankle center in the United States. Specifically, we sought to define a male:female ratio and look for any trends in terms of age and mechanism of injury while also investigating the role of medical comorbidities.</p>
<sec id="section6-1071100712460223" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The medical records of 7 foot-and-ankle fellowship-trained orthopaedists at 1 institution were reviewed by Current Procedural Terminology (CPT; code 27650: repair, primary, open or percutaneous, ruptured Achilles tendon) and International Classification of Diseases–9 (ICD-9; code 727.67: Achilles tendon rupture, nontraumatic) in an effort to identify all Achilles tendon ruptures seen and/or treated by those surgeons since they have been in practice. The charts were reviewed to confirm Achilles tendon rupture and record demographic and injury information on the patients. Any patient who had an Achilles tendon rupture and was seen or treated by 1 of the surgeons was included.</p>
<p>Data included sex, age, and side. The mechanism of injury was noted, as was whether the injury was acute or nonacute. Acute injuries were defined as those patients who had an Achilles tendon rupture that could be linked to a specific injury. Nonacute patients were essentially all other patients. Many patients that did not have acute Achilles tendon ruptures were found in this search. These “nonacute” patients were largely patients that had either insertional or noninsertional Achilles tendinosis. Demographic data from these patients were recorded to assess their effect on mean age and male:female ratio, but these patients were not included in any other assessment.</p>
<p>The term <italic>athletic activity</italic> was used to encompass activities such as dance and aerobics in addition to sports, as opposed to the term <italic>sporting activity</italic>, which has been used in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460223">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460223">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712460223">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460223">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712460223"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712460223"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712460223"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712460223">21</xref></sup> This nomenclature shift was done to include these activities that were perhaps not traditionally thought of as “sports.” Any comorbidities that were thought to increase the risk of rupture were also noted.</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics were calculated for variables of interest. Continuous variables were analyzed using a <italic>t</italic> test, and the chi-square test was used to evaluate categorical variables. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.1.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 468 patients were identified by ICD-9/CPT codes over a 20-year period (1991-2010). Females accounted for 99 of these patients, for a male:female ratio of 369:99 (3.72:1). Of this total, 358 patients had acute Achilles ruptures, while 110 had nonacute Achilles pathology. Of the acute ruptures, 302 were in males and 56 were in females (5.39:1). Relatively more patients with nonacute pathology were female (male:female, 67:43, or 1.56:1). The data on sidedness are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712460223">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>For the female patients, athletic activity was involved in 40 of 56 acute ruptures (71.4%). Tennis was the individual sport that accounted for the greatest number of acute ruptures (25.0%). Falls not otherwise specified (14.2%) and dancing (8.9%) accounted for the next-highest proportion of Achilles tendon ruptures. For the male patients, athletic activity was causative in 243 of 302 acute ruptures (80.5%; <italic>P</italic> = .130). A greater proportion was due to basketball (24.8%) and a lesser proportion to tennis (18.5%). Also, all patients who had an Achilles rupture while playing either squash or racquetball were male, and all who had an Achilles rupture while doing aerobics or gymnastics were female.</p>
<p>Twelve patients of the 358 acute ruptures (3.4%) were noted to have comorbidities that were thought to possibly increase their risk of rupture. Six of these comorbidities were in males (6 of 302, 2.0%), and 6 were in females (6 of 56, 10.7%). This difference was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .005). Three patients were on systemic steroids for different reasons (2 female, 1 male), and 1 patient had a local injection into his Achilles tendon sheath. Five patients had a history of recent use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics (3 female, 2 male). One patient had a history of Guillain-Barre syndrome with systemic steroid usage (male), and 2 had a fracture of their contralateral lower extremity (1 ankle, 1 fifth metatarsal) that required nonweightbearing and then sustained an Achilles tendon rupture on the side on which they were weightbearing (1 female, 1 male).</p>

<p>The results of this study agree with all published data that acute Achilles tendon rupture is more common in men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712460223">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712460223">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712460223">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712460223">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712460223"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712460223"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712460223"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712460223">21</xref></sup> Not surprisingly, acute ruptures occur in a population younger than those with nonacute Achilles issues. In general, athletic activity of any sort, irrespective of sex, is a consistent risk factor for Achilles tendon rupture.</p>
<p>This study had several weaknesses. First, it was retrospective and relied entirely on chart review. Due to the fact that several surgeons were involved, data were gathered from different sources. Moreover, many patients that did not have acute Achilles tendon ruptures were identified by CPT or ICD-9 codes. These patients were not included in the general assessment, but they were included only with respect to their effect on age and male:female ratio. It was thought that these patients would identify weaknesses in population-based studies on Achilles ruptures that used a similar method of data collection. Since these patients are more likely to be older and more likely to be female, then these nonacute patients could skew the data such that the male:female ratio would be lower and the mean age higher.</p>

<p>Percentage of ruptures associated with athletic activity.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Compiling all these studies gave a male:female ratio of 2.81:1. Acute Achilles tendon ruptures are more common in men. It is possible that this ratio is higher than 2.81:1, as the 2 largest studies are from population-based data from which it is not clear if only acute injuries were included. In the current study, nonacute pathology was more common in women. Given that we used a similar mechanism to identify patients (ie, by CPT and ICD-9 codes) and ended up with so many patients that clearly did have not acute Achilles tendon ruptures, it is plausible that these larger studies may include patients that have more chronic pathology. Based on this logic, a male:female ratio closer to the 5.39:1 among our acute patients is possibly more accurate for acute Achilles tendon ruptures.</p>
<p>Many of these studies note a slightly higher age in women than men for Achilles tendon rupture. In the current study, the mean age for males and females was virtually identical. Many of the studies demonstrating a higher age in women used CPT and ICD-9 codes to calculate ratios and did not investigate chronicity. Removing the more chronic patients from consideration equalized the age distribution between sexes in the current study, which could account for the age difference seen in other studies.</p>
<p>Jozsa et al originally reported on the correlation between recreational sport activity and Achilles tendon rupture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460223">9</xref></sup> They noted histologic degeneration within ruptured Achilles tendons, but 59% of patients also had involvement in sports activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712460223">9</xref></sup> All of the studies compiled above showed sports participation in 59% to 81% of patients with Achilles tendon ruptures. Our patients fall within this range at 79.0%. Some people may have a greater likelihood of rupturing their Achilles tendon due to degeneration, but those people still require an eccentric contraction of sufficient force to rupture the tendon. It has been hypothesized that those with a sedentary lifestyle are perhaps at greater risk. However, Davis et al challenged this notion, reporting on 865 Achilles tendon ruptures over a 3-year period in the US military, patients who are required to maintain the highest levels of physical fitness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712460223">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many musculoskeletal injuries occur with a greater frequency among women. Indeed, a host of studies have looked at various injuries in this respect. Jones et al noted in a population of army basic trainees that women reported more musculoskeletal injuries than men, although almost all these injuries were overuse injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712460223">8</xref></sup> Sex differences have been explored in relation to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in great depth, with many studies focusing on the effect of female sex hormones. Wojtys et al noted an increased incidence of ACL rupture in women during the ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, when estrogen levels peak.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1071100712460223">24</xref></sup> Some studies have further noted that oral contraceptive use appears to blunt the injury spike seen with ovulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712460223">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Estrogen receptors have been identified on both ligament (ACL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712460223">13</xref></sup> and tendon (posterior tibial tendon)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712460223">1</xref></sup> in ACL fibroblasts and posterior tibial tendon tenocytes, respectively. Yu et al further noted that fibroblast proliferation and type I procollagen synthesis are reduced significantly with increasing estrogen concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1071100712460223">26</xref></sup> However, Wentorf et al have noted that endogenous estrogen has no direct effect on the mechanical or material properties of the ACL in cynomolgus monkeys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1071100712460223">23</xref></sup> Similarly, Burgess et al showed no difference in tendon mechanical properties for the patellar and medial gastrocnemius tendons with acute fluctuations in female sex hormones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712460223">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712460223">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Contrary to many injuries, Achilles rupture is less common in females, perhaps explained by biological reasons. Bryant et al have suggested that the chronic effect of estrogen exposure in females is ultimately less Achilles tendon strain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712460223">2</xref></sup> Furthermore, Kobori et al demonstrated that female sex hormones had an inhibitory effect on muscle fiber diameter, possibly providing some protection against the risk of tendon rupture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712460223">10</xref></sup> It is also interesting to note that women were more likely to have a comorbidity that predisposed them to rupture in the current study. This fact only strengthens the argument that women are less likely to rupture their Achilles tendon with all else being equal.</p>
<p>Many reasons have been offered to propose why the Achilles tendon is more likely to be ruptured in men. Men in general have greater muscle mass and are capable of generating greater force of contraction. It is possible that men can more easily exceed the maximal tensile strength of the tendon than women. Based on Maffulli’s data, patients who rupture their Achilles tendons appear to be at risk because their tendons are more likely to be degenerative. Next, they must be put into a position in which they will experience an eccentric contraction of sufficient force to rupture the tendon. Therefore, Achilles tendon ruptures could be more common in men because they are more likely to have either degenerative tendons or a sufficiently large eccentric contraction.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study is the first to specifically look at Achilles tendon rupture in women. It is also the first to look at the demographic factors associated with Achilles tendon rupture in a civilian US setting. The current data agree with previously published reports that Achilles tendon rupture is much more common in men than women. Previous studies that obtained patient data via diagnosis codes have likely overestimated the proportion and age of women with acute Achilles tendon rupture by including patients with nonacute pathology. These data suggest that athletic activity is a consistent risk factor for Achilles tendon rupture, irrespective of sex. Also, not only is Achilles tendon rupture less likely in women, but women who do rupture their Achilles tendon are more likely to have some predisposing comorbidity.</p>
