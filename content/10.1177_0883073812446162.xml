<abstract>
<p>Vacuum extraction significantly reduces perinatal morbidity/mortality. Increased occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage has been associated with vacuum extraction and is multifactorial; a causative effect is not assumed. Long-term developmental outcome data in this specific subpopulation are lacking and may differ from non–vacuum extraction–associated intracranial hemorrhage. Long-term follow-up of children with symptomatic vacuum extraction–associated intracranial hemorrhage was retrospectively analyzed using Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Twenty-five newborns were identified with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage after vacuum extraction. Motor development was severely impaired in 4 children (16%, Bayley Scale score &lt;55), moderately impaired in 5 children (20%, Bayley Scale score 55-69) and mildly impaired in 2 children (8%, Bayley Scale score 70-84). Mental development was severely impaired in 2 children (8%), moderately impaired in 3 children (12%) and mildly impaired in 5 children (20%). Impaired outcome was associated with parenchymal injury and seems to be a higher reported outcome in non–vacuum extraction–associated intracranial hemorrhage. The high prevalence of impaired development in symptomatic vacuum extraction–associated intracranial hemorrhage necessitates long-term follow-up.</p>

<p>Vacuum extraction, applied in 15% of deliveries, improves neonatal outcome by shortening the second stage of labor and thereby reducing the duration of fetal distress and subsequent perinatal morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812446162">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812446162"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812446162">3</xref></sup> Increased occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage (intracranial hemorrhage), however, has been associated with vacuum extraction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812446162">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812446162"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812446162">4</xref></sup> and it is assumed that ante- or intrapartum intracranial hemorrhage necessitates vacuum extraction rather than results from vacuum extraction, except for incidental cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812446162">5</xref></sup> Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurs in 0.1% to 0.8% of infants after vacuum extractions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812446162">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812446162">3</xref></sup> Although the risk of vacuum extraction–related short-term complications and mortality has been extensively reported in the literature, little information is reported on neurodevelopmental outcome of infants with vacuum extraction–associated intracranial hemorrhage, and the outcome in this subgroup may differ from non–vacuum extraction–associated intracranial hemorrhage.</p>
<p>This study is aimed to analyze the outcome in this specific population and to compare with literature reports on non–vacuum extraction–associated intracranial hemorrhage. In this study, we describe the long-term follow-up of a heterogeneous cohort of children with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage associated with vacuum extraction.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073812446162" sec-type="methods">
<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<p>We searched our patient database to identify all infants who were born between January 1999 and December 2007 and were diagnosed with an intracranial hemorrhage after vaginal delivery by means of vacuum extraction. Patients were either born in our center or referred to our level IIIa neonatal intensive care unit. Neuroimaging was only performed on a clinical suspicion of intracranial hemorrhage. Intracranial hemorrhage was diagnosed using either echoencephalography, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Patient characteristics (sex, Apgar score, birth weight, and gestational age) were retrieved from medical charts. Neuroimaging results were retrieved from original documentations of the attending radiologist.</p>
<p>Patient outcome was evaluated using an age-specific test: either the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-II-NL) or the shortened version of the Revisie Amsterdamse Kinder Intelligentie Test, depending on their age. The Bayley Scale, used between 1 and 2 years of age and corrected for gestational age, consists of a Mental Developmental Index and a Psychomotor Developmental Index. The Mental Developmental Index includes items about sensory-perceptual skills, eye-hand coordination, imitation, language development, memory, and problem-solving abilities. The Psychomotor Developmental Index includes items about gross and fine motor development (rolling, crawling, sitting, standing, walking, running, jumping, and grasping). Both the Mental Developmental Index and Psychomotor Developmental Index have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Scores greater than 100 indicate advanced development for age. Development is defined as severely impaired if the scores were lower than 55, moderately impaired if they were 55 to 69, and mildly impaired if they were 70 to 84. In a normal population, about 95% of all children obtain scores in the 70 to 130 range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812446162">6</xref></sup> The shortened version of the Revisie Amsterdamse Kinder Intelligentie Test is a validated individual intelligence test used above the age of 4 years 2 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812446162">7</xref></sup> This test includes perceptual skills, logical reasoning, word knowledge, visual-motor integration, and word fluency. The results of the Revisie Amsterdamse Kinder Intelligentie Test are interpreted in the same way as the Bayley Scale with a norm score (IQ score) of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. This test does not yield a score for motor development. If a child did not complete the standardized assessment, an experienced pediatrician and a psychologist categorized the child’s estimated developmental level on the basis of the clinical observation as severely impaired, moderately impaired, or not impaired.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS, version 16.0. The comparison between characteristics of patients with or without impaired development was performed using an independent samples <italic>t</italic> test or Fisher exact test for nonparametric divided data. Statistical significance was defined as a <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;.05.</p>

<title>Patient Characteristics</title>
<p>Between January 1999 and December 2007, a total of 1984 of 14 562 deliveries (14%) in our hospital were terminated by means of vacuum extraction. We identified 25 patients with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage after vacuum extraction. Seven patients were born elsewhere and referred to our neonatal intensive care unit.</p>
<p>Eighteen patients were boys. Mean gestational age was 39 weeks. Mean birth weight was 3283 g (range 1685-4800 g). An Apgar score at 1 minute below 5 points was observed in 9 patients. Four patients had an Apgar score below 5 points at 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Clinical symptoms suspect for intracranial hemorrhage varied between patients. Seizures were most frequently reported (n = 15, 60%); other clinical signs that lead to performing neuroimaging were asphyxia, irritability, and apneas.</p>
<p>Intracranial hemorrhage was most frequently localized subarachnoidal (n = 12), subdural (n = 11), and/or intraparenchymal (n = 11). Twelve children had blood in multiple compartments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073812446162">Table 1</xref>). Laboratory tests to evaluate coagulation were performed in 17 children; no coagulation disorders were identified.</p>

<title>Neurodevelopmental Results</title>
<p>Twelve patients were evaluated using the Bayley Score at the age of 24 months corrected for gestational age. Two patients were developmentally impaired to a degree that the results of the Bayley Score became unreliable and were categorized as severely impaired for further analysis. The Revisie Amsterdamse Kinder Intelligentie Test was used in 2 patients at a later age (mean age at evaluation 56 months). Nine patients were categorized on clinical observation.</p>
<p>A total of 13 (52%) patients had developmental impairment, 10 mentally and 11 for motor function (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073812446162">Table 1</xref>). Motor development was classified as severely impaired in 4 children, moderately impaired in 5 children, and mildly impaired in 2 children. No delay in motor development was observed in 14 children. Mental development was severely impaired in 2 children, moderately impaired in 3 children, and mildly impaired in 5 children. Normal mental development was observed in 15 children.</p>
<p>Twelve of 25 children (48%) showed normal motor as well as mental development. Of children with normal mental development, only 2 (13%) had impaired motor development, and of children with impaired mental development, 8 (80%) also had an impaired motor development. Eight of 25 (32%) children had an impaired motor and mental development.</p>
<p>Impaired development was related to parenchymal brain damage (intraparenchymal bleedings and infarction; codes 5 and 6 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073812446162">Table 1</xref>). For motor impairment, 10 of 11 (91%) have type 5 or 6 lesions, compared with only 6 of 14 (43%) with normal development (<italic>P</italic> = .03; Fisher exact test). Of mentally impaired patients, 8 of 10 (80%) had type 5 or 6 damages compared with 8 of 15 (53%) with normal motor development (<italic>P</italic> = .23; Fisher exact test). No statistical differences were found concerning Apgar scores, gestational age, or birth weight between children with and without impaired mental or motor development.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we observed that normal development in children with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage after vacuum extraction occurred in only 48%. Although short-term morbidity of vacuum extraction–associated intracranial hemorrhage has been extensively described in the literature and is reported to be low,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812446162">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812446162">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812446162">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812446162"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812446162">10</xref></sup> to our knowledge detailed long-term neurodevelopmental outcome of vacuum extraction–related symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage has not been reported earlier.</p>
<p>To compare developmental outcome of vacuum extraction–associated symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage with non–vacuum extraction–associated intracranial hemorrhage, only a recent study including both patients with and without vacuum extraction–associated perinatal intracranial hemorrhage is available, with a reported 84% normal development at 15 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812446162">11</xref></sup> This is consistent with earlier studies on neurologic outcome of children with intracranial hemorrhage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812446162">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812446162">13</xref></sup> but is considerably higher than the 48% of patients with completely normal development at 24 months we found in this cohort. However, in those studies, unfortunately neither the proportion of vacuum extraction–associated intracranial hemorrhage of the total cohort was specified nor its contribution to the overall developmental outcome. Despite these limitations, our data suggest that vacuum extraction–associated symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage is a distinct subpopulation of perinatal intracranial hemorrhage with a poorer prognosis, regardless its cause.</p>
<p>As the necessity of vacuum extraction is assumed to be indicative of intracranial hemorrhage rather than the cause (except for incidental cases), and this study does not prove otherwise, causative factors explaining the assumed poorer outcome in this subpopulation could be asphyxia, infection, prematurity, vascular, or hematologic disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812446162">14</xref></sup> From our series, predictive risk factors for poor neurodevelopmental outcome such as Apgar scores, gestational age, or birth weight could not be deducted.</p>
<p>The pathophysiologic mechanism responsible for the high incidence of impaired neurodevelopmental outcome in vacuum extraction–associated intracranial hemorrhage thus remains unclear. In addition, the pathologic-anatomic findings do not reveal the specific mechanism between vacuum extraction and outcome: subarachnoid hemorrhages—in our cohort, the majority of intracranial hemorrhage—have been associated with birth trauma in general; the same applies for both subdural hemorrhage—also relatively common in this cohort—and hemorrhages in multiple compartments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812446162">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812446162">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812446162"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073812446162"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073812446162">17</xref></sup> The localization of the intracranial hemorrhage in symptomatic patients is of importance for its prognosis: in our cohort, intraparenchymal lesions were found to be a risk factor for increased prevalence of impaired motor outcome; however, not all (43%) patients developed motor impairment.</p>
<p>Performing neuroimaging in nonsymptomatic patients after vacuum extraction seems unjustified. Intracranial hemorrhage is reported to occur in as high as 26% of asymptomatic neonates following (assisted) vaginal birth,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812446162">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073812446162">16</xref></sup> and routine echoencephalography in asymptomatic children shows abnormalities of unknown clinical significance that did not require therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812446162">3</xref></sup> Routine CT in asymptomatic children revealed intracranial hemorrhages that had disappeared by the age of 1 year. None of those children showed impaired psychomotor development at the age of 3 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073812446162">19</xref></sup> As earlier studies have shown that vacuum extraction–related symptoms develop within 10 hours after birth,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073812446162">20</xref></sup> clinical observation of asymptomatic patients seems adequate. Although no long-term follow-up evaluation was performed in these children, these studies also lack an indication for routine screening of infants born after vacuum extraction, so neuroimaging after vacuum extraction is only indicated when clinical symptoms develop.</p>
<p>Limitations of this study are its retrospective character, the heterogeneous population with the different age-dependent neurodevelopmental testing methods, the single-center nature, the relatively small number of included patients, and the lack of a control group. The high proportion of overall incidence of symptomatic vacuum extraction–associated intracranial hemorrhage (1.2%) in our population might be due to the fact that our hospital is a referral center for high-risk pregnancies.</p>
<p>However, despite these limitations, these data suggest that children with symptomatic vacuum extraction–associated intracranial hemorrhage often have impaired motor and mental development, and this necessitates long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up. Whether vacuum extraction–associated intracranial hemorrhage does have a poorer outcome than non–vacuum extraction–associated intracranial hemorrhage should be studied in further (prospective) studies also to identify contributing risk factors and mechanisms of vacuum extraction–related intracranial hemorrhage on neurodevelopmental outcome.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although vacuum extraction itself is not assumed to be a causative factor, this study demonstrates a nearly 50% incidence of poor neurodevelopmental outcome in symptomatic vacuum extraction–associated intracranial hemorrhage and indicates the necessity of long-term follow-up in this specific population.</p>
