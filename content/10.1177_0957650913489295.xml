<abstract>
<p>Experimental/computational work highlighted the combustion performance with eccentric blockage rotation in the reactive flow passage to augment the turbulence production rates in the flame for acquiring high power to weight ratios and effective heat transfer in industrial applications. The temporal/spatial velocity gradients stimulated around the reactive stream boundaries enhanced the turbulence development in both premixed and non-premixed flames. The eccentric shapes included circular, elliptical, squared and triangular shafts as well as a triple/straight blade rotor. The design was further developed to incorporate simultaneous rotation of the eccentric blockage around its axis via a planetary gear assembly to duplicate the vortical structure. While the premixed flames responded to such cyclic action by having a mixture velocity of 16.8 m/s, the non-premixed flames acquired an increase of 341% in the largest eddy size and a flame length reduction by 42%. Increasing the Strouhal number to 0.94 and the swirl ratio to 0.78 increased the turbulent kinetic energy to 9.1 m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>. By controlling the drag coefficient and wake vorticity for the solid shapes, the triangular rotor enhanced the combustor outward heat flux to exhibit a heater efficiency of 36.8% in the premixed flame mode and reduced the HC and CO emissions, respectively, to 0.1% and 513 ppm for non-premixed flames. Decreasing the reactive stream cross-section favorably increased the flow shearing effects, while the elliptical shape showed the highest sensitivity to axes’ orientation with respect to the direction of rotation. Due to the reduction in peak temperatures via increasing the turbulence intensity and heat transfer rate from the flame, the NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> exhaust concentrations decreased to a minimum value around 10 ppm. The combustion efficiency of diffusion flames was optimized with the fuel port central positioning in the burner, where the planetary gear design provided a turbulence intensity of 13.7% by the triple blade rotor.</p>

<p>Combustion development is pursued through innovative burner designs, with a combination of various flow disturbances and tuning of the mixing and reaction time scales. As turbulence develops in a reactive flow field, the strain rate can be magnified via involving both passive and active control techniques such that the spectrum of turbulence length scales becomes broadened to support more effective heat/mass transport. In this regard, the interaction between the neighboring parallel flamelets occurs more frequently as the turbulent length scales become smaller, and when a flame trapped in a large vortical structure spins further inside its core.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650913489295">1</xref></sup></p>
<p><bold>S</bold>wirling flow and pulsating flow are examples of two interactive flow disturbances. Although swirling flow is known to be superior for introducing severe strain rates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957650913489295">2</xref></sup> limited research was found in the literature concerning the rotary vane swirl flames (including the studies reported by Sivashinsky et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650913489295">3</xref></sup> Sheu et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957650913489295">4</xref></sup> Sakai and Ishizuka<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957650913489295">5</xref></sup> and Dwyer and Hasegawa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650913489295">6</xref></sup>). On the other hand, the pulsating flow is a particular kind of unsteady flow configuration in which there is a regular cyclic variation in the flow velocity superimposed on a constant time-averaged flow rate. In most industrial pipe flow systems, the flow is turbulent and when pulsation is introduced; there are supplementary turbulent fluctuations in the velocity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957650913489295">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>While shear layers are the main source of turbulence via the spatial velocity gradients around jets, there are consequences of having time-varying velocity profiles to involve temporal velocity gradients as well. Such interactive flow fields are currently established by involving rotation of an eccentric shaft inside the duct which holds the reactive streams. In such flow arrangement, the positions of the eccentric shaft and the flow opening are cyclically interchanged by the eccentric shaft movement. As the shear layers in this case exist within the stream outer boundaries close to the duct wall as well as around the interface with the shaft, there is a temporal velocity gradient which enriches the global stream shearing effect for further turbulence intensification. The spatial and temporal velocity gradients favorably combine to magnify the rates of turbulent kinetic energy production such that the consequent turbulence evolution can be modulated by flexibly varying the speed of rotation as well as the shaft cross-section.</p>
<p>The rotation is employed in order to involve the swirl favorable effect as an active control technique as well as to modulate the flow shearing effects associated with the different cross-sections of the annular stream (to act as a passive control technique). The current configuration thus highlights the interference between swirl and the different annular cross-sections to increase the strain rate (by incorporating the respective vortices in the flow wake region around the eccentrically rotating shaft). The advantage of such design relative to the classical pulsating flow (imparted through an actuated valve or a diaphragm) is that it provides the combination of swirl and pulsation for more severe turbulence generation. Furthermore, the swirling flow portion in the current mechanism enhances the heat transfer as it increases the overall rate of fluid transfer to the surrounding walls.</p>
<p>In stationary vane-swirler configurations, the axial momentum flux of the flow is partially converted into a tangential component through the swirler body. On the other hand, in rotating vane-swirler applications, a forced vortex is entirely imposed by an external power such that the axial velocity component remains the same. If such axial velocity component is disturbed by cyclic shaft positioning, a flow strain arises in this component and a tangential velocity simultaneously develops within the boundary layer around the eccentric shaft. Furthermore, if the eccentric shaft cross-section is increased into a large percent of the pipe flow area, the flow strain due to the tangential flow component of the shaft becomes much larger and in the same time the periodic change in the axial velocity is more severe. For a rotating straight vane at the same speed (which was conventionally investigated before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650913489295">8</xref></sup>), no disturbance in the axial flow component occurs since the vane has negligible thickness such that the available area for the axial flow does not change very much. In comparison, with the very thick body of rotation in the current design there is a disturbance introduced on the axial flow so as to provide powerful action of pulsation in addition to the tangentially imposed flow.</p>
<p>As a pulsating flow exists, the turbulence due to the velocity gradients develops intensively. Fureby and Lundgren<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650913489295">9</xref></sup> stated that pulsating combustion describes a combustion process that occurs under oscillatory conditions, wherein the state variables (such as pressure, temperature and velocity) vary periodically with time. Although pulsating combustion is an old technology, it has recently received renewed attention mainly in the search for high-efficiency heating devices and high-pressure pulse systems. Akulich et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957650913489295">10</xref></sup> reported that pulsating combustion ensures heat and mass transfer rates severalfold higher with a greater turbulence intensity (by more than one order of magnitude in comparison to typical combustion systems). The rates of nitric oxides decrease by a factor of three and the thermal efficiency is improved significantly. In the pulsating combustion chambers with mechanical valves, the valves execute either reciprocating or rotary motion. A pulsating regime of combustion is produced due to a discontinuous supply of either air or fuel. Fureby and Lundgren<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650913489295">9</xref></sup> stated that the flow field over the major part of a pulse combustor can be approximated with an oscillatory plug flow, indicating that the flow can be simplified to be one-dimensional. In consequence, it was concluded that a natural way to start developing theoretical models for pulsating combustion is to formulate and examine one-dimensional models to serve as a theoretical instrument for the designers of pulse combustors.</p>
<p>As stated by Scotti and Piomelli,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957650913489295">7</xref></sup> many turbulent flow cases (such as the flow in internal combustion engines and heat exchangers) are inherently unsteady. The unsteadiness can be caused by fluctuations either in the driving force or in the boundary conditions and may be a combination of both. The experimental evidence revealed that at very low frequencies turbulence has time to relax to the local equilibrium. As the frequency is increased, typical turbulent quantities such as the ratio between stream-wise fluctuation intensity and turbulent kinetic energy start to exhibit phase dependence; which might indicate that the processes of production and dissipation are out of phase.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the combustion-driven flow acceleration maintains a steady-state rate of strain which magnifies the cold-flow turbulence production rates, the performance modulation is currently investigated for both premixed and non-premixed flame modes. Since the designs proposed herein cause a severe disturbance across the jet shearing layers, the significant enlargement in flow strain rates and the enhancement of turbulent heat/active species mass transfer have the potential to extend the premixed flame stability limits. Furthermore, the mixing rates between the fuel and air bulk streams drive efficient reactions to enhance the combustion efficiency in non-premixed flames. In both flame modes, the heat transfer rates are enhanced and there is a subsequent reduction in the peak flame temperature to suppress the NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> emissions.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0957650913489295"><title>Experimental test rig and layout</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650913489295">Figure 1(a)</xref> shows the test rig commissioned for the current investigation. It comprises a natural gas cylinder (1) that is equipped with the pressure regulator (2), a centrifugal air blower (18) and orifice meter arrangements (4) and (17) to measure the flow rate across the air and fuel feeding pipes (3) and (16), respectively. The flow switch between the premixed and non-premixed flame modes is employed with the aid of the ball valves (13) and (15). In this sense, valve (13) is closed while valve (15) is opened such that the fuel is admitted through the fitting (14) into the premixing chamber (5) to which the flame arrestor (6) is fitted for operating in the premixed flame mode. As the valve positions are interchanged, the fuel feeding tube (16) extends as a central pipe inside the cylindrical furnace tube (7), while the air is introduced alone from the lateral inlet for operating the non-premixed flame mode. An eccentric shaft is attached through the bracket (8) to a pulley driven by the AC induction motor (10) which is supported by the concrete base (12) via the metallic frame (11). Two designs are examined for the rotary part arrangement. The specific details of both designs are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650913489295">Figure 1(b) to (d)</xref>. In the first design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650913489295">Figure 1(b)</xref>), the parts highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650913489295">Figure 1(a)</xref> are combined with other parts that are denoted by the letters from A to F. In this regard, the pulley (9) drives the pulley (C) through a belt (D) with the speed ratio required. While pulley (C) revolves around the stationary pipe (7) utilizing the ball bearing (F), the bolt (E) is threaded to the bracket (8) which in turn transfers the rotary motion via the bolt (B). In consequence, the shaft (A) rotates eccentrically inside the pipe (7). The eccentric shaft has one of the cross-sections shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650913489295">Figure 1(c)</xref> (to be either circular, elliptical, squared, triangular or triple blade rotor). The dimensions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650913489295">Figure 1(c)</xref> correspond to equal cross-sectional areas. As the hydraulic diameter changes, the variation in the hydraulic diameter ratio consequently follows the values tabulated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0957650913489295">Table 1</xref>.

<p>In the second design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650913489295">Figure 1(d)</xref>), the fuel feeding tube (16) is split at its end into two parts: the one at the bottom is stationary; while the one at the top is rotating. In this case, the latter part revolves with both the pulley (C) and the central gear (II) as one unit relative to three stationary parts; namely the fuel tube bottom part, the furnace tube (7) and the gear rack (GG). The sleeve (CC) delivers the rotary motion from the pulley to the fuel tube top part to rotate relative to the furnace tube using a properly sized ball bearing, while the sleeve (AA) supports the bottom part of the ball bearing (BB). The pinion gear (KK) represents a group of three gears that exhibit planetary motion around the central gear (II) via the rack (GG), where the pinion gear shown on the right holds one of the different eccentric shaft shapes such as the triple blade rotor (HH). The ring (LL) and the centrally punched disc (JJ) (which is welded to the revolving part of the fuel tube (16)) set an annular path for the pinion to revolve around its axis as well as along the rack. In the non-premixed flame mode, four pipes circumferentially attached to the combustor introduce the air at the plane (DD) so as to be admitted within the annular space. In some experimental runs, the configuration of radially inward fuel injection is tested (wherein the fuel flow across the pipe (16) is switched into four opposing ports at the plane (FF)). In the premixed flame mode, the circumferentially opposing inlet pipes are displaced from the plane (DD) to the plane (EE) such that the opposing mixture streams impinge onto the central pipe top part (through which the fuel supply is no longer provided).</p>
<p>The teeth coupling inside the planetary gear assembly is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650913489295">Figure 1(e)</xref> (where the gear (A) drives the three pinions (B), (C) and (D) along the rack (E)). In the current design, one of the planetary gears A, B and C are clutched to the eccentric shaft which consequently acquires combination of self-revolution and planetary motion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650913489295">Figure 1(f)</xref> describes the resultant evolution of a small-scale vortex beside the original large-scale one so as to enlarge the turbulent kinetic energy. Such feature of combining vortex generation in the second design strengthens the bulk mixing between the hot and cold regions so as to increase the rate of advection across the wall boundary layer.</p>
<p>In the second design, the premixed flame is stabilized between plane EE and plane FF in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650913489295">Figure 1(d)</xref>; while the diffusion flame has its stoichiometric envelope starting very close to the central pipe exit and extending (for most flame cases) beyond the exit section of pipe (7). The measurement plane for comparing the exhaust species concentrations was thus selected to be the plane that lies 30 cm from the exit of pipe (7). The wall heat transfer conditions are determined by performing the energy balance on cooling water flowing across a copper tube spirally wound around pipe (7). With the aid of water flow rate measurement, the rate of heat transfer from the flame to the wall is calculated based on the water inlet and outlet temperatures that are recorded by thermometers.</p>
<p>A hot wire anemometer with a telescoping probe and a digital display is used to measure the velocity and turbulence intensity. The anemometer probe is manufactured from a wire (of 5 µm diameter) which has a velocity measuring range of 20 m/s, resolution of 0.1 m/s and accuracy of ± 3.5%. A platinum-13% rhodium/platinum thermocouple with 0.25 mm wire diameter is utilized for measuring the time-averaged flame temperatures, having been corrected for convection and thermal radiation from the thermocouple bead. The time-averaged NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic>, CO and HC concentrations in the exhaust gas streams are measured across the flame exit section by an electrochemical gas analyzer (EUROTRON, GREENLINE-MK2). The exhaust gas sample is aspirated at a flow rate of 1550 cm<sup>3</sup>/min. The analyzer is equipped with a water-cooled stainless steel probe having its end tapered to a 3.0 mm diameter for minimizing the disturbances on the flame. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0957650913489295">Table 2</xref> shows the uncertainty values corresponding to both systematic and fluctuation errors of the respective quantities currently measured. For the thermocouple, the percentage uncertainty in the gas temperature was calculated based on the minimum gas temperature encountered within the measuring domain of interest, which was about 376 ℃ at the burner downstream regions. In this case, the systematic error of 0.4% represents an absolute error value of 1.5° while the fluctuation error of 8.3% represents 31°. Based on a temperature difference of 285° that will be shown between the no-swirl and the maximum swirl level, the absolute errors of 1.5° and 31°, respectively, represent percentage errors of 0.53% and 10.8%. A traverse mechanism is utilized for positioning the thermocouple and the sampling probe along the measurement plane. A Nikon digital camera with 2560 × 1920 pixels and a shutter speed of 1/4000 s is used to indicate the flame qualitative features.

<p>A numerical simulation is commissioned to reveal the fluid dynamics/turbulence aspects of the current flame configuration with the dimensions typically encountered in the experiments. An ANSYS CFX code is utilized to address the velocity field and the turbulence properties for both cold and reacting flow conditions. A CFX mesh is generated for the geometrically built-in model, while a mesh-adaptation procedure is employed to resolve the reactive flow structures at the higher gradient regions. The governing equations comprising the set of elliptical differential equations are solved for mass, momentum, species concentrations and energy as previously described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650913489295">11</xref></sup> while a two equation <italic>k–ɛ</italic> model is used for the turbulence closure.</p>
<p>Plug flow boundary conditions are used to specify the inlet stream velocities at the circumferential and central boundaries, while a Dirichlet no-slip boundary condition is set along the burner circular wall as well as around the eccentric shaft. Hexahedral face meshes with multi-block structured grid are used for the problem discretization to resolve the flow strain pattern, where the starting number of cells is 5024 × 800.</p>
<p>A model of detailed kinetics is employed for methane/air combustion via the GRI-Mech 3.0 mechanism to account for NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> reactions through the thermal and prompt routes as well as the N<sub>2</sub>O and re-burn mechanisms according to Li and Williams.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650913489295">12</xref></sup> A finite rate/eddy dissipation model is used to account for the effects of turbulence/chemistry interaction, wherein the reaction rate source term is the minimum of both the Arrhenius rate and the mixing rate (in which the reactions are governed by the large eddy mixing time scale, <italic>k</italic>/<italic>ɛ</italic>). The turbulent transport terms are simulated according to the gradient transport approximation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957650913489295">13</xref></sup> involving both turbulent Schmidt number and the eddy viscosity (which is calculated as a function of <italic>k</italic> and <italic>ɛ</italic>). The three-dimensional computational domain is represented by a staggered/non-uniform grid system. The numerical accuracy is second order in both space and time, where the steady-state solution is reached within relative convergence of 10<sup>−6</sup>.

<p>Using a stretching factor of 10 for the mesh-adaptation procedure, the residuals from each run are computed and the mesh size is automatically reduced in proportion to the amount of residuals. A sensitivity analysis was performed for the mesh size to validate the results. A nominal mesh size of 0.100 mm was considered satisfactory for accurate model prediction as verified by <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0957650913489295">Table 3</xref> (which, respectively, shows the maximum change that takes place relative to each local flow property across the whole domain upon reducing the mesh size). It is shown that refining the nominal mesh size further to 0.083 mm only results in an overall maximum value of 1.1% for the change in the computational values with respect to the previous mesh size values.

<p>A minimum spatial step of 0.01 mm is thus used at the reaction zones to assure a degree of fineness that is sufficient to adequately simulate the detailed chemical reactions. Unity Lewis number is assumed for all species, such that both turbulent Schmidt number and Prandtl number are set equal to 0.7. Both the turbulent viscosity and the corresponding turbulence scale are obtained via solving the turbulent kinetic energy and the dissipation rate equations by setting the inlet turbulence level at 5%.</p>
<p>The computations are initiated by involving the successive velocity profile solutions at each moment within the rotor periodic time. Afterwards, the temporal velocity gradient associated with the velocity variation between each two successive profiles is set as the transient term in the Navier Stokes equation to update the velocity values in order to yield the contribution to the turbulent kinetic energy. Aided by the values calculated for the turbulent viscosity, the resultant velocity magnitudes are also used to obtain the transient solution for the mass fractions and temperature using the relevant heat and mass transport coefficients. Consequently, the delay period associated with combustion can be calculated. Since the rotary shaft introduces a positive acceleration into its front regions and a negative acceleration into its rear regions, such spatially separated effects yield additional velocity gradients to enrich the local turbulent kinetic energy in each region.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650913489295">Figure 2</xref> shows the computational results of the velocity contours across the pipe as affected by the shaft eccentric motion within one revolution (for a diameter ratio of 0.4). In the group (a) of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650913489295">Figure 2</xref>, the patterns describe instants that are separated by 40° (where the last instant at 320° is typically followed by the position 0° to repeat the cyclic action). In the group (b), the corresponding velocity change in the local velocity is represented for a rotational speed of 3000 r/min. In this sense, as the shaft is totally displaced 40° anti-clockwise between the successive positions selected, a region of velocity gain appears at the shaft rear side (where the flow is re-admitted behind the shaft) and a region of velocity deficit is pronounced at the frontal side (where the flow is blocked by the shaft). It can be inferred that the velocity gradient terms (<italic>U</italic>d<italic>U</italic>/d<italic>x</italic>) and (<italic>V</italic>d<italic>U</italic>/d<italic>y</italic>) within the boundary layer of the available flow area (across the <italic>x–y</italic> domain) are important. The higher their values are, the less pulsation effect is pronounced. In this case, the terms (<italic>U</italic>d<italic>U</italic>/d<italic>x</italic>) and (<italic>V</italic>d<italic>U</italic>/d<italic>y</italic>) in the momentum equation become comparable to the temporal velocity gradient (d<italic>U</italic>/d<italic>t</italic>) and hence little enhancement in the turbulence production rates is produced. On the other hand, if these velocity spatial gradient terms are relatively small<bold>,</bold> the temporal velocity gradient (d<italic>U</italic>/d<italic>t</italic>) makes a bigger contribution to the original strain in the flow for appreciable enhancement in the turbulent kinetic energy production rates. In this sense, increasing the rotational speed is preferable (particularly for the larger rotating shaft diameters whereby the correspondingly smaller flow passages originally have higher spatial velocity gradients). Combining the increase in both the rotational speed and the shaft diameter produces stronger swirl (as more streams get driven intensively by the eccentric shaft) and more severe disturbances (where there is less chance for the boundary layer to be fully developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957650913489295">14</xref></sup>). There is, however, a limit for increasing the shaft diameter in the non-premixed flame mode (so as to allow positioning of the central fuel injector).

Due to the eccentric shaft position, there is a peak velocity (located off-center at <italic>r</italic> = 20 mm in conjunction with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650913489295">Figure 2(a)</xref>). While the local velocity (at <italic>r</italic> = 10, 20, 30 and 40 mm) exhibits a pulse shape (with a growing and a declining velocity style close to the start and the end of the cycle, respectively), the local velocity (at <italic>r</italic> = 0) shows slight fluctuations around an average value. This takes place since the shaft in this case has a diameter of 40 mm such that its cross-section trajectory does not intersect the pipe centerline, thus causing only slight alternation in the central velocity magnitude.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650913489295">Figure 3(b)</xref> indicates the correspondingly local velocity differences across the time between two successive instants. It is noted that the maximum shearing effects due to the velocity difference occurs twice in the cycle at <italic>r</italic> = 20 mm (in accordance with the peak velocity), but the peak velocity gain and deficit are separated by a long interval of zero strain rate. Similarly, at <italic>r</italic> = 30 and <italic>r</italic> = 40 mm; although the velocity difference peaks still have significant magnitudes, a large portion of the cycle is void of any velocity fluctuation (where the flow exhibits a condition that may be prone to laminarization). It follows that the optimum position for maintaining the turbulence activity is along the burner centerline such that it also fits the position of the fuel port in diffusion flames in order to severely strain the bulk fuel and air masses that are transported into the stoichiometric flame envelope. The closer the centerline is, the more continuous the velocity profile and the oxygen supply are (as the regions of positive and negative velocities are interchanged more frequently). Therefore, there is no discontinuity in the oxygen supply so as to eliminate any CO emissions (such as those encountered by Charon et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957650913489295">15</xref></sup> due to the sequence of pulsating the flow of fuel and air supplies via rotary valves). On the other hand, for premixed flames the time-averaged velocity gradient is cyclic and imposes high rates of strain onto the reaction sheet.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650913489295">Figure 3(c)</xref> shows the effect of shaft diameter on the local velocity variation (at <italic>r</italic> = 40 mm). Upon increasing the shaft diameter (<italic>D</italic>) from 40 to 80 mm, the peak velocity difference increases which consequently leads to higher turbulence production rates. The dashed lines correspond to the velocity differences for the circular rotor, while the solid lines correspond to the intensities of turbulent fluctuations (as measured by the hot wire anemometer for the triple blade rotor at the same radial position <italic>r</italic> = 40 mm). These cold flow features favorably affect the reactive flow scenarios. In this sense, at the higher reactive flow velocities (corresponding to increasing the shaft diameter) the higher turbulent kinetic energies extend the flame stability limits. On the other hand, for diffusion flames; the correspondingly higher air velocities shorten the flame (as it becomes dominated by a compact zone of air supply for enhancing the combustion efficiency). In both flame modes, the turbulent transport is significantly enhanced by involving severe strain rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957650913489295">16</xref></sup> In addition to increasing the strain rate by increasing the rotational speed up to 4500 r/min, the counter-rotating vortices in the second design increase the intensity of velocity fluctuation to 13.7% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650913489295">Figure 3(d)</xref>).</p>
<p>The significant increase in the production rates of turbulence energy has been computationally verified, where the <italic>k–ɛ</italic> model results reveal the variation of the turbulent kinetic energy and eddy dissipation rate with the length scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650913489295">Figure 3(e)</xref>). According to Luznik et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957650913489295">17</xref></sup> within the dissipation spectrum most of the dissipation occurs at scales that are larger than the Kolmogorov scale. The peak turbulent kinetic energy increases with the Strouhal number consistently for all the solid shapes investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650913489295">Figure 3(f)</xref>). The combined effects of increasing the diameter and frequency produce such variation in the turbulent kinetic energy versus the Strouhal number (where there is a consistent increase in the swirl strength and the rate of axial velocity perturbation). Between the Strouhal number values of 0.0 and 0.6, the change was imparted by varying the rotational speed. Between the Strouhal number values of 0.6 and 0.9, the rotational speed was fixed and the hydraulic diameter was varied between the values of 3, 3.5, 4 and 4.5 cm to yield the Strouhal number values of 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9, respectively. It is evident that the turbulent kinetic energy consistently increases with the overall variation in the Strouhal number.</p>
<p>Due to the combination of vortices in the second design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650913489295">Figure 1(f)</xref>), there are regions for both summative and subtractive velocities (such that the shearing effects are magnified). Since the turbulent kinetic energy severely increases with the velocity gradients, the resultant peak turbulent kinetic energy in the second design is much higher than that in the first design. Inasmuch as the temporal velocity gradient increases in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650913489295">Figure 3(c)</xref> with the diameter (as does the swirl strength), the turbulent kinetic energy has consistently been found to increase with the diameter ratio. However, the velocity shearing strain across the rotor due to its self-induced vortex decreases with increase in the separation between the counter-acting velocities. As a result of such counter-acting effects, the turbulent kinetic energy relative increase between the two designs attains a maximum of 35.8% at the diameter ratio of 0.41. The enhancement of flow shearing thus gets slightly saturated in the second design as the shaft diameter increases. In both designs, the recirculation of combustion hot products onto the eccentric shaft upper face (in its wake region) assists flame stabilization.</p>
<p>The strain rate imposed in the current design can be linked to the flow features pertaining to the swirling flow such that the various features can be combined in the current designs. In this case, the central recirculation zone (CRZ) that is the central core for reverse flow in the swirl burners co-exists in conjunction with the external recirculation zone (ERZ) developing at the corners. Both shearing flow zones are intensified by combining swirl and pulsation. Under such circumstances, the precessing vortex core exhibits unsteady flow strain corresponding to the reverse flow that takes place due to vortex breakdown. The flame contributes to the vortex breakdown where the combustion instabilities may create high pulsation levels in the velocity field to be responsible for combustion-induced vortex breakdown.</p>
<p>The use of the <italic>k–ɛ</italic> closure model is to reflect the qualitative effects of having the recirculation zones in the current designs. In spite of its limitations in fully representing the swirling flow features, it treats the different rotor cases by a unified simulation form for the turbulent kinetic energy resulting from the flow strain due to the combination of swirl and pulsation. Insofar as the Reynolds stress representation is the same, the comparative strain rates become meaningful for discussion. Furthermore, computational runs were performed utilizing large eddy simulation to verify the character of the main recirculation zone. While the CRZ is manifested by the velocity vectors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650913489295">Figure 3(g)</xref>, the turbulent kinetic energy in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650913489295">Figure 3(h)</xref> is shown to reflect the shearing impact across the streamlines. There is an under-prediction error of 16.7% in the peak turbulent kinetic energy and 13.2% in the average turbulent kinetic energy obtained by the <italic>k–ɛ</italic> closure model upon comparing their numerical values with the large eddy simulation results.</p>
<p>The computational runs with large eddy simulation showed qualitative agreement for the increase in both the eddy size and turbulent kinetic energy with the swirl ratio and confirmed the drag coefficient variation among the different shapes. The maximum length scale obtained as [<italic>k</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650913489295">1</xref>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957650913489295">5</xref></sup>/<italic>ɛ</italic>] via the <italic>k–ɛ</italic> model was found to increase by 21.8% upon employing the large eddy simulation (wherein direct numerical simulation is implemented for the large eddies). The peaks of turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate become thus more separated in comparison to what is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650913489295">Figure 3(e)</xref> (which presents the Fourier transform resolving of length scales under rotating flow conditions pertaining to 4500 r/min).</p>
<p>There are more recent works relevant to the features encountered in the current work. Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957650913489295">18</xref></sup> investigated an un-confined/double swirl burner together with the response to sinusoidal variation of the mass flow rate in the pilot jet by the aid of large eddy simulation. They highlighted that the swirl-generated CRZ utilized to stabilize the flame is usually unstable but precesses around the axis of rotation. Downstream of the CRZ, turbulence becomes more isotropic. The corresponding flame front was seen to be quite wrinkled, thus reflecting the large-scale interaction between the flame and turbulence. Under swirling/pulsating conditions, the large structures have the form of ring vortices compared to the spiral type vortices in the swirling/non-pulsating case. The chemical reaction occurs in the vortex ring structure and hence it produces a fluctuation in the heat release, which in turn excites combustion-driven oscillations. Their results are thus particularly useful for highlighting the inner structures of the swirling flows with and without pulsation, where the current burner having its own design features represents extension to their swirl/pulsation flow combination. While the current burner design stimulates shearing stresses that could be supportive to the ones already established in commercialized burners, it may be associated with a thermal radiation contribution from the solid rotor as a result of interaction with the flame.</p>
<p>Due to the complicated nature of the swirling flow structures, more research works have been continuously performed. For instance, Chmielewski et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957650913489295">19</xref></sup> investigated the velocity profiles in the strong swirling flow that leads to complete recirculation. The tangential and radial velocity components are responsible for generating the low pressure along the fresh mixture outflow. The depression is high enough to cause the reverse flow that creates the CRZ and the ERZ. Visualization of the flow features testified to the process of mixing of the flue gases with the flammable mixture within the combustion chamber. More recently, Valera-Medina et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957650913489295">20</xref></sup> investigated a swirling combustor with a confinement shape representative of gas turbine combustors. They characterized the time-dependent behavior of the CRZ which was shown to have an asymmetric lobed shape that is precessed about the central axis.</p>
<p>The advantage of the current designs lies in their ability to flexibly control the rotational speed to actively match the industrial load variation (with no limit on increasing the speed of rotation). The planetary gear design has the feature of changing the speed ratio between gears so as to modulate the turbulence scales (where extending the range of length scales is combined with the counter-rotating motion). The planetary movement is probably affecting the fundamental behavior of the flame and the appearance of its swirling inner structures. However, if a future design is made to accommodate a vane swirler in the central region of the planetary gear burner (where enough space is left to maintain the interior flow structures), the overall shearing effects may be increased.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650913489295">Figure 4(a)</xref> shows the increase in flame stability limit (under combustor wall adiabatic conditions) as the rotational speed increases from 0 to 4500 r/min (at which the swirl ratio and the Strouhal number reach respective values of 0.78 and 0.94 based on the stability limit flow velocity). The gain in the firing capacity for the two designs is attributed to the combined effects of augmenting the turbulent kinetic energy and enhancing the heat transfer rates between the reactive gases and the solid parts, where the respective roles can be verified separately. In this sense, the role of turbulence can be proved in the light of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650913489295">Figure 2(b)</xref>, wherein the cold flow temporal velocity gradient increases above 300 m/s<sup>2</sup> as the rotational speed reaches 4500 r/min (by the circular eccentric shaft). This respectively produces peak turbulent kinetic energies of 6.7 and 9.1 m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup> in the first and the second designs.

<p>The image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650913489295">Figure 4(b)</xref> shows the sustainable/bluish reaction zone spreading all over the burner cross-section by the triple blade rotor in the second design for a stoichiometric mixture at 4500 r/min. To make more use of the flame images, another image was recorded to comparatively show the consequence of switching to the other design and simultaneously having higher blockage ratio. In this case, image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650913489295">Figure 4(c)</xref> shows the flame cross-sectional pattern for the circular rotor in the first design with a hydraulic diameter ratio of 0.4, where there is less bluish spectrum intensity. Although the bluish intensity reflects the highly turbulent reaction zones corresponding to the swirling/pulsated flames, such bluish intensity is comparatively reduced and is also getting overlapped by the orange spectrum due to the metallic rotor overheating.</p>
<p>As the Strouhal number thus reaches 0.94, employing non-adiabatic wall conditions reveals that the percent of heat that is transferred to the cooling water jacket is 28.1% and 36.8%, respectively, for the circular and the triangular rotor (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650913489295">Figure 4(d)</xref> for the second design). As the triple blade rotor consistently enhances the heat transfer rates from the combustor to magnitudes higher than those of all other shapes at all rotational speeds, the heat transfer percent reaches 29.1% in the first design and 39.4% in the second design (both at 4500 r/min). While the pulsation imposed by the alternating shaft positioning increases the convective heat transfer rates similarly to the favorable results of Rocha et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957650913489295">21</xref></sup> with an acoustic field, the strongly induced swirl effect strengthens the heat transport activity across the pipe cross-section.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650913489295">3</xref></sup> Abdel Latif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957650913489295">14</xref></sup> concluded that combustion with pulsating flow augments the heat transfer since it contributes to reducing the resistance of the thermal boundary layer (as stated to have no chance to be fully developed).</p>
<p>It is pointed out that the flame stability limits vary with the Strouhal number among the different shapes and between the two designs in the same favorable trend by increasing the rotational speed as does the heat transfer percent. This testifies to the role of the internal heat recirculation under adiabatic conditions in extending the stability limit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650913489295">Figure 4(a)</xref>). In this regard, the rotary action simultaneously enhances the rates of heat transmission from the flame to the pipe wall within the boundary layer and the rates of heat recirculation internally across the reaction zones from the post-flame zone to the pre-flame zone. Inasmuch as the enhanced turbulent transport of heat through internal heat recirculation favorably sustains higher reaction rates, the extension in flame stability limits is coupled with the enhanced percent of heat that is externally transferred. The computations indicated that an increase of 43% in the heat transfer rate across the combustor wall is acquired via the swirl effect, while 57% increase is gained via the velocity cyclic effect (as attributed to the increase in turbulent kinetic energy due to each effect). Inasmuch as the shaft diameter has been used for the Strouhal number computation (so as to reflect the portion of the flow that is swirled), increasing the Strouhal number increases the impact of both swirl and pulsation on the flame stability and heat transfer. Bradley et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0957650913489295">22</xref></sup> stated that the flow instabilities produce severe flame wrinkling with a corresponding increase in the burning capacity and rate of heat transport.</p>
<p>Due to the enhanced heat transport in both designs, there is a consequent NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> emission reduction either with adiabatic or non-adiabatic operation (as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650913489295">Figure 5</xref> for the triple blade rotor in the second design). This is because the heat is either entrapped so as to extend the flame stability limit (with a consequent residence time reduction for decreasing the NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> emissions) or is significantly extracted to consequently reduce the post-flame temperatures for decreasing the NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> formation rates. The NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> emissions for the lean limit is the least (as the equivalence ratio limit decreases from about 0.56 to 0.50 between 0 and 4500 r/min for the NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> emissions to be dominated by the highest temperature drop). The NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> level thus approaches 10 ppm (which is less than that corresponding to the first design by 6 ppm).

</fig></p>
<p>The different shaft shapes (having the same cross-sectional area) produced different levels of impact on the combustion performance. This can be attributed to the corresponding difference in the wake character, which produces different intensities for the overall turbulence energy. Munson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0957650913489295">23</xref></sup> highlighted such shape dependence for laminar flow conditions as well as for turbulent flow conditions (wherein the flow separation is delayed to cause reduction in the drag coefficient). While the above results of the premixed flame performance were obtained experimentally, the wake character can be supported by the set of computational results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0957650913489295">Figure 6</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0957650913489295">Figure 6(a)</xref> represents the flow wakes around the different cross-sections as the rotor revolves anti-clockwise, while the possible cases of orientation for each shape are represented (in the order from 1 to 8). While there is one orientation for the circular shaft with respect to the burner center (exhibiting two vortices in the sketch (1)), the triple blade rotor nearly has no sensitivity to its orientation (as there are usually three vortices corresponding to each wake of the three blades in the sketch (2)). The triangular cross-section has three wakes for the orientation in the sketch (3) and two vortices in the sketch (4). Since the intensities of the turbulent kinetic energies pertaining to these vortices merge further downstream, the three vortices distinguish the triangular solid rotor and the triple blade rotor (where the latter is further characterized by a higher drag coefficient and more flow guidance). While both the elliptical and squared shapes consistently have two vortices at any relative orientation (in the sketches (5)–(8)), the size of recirculation vortex pertaining to the elliptical cross-section has the highest sensitivity to the relative orientation. In this case, the drag coefficient reaches the peak value when the major axis is oriented perpendicular to the flow direction as shown in the sketch (6). Such sensitivity, however, decreases by the second design (via the self-revolution of the rotor during its rotation around the burner centerline). The superior performance of the triple blade rotor is due to the existence of three vortex zones (at any angular orientation with respect to the direction of flow stimulated around the shaft during rotation). This can be justified with the aid of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0957650913489295">Figure 6(b) and (c)</xref> (respectively presenting the vorticity magnitudes and the streamline pattern).
<fig id="fig6-0957650913489295" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Illustration of the reactive flow vortices: (a) prediction of the wakes associated with the rotor different cross-sections by variable orientation; (b) the computational results of the vorticity magnitude for the triple blade rotor; (c) the streamlines as computed around the triple blade rotor; (d) highlighting the combination of vortices to sustain ignition.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650913489295-fig6.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The momentary movement of the shaft is represented by a frontal view in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0957650913489295">Figure 6(d)</xref> (wherein the shaft is displaced within the burner to the left such that the vortices pertaining to the rear face wake are stimulated around the shaft). As the shaft moves, it approaches the flame portion that is settled at the left side while it leaves a fresh mixture in the wall boundary region (such that the interaction of the two wake vortices on top of the shaft provides the heat and mass transport necessary to sustain continuous ignition). Inasmuch as the velocity cyclic variation periodically provides a severe increase in the turbulent kinetic energy, there is a significant enhancement in the rate of temperature rise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0957650913489295">24</xref></sup> This, in turn, reduces the ignition time for the fresh mixture in the wall boundary region at the shaft rear face. As the reactive flow velocity increases to such extent that the flame is displaced downstream toward the shaft upper edge, it effectively increases the preheating length and gives the chance for the vortices (that are stimulated both around and above the eccentric shaft) to merge. For both group<bold>s</bold> of vortices, the recirculation eddy turn over time affects the flame stability limits since synchronization should be achieved between the time for the fresh mixture to pass through the near-wall ignition zone and the time for receiving the hot parcels at the wake zones. Since both times decrease by coupling the high rotational speeds with the high mixture flow rates, the extension in stability limit is acquired via increasing the speed of rotation. In this regard, the time to pass through the ignition zone decreases at higher mixture flow rates while the time for transporting heat within the wake vortex decreases as the flow velocity around the rotating shaft increases at higher speeds of rotation. It is thought that the flame extinguishes beyond the stability limit as the flame lifts off above the shaft upper edge where there is no further preheating length such that the chemical reaction ceases due to the over-supply of reactants.</p>
<p>There is also a contribution from the gas acceleration (due to combustion) to the increase in peak turbulent kinetic energy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957650913489295">25</xref></sup> At longer ignition delay conditions, there exists a larger phase shift between the flow strain due to acceleration and the original pulsating flow disturbance; while the phases shift decreases by a shorter ignition delay. The ignition delay is shortened at high rotational speeds via the enhanced heat transfer rates from the exhaust gases and the combustor wall (where there is more interference between the exhaust gases and the wall boundary) to increase the kinetic limit within each combustion cycle. In this regard, the severe corrugations in the flame sheet enhance the turbulent reaction rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0957650913489295">26</xref></sup> such that more folding of the reactive layers takes place as the strain rate increases by increasing the speed of rotation and shaft diameter. At the correspondingly higher values of the Strouhal number, there is a wide spectrum of vortices to accommodate intensive mass entrainment;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957650913489295">27</xref></sup> thus, representing an effective mixing gate between the mixture in the pre-flame zone and the hot products in the post-flame zone. The swirl thus increases the interfacial area between the different regions of the flame (where the combined strain in the three-dimensional scope sustains combustion of the over-supplied mass of reactants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0957650913489295">28</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>The flame stabilization plane was experimentally noticed to be displaced upward as the mixture flow rate increased to the extent of reaching the stability limits shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650913489295">Figure 4(a)</xref>, beyond which the flame blew out. In the light of such finding, the flame extinction thus occurs due to a deficit in the heat portion that is transferred upstream to match the chemical reaction rates. The blow-out limits may be also attributed to the flame stretch. Yang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0957650913489295">29</xref></sup> stated that extinction by flame stretch occurs when the strain rate in the flow is increased, thus decreasing the Damköhler number (which is the ratio of a characteristic flow or diffusion time to a characteristic chemical reaction time). As the Damköhler number is reduced, the fuel burning rate is gradually decreasing until a critical value is attained when the flame abruptly extinguishes. The flame extinction by such flame stretch may significantly contribute to the attribution of the flame stability limits. In this case, the flow velocity increases such that the subsequent increase in the flame stretch causes extinction in addition to the effect of reducing the heat transfer role.</p>
<p>The combined effect of stretch and heat transfer as found in the current work discussion resembles the analysis of Dixon-Lewis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0957650913489295">30</xref></sup> who used numerical methods to examine the combined effects of stretch and upstream heat loss on the properties of a stoichiometric laminar premixed methane–air flame. A fresh combustible mixture was discharged toward the stagnation plane from identical coaxial/plug flow nozzles maintained at constant temperature and separated by a fixed distance (where the upstream heat loss to the nozzle takes place). As the stretch rate was varied (via changing the nozzle inlet velocity), high- and low-stretch extinction limits were observed. In the work of Ju et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0957650913489295">31</xref></sup> attention was paid to the combined effect of radiative heat loss and stretch. They stated that the flame is extinguished at high-stretch rates due to stretch and is quenched at low-stretch rates due to radiation loss.</p>
<p>By defining the hydraulic diameter ratio between the solid shape and the combustor, the extension<bold>s</bold> in flame stability limit for the first design (in addition to the reduction in NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> emissions) are plotted versus such non-dimensional parameter as experimentally varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650913489295">Figure 7</xref>). As noted, increasing the hydraulic diameter ratio decreases the gap available for the axial flow and thus increases the velocity and turbulence impact to sustain higher reactive flow rates (with less residence time for NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> emissions). The increase in shaft diameter also enlarges the wake regions and increases the flow portion that is swirled. For small and intermediate values of the diameter ratio, the solid shapes acquire lower stability limits than those of the triple blade rotor (since its reactive flow is accompanied by more wakes and higher vortical intensities, where each blade moves against the flow similar to a baffle). Nearly when the diameter ratio exceeds 0.65, the stability limits obtained from the different solid shapes are comparable to those of the triple blade rotor (as the flow cross-section significantly decreases such that it strongly increases the rate of velocity pulsation). Due to such favorable features, the measured flame temperatures showed a fairly uniform distribution at the combustor exit plane for all shapes (where the different shapes were characterized by an average temperature between 1139 ℃ and 1424 ℃ under non-adiabatic conditions).

<p>The second design was undertaken to enable the active control through more parameters. In this sense, the planetary gear rotation has more flexibility in varying the blockage rotational speed and also provides counter-rotating vortices. The suspension of the rotating blockage had some interference problems with the flame in the first design due to overheating of the bearing which was thus displaced downward in the second design. In both cases, less overheating problems were encountered by having the cooling water jacket or by combusting lean fuel/air mixtures.</p>

<p>Since the periodic time of pulsation decreases closer to the centerline (for an eccentric shaft diameter less than the combustor radius), the central fuel jet positioning is the optimum in comparison to the lateral positioning that is associated with a periodic deficiency of air at each port. The various results discussed for the non-premixed flame mode correspond to experiments. The images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650913489295">Figure 8(a)</xref> compare the flame length reduction between 0 and 4500 r/min for the circular shaft (corresponding to the second design). The flame length significant reduction can be attributed to the impact of enhanced turbulent transport into the thickened reaction zone by large and small scales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0957650913489295">32</xref></sup> as testified by the temperature fluctuations that reach a maximum deviation of 97 ℃ from the mean value at Sr = 0.78 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650913489295">Figure 8(b)</xref>). As compared to a maximum deviation of 22 ℃ at Sr = 0.00, the largest eddy size in the reaction zone can be stated to increase by 341%. The magnitude of peak flame temperature decreases with the rotational speed (from Sr = 0.00 to Sr = 0.78), since the air is supplied in overall excess of 25% in such non-premixed flame condition. Consequently, increasing the rotational speed increases the rates of entrainment into the flame zone so that the excess air provided locally in most of the regions reduces the flame temperature below its peak value pertaining to the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio.

</fig></p>
<p>The pulsating effect mainly stretches the velocity component (that is parallel to the shaft), while the swirling effect mainly stretches the two horizontal components such that an intensive three-dimensional strain is currently achieved by combining pulsation and swirl. Such favorable combination extends the kinetic limit for reactions that may not keep pace with the delivery rates of reactants when only one effect works. This is testified by recalling that if only pulsation was involved there would be an optimum Strouhal number for matching the reaction time scale with the mixing time scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0957650913489295">33</xref></sup> Similarly, as the mixing achieved by swirl may be saturated, the corrugations pertaining to the pulsation effect further stretch the reaction zone to sustain reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0957650913489295">34</xref></sup> Therefore, the combination of swirl and pulsation sets a continuous limit for enhancing the rates of mixing and combustion. This allows effective use in industrial furnaces such that continuous improvement is achieved beyond the optimum working conditions by continuously employing the additional strain of swirl or pulsation.</p>
<p>The visible flame length reduction is verified by a thermal flame length reduction. In this regard, the peak flame temperature recorded for each flame indicates that the thermal flame length is severely shortened from the no-rotating to the rotating condition (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0957650913489295">Figure 9(a)</xref> for the second design). An intensive flame with a compact reaction zone is thus driven by the increase of 193 ℃ in the flame average temperature for the rotational speed increase between 0 and 2500 r/min, while the increase from 0 to 4500 r/min increases the average flame temperature by about 486 ℃. Rocha et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957650913489295">21</xref></sup> stated that the acoustic field generates zones of intense mixture of reactants in the flame region. Their experiments showed the reduction in flame length by the increase in acoustic amplitude. Due to the strong effect of swirl in the current burner, the peak flame temperature is located at the outer radii (since the reaction zones are intensified at the outer radii under the centrifugal effects of swirl), but its magnitude decreases with the rotational speed (for the second design in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0957650913489295">Figure 9(b)</xref>).
<fig id="fig9-0957650913489295" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Comparative combustion characteristics for the different rotors vs. the rotational speed in the second design: (a) measured thermal flame length; (b) experimental values for the peak flame temperature and (c) CO exhaust emissions as obtained from experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650913489295-fig9.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0957650913489295">Figure 9(c)</xref> shows the reduction in the peak CO exhaust emissions from the second design as the rotational speed increases up to 4500 r/min (at Sr = 0.78 and St = 0.94). The pulsation effect contributes to the mixing enhancement as the pulsating field increases the mixing rates between reactants via the convective processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957650913489295">21</xref></sup> such that pulsation reduces the pollutant emissions pertaining to incomplete combustion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0957650913489295">35</xref></sup> The squared and triangular rotors exhibit CO emissions lower than those of the circular and elliptical ones, since their more favorable wake regions enrich the role of recirculation for having more intensive combustion. Munson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0957650913489295">23</xref></sup> stated that the cross-sections with sharp corners favor the flow separation (with higher drag coefficients and stronger recirculation zones) in comparison to the smoothed shapes such as the elliptic one. The CO emission differences between the four shapes are more pronounced at the higher speeds. This confirms the dominating effect of increasing the turbulence levels within the boundary layer at high values of Reynolds number (at which the flow is more prone to separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0957650913489295">36</xref></sup>). There is a similar reduction in the HC emissions for the same solid shapes by increasing the diameter ratio in the first design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0957650913489295">Figure 10(a)</xref>), where the emissions reach values as low as 0.1% with the triangular rotor beyond the diameter ratio of 0.3. The CO and HC emissions reflect high combustion efficiencies via the higher rates of velocity perturbation. Qui et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0957650913489295">37</xref></sup> found that the mixing performance is improved by increasing the pulsation amplitude under a particular Reynolds number (provided that the period of vortices is smaller than the residence time of flow within the mixing zone).

</fig></p>
<p>Since the favorable flow strain at higher rotational speeds reduces the local temperature peaks, there is a corresponding NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> reduction with the Strouhal number. This is shown for the triangular rotor at different hydraulic diameter ratios in the first design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0957650913489295">Figure 10(b)</xref>). The NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> decreases with the rotational speed due to the enhanced convective heat transfer from the flame to the wall (under non-adiabatic conditions). The favorable effect of increasing the hydraulic diameter ratio is directly attributed to increasing the size of wake regions.</p>
<p>The image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0957650913489295">Figure 11(a)</xref> shows the non-premixed flame quality for the second design with radially inward fuel injection. As the fuel jets are introduced laterally around the combustor wall, the yellowish zones are displaced from the centerline (depending on the position of the triple blade rotor relative to the two opposing ports). Denev et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0957650913489295">38</xref></sup> found that for a jet in a cross-flow the mixing enhancement by swirl is not found or at least not substantially observed. Upon switching to the central fuel injection, the bluish spectrum extends at the flame base to fill the whole combustor cross-section (as shown by the image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0957650913489295">Figure 11(b)</xref>), where the overall reaction zone extends in the vertical plane to get the bluish spectrum across a corrugated envelope. In this concern, Kartheekeyan and Chakravarthy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0957650913489295">39</xref></sup> stated that the fluctuation in flame area contributes to the fluctuation in heat release rate during a cycle of acoustic oscillations as characterized by the shear layer strength. The rolling of shear layers significantly enhance the mixing in diffusion flames in the same way as the flame stretch enhances the propagation speed in premixed flames.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0957650913489295">40</xref></sup> In the currently excited flames, the amplitude of pulsation is not externally controlled (but is dictated by the flow velocity at which reactions are sustained). A future study is commissioned to further enhance the radiation heat transfer by incorporating porous media downstream of the triple blade rotor. Additional works may be commissioned to reveal more aspects of aerodynamics pertaining to the complicated flow that arise<bold>s</bold> due to combining swirl and pulsation. While the current work reported flow field visualization only by computational fluid dynamics to highlight the features that makes the design suitable for intensification of industrial processes, those future studies may utilize tracing techniques for cold-flow experimental visualization.

<p>There are various applications that may incorporate the currently proposed designs. These applications include cold-flow mixers in the industrial field such as food industry, petrochemical processing activities and floating objects’ mixers in pump stations. In addition, the current mechanisms may be suitable for effective heat transfer across the different streams in heat exchangers, particularly in the power generation plants that utilize rotary air preheaters. The designs also fit the applications in boilers where a driver already exists aligned to the burner for operating a rotating cup atomizer. The intensification of heat transfer in some processes is possible such as in incinerators, while the employment of high rates of mass transfer may be found in air conditioning humidifiers which mix the air with moisture. The enhanced recirculation of heat and mass in combustion systems sustains combustion of poor combustible materials and lean fuel/air mixtures.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0957650913489295" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The sustainable firing rates and combustion efficiency have dramatically increased by employing eccentric blockage rotation in the flame at speeds that reach 4500 r/min. The swirl effect has been combined with the strain imposed via the pulsation effect, associated with the jet cross-section; to enrich the strain rates produced at the rotor wake regions. The results testified to the enhancement in the production rates of turbulence that drive more efficient heat/mass transport via increasing the flow strain and widening the spectrum of turbulence scales. A mixture velocity as high as 16.8 m/s and a heater efficiency magnitude above 36% could be sustained in the premixed flame mode, together with NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> emissions as low as 10 ppm. Such extension in the firing capacity provides a maximum heat flux of 0.972 MW/m<sup>2</sup> and is coupled to the feature of a compact furnace that accommodates a firing density of 38.8 MW/m<sup>3</sup>. Aided by the minimized emission levels of pollutants, the different designs are suitable for the industrial needs. The non-premixed flame could be shortened by 42% in accordance with an increase of 341% in the largest eddy size. The enlargement in the largest eddy size proves that the current designs are viable for use in flow mixers. The CO and HC emissions were thus reduced respectively to 513 ppm and 0.1% upon increasing the rotational speed from 0 to 4500 r/min. The favorable response of all designs to the rotational speeds in the range of 0–4500 r/min ensures that such active control technique is durable for variable load heat exchangers. While different rotor shapes have been interchanged via two burner designs seeking for the optimum performance, each design potentially serves as a prototype for furnaces to enhance the rates of heat transfer from the flames as well as to minimize the NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> emissions. The current designs facilitate active control in industry by providing flexible modulation of variables pertaining to revolution.</p>
