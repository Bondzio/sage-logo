<p>This special issue of <italic>Journal of Disability Policy Studies</italic> features a group of studies that conducted secondary analysis of two national databases: The “Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Studies (SEELS)” and the “National Longitudinal Transition Studies 2 (NLTS2).” Both of these databases were produced by SRI International through grant support from the U.S. Department of Education. Together, they provide comprehensive data on the special education system over an extended period of time. To date, the use of the SEELS and NLTS2 databases is limited because only a few studies have been conducted and published based on analyses of these databases, which have a tremendous amount of information that can inform policies and practices. This special issue is an attempt to enhance the use of these national data by collectively publishing manuscripts based on analyses of these databases.</p>
<p>Of the five articles included in this special issue, four analyzed data from the SEELS. Ju, Zhang, and Katsiyannis conducted structural equation modeling analyses to examine the reciprocal causal effect between academic self- concept and academic achievement with family SES and parent involvement as predictive factors. They found that academic achievement in early elementary years predicts later self-concept and self-concept in early elementary predicts later academic achievement. Duran and colleagues investigated the relationship between social skills and disciplinary actions and found that students with lower social skills ratings are much more likely to be subject to exclusion or disciplinary practices than peers with high social skills ratings. Based on this finding, the authors see the need to promote social skills training. Frew and colleagues examined the effect of school initiated outreach activities on parent involvement in school events. Their findings extends the current literature on parent involvement by providing empirical evidence to support efforts in getting parents involved in their children’s education. Duchnowski and colleagues described the level of involvement by parents of students with emotional disturbances. They found that those parents who received support services from schools are more involved in their children’s education than those who did not receive such services.</p>
<p>One of the five articles analyzed data from NLTS2. This was done by Zablocki and Krezmien who attempted to identify factors that might predict dropout of school by students with disabilities. Having an emotional/ behavioral disorder, receiving disciplinary actions, suffering from grade retention, and achieving lower than average grades were identified as risk factors for dropping out of school.</p>
<p>We hope these five articles inform the field of special education in reflecting its policies and practices in various areas at both elementary and secondary levels. We would like to thank the editors and staff of <italic>Journal of Disability Policy Studies</italic> for their support of this special issue and are grateful to the authors for contributing their scholarly work to this special issue.</p>
