<abstract>
<p>After praziquantel treatment for schistosomiasis, parasitological cure rates of 60%–90% are usual. Does this response to treatment correlate with the improvement in liver and bladder changes seen on ultrasound in children? This study shows that ultrasound is an effective way to evaluate liver and bladder changes caused by schistosomiasis infection in children and to assess treatment effects after mass treatment programmes.</p>

<p>The eggs of <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> and <italic>S. haematobium</italic>, when trapped in hepatic sinusoids or bladder mucosa, induce granulomatous lesions and deposition of extra cellular matrix along the portal vein branches in the liver or the bladder mucosa. The latter may lead to the development of periportal fibrosis or bladder wall masses, which are associated with a higher incidence of portal hypertension, variceal haemorrhage and bladder tumours.</p>
<p>Following a praziquantel dose of 40 mg/kg, parasitological cure rates of 60%–90% and egg count reduction rates of more than 90% are usual.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0049475513490422">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513490422">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reduction in the prevalence of periportal fibrosis and bladder wall lesions is central to the control of morbidity and mortality from schistosomiasis but there are only a few published reports on follow-up after treatment using ultrasound and none dealing only with children. Ultrasonographic findings of schistosomal liver changes and bladder lesions are well-correlated with histology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0049475513490422">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049475513490422">4</xref></sup> Is the reduction in egg counts based on stool and urine samples also accompanied by a resolution or improvement of liver and bladder lesions?</p>
<p>This study assesses the efficacy of praziquantel to treat <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and <italic>S. haematobium</italic> changes in the liver and bladder of school children, as demonstrated by ultrasound.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0049475513490422"><title>Patients/method</title>
<p>The study was carried out at Chitokoloki Day School, located on the Zambezi River, North Western Province, Zambia. The students in the study cohort came from grades 1 to 12 and were aged between 5 and 22 years. Informed consent was obtained from the students as well as the village headmen and the school principals. At the initial study in 2010, 763 students were examined by ultrasound and treated with a 40 mg/kg dose of praziquantel. At follow-up, in 2011, 704 were examined by ultrasound and again treated. There were 397 students who were examined and treated in both years.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0049475513490422"><title>Hepatic ultrasound</title>
<p>The portable ultrasound machine used in the study was a Sonosite M-Turbo. A single radiologist performed the examinations using the protocol developed by the Niamey documents for the World Health Organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0049475513490422">5</xref></sup> and was blinded to the 2010 ultrasound results. The liver pattern was determined, based on an image pattern based assessment according to the WHO protocol and data by King et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0049475513490422">6</xref></sup> For image pattern A or B no further measurements were performed. Periportal wall thickness was recorded for liver patterns C, D, E and F which were increasing degrees of periportal thickening/fibrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0049475513490422">7</xref></sup> For periportal thickness, 2 or 3 second-order portal vein branches from the left and/or right portal veins were measured. The normal range was taken as two standard deviations above the mean height adjusted values for the periportal branch wall thickness (PBWT). Abnormalities of PBWT were graded between two and four standard deviations above the mean, or greater than four standard deviations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0049475513490422"><title>Renal tract ultrasound</title>
<p>Both the kidneys and the bladder were examined. Bladder wall changes were recorded as irregular, thickened, masses or pseudopolyps.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0049475513490422"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The students were subdivided into three fairly even age groups for analysis of the data and in keeping with previous published work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513490422">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0049475513490422">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0049475513490422">6</xref></sup> The proportion of students with normal or abnormal periportal thickening, as well as with positive or negative ultrasound findings, in each age group were compared using chi square analysis. All analyses were carried out using SPSS V 18.0 and a <italic>P</italic>-value of &lt;0.05 afforded significance.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0049475513490422" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Students were initially divided into four groups based on age: 5–10 years (<italic>n</italic> = 250); 11–15 years (<italic>n</italic> = 287); 16–20 years (<italic>n</italic> = 200); and &gt;20 years (<italic>n</italic> = 22). The fourth group was excluded from statistical analysis because of the small sample size and because these participants were part of the adult population.</p>
<sec id="sec7-0049475513490422"><title>Liver ultrasound findings</title>
<p>The 397 students examined in 2010 and again in 2011 were divided into age groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0049475513490422">Table 1</xref>). The only statistically significant result was a decrease in the most severe findings, that is, the group with &gt;4 standard deviation (SD) changes in PBWT, which decreased from 18.1% to 6.8% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01). However, when the overall positive findings were combined in 2010 (<italic>n</italic> = 166), 94/166 (56.6%) had resolution of PBWT (changes of 2SD to 4SD and &gt;4SD) and a further 27/166 (16.3%) improved (i.e. &gt;4SD to 2SD-4SD; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0049475513490422">Table 2</xref>). Hence, a total of 121 (72.9%) demonstrated resolution/improvement after only one treatment. This outcome is within the 60%–90% cure rate that would be expected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0049475513490422">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0049475513490422">2</xref></sup>

<p>Our study shows that the improvement in liver and bladder changes observed on ultrasound correlates with the parasitological cure rates after praziquantel, quoted in the literature.</p>
<p>The children with liver changes demonstrated a resolution and/or improvement rate of 72.9% for PBWT. The 72.9% improvement rate may be due to the relatively young age of our participants (5–20 years; mean age 12.9 years). A study by Berhe et al<italic>.</italic> investigated participants aged 7–68 years and the resolution/improvement rate was only 52.3%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0049475513490422">8</xref></sup> Cota et al<italic>.</italic> (2006) studied 84 children and adults, four years after treatment with oxamniquine and confirmed regression of fibrosis in 32%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0049475513490422">3</xref></sup> In a further study of patients aged 8–54 years, Ruiz-Guevara et al<italic>.</italic> demonstrated complete reversal of periportal lesions in 28.2% following treatment with praziquantel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0049475513490422">9</xref></sup> In our study, 56.6% of those treated had a complete resolution.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0049475513490422" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study shows that a reversibility of schistosomal based periportal thickening and bladder wall lesions is possible in children after treatment. In our cohort of students, a possible explanation for this is that periportal inflammatory changes may not have progressed to periportal fibrosis. Improvement rates in adults are thought to be lower because, with the progression of the disease to fibrosis, reversibility is not possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0049475513490422">10</xref></sup> The outcomes demonstrated here highlight that treatment changes are easily demonstrated on ultrasound and can provide useful information on the morbidity and mortality of those who have been treated.</p>
