<p>Sing, Sophie! (Candlewick Press, $6.99, 1999, ISBN 0-448-43906-9) is an inventive story of an Oklahoma girl who proclaims, “I got a song in my heart and it needs to come out!” Wearing a ten-gallon hat and strumming her guitar, Sophie—the main character—sings throughout the story in country and western style. Each verse of Sophie’s song is a humorous and inventive description of her life, and readers can easily imagine Sophie singing at top of her lungs.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>My dog ran off, my cat has fleas</italic>,</p>
<p><italic>My fish won’t swim, and I hate peas</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>But I’m a cowgirl through and through</italic></p>
<p><italic>Yippee-ky-yee! Yippee-ky-yuu!</italic></p>
<p>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1048371311434324">Dodds &amp; Litzinger, 1999</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And though children will likely enjoy, and eagerly join in with the rousing, “Yippee-ky-yee! Yippee-ky-yuu!” that ends each verse, no one in the story seems to appreciate Sophie’s songs. When each of her family members—Momma, sister Kate-Ellen, brother Willie, and Pa—hear her big voice, they all tell her to take that racket somewhere else. Author Dayle Ann Dodds makes it clear to readers that Sophie feels dejected, with her mumbles of “fiddle-faddle,” and “Oh, goose grease.” But, Sophie presses on, and finds different places to sing another verse. Illustrator, Rosanne Litzinger shows Sophie singing in the garden, at the creek, and leaning against the barn. With each new setting, Sophie’s audience dwindles to corn and crickets. When a storm hits, making baby Jacob cry, it is Sophie and her song that replaces his fear with giggles. And, as a result, her family asks her to sing another verse!</p>
<p>Dodds treats readers to rib-tickling rhymes and words that are delightful to read and sing aloud. Litzinger illustrates the story and Sophie’s verses with colorful and whimsical images of Oklahoma landscape, farm animals, and Sophie singing from the bottom of her heart and at the top of her lungs. Together, author and illustrator, create a humorous story; however, when readers look more closely they discover the authors have expertly shared children’s use of music in their lives. “Children think aloud through music. They socialize, vent emotions, and entertain themselves through music” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1048371311434324">Campbell, 2010</xref>, p. 4). Yet, children’s musicking is frequently unrecognized or ignored by adults. The narrative of <italic>Sing, Sophie</italic> illuminates this familiar real-life experience for children who make music in meaningful ways even though others may tell them to be quiet or “Stop that noise.” In this story, Sophie’s singing is eventually validated, an outcome that may gently prod adult readers to validate the music making of the children in their classrooms and lives.</p>
<p>In addition to connecting to reading goals for children in kindergarten and primary grades, <italic>Sing, Sophie!</italic> has potential to create a veritable musical storm in the general music classroom. Lessons that link language to music described in this article include engaging children in discussing music and culture, singing Sophie’s song, playing a guitar and other classroom instruments, reading icons representing musical sounds, and creating music.</p>
<sec id="section1-1048371311434324">
<title>Read and Sing</title>
<p>The first step in using <italic>Sing, Sophie!</italic> in the music classroom is reading the book aloud to children. Use the melody from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1048371311434324">Figure 1</xref> to sing the verses of Sophie’s song as they appear in the text. After singing the last phrase, “Yippee-ky-yee! Yippee-ky-yuu!” invite the children to sing it again with you. Encourage continued participation in singing this part of Sophie’s song each time a verse occurs. By the time the children arrive at the sixth and final verse, most children will be singing at the top of their lungs just like Sophie.</p>

</fig>
<p>After reading, ask children questions about the story to promote their language comprehension and to prompt a discussion of music and culture. Suggested questions with anticipated answers include the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1048371311434324" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What did Sophie love to do? (Sing)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What were Sophie’s songs about? (They were about her, what she liked and didn’t like, and things that happened to her.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How did Sophie’s family react to her singing? (At first they told her to go away.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What happened in the story that changed their minds about Sophie’s singing? (A storm made the baby cry, and Sophie’s singing made him stop.)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Children’s answers to the above questions, however, are merely the beginnings of meaning making in reading. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1048371311434324">Cooper (1997)</xref> posited that teachers should prompt children to go beyond the surface information and dig deeper into the real meaning of the story. One of the deeper meanings is that music is a key feature of childhood. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1048371311434324">Campbell (2010)</xref> stated, music is a “childhood constant” that is meaningful in children’s lives (p. 216). As children listen to a story, they construct personal understandings of that story based on their unique background experiences. Therefore, teachers should prompt children to access prior knowledge to help them understand the story. However, teachers should avoid trivializing underlying concepts of text in an effort to activate prior knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1048371311434324">Hansen, Bernstorf, &amp; Stuber, 2007</xref>), and aid children in going beyond the surface information to dig deeper into the real meaning of the story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1048371311434324">Cooper, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>To prompt children to interact with the text at a deeper level, ask questions that invite them to interpret the text through their personal experiences. Each of the suggested questions and prompts that follow correspond in content with the more surface comprehension questions above. Thus, the questions are designed to work in tandem.</p>
<list id="list2-1048371311434324" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What kinds of things do you love to do, as much as Sophie loved to sing?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If you sang a song about your life, what would you sing about?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What does it feel like when others tell you to stop doing something? Or to go away? What can you do about it?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Have you ever helped someone not be scared of something? How did you help them feel better?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>When children interact with a story using their personal understandings to help them comprehend it, they experience what reading teachers term a <italic>transaction</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1048371311434324">McGee &amp; Richgels, 2011</xref>). A transaction with the text occurs when children use the story to understand themselves and the world they live in on a more abstract level. They begin to take the perspective of others—the characters in the story—and draw on evidence in the story to validate or refashion their own perspectives. Reading and discussing <italic>Sing, Sophie!</italic> provides music teachers with an opportunity to aid children’s interactions with the text, and possibly experience transactions related to how they use music in their lives.</p>

<title>Sing and Play</title>
<p>After reading the book aloud, perhaps an obvious next step in creating a musical storm, and connecting music and language is singing Sophie’s song, and playing “Sophie’s” guitar. Music education intern, Nicole Papadatos from Peabody Conservatory of Music in Baltimore, taught this subsequent lesson to kindergarten children at Pointers Run Elementary School in Maryland. She displayed the song lyrics on chart paper, and invited the children to read the lyrics of the song. To aid their reading fluency, she tracked the words as they read. Then the children sang the lyrics using the melody they heard when the story was read and sung to them during the initial lesson. After asking the children, “What instrument did Sophie play in the story?” she revealed that she had brought a guitar to accompany their singing. The children were delighted to sing the verse again while she accompanied them on guitar.</p>
<fig id="fig3-1048371311434324" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1048371311434324-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>To provide the children with an experience of playing the guitar, Ms. Papdatos invited individual children to strum the guitar while she held the instrument and fingered the chords. She allowed each child to begin strumming, and after a steady beat was perceived, cued the rest of the group to sing a verse of the song while the child strummed. By using several repetitions for each verse, the children worked on pitch matching and reading fluency simultaneously. Ms. Papadatos noted that during the lesson children were eager to repeatedly sing the same verse. She also reflected that when reading and singing new verses, children’s reading fluency was aided, and perhaps motivated, by the steady beat.</p>
<p>This author wrote the melody notated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1048371311434324">Figure 1</xref> so that it could be sung using only the tonic chord. Using a one-chord song makes it feasible for children to hold the instrument and strum a steady beat alone—just as they see Sophie do in the story. Music teachers may prefer to tune a ukulele to a single tonic chord, an option that provides an alternative to holding the instrument for children, and allow them to have an experience more closely related to the story and that may seem more authentic musically.</p>

<title>Create a Song</title>
<p>Music teachers may wish to invite children to write their own songs. Together, author and illustrator created an enjoyable story about where music fits into life and the purposes it serves. Sophie sings because she loves it; she has something to say, and she has stories to tell. Invite children to discover what lyrics they would write in a song about themselves. Prompt children to discover how Sophie’s song is packed with words that describe her life and express her emotions. Then, engage children in exploring funny words and rhymes to help tell their stories. Aid children in fashioning their words into a song, using the syllabic pattern of the verses. Use the melody notated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1048371311434324">Figure 1</xref>, or improvise a melody over tonic and dominant chords strummed on a guitar. Take a cue from Sophie, and sing with your heart, even if the melody and words are not quite perfect!</p>

<title>Read and Create</title>
<p>Children must “experience a concept or topic in multiple ways so that their emotional response will help them learn” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1048371311434324">Hansen et al., 2007</xref>, p. 65). Children encounter the topic of weather through reading and listening to the story, and later through discussing the plot. Music provides a unique and naturally pleasurable way to further understand this topic. Expressing experiences through music is an important function of music. The summer storm described in the story offers an opportunity to engage children in thinking about weather through sound. Included is a lesson sequence for helping children translate the experience of a storm to musical sounds and related symbols.</p>

<list-item><p>Connect children’s knowledge about storms to their musical thinking.

<list-item><p>Transfer the vocal sounds to instruments. Preselect a variety of instruments such as glockenspiels (rain), drums (thunder), slap stick (lightning), and maracas (wind).

<list-item><p>Assign individual children an instrument to play, and have them read the icons as you point to them. Then, invite individual children to “direct the storm” by pointing to the icons.

<title>Creating a Musical Storm</title>
<p>When Ms. Papadatos taught the music and language lesson outlined above, she instructed the children to play their instruments without talking and make only the musical sounds. One child responded excitedly, “Like a <italic>musical</italic> storm!” This child’s proclamation seemed the perfect summary for the series of music activities they experienced with <italic>Sing, Sophie!</italic> over two class meetings. The children who participated in these lessons used their language literacy skills of listening, reading, and speaking to promote their musical literacy skills of reading nontraditional notation, singing, playing instruments, and creating. And from a single children’s book, emerged a “musical storm” in the general music classroom.</p>
