<abstract>
<p>In response to the commentaries, we reflect on the pitfalls and opportunities that come with identifying and naming ‘Antipodean economic geographies’ and in particular emphasise the practical aspects of this decision. We also critically reflect on suggestions that we have brought such knowledges into a set of market relations, citing how the recently published International Benchmarking Review of UK Human Geography gives added salience to the intentions of our original paper. Finally, we note the useful ground clearing that these commentaries make for future debates around the politics and whereness of economic geographical knowledge production in new global contexts.</p>

<body>
<p>Our paper was motivated by two key intentions. First, was to begin a critical reflection about the types of economic geographies that are produced in and from the Antipodes and to raise awareness of the work of economic geographers in New Zealand and Australia who have shaped thinking and provided a guiding frame and leadership in regard to some key topics in economic geography. Our second intention was to create a dialogue that deliberately sutured two debates that so far have developed independently of each other, namely, the critical histories of economic geography and the postcolonial sensitivity rippling through some parts of the sub-discipline. Connell’s concept of Southern Theory provided a useful means of bringing these two dialogues into conversation; not least because it enabled us to question some of the assumptions that are central to viewing economic geography through a postcolonial gaze but also, as was demonstrated by the contributors of our paper, allowed us to suggest that the ‘core’ is already being spoken to and is appropriating knowledges and categories produced from elsewhere but which largely remains unacknowledged.</p>
<p>Reflecting on these two aims, we are glad that, overall, commentators saw our paper as it was intended to be: a contribution to long-standing and, what we hope to be, ongoing debates about the geographies of knowledge production. We were especially pleased that commentators saw our input as an ‘active attempt’ to go beyond simple binaries, such as core and periphery, by highlighting the ways in which economic geographical knowledges are produced in complex and contingent assemblages. While doubts may have arisen by some commentators about our geographical focus, we still feel the ambiguity of the Antipodes position in terms of its neither here nor there position is a useful empirical vehicle to further nuance such debates. Indeed, as is demonstrated in Howitt’s (2013) commentary, our focus on the Antipodes has arguably ‘valorised’ and brought to light some very real and long-standing issues that Antipodean geographers have had to grapple with by virtue of their geographical position. But of course our contribution does not seek to be definitive nor complete and both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820613493157">Howitt (2013</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820613493157">Dombroski (2013</xref>) are right to point out to some notable absences in our writings including the lack of references made to indigenous economic geographical knowledges and post-carbon economic geographies in an anthropogenic era.</p>
<p>By contrast, however, in the context of the specific economic geographical debates, we sought to highlight in the piece, and the way in which they have gone on to have significant purchase within economic geographical debates generally, we feel that for the most part these were not engaged with by the respondents. These contributions may be summarised as industrial restructuring and financialisation, the important role of the state and therefore of neoliberalism, regional and rural economies and cultural economies. The alternative economies agenda developed by Julie Graham, Katherine Gibson and others was also highlighted. To what extent this stems from the fact that few of the respondents might identify as economic geographers, or that three of the five respondents are from New Zealand or Australia is something we continue to ponder.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, despite the diversion away from the economic geographical content of the paper, the commentaries did raise some important points of contention and it is to these that we now turn.</p>
<p>A common theme to evolve from the commentaries was the suggestion that we have sought to ‘produce’, ‘fix’, ‘delineate’ or ‘essentialise’ Antipodean economic geography. Such representations of our arguments, especially by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820613493157">Berg (2013</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820613493157">McKinnon (2013</xref>), as setting up some sort of binary or inflexible categorisation are at odds with the words we wrote and we were disappointed to read such evaluations. Not least because we were careful to make the disclaimer early on in the piece that we neither sought to construct these knowledges as singular and homogenous, as a conscious set of ‘other’ economic geographies or claim that Antipodean economic geography was an identifiable or knowable category. Yet, while it was never our intention to pigeonhole, fix or create a knowable category, there were issues of practicality that needed to be accommodated. Primarily, we were confronted with the quandary that if we were to never ‘name’ or identify such things like ‘Antipodean economic geographies’, how were we to meaningfully discuss them or nuance such debates? While we of course accept, and take as given, that there are always political ramifications in identifying or naming something (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820613493157">McKinnon, 2013</xref>), we feel that to not name them would result in a continued obfuscation of the point we were trying to make – the importance of recognising the situatedness of Antipodean (and, indeed, all) economic geographical knowledges.</p>
<p>Related to the above critique was the assertion that by ‘explicitly and unashamedly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820613493157">Berg, 2013</xref>) naming a scholarly assemblage, in this case ‘Antipodean economic geography’, we were by the very writing of this dialogue, bringing such knowledges into a ‘set of market relations’ and an academic hierarchy. This point is well made. It is true that there are important and potentially negative consequences in the process of naming. The performance of naming brings into being new and possibly repressive power relations. It can essentialise, make monoliths and create straw effigies. Indeed, such pitfalls are probably more likely when we are naively ‘innocent’ of them. Yet, as argued above, not ‘naming’ may be equally problematic. In response to both the above critiques, we endorse the point that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820613493157">Dombroski (2013</xref>) makes when she positions the term ‘Antipodean economic geography’ as ‘slippery’. We reiterate, therefore, that the term Antipodean economic geography is provisional and should be contested, however, unless we name such categories how are we to scrutinise them and their consequences? Admittedly, it did not occur to us that in creating this rupture, we were participating in a ‘race to innocence’ or that we were complicit in a ‘reactionary and unprogressive set of politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820613493157">Berg, 2013</xref>). Rather, academics seeking to shed light onto peripheral/edgy knowledges by naming them and showing how they speak back to more hegemonic tropes should be cognisant of the dangers but also fearless in the execution of such critical reflection.</p>
<p>Likewise, while we did not set out to make monoliths of the United Kingdom and United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820613493157">Dombroski, 2013</xref>), it would be naive to not critically reflect on what the perceived dominance of US and Anglo economic geography means for what kinds of economic geographies are produced, published and circulated. Indeed as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820613493157">Howitt (2013</xref>) highlighted, by virtue of his Antipodean position, he experienced very real and tangible difficulties in getting his work published in international journals, despite his arguments around relational approaches to scale predating the ‘official’ relational turn circa 2001–2003. Furthermore, notwithstanding Berg’s (2013) call for a much more nuanced approach to transcending and negotiating power via axes of interlocking oppressions, it is hard to deny that a stark core/periphery binary persists. The importance of interventions such as the one this paper attempts to make is perhaps best demonstrated, strengthened even, by the International Benchmarking Review of UK Human Geography published in March this year. The take-home headline from the review is that ‘human geography as a whole in the United Kingdom ranks first in the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820613493157">Boyle and Gardner, 2013</xref>: 4). Among other things, the document posits the United Kingdom and its academics as ‘setting the intellectual agenda’ for human geography, the home ‘for many of the disciplines leading journals’ and surpassing other countries in terms of ‘volume and citation impact’. Yet, this benchmarking exercise wasn’t undertaken by a usual suspect global consultancy or surveillance firm, but rather by the Royal Geographical Society and the UK’s Economic and Social Research Council, led by a panel and steering group composed of geographers. While we are not privy to the reasons why these geographers participated, or the politics behind their conclusions, it seems ironic that those who contribute or are sympathetic to debates about the politics and whereness of knowledge production are then involved in neoliberal exercises such as these. The very existence of such documents serves to reinforce scholarly otherness and produce hierarchies of knowledge production. Moreover, such evaluations appear to be done without critical acknowledgement of the issue of language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820613493157">Aalbers, 2013</xref>), the geography of academic capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820613493157">Berg, 2013</xref>) or UK’s geography’s deep imperial origins. To that end, our original intention to bring into conversation critical histories of the discipline and the recent postcolonial gaze has added salience; not least because as we have also demonstrated this ‘agenda setting’ will likely have been shaped by contributions from Antipodean and other non–UK-based scholars.</p>
<p>Reading the benchmarking report brings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820613493157">Aalbers (2013</xref>) commentary into sharp relief. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820613493157">Aalbers (2013</xref>) correctly draws attention to what might be the potential ‘sloppiness’ of the meta-geography we employed throughout our paper, highlighting our shifting references to the northern hemisphere as the perceived core or centre of geographical knowledge production, while at other times the Anglo-American hearth. In a somewhat playful manner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820613493157">Aalbers (2013</xref>) is right to press us to be more precise by what we mean by ‘the centre’ particularly in light of how our claims might leave countries such as Ireland and Canada, while also illuminating to us how peripheralised knowledges can be produced in close geographical proximity to the centre as well as in the Antipodes. In hindsight, we wish this is something that we could go back to rectify and narrow down to England and the United States. In the context of where our arguments leave places such as continental Europe, we, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820613493157">Dombroski (2013</xref>), would advocate producing a ‘diverse economy of economic geography knowledge’.</p>
<p>Finally, our feeling is that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820613493157">Dombroski (2013</xref>) undertakes some useful ground-clearing to think about where next this debate about Antipodean economic geography may go or what an ‘Antipodean economic geography might become’ in the anthropogenic climate change era or in other new global contexts. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820613493157">Dombroski (2013</xref>), she advocates Antipodean economic geography as a ‘tool to fracture, queer and situate economic geography’ generally, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820613493157">McKinnon (2013</xref>) suggests that Antipodean becomes a term that means ‘to look for difference’. Admittedly, it did not occur to us as we assembled this paper that we were undertaking a performative intervention that queers economic geography, but we are happy to go with and welcome this (multiple) interpretation. Predictably perhaps, but no less welcome, both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820613493157">Dombroski (2013</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820613493157">McKinnon (2013</xref>) extol the virtues of hybrid research collectives so as to cultivate more diverse economic geographies and to see Antipodean economic geographies as a tool for democratising modes of research and exploring what kinds of politics it enables us to enact. While in principle this is something we support, in practice we would highlight that hybrid research collectives are highly dependent on the context and the types of ‘others’ who we as researchers engage with to produce economic geographical knowledges: some of these ‘others’ do not necessarily or easily lend themselves to setting up hybrid research collectives nor do they even want to. Equally, we would draw caution to McKinnon’s (2013) comment that Antipodean becomes a term to represent ‘a habit of speaking from the underside’ and ‘looking for difference’: as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820613493157">Aalbers (2013</xref>) suggested the majority of geographers work in spaces of in-betweenness, which are not solely confined to the Antipodes. To employ such a term with an implied geographical marker may obscure other colleagues elsewhere who are also looking for difference; while remaining conscious of the need for engagement with UK and US researchers in common voice projects. Either way, thinking about where discussions around Antipodean economic geography or the politics and whereness of economic geographical knowledge production goes next is clearly ripe for further analysis, and it is our hope that this paper has played some part in initiating these discussions.</p>
