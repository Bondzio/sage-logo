<abstract>
<p>Many consider international human trafficking, or the transportation of children and adults across national borders for forced labor and services, 21st-century slavery. Academics, lawmakers and international bodies have developed a rich body of literature around trafficking in recent years, while documentarians, screenwriters and artists have placed it squarely in popular discourse. But little is known about how the press translates that knowledge to a lay audience. This study sets out to explore that question, asking how the world’s elite press framed trafficking and with whose or what agenda. The findings offer strong evidence for the US government’s role in framing the issue in the press largely as a sexual phenomenon.</p>

<p>International human trafficking by most accounts is 21st-century slavery, fueled in part by a multi-billion-dollar criminal enterprise, and those who fight trafficking, from university lecture halls to the corridors of the US Congress, modern-day abolitionists. As this new century dawned, both Congress and the United Nations passed sweeping laws designed not only to identify and criminalize the phenomenon but also to stop its spread across the globe. Stories of pre-pubescent girls from impoverished nations sold to traffickers to become sexual slaves in far-away western cities gripped the attention of lawmakers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), people of faith and the world press (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748048511432600">Shapiro, 2004</xref>). Since 2000, with passage of both the US Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) and the United Nations’ Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, international human trafficking has become central in the public discourse on human rights and, in particular, the rights of women and children.</p>
<p>The phenomenon now has a name, and with it come reports of abuses difficult to imagine in contemporary times: young boys sold as ‘camel jockeys’ in the Middle East (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748048511432600">Sengupta, 2002</xref>), women and girls sold into domestic slavery for middle-class families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748048511432600">Frean, 2006</xref>), children sold to work as slaves in fields in an ever-increasing globalized economy that demands cheap labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748048511432600">US Department of State, 2006</xref>), babies scooped up in catastrophes such as the Indonesian tsunami and sold to unsuspecting couples in the West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748048511432600">Perlez and Rusli, 2005</xref>). Documentary films, including one screened at the prestigious Sundance film festival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748048511432600">Sciretta, 2007</xref>), a fictionalized television mini-series starring Mira Sorvino, movies, books and plays place human trafficking squarely in the realm of popular culture. A <italic>New York Times</italic> editorial writer has even used his column as a pulpit to fight sex trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748048511432600">Kristof, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet despite numerous stories of degradation, both the US and international laws emerged amid great debate and tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748048511432600">Chuang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048511432600">Gozdziak and Collett, 2005</xref>). As captured in academic and advocacy writings in recent years, the debate essentially centered on a question of emphasis and priority, on whether efforts to fight trafficking should focus on what many considered the peculiarly heinous act of sexual slavery. The question proves complex if not delicate when considering some countries, such as Germany and the Netherlands, legally allow prostitution, with local trade groups that advocate for sex-workers’ rights. But the overarching consideration centers more on a moral and philosophical debate about the sexual agency of women, free will within the choices they make and whether they are in need of particular legal protection — or as some might describe, salvation. Complicating matters is a wealth of data that suggest most prostitutes experienced chronic sexual abuse as children, resulting in deep psychological trauma, including self-destructive tendencies, such as drug abuse and even suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748048511432600">Poulin, 2009</xref>). For many scholars, the question of whether trafficked women are even mentally in a position to <italic>choose</italic> a lifestyle of sexual exploitation is absurd and misses a larger moral question: the global dehumanization and commodification of females for astronomical profits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748048511432600">Poulin, 2009</xref>). ‘Procuring reigns over prostitution, even in countries where prostitution has been legalized. As goods, the prostitutes are not free: They are under the ownership of the procurer and the customer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748048511432600">Poulin, 2009</xref>: 118).</p>
<p>The debate about female agency and free will continues, perhaps nowhere more than in the US, an international leader in fighting the problem. Though the US law took effect under the leadership of President Bill Clinton, President George W Bush made <italic>sexual</italic> trafficking a priority in his administration, in part under the counsel of a growing evangelical movement focused on international human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748048511432600">Shapiro, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1748048511432600">
<italic>The New York Times,</italic> 2004</xref>). Indeed, since 2000, TVPA has undergone several changes, including increased penalties for sexual traffickers, and in 2003 the US Department of Homeland Security launched an initiative expressly designed to focus on the sexual trafficking of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748048511432600">US Department of State, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>With that in mind, this study seeks to understand how competing priorities and agendas on international human trafficking are being carried out in the press. Though journal articles on human trafficking abound, literature on media coverage is largely absent, providing a rich opportunity for analysis. Research began with a scan of 50 of the world’s major newspapers over five key years, revealing several thousand stories on the issue. The vast majority of those appeared in the US and British press, particularly the international leaders <italic>The</italic> <italic>Washington Post</italic>, <italic>The New York Times</italic>, <italic>The</italic> (London) <italic>Guardian</italic> and <italic>The</italic> (London) <italic>Times</italic>. As such, this content analysis focuses on coverage in those four papers, from 2002 to 2006. In the absence of previous press study, this article seeks to explore and explain that coverage through open-ended research questions, using the method of frame analysis within the theoretical structure of agenda building.</p>

<title>Previous research</title>
<p>This review begins with a broad look at the problem of international human trafficking, or the taking of children and adults for forced labor and service, as explained in both journal articles and government documents. Major inconsistencies in the data are prevalent, in part because of the clandestine nature of the crime but also because trafficking lacks a clear, universal definition in the literature. Confusing matters is the fact that governments, media and even researchers continue to ‘conflate migration, asylum, refugees, [and] trafficking’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748048511432600">Kelly, 2005</xref>: 239). The initial overview is followed by more detailed summaries of both journal literature and government reports on the subject and, finally, a review of the agenda-building theory and framing method that guide this content analysis.</p>
<sec id="section2-1748048511432600">
<title>Overview of human trafficking</title>
<p>Though numbers either vary or are unknown on aspects of the problem, human trafficking is portrayed in articles and documents as a devastating phenomenon worldwide. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) of the United Nations has maintained a global database of victims who have been helped in recent years. Between 2001 and 2005, law-enforcement agencies, NGOs, international organizations and embassies referred 5233 cases to the migration office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748048511432600">Omelaniuk, 2005</xref>). According to these data, those most at risk are destitute, female and poorly educated. Victims typically are recruited from impoverished countries, primarily in Asia, the former Soviet Republics and Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048511432600">Kangaspunta, 2003</xref>). They may then be transported through countries that provide geographically expedient and relatively safe routes, primarily in Central and Eastern Europe, and end up being exploited for labor or other issues in more affluent parts of the world, such as the United States and the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048511432600">Kangaspunta, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Traffickers and their accomplices, including sexual procurers, tend to be friends or relatives of victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748048511432600">Omelaniuk, 2005</xref>). The global database also shows that 29% of recruiters are women or girls who do so to help pay down their own debts to traffickers (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748048511432600">ILO-IPEC, 2002</xref>). Some argue that the legalization of procurement and the regulation of prostitution has led to ‘colossal expansion’ of this industry and of trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748048511432600">Poulin, 2009</xref>: 113). Organized crime, perhaps not surprisingly, is heavily involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748048511432600">IOM, 2005</xref>). Beyond forced labor, growing gender imbalance in areas of South and East Asia increasingly is driving demand for trafficking victims as brides. In China, preferences for sons over daughters and the government’s one-child policy resulted in fewer females, prompting some men to buy brides, sometimes from bordering countries such as North Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748048511432600">US Department of State, 2006</xref>). These women’s parents often sell them to traffickers, or the women are kidnapped to be brides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748048511432600">US Department of State, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Estimates of the scope of the problem have varied widely over the years. Using ILO data, the US State Department reports 2.45 million people are trafficked globally each year, including 43% for purposes of sexual exploitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1748048511432600">US Department of State, 2009</xref>). Also noteworthy is that early estimates of up to 50,000 people trafficked into the US alone repeatedly have been adjusted down to current estimates of roughly 14,500 to 17,500, with the government citing improved methodology for the changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048511432600">Gozdziak and Collett, 2005</xref>). As for revenues to traffickers and accomplices, the State Department links billions of dollars in annual proceeds to money laundering, drug trafficking, document fraud and human smuggling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1748048511432600">US Department of State, 2005</xref>). More specifically, a 2005 ILO study estimates trafficking for forced prostitution alone yielded annual profits of $27.8 billion (US). For women and children trafficked for prostitution, legal or not, ‘forced’ or not, Poulin puts annual profits between $60 and $94.5 billion (US), explaining increased involvement of organized crime: high returns on low ‘investments,’ in some cases with little or no risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748048511432600">Poulin, 2009</xref>: 109).</p>

<sec id="section3-1748048511432600">
<title>Overview of government documents</title>
<p>Many government records consist of reports from US agencies and various divisions of the United Nations, Congressional legislation and White House executive summaries. While the reports often provide a baseline of data on various types of human trafficking, including forced field labor and sexual enslavement, much of the emphasis is on sex trafficking. The State Department is required to provide the Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report on global trafficking to Congress each year. One report, for instance, characterizes people trafficked yearly primarily as victims of sex trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748048511432600">US Department of State, 2006</xref>). In 2003, along with reauthorizing the law, Congress passed the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act to help fight child-sex tourism. Together, the laws increase penalties to a maximum of 30 years in prison for such tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748048511432600">US Department of State, 2006</xref>). The government reports PROTECT has resulted in at least 20 indictments and more than a dozen convictions of child-sex tourists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748048511432600">US Department of State, 2006</xref>). The same year PROTECT took effect, President Bush described sex trafficking in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly as a ‘special evil, a multi-billion-dollar underground of brutality and lonely fear’ and a global scourge alongside the AIDS epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748048511432600">Landesman, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, the Department of Homeland Security developed Operation Predator to fight child exploitation, child pornography and child-sex tourism. The State Department contends tolerance of the commercial-sex industry has made Japan one of the world’s top destinations for sex trafficking of foreign workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748048511432600">US Department of State, 2006</xref>). In other action, US legislation in June 2006 called on the government of Germany to investigate and fight sex trafficking during the FIFA World Cup soccer match there. According to House Resolution 860, sponsored by US Rep. Christopher Smith (R – New Jersey), legal prostitution in Germany was being used as a cover for illegal sex trafficking. The measure urged Germany and other European countries to publicize the threat of trafficking during soccer matches.</p>

<title>Overview of journal literature</title>
<p>Dozens of journal articles since 2000 have examined human trafficking. Women’s Feature Service in 2004 devoted numerous articles to trafficking, while several journals, including <italic>International Migration</italic>, dedicated entire editions. Articles in recent years particularly critiqued government responses to trafficking and suggested changes to laws and even alternatives to them. This review primarily focuses on those critiques, beginning with the origins of the US and international laws. A lengthy critique in the <italic>Seattle Weekly</italic> that raised questions about possible exaggerations of the problem of forced prostitution partly informs this review, despite the article appearing in a weekly newspaper.</p>
<p>The first international agreement to address trafficking, according to an assessment of such laws in <italic>Harvard Law Review</italic>, was the United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others, adopted in 1949. Because the definition of trafficking was limited to prostitution, it did not capture the full range of modern trafficking, such as labor exploitation (Free the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748048511432600">Slaves, 2005</xref>). The 2000 adoption of the Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime and the accompanying Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children marked the first time an international body adopted a definition broad enough to cover that scope. The Protocol took effect with its 40th ratification in December 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748048511432600">Munro, 2006</xref>), though not without much compromise among member states. Some scholars note the definition of trafficking ‘victim’ provides both restrictive and broad interpretations. A person viewed as giving consent to prostitution, for instance, may not be treated as a victim with attending services and even be prosecuted as an illegal worker. Further confusing matters, legal definitions of ‘victim’ or ‘criminal’ may stand in contrast to more sociological notions of victims that recognize the complexity of psychological coercion in <italic>any</italic> form.</p>
<p>US law, on the other hand, has criminalized all forms of involuntary servitude since the enactment of the Thirteenth Amendment, which made it illegal to hold people for labor through the use of force, threats of force or threats of legal coercion equivalent to imprisonment. Because the US Supreme Court narrowly interpreted involuntary servitude to exclude servitude induced by psychological coercion, as explained in <italic>U.S.</italic> v. <italic>Kozminski</italic> (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748048511432600">
<italic>Harvard Law Review</italic>, 2006</xref>), the amendment and enabling statutes were of limited use in fighting much trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748048511432600">
<italic>Harvard Law Review,</italic> 2006</xref>). Then human trafficking gained intense media attention in the 1990s, partly after authorities found more than 70 Thai women and men who had been smuggled into California and enslaved for as long as seven years at a guarded compound, according to a US Senate sub-committee hearing (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748048511432600">Potts, 2003</xref>). Albanese et al. noted that President Clinton in 1998 issued a directive that established the foundations of the government’s current strategy: prosecution, protection and prevention (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748048511432600">
<italic>Harvard Law Review</italic>, 2006</xref>). Congress in 2000 enacted TVPA, which defines ‘coercion’ to include psychological manipulation and requires the State Department to issue an annual report to Congress each year detailing the United States’ and other countries’ anti-trafficking efforts, the latter facing US sanctions if they don’t comply with the law. That determination is based on a three-tier rating system, with Tier 1 countries perceived as well in compliance.</p>
<p>TVPA was largely the result of lobbying by a coalition of religious and political interests pulled together by a leader in the evangelical movement, Richard Cizik (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748048511432600">Shapiro, 2004</xref>). The coalition included representatives of <italic>Ms.</italic> Magazine founder and feminist Gloria Steinem and the Jewish nonprofit organization B’Nai B’rith, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748048511432600">Shapiro, 2004</xref>). The alliance between politically conservative evangelicals and politically liberal feminists, in particular, might be explained by a similar view that sees the world full of ills ‘perpetrated by men on women, with sex a primary means of exploitation and abuse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748048511432600">Shapiro, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>But some researchers criticize the increasing focus on sex trafficking and its ‘gothic portrayals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748048511432600">Chapkis, 2003</xref>) over other forms, particularly in countries where prostitution is legal. ‘The worldwide market for labor is far greater than that for sex’, David Feingold, a coordinator for United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), was quoted as saying. ‘Statistics on the “end use” of trafficked people are often unreliable because they tend to overrepresent the sex trade’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748048511432600">Feingold, 2005: 26</xref>). He cited a 2005 UN International Labor Organization (ILO) study that found of the estimated 9.5 million victims of forced labor in Asia, fewer than 10% are trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748048511432600">Feingold, 2005</xref>). Statistics that say forced prostitution is the most common form of trafficking are controversial, and critics argue that the emphasis on prostitution is for ‘ideological reasons’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748048511432600">Shapiro, 2004</xref>). Indeed, competing interest groups divided on prostitution legalization, such as the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women and the Global Alliance Against Trafficking in Women, lobbied intensely throughout the drafting of the UN Protocol on trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748048511432600">Munro, 2006</xref>). Ultimately, the UN moved away from the 1949 Convention that limited trafficking to prostitution.</p>
<p>Some scholars, however, argue that the UN’s definition of trafficking implicitly maintains a close link between trafficking and prostitution, in part by singling out women and children for focus in the Protocol, and that this has led to some countries privileging the uniqueness of sex trafficking in their respective laws, despite evidence of alternative types of trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748048511432600">Munro, 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-1748048511432600">
<title>Applications of agenda-building theory, framing methods to trafficking</title>
<p>This study asks how the media’s agenda on human trafficking generally was set over five years of intense and growing interest. Two theoretical frameworks apply here: agenda setting and agenda building. Scholars have advanced agenda setting in several ways since the publication of McCombs and Shaw’s seminal first study three decades ago on the 1968 presidential race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748048511432600">McCombs and Shaw, 1972</xref>). The theory posits that what the media find important, or salient, is what the public finds important. Put another way, the media may not tell people what to <italic>think</italic> so much as what to think <italic>about</italic>. Subsequent studies argued second-level agenda-setting effects, where particular attributes of issues on the media’s agenda are reflected in attributes the public finds important, such that the media not only cue the public on <italic>what</italic> issues to think about (first-level agenda setting) but <italic>how</italic> to think about those issues (second-level agenda setting) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748048511432600">McCombs and Shaw, 1993</xref>). Many agenda-setting studies determine the media agenda and public agenda through content analyses and public-opinion surveys, respectively. However, some agenda-setting studies omit the latter, focusing just on media content as a gauge of public interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748048511432600">Huckins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1748048511432600">Werder, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748048511432600">Zibluk, 1999</xref>). Huckins, for instance, tested whether the Christian Coalition’s agenda, as reflected in its organization newspaper, correlated with the media’s agenda.</p>
<p>Agenda-building theory at both first and second levels, in contrast, asks how those agendas get built in the first place and by what or whom. Among the more obvious sources of influence on media agendas are public relations professionals, politicians, governments and their agents and ordinary citizens. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748048511432600">Dinan and Miller (2007</xref>) argue that wherever big business is threatened, for instance, ‘spin doctors’ are on hand to attempt to manipulate public opinion via the media, to the detriment of democracy. News releases, not surprisingly, show a significant role. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748048511432600">Turk (1986</xref>) reported that state government public information officers in Louisiana raised the salience of those state agencies in the media through such releases. Similar findings appeared in an international setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748048511432600">Turk and Franklin, 1987</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748048511432600">Herman and Chomsky (1988</xref>), on the other hand, suggest political-economic dimensions influence what topics and issues mainstream media deem worthy of attention, and that in turn limits the boundaries of public debate.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748048511432600">Kiousis et al. (2006</xref>) explored the role of political candidate news releases, media content and public opinion in shaping the salience of political issues and candidate images during the 2002 Florida gubernatorial election, finding support for both first- and second-level agenda-building and agenda-setting effects. More recently, scholars turned their sights on the impact of social media and user-generated content, finding scant influence, at least on business journalists (Lariscy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748048511432600">2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748048511432600">Salwen (1990</xref>) argues agenda building offers a crucial middle ground between competing media-influence theories: agenda setting on the one hand, which suggests a simple stimulus response between news coverage and public opinion, and spiral of silence on the other, which suggests the media as ‘Orwellian’ instruments of social conformity. Under agenda building, he argues, the news media are one of many tools at citizens’ disposal to frame and enlarge public issues.</p>
<p>Perhaps most germane to this human trafficking study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748048511432600">Johnson et al. (2004</xref>) examined the relationship between four recent presidents, the press, the public and real-world events on the issue of drugs. As others before them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748048511432600">Lang and Lang, 1983</xref>), they found a somewhat reciprocal, albeit complicated, relationship among these parties, both influencing and being influenced by each other. Relevant to this content analysis, they found the extent of a problem and the amount of attention the president pays to it appear to be major factors affecting his ability to influence the agenda-building process.</p>
<p>To examine that question here, the study focuses just on media content and uses framing analysis to identify key human trafficking categories, or types, in four major newspapers in the world. Explications of framing as a paradigm, theory, model, concept and method abound in scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748048511432600">Ghanem, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748048511432600">Reese et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1748048511432600">Zhang, 2000</xref>). While this study does not intend to provide a comprehensive discussion of those differences, several definitions and some historical perspective guide this newspaper content analysis.</p>
<p>Frame analysis is relatively new, dating back some 30 years. But its appeal is growing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748048511432600">Reese et al., 2001</xref>). The popularity of the framing perspective is readily seen in conference programs of groups such as the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication, the International Communication Association and others, bolstered by interests in issues across disciplines and even national borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748048511432600">Reese et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Among framing’s pioneers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748048511432600">Gitlin (1980</xref>) defined frames as ‘persistent patterns of cognition, interpretation, and presentation, of selection, emphasis, and exclusion, by which the symbol-handlers routinely organized discourse, whether verbal or visual’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748048511432600">Gitlin, 1980</xref>: 7) and that frames allow journalists ‘to process large amounts of information quickly and routinely.… and to package it for efficient relay to their audiences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748048511432600">Gitlin, 1980</xref>: 7). Many macro-social factors influence journalistic frames, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1748048511432600">Zhang (2000</xref>: 5) points out. Zhang’s reassembled definition, taking into account such forces and accounting for interest in multiple disciplines, including sociology, political science and psychology, reads as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>Framing is a process of how politicians, policymakers relay their messages to attract media attention and put the best face on the events, how journalists construct messages under organizational guidelines and professional values and how audience members interpret, think, and reassess those media messages. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1748048511432600">Zhang, 2000</xref>: 5)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>An important aspect of this definition is its emphasis on audience interpretation, because not all framing analyses consider it. Many have focused solely on the frames themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748048511432600">Ghanem, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>This content analysis examines the frames alone, looking for among other details, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748048511432600">Lotz (1991</xref>) described, the structural bias inside them:<disp-quote>
<p>Whenever reporters have to compress a multifarious reality into a few paragraphs, distortion inevitably results, particularly when some parts are deliberately highlighted and others completely left out, which happens in every news story written. Therefore, in the sociological sense, communication biases are ever present. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748048511432600">Lotz, 1991</xref>: 67)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In light of such potential distortion and critiques of how the government has framed trafficking as highlighted in this literature review, two research questions emerge for this content analysis:</p>
<p>
<italic>RQ1a:</italic> From among the various frames for the newsworthy story of international human trafficking, as reflected in the scholarly literature and in various government reports and investigations, which one appears to dominate media coverage?</p>
<p>
<italic>RQ1b:</italic> How does the adoption of that frame tell us who sets the agenda for the agenda-setters?</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study began with a broad review of newspaper, governmental and academic coverage of international human trafficking around the world to assess the scope and nature of the problem. As mentioned earlier, the vast majority of newspaper stories appeared in major papers in the US and England, two primary destination countries for trafficked people. Searches of about a dozen databases revealed several hundred government reports and journal articles.</p>
<p>From issues that emerged in that material, this study proceeded as a traditional content analysis, focusing on four major newspapers that reported the lion’s share of trafficking stories: <italic>The Washington Post</italic>, <italic>The New York Times</italic>, <italic>The</italic> (London) <italic>Guardian</italic> and <italic>The</italic> (London) <italic>Times.</italic> The search looked for ‘human trafficking’ in the headline or lead paragraph or as a key term in the story, in order to capture stories substantially about trafficking, but not peripherally. The subject term ‘human trafficking’ in Lexis produced roughly 1400 stories over five years. It should be noted that Lexis indexers often include stories in a search that do not necessarily include exact subject terms if they believe the stories essentially are about the matter at hand.</p>
<p>Stories captured in the search that were not related to human trafficking, such as drug trafficking, were removed, along with Congressional roll-call votes, calendar listings and letters-to-the-editor. Also removed were stories that mentioned ‘human trafficking’ but were not substantially about the subject. Full-length feature stories on trafficking, such as movie reviews, were included, as were news briefs, such as reports of arrests of suspected traffickers. Finally, stories that appeared to be about human smuggling, which differs from trafficking in that it does not involve slavery, only were included if the story centered on criminal charges that nonetheless characterized the smuggling as trafficking.</p>
<p>The author initially identified four content categories: ‘sex’, ‘labor’, ‘other’ and ‘non-specified’. To help ensure external validity as recommended in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1748048511432600">Riffe et al., 2005</xref>), the author located the categories in a paper outside the study, <italic>The</italic> (London) <italic>Telegraph</italic>. As a result of the coding-reliability process, the author added two more categories, ‘domestic servitude’ and ‘several’, and refined descriptions of all. Coding on 10% of the sample for reliability, as recommended in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1748048511432600">Riffe et al., 2005</xref>), resulted in a Scott’s pi for the content categories of .93, well in the acceptable range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1748048511432600">Riffe et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to produce a manageable sample to analyze, every third story in each newspaper was included in the study, for a total of 266. The unit of analysis was the individual story or column, regardless of the section it ran in, such as local (metro), business, entertainment or sports. The total number of stories in the sample for each year in each newspaper is broken down in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1748048511432600">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In RQ1a, this study asked which trafficking frame, as reflected in the scholarly literature and in various government reports and investigations, appeared to dominate media coverage.</p>
<p>Statistical tests for newspaper by story frame showed significance at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .00 (χ<sup>2</sup> 35.39, <italic>p</italic> = .002). Those results should be read with some caution, however, because of the number of cells with expected frequencies of fewer than 5 cases. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1748048511432600">Table 2</xref>, sex trafficking overwhelmingly dominated coverage across the four newspapers, with more than half of the stories in the sample in this category. Those stories included a mix of hard news and news features, the latter often reported in graphic terms in profiles of female victims. Though considerably behind sex, the second and third highest content categories were ‘non-specific’ and ‘other’, respectively. Recall those categories dealt with stories that called attention to no particular type of trafficking and those focused on something other than the primary ones of sex, labor and domestic servitude, respectively.</p>
<p>In both US papers, too, sex trafficking amounted to more than half of all trafficking stories, the only other category with significant numbers being ‘non-specific’ (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1748048511432600">Table 2</xref>). Indeed, both papers were remarkably similar in all category breakdowns. So, too, were the two British newspapers. In each, just under half of all stories were about sex trafficking, the second highest count easily the non-specific category. The British papers also reported higher percentages of ‘other’ than the US papers, with most of those stories focused on trafficking of brides and babies, which do not easily fit most definitions in the trafficking literature. It should be noted that labor trafficking, which experts describe as a major form of the crime, received scant or no focus in all four papers.</p>

<p>As to RQ1b, which asked how the dominant trafficking frame suggested who sets the agenda for the agenda-setters themselves, the international press, this study offers strong indirect evidence of the government’s role. Just as the US and UN focused attention on sex trafficking, so, too, did the press during the five years of this study.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to explore how the elite press framed international human trafficking and what that suggested, if anything, about the origins of the press agenda. The key finding that sex trafficking dominated the trafficking agenda of four major world papers raises several important questions. Though many experts take care to acknowledge the particular degradation of sex trafficking, they also write that the government’s attention to it neglects other pernicious forms. Many warn the government’s focus on sex, for instance, has been to the ‘detriment of investigating trafficking for bonded labour and domestic servitude’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048511432600">Gozdziak and Collett, 2005</xref>: 117). And as the findings here suggest, the press have all but ignored labor trafficking in keeping with the influential US government’s agenda. Many scholars speculate that the government’s emphasis on sex is multi-faceted, but most stress the religious right’s influence on the Bush administration during this study’s period. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048511432600">Gozdziak and Collett (2005</xref>) call attention to pressure from groups with roots in American feminism. The groups ‘have been at the forefront of the push to raise awareness about trafficking in human beings, and have thus promoted research into women in the sex industry, not necessarily trafficked women.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048511432600">Gozdziak and Collett, 2005</xref>: 117).</p>
<p>Debate about this emphasis is strong even among feminist scholars. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748048511432600">Chapkis (2003</xref>) argues that the US trafficking law strategically uses anxieties over sexuality, gender and immigration to further curtail migration and does this in part through misleading statistics that create a moral panic around sexual slavery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748048511432600">Chapkis, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048511432600">Gozdziak and Collett (2005</xref>) offer blunt language on why the US government has focused on sex over labor trafficking: It ‘is the result of close ties between the current U.S. administration to the business community. The [Bush] administration is reluctant to commission studies that would investigate its greatest ally and supporter’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048511432600">Gozdziak and Collett, 2005</xref>: 117).</p>
<p>Clearly, the implications of the elite press apparently embracing the government’s agenda on trafficking, rather than serving as watchdog on trafficking priorities, are significant. Potentially, resources devoted to sex trafficking to the exclusion of other forms, for instance, could result in escalating problems for workers enslaved as laborers and household servants. A more subtle cultural effect is perhaps equally disconcerting: the potential for perpetuating stereotypes of women and girls as powerless victims in society, unable to control their bodies in the most private way without state help. Yet even that conclusion glosses over nuances in the trafficking debate about what ‘victim’ means in the context of a crime where physically and psychologically damaged women engage in sex for the profit of others. Arguments that move beyond ‘victim’ and ‘victimizer’ may be in order.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1748048511432600">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Because this study is limited to one newspaper content analysis, few definitive conclusions can be drawn. Though it offers support for the agenda-building process in the press by outside forces, such as the government, a fuller research program is in order.</p>
<p>That program might include, among other things, in-depth interviews with individual reporters who frequently write about trafficking and what they view as the biggest problem; an examination of the public’s role, if any, in shaping the various agendas on trafficking; explorations of the relative dearth of stories in the press on the topic to begin with; the effectiveness of the laws in fighting the problem; and a careful examination of government expenditures on the problem in its broadest definition. In addition, because of debate over what exactly trafficking is and who it hurts, a textual or critical discourse analysis of a small, representative sample of news articles might shed light on this most contentious issue. Finally, this study limited itself to news articles. A separate analysis of editorials and other opinion columns could illuminate whether elite media have ever tried to <italic>mobilize</italic> public opinion around trafficking.</p>
