<p><italic>World Wide Weed</italic> is a fascinating, focused, and well-organized collection of articles on an understudied sociological phenomenon, the rapid spread and diversification of cannabis cultivation. No longer an illegal substance produced primarily in developing countries for export to lucrative illicit markets in the developed world, cannabis produced for recreational drug use is now increasingly cultivated in the same places where it is consumed. New technologies for cultivation and easy dissemination of the tools and techniques via the Internet have led to a proliferation of growing operations even in urban and suburban areas. Further, these changes in cannabis cultivation are occurring at a time when the war on drugs in the United States and international treaties criminalizing cannabis in the same way as poppies and coca plants are colliding with rapidly changing public attitudes and local laws.</p>
<p>This aspect of illegal drugs and society’s efforts to deal with them has been widely noted in the popular media but comparatively neglected in academic research compared to an enormous volume of research on the behavior of drug users and the efficacy of law enforcement efforts to curtail drug dealing and use. For these reasons, this collection is valuable and overdue.</p>
<p>Cannabis for recreational drug use (as opposed to the agricultural product hemp, which is the same species cultivated in a manner that minimizes its psychoactive properties) is now produced in 172 countries, a sharp increase in only a few decades for a substance that has been used in some cultures for thousands of years. Given this rapid worldwide spread of cannabis cultivation and the accompanying diversity in local situations, this volume does a remarkable job of outlining the dimensions of the phenomenon and identifying key issues. The various chapters examine two traditional growing areas, Morocco and the English-speaking Caribbean, and 10 developed nations that have seen rapid, recent emergence: Denmark, Finland, Belgium, Canada, the United States, Spain, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The various contributions employ a wide range of social science data sources and methods to examine different aspects of cultivation, including survey studies, analyses of law enforcement data, ethnographic studies, medical sociology, formal social network analysis, biological studies of eradication efforts, historical studies, and policy evaluations.</p>
<p>Remarkably, given this wide geopolitical reach and methodological diversity, the collection as a whole, by focusing squarely on the topic of cultivation, has a compelling unity built around two central issues. The first is the wide diversity of cultivators, in terms of their motivations and methods. The second is the seeming futility of efforts to control or curtail the spread of cultivation operations.</p>
<p>As the editors note, the diversity of cultivators and their motives is probably the most studied and best understood aspect of the situation. The chapters that deal with these issues advance that knowledge further. This part of the book deals with very basic sociological categories and concerns in a way that is both absolutely germane to the topic at hand and also, by virtue of this grounding, more illuminating about contemporary issues of law and society than many more abstract and self-consciously theoretical treatments. The fascinating thing about this topic from the standpoint of basic sociology is that cannabis cultivation spans a range from social movements to organized crime. Comprehending its rapid spread raises basic issues of law and society, rapid secular change, and the emergence of a globalized world in which physical and intellectual production move rapidly across national boundaries, and changes in one country quickly ramify around the globe.</p>
<p>The criminalization of the practice of cultivation when significant proportions of many national populations either actively use cannabis or disapprove of its criminalization creates a situation in which the categories of “crime,” “professional crime,” and “organized crime” become further unmoored from whatever degree of consensual definition they might have enjoyed previously. The book documents the widespread existence of people who grow solely for their own recreational or medical use; the equally widespread involvement of criminal entrepreneurs involved in other kinds of crime; and a wide spectrum of cases between these two extremes.</p>
<p>The more policy-oriented chapters document how hard it is to deal with this situation without either being excessively punitive toward those otherwise honest citizens or, the reverse, giving a free hand to large, pernicious criminal organizations. This policy dilemma is exacerbated by the seemingly insurmountable technical challenges of doing anything, at all, to control cultivation. As several chapters note, cannabis is a remarkably hardy plant that can be grown anywhere and the cultivation of which can be fairly easily concealed, even in densely populated urban areas. It is difficult to detect even outdoors and is not very vulnerable to chemical or biological control agents, some of which would threaten worldwide hops production if used. Rare indeed is the moral entrepreneur who would dare to threaten beer.</p>
<p>Criminalization of cultivation creates lots of problems for different kinds of people, yet efforts to devise alternatives have also proved problematic. The Dutch policy of decriminalizing the figurative “front door” of the “coffee shops” where cannabis may be sold in small amounts is an instructive case in point. The “back door” through which supplies enter remains criminalized. This has created a market for organized crime, which is a problem for the wider society. It has also created a problem for some cannabis consumers who dislike the high-THC-content cannabis produced under these conditions as a way of reducing bulk to avoid detection. Case studies of thoughtful attempts in Australia and Spain to allow small-scale cultivation illustrate the difficulties of moving beyond the contradictions of the current situations.</p>
<p>This book, to its credit, is not a work of advocacy. A reader can discern sympathy for small-scale cultivators in some places and sympathy for law enforcement and those concerned about public health in others. The collection as a whole, however, holds no brief for any particular policy prescriptions. It presents itself as a careful work of needed scholarship to inform public debate. It is that and that is as it should be.</p>
