<abstract>
<p>The amount of instruction students receive has long been viewed as a foundational educational resource. This article presents an analysis of the time students spend in elementary English language arts (ELA) and mathematics instruction. In mathematics, the average student received about 140 hr of instruction, but students in the top sixth of classrooms in this distribution can expect to receive between 80 and 160 hr more instruction over the school year than students assigned to the bottom sixth of classrooms. We found similar magnitudes of variation in ELA. Although most of the variation was due to differences among classrooms, there was also substantial variation among schools. Some variation in instructional time is expected and probably favorable. However, we argue that the large variation demonstrated by these results represent substantial inequity in students’ opportunity to learn ELA and mathematics.</p>

<body>
<p>The amount of time students spend in instruction is a foundational condition for learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0895904811417580">Carroll, 1963</xref>). Recognizing the importance of school time, policy makers have long sought to ensure that all students receive at least a minimum amount of instruction by legislating the length of the school year, the number of hours in the school day, and, at times, amounts of daily instruction in core academic subjects. In this article, we report results suggesting that the problem of ensuring that all students have equal access to instruction is far from solved.</p>
<p>Our interest in studying instructional time was sparked by a preliminary analysis using data collected as part of the Study of Instructional Improvement, a large-scale longitudinal study of three nationally disseminated comprehensive school reform programs. The two histograms below present distributions of the average daily instructional time for English language arts (ELA) and mathematics classrooms participating in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0895904811417580">Figure 1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0895904811417580">1</xref></sup>. In an average classroom, students receive 76 min of instruction a day in ELA and 46 min in mathematics. What stands out, however, are not the averages but rather the large variation across classrooms. A student in a classroom one standard deviation below the mean can expect to spend a daily average of 56 min less time in ELA instruction and 30 min less in mathematics instruction than a student attending the corresponding classroom one standard deviation above the mean. Although such differences may not be notable for any single day of instruction, when these differences persist over the course of a 180-day-long school year, they amount to very large inequities in students’ total instruction.</p>

</fig>
<p>This simple analysis caught our attention. Depending on the classroom they attend, students can expect to receive remarkably different amounts of instruction. Although others have noted that there is variation in the amount of instruction students receive, we wanted to better understand what factors were contributing to these substantial differences. Is variation in average daily time driven mainly by the number of days a subject is taught, the length of daily lessons, or a combination of lesson frequency and duration? Are the classrooms in which students receive substantially less instruction mostly clustered within particular schools or are they distributed evenly across schools? When students receive a below-average amount of instruction in ELA, do they tend to receive an above-average amount of instruction in mathematics? How do factors such as student and teacher absenteeism contribute to the amount of instruction students receive? What are the chances that a student is even likely to receive instruction on any given day?</p>
<p>In this article, we explore these questions. Although we recognize that devoting an article to detailed exploration of variation is somewhat unconventional, we think there is much to be learned by careful attention to conceptualizing, measuring, and describing variation in fundamental educational constructs such as instructional time. This provides policy makers and others focused on improving schools with critical guidance on appropriate targets for intervention. Of course, students’ access to instruction is not just determined by the quantity of instruction but the quality of instruction as well. The quality of instruction is certainly paramount in the opportunity that students have to learn and succeed in school; however, the quantity of instruction (or lack thereof) is also very important and can significantly affect student outcomes (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0895904811417580">Fisher &amp; Berliner, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>We begin with a brief discussion of prior research with a focus on a number of important conceptual distinctions and methodological approaches that have shaped the study of school time. In the Results section, we present findings from analyses that provide different views into understanding the amount of instruction students receive. These are intended to both demonstrate how students’ access to instruction varies and to illustrate important theoretical distinctions and methodological considerations that can guide future research on school time and related policy recommendations</p>
<sec id="section1-0895904811417580">
<title>Research on School Time</title>
<p>For more than a century, researchers have collected survey data on instructional time. One of the most comprehensive studies conducted in schools, published in 1928, was a report comparing instructional time in different districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0895904811417580">Mann, 1928</xref>). Nearly 3,000 surveys were sent to school superintendents asking for a breakdown of time allocated for instruction in each subject in the elementary grades. There was great variation, with one district reporting 20 hr per week for the teaching of mathematics, whereas another district reported just 4 hr per week. The authors concluded that “standardization in time allotment practice in the school systems of the United States is totally lacking . . . . While a certain amount of variation in time is to be expected and may be desirable, the extreme differences in current practice . . . seem almost incredible” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0895904811417580">Mann, 1928</xref>, p. 141). Almost half a century later, another survey revealed similar variation in exposure to instruction, except the focus in this case was on state-level variation. In Iowa, the average school year was 180 days, with an average daily attendance rate for students of 94.5%. Missouri schools, however, had an average school year of 174 days, with a student attendance rate of only 84%—a difference that amounted to roughly 25 days of instruction per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0895904811417580">Wiley &amp; Harnishfeger, 1974</xref>).</p>
<p>In the 1970s, there was a new wave of research that focused directly on classroom instruction. In these studies, instructional time was typically measured using researcher observations to record time spent during the observation period and, in some cases, how long particular students spent working on academic content, often referred to as <italic>time-on-task</italic> or <italic>academic engaged time</italic>. Many of these observational studies found a positive relationship between instructional time and achievement (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0895904811417580">Borg, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0895904811417580">Brophy &amp; Good, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0895904811417580">Carroll, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0895904811417580">Fisher &amp; Berliner, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0895904811417580">Gettinger, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0895904811417580">Purkey &amp; Smith, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0895904811417580">Stallings, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0895904811417580">Walberg, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0895904811417580">Wiley &amp; Harnischfeger, 1974</xref>).</p>
<p>The discussion to this point has only touched the surface of a large literature focused on the study of instructional time (for more extensive reviews of research on time, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0895904811417580">Berliner, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0895904811417580">Huyvaert, 1998</xref>). However, even this brief overview illustrates how studies divide along a conceptual and methodological boundary. One group of studies has focused on time allocated for instruction. These studies were mostly large scale and tended to employ survey instruments completed by district personnel, principals, and, in some cases, teachers. As attention turned to the study of teaching in the 1970s, researchers began to collect more precise measures using observations and direct coding of the instruction students received. These studies, however, tended to be very time-consuming and were by necessity much smaller scale, involving fewer teachers and fewer schools. As only a number of lessons were typically observed for each teacher, little could be said about whether these observational measures of time represented larger patterns in a teacher’s instruction across the year. Neither large-scale survey research, and the associated general data on allocated time, nor small-scale observational research, and the associated data on enacted time, capture the different types of variation in instructional time that students can experience across the school year.</p>
<p>The move from large-scale and coarse measures of instructional time to small-scale observational measures illustrates the ongoing effort to quantify the quality of instruction. When studies of the number of minutes allocated for instruction seemed to fail to capture important elements of instruction (was the time being used effectively?), measures were refined to capture students’ time-on-task. Academic learning time went one step further to try to measure how much of the time-on-task students actually spent learning new academic material. Each more refined measure of instructional time tried to get closer to how effectively time was used to support student learning.</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1980s, a number of scholars sought to respond to the limitations of conventional surveys and observations by developing a new type of measure commonly referred to as <italic>instructional logs</italic>. These measures were repeatedly administered over the course of the school year (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0895904811417580">Burstein et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0895904811417580">Knapp, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0895904811417580">Porter, Floden, Freeman, Schmidt, &amp; Schwille, 1986</xref>). Instructional logs represented a methodological breakthrough because they provided both detailed daily data on instruction and data on its variation across the school year. In his <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0895904811417580">1989</xref> study of the enacted curriculum, Porter collected data on the number of minutes the average student spent in mathematics instruction. Even though Porter’s study included only a few teachers, the data collected were very detailed because each teacher filled out an instructional log every day. Porter found, for example, that one teacher in the study spent twice as much time teaching mathematics as other teachers in the same school.</p>
<p>Researchers have also looked at instructional time as a critical measure in international comparisons. A variety of studies drawing on survey and administrative data have found that there is substantial variability in the amount of time allocated for schooling across countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0895904811417580">Amadio, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0895904811417580">Benavot, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0895904811417580">National Education Commission on Time and Learning, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0895904811417580">United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0895904811417580">World Bank, 1990</xref>). The Third International Mathematics Study focused on the instruction students received using both surveys and video analysis and found that students in different countries got substantially different amounts of instruction in math and science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0895904811417580">Stigler, Gonzales, Kawanka, Knoll, &amp; Serrano, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0895904811417580">Stigler &amp; Stevenson, 1991</xref>). Furthermore, results from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMS) provides evidence that this variation is positively associated with student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0895904811417580">Schmidt et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0895904811417580">Stevenson &amp; Stigler, 1992</xref>). There is emerging evidence that amount of variation within a country differs substantially. Results from the 1999 TIMSS video study, which recorded eighth-grade mathematics lessons in seven different countries, found that the lesson length varied most widely in the United States. The standard deviation of the lesson length was 17 min; in three of the countries, the standard deviation was 3 min or less.</p>
<p>Even this cursory review highlights the different methods and areas of interest that have characterized the study of instructional time. Whether the focus is on the classroom, school, district, state, or international comparisons, one finding that cuts across studies is the remarkable variability in school time. Again and again the research suggests that students can expect to receive very different amounts of instruction and that the amount of instruction students receive can have significant effects on student learning.</p>

<sec id="section2-0895904811417580">
<title>Conceptualizing, Measuring, and Analyzing Time</title>
<p>In this article, we describe variation in instructional time for elementary grade ELA and mathematics. We take as a baseline the total time by law that schools are required to deliver instruction, typically on the order of 180 days a year. We refer to this as <italic>allocated</italic> time. Moreover, like many others who have been interested in instructional time, we also focus on how time is spent in the classroom, what we refer to as <italic>enacted</italic> time. However, given our interest in school improvement and the work of school-level professionals such as principals, instructional leaders, and teachers, we also introduce a new category not identified in previous research—what we call <italic>possible</italic> time. Possible time refers to those days when both a student and his or her teacher are present in school and thus regular instruction can take place. Possible instruction days allows us to separate out how schools and teachers are using the time over which they have the most control, days when the regular classroom teacher and the student are in school. Teacher and student absences, although important issues, are not under the direct control of schools (although the effect of teacher absences on student learning may be offset if the school has a strategy to ensure that students receive valuable learning experiences even though the regular classroom teacher is away). Each of these distinctions in the definition of instructional time is described in more detail below.</p>
<p><italic>Allocated</italic> time is regulated by states, which set the length of the school year and the number of hours and minutes that constitute a school day. These regulations may be further modified by a school district in its negotiations with teachers’ unions or others with vested interests in school time. It is not surprising that researchers have long concerned themselves with the study and control of allocated time; it is these laws and regulations that determine how long schools are in session and thus set an outer bound on how much instruction students can receive. However, slippage can easily occur between requirements for allocated days or hours of schooling and the amount of instruction students actually receive. Indeed, students may not attain the number of days allocated for instruction simply because they are sick and thus absent from school.</p>
<p>Possible time is defined as days when neither a student nor his or her teacher is absent. When both the teacher and student are present in school, it is possible for regular instruction to take place. We recognize that when a teacher is absent and a substitute teacher takes over, some form of instruction may still take place. We do not, however, consider days when the teacher is absent to constitute <italic>regular</italic> instruction as students are likely to be busied with rote and undemanding work (if they do any relevant work at all; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0895904811417580">Miller, Murnane, &amp; Willett, 2008</xref>). However, not all possible days are used for instruction. There are many pressures on the time available in a possible day; these range from lunch and recess periods to physical education, to field trips, to time spent on the smaller details of classroom life such as lining up, walking through the halls, and taking bathroom breaks. In most schools, teachers and school leaders have great discretion over how to use possible time, spending anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, to no time at all on instruction in a given subject.</p>
<p>Enacted time is the time used for classroom instruction and refers to the amount of classroom instruction spent on a specific subject area, for example, 50 min for mathematics instruction or 2 hr for ELA instruction.</p>
<p>Each of these three categories moves one step closer to the amount of instruction students actually receive. It seems likely that different students attending different classrooms and schools will experience varying amounts of time for each of these categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0895904811417580">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>Distinctions in the conceptualization of time</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0895904811417580-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In the analyses presented in this article, we focus on variation in enacted time as a proportion of possible days of instruction. The use of daily instructional logs is integral to this analysis. Each log report focuses on a randomly selected target student. On a day when the target student misses instruction, the teacher is asked to record the reason for missing. Moreover, on days when the student receives instruction, the teacher records the length of the lesson. Over the course of the year and many log reports, this provides data for a classroom of students on the reasons that days of instruction are missed and on lesson length for days when instruction takes place. Estimates of instructional time from log data are not only much more precise than conventional survey measures but also offer the potential to identify and examine variation in how time is used as a proportion of only those days when students and teachers are present in school. In the following sections, we use data from instructional logs to study variation in the amount of instruction students receive in ELA and mathematics.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>Data for this study were collected as part of the Study of Instructional Improvement, a large-scale longitudinal study of elementary schools involved in comprehensive whole school reform programs. The sample of 112 elementary schools is roughly equally divided among schools participating in the Accelerated Schools Project, America’s Choice, and Success for All, and a fourth comparison group of schools participating in none of these programs. Schools are predominantly high poverty and urban, with 68% of schools located in large and small cities and no schools located in rural areas. The average school in the sample served neighborhoods where 19% of households were in poverty. Schools were located in a total of 15 states and 42 districts. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0895904811417580">Table 1</xref> includes additional descriptive statistics calculated from school means.</p>

<p>A total of 1,859 teachers of ELA in 2,496 classrooms and 1,540 teachers of mathematics in 1,802 classrooms provided detailed information about time spent in instruction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0895904811417580">2</xref></sup> Seventy-three percent of these teachers reported instruction in both subjects. The data collection occurred over 4 years and followed cohorts of students as they progressed from grade to grade. Some logging teachers taught a different grade in a subsequent year and ended up teaching students in more than one cohort. For this reason, the number of classrooms in the study is higher than the number of teachers.

<p>Data for this study were collected using instructional logs. The instructional logs are brief surveys completed by the classroom teacher at the end of each day of a logging period. Teachers completed two daily logs—one for ELA and one for mathematics. For each daily log, teachers described the instruction for a randomly selected target student and reported on their instruction for subject-specific topic areas (e.g., comprehension, word analysis, written composition, number concepts, operations, algebra). Teachers indicated the total minutes the target student spent in ELA and mathematics instruction for that day. On days when the target student spent no time in instruction, teachers selected from a list of reasons (e.g., target student absent, teacher absent, special activity, etc.). Teachers logged instruction for a 6 to 8-week period during the fall, winter, and spring. During each logging period, teachers were assigned to log on selected days, usually 3 or 4 of the 5 days in a week. Response rates were high, almost 90% in both ELA and mathematics for an average of about 40 logs per mathematics classroom and 29 logs per ELA classroom each year of the study. Eliminating the logs that were filled out incorrectly or were assigned to be filled out on days when school was not in session produced a total of 72,037 ELA logs and 72,842 mathematics logs over the course of 4 years. Extensive piloting established that the logs provided valid data on the instruction students receive, with teachers showing understanding of the categories used to characterize instruction and reporting on their instruction in ways that closely mirrored the use of logs by trained observers from the Study of Instructional Improvement research team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0895904811417580">Ball, Camburn, Correnti, Phelps, &amp; Wallace, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0895904811417580">Camburn &amp; Barnes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0895904811417580">Camburn &amp; Han, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Models</title>
<p>The time variables used in the analysis are at the lesson, classroom, and school level. Our analysis deals with two different outcome measures, frequency and duration of instruction. Frequency is a binary measure. Out of all <italic>possible</italic> days of instruction (i.e., days when both the teacher and student are present), any day on which instruction took place is coded 1 and any day on which instruction did not take place is coded 0. Duration is a continuous measure of the total number of minutes spent in instruction across the whole school day. The total minutes of instruction do not need to be contiguous and are often taken across different periods of instruction and aggregated over the course of the day. We used hierarchical linear and logistic regression models to investigate the variation of frequency and duration of instruction at the lesson, classroom, and school levels (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0895904811417580">appendix</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The results are presented in two sections. In the first section, we examine variation in instruction, looking first at frequency and next at duration for ELA and mathematics. In the second section, we explore whether there is compensation between frequency and duration (i.e., variation in days of instruction is compensated by adjusting lesson length) and between ELA and mathematics (i.e., variation in time devoted to ELA is compensated by adjusting time devoted to mathematics). To provide a context for each section and for our focus on possible days of instruction, we begin by briefly describing the major reasons that are given for missing days of instruction.</p>
<p>On average, students could expect to miss instruction in ELA or mathematics on approximately 1 out of every 4 to 5 days of a 180-day school year. Roughly, half of all missed days were due to teacher and student absenteeism (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0895904811417580">Table 3</xref>). As is the case with other measures of time discussed in this study, there was substantial variation across schools in the rate of absenteeism. Schools in the bottom sixth of the distribution had student absentee rates that ranged from 1.6% to 4.2% compared with schools in the top sixth of the distribution with absenteeism rates from 7.7% to 15.8%. Teacher absentee rates also varied with schools in the bottom sixth of the distribution ranging from 1.3% to 3.2% compared with the top sixth with teacher absentee rates ranging from 7.1% to 10.7%. Clearly, absenteeism is a far greater problem in some schools than others.</p>

<p>In the remainder of this article, we focus only on days when both teachers and students were present and thus available for instruction, what we refer to as possible days of instruction. As discussed earlier in the article, we are limiting the sample to examine the amount of instruction students receive on days when both the student and the teacher are present in school. We focus on possible instruction days because these are the school days over which administrators and teachers have the greatest control and these are the schools days when the regular classroom teacher is available to deliver instruction and students are available to receive instruction. As we are limiting the sample to possible instruction days and as teacher and student absences are not accounted for in the sample of days on which we perform the remainder of the analysis, the results provide an underestimate of the total amount of instruction students miss. In the analyses that follow, variation in the probability of receiving instruction represents the extent to which possible days were used for instruction in ELA and mathematics compared with other activities such as field trips, special events, standardized testing, or the myriad other noninstructional pursuits that can take up a school day.</p>

<title>Variation in ELA and Mathematics Instruction</title>
<p>How much variation was there in the probability that a student receives instruction in ELA and mathematics on a particular day? To answer this question, we used a three-level unconditional hierarchical logistic regression model with log responses nested within classrooms and classrooms nested within schools. At the first level, we used the binary log responses to estimate the probability of a student receiving instruction in a particular classroom. The next level estimates a probability that students will receive instruction in a particular school and estimates the variance of the classroom probabilities around the school-level probability. The top level estimates the overall probability and the variance of the school-level probabilities around the overall mean. Results from the unconditional model are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0895904811417580">Table 4</xref>.</p>

<p>Students had roughly a 90% probability of receiving instruction in ELA or mathematics on any given possible day of instruction. This translates into missing about one day of instruction every 2 weeks for those possible days when, in theory, regular instruction could have taken place. Seventy-two percent of the variance in the probability of receiving ELA instruction on any given day lies between classrooms within schools; the remaining 28% lies between schools. The picture is only slightly different in mathematics, where a student has an 88% probability of receiving instruction and 83% of the variance lies between classrooms within schools and 17% lies between schools. The reliability estimates for these two models are very high, which indicates that it is possible to reliably distinguish between classrooms and schools.</p>
<p>To translate these percentages into something more meaningful, we estimate the probability of a student receiving instruction in ELA or mathematics for five hypothetical schools. We select these schools from the school distribution such that they fall at −2 and −1 standard deviations below the mean, at the mean, and at +1 and +2 standard deviations above the mean (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0895904811417580">Table 5</xref>). As the distribution of the frequency of instruction measured in log odds is close to normal, it is possible to get a sense of the portion of time that will be described in this range of estimates. As school estimates roughly follow the normal distribution, about 95% of schools will be within two standard deviations of the mean and thus represent plausible extreme estimates. About 66% will fall within one standard deviation of the mean.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>The estimates of the probability of receiving instruction are a few percentage points higher for ELA than they are for mathematics, but the story is similar for both subjects. A student attending an average classroom in a school −1 standard deviation below the mean of school distributions (−1 <italic>SD</italic>) had an 84% probability of receiving instruction in ELA and 83% probability in mathematics on any given possible day of instruction. A student attending an average classroom in a school +1 standard deviation above the mean (+1 <italic>SD</italic>) had a 94% probability of receiving instruction in ELA and 91% probability in mathematics. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0895904811417580">Table 5 shows that at the lower extreme, there are schools where students received instruction on fewer than 80% of possible days (77% in ELA and 78% in mathematics).</xref> Keep in mind that these results only consider days when both the teacher and target student are present.</p>
<p>The variation in the probability of receiving instruction is greater among classrooms within a school. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0895904811417580">Table 6</xref>, we follow a similar procedure as we did above for schools to estimate the probability of receiving instruction in five hypothetical classrooms at −2 <italic>SD</italic>, −1 <italic>SD</italic>, at the mean, +1 <italic>SD</italic>, and +2 <italic>SD</italic>. However, in this case, we are just looking at these distributions in classroom probabilities for classrooms in the average school. For a student attending a classroom that is −1 <italic>SD</italic> below the mean of classrooms in an average school, the probability of receiving instruction on any given possible day was 80% in ELA and 76% in mathematics. In an average school, the probability of receiving instruction in a classroom at the mean of the classroom distributions was 90% in ELA and 88% in mathematics. The probability of receiving instruction goes up for classrooms at +1 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean of classroom distributions to 95% in ELA and 94% in mathematics.</p>

<p>These differences become more striking when these probabilities are translated into the number of days missed in a 180-day school year. We could decide to represent this as the variation in the total number of days that students <italic>get</italic> instruction. However, given our interest in school improvement, we find it useful to focus directly on differences in the amount of instruction that students <italic>miss</italic>, as many school reformers will focus on finding ways to ensure that students regularly receive instruction. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0895904811417580">Figure 3</xref>, we graph just the schools at −1 <italic>SD</italic>, the mean, and +1 <italic>SD</italic> and, within each of these schools, we show the number of days that students missed instruction in a classroom at −1 <italic>SD</italic>, the school mean, and +1 <italic>SD</italic>. This breakdown provides a visual reference for how classrooms vary both within and among schools. Note, for example, that students in a school that is −1 <italic>SD</italic> below the mean may have missed fewer days of instruction than students in a school +1 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean, depending on the classrooms to which they were assigned.</p>
<fig id="fig3-0895904811417580" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0895904811417580-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>However, these histograms also illustrate the degree of variation in missed days. This difference is substantial across schools—about 3 weeks difference in ELA and about 2.5 weeks difference in mathematics between schools −1 <italic>SD</italic> below and +1 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean for the average classroom. The number of days of instruction students missed varies even more dramatically across classrooms in a given school. In an average school, students in a classroom −1 <italic>SD</italic> below the mean received up to 25 days less ELA instruction compared with students in a classroom +1 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean. This is equivalent to roughly 5 weeks or about one seventh of the school year. In mathematics, that same comparison yields a difference of more than 30 days or approximately one sixth of the school year. The differences in the classrooms at −1 <italic>SD</italic> and +1 <italic>SD</italic> in the low schools are even larger, a difference of about 40 days, or almost one quarter of the school year. Students missed very different amounts of instruction depending on the school and classroom they attended.</p>
<p>How variable is the number of minutes devoted to instruction in ELA and mathematics on days when these subjects were taught? In the previous section, we examined variation in days or frequency of instruction. The probability of receiving instruction on a given possible day is an important, but incomplete, representation of enacted time. Knowing that instruction is taught on any given day says little about how much instruction students receive when the subject is taught. In this section, we examine the duration of instruction. Duration for ELA or mathematics is defined as the total minutes of instruction (i.e., aggregated across the entire day) on those possible days when instruction in that subject occurred. We begin by presenting results from the unconditional three-level hierarchical model with instructional log responses (i.e., total daily minutes of instruction) nested within classrooms nested within schools. Each level assumes the errors are normally distributed, which in an unconditional model is equivalent to assuming the outcome is normally distributed at each level.</p>
<p>On days when instruction occurred, students received on average 101.5 min of instruction in ELA and 63.1 min in mathematics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0895904811417580">Table 7</xref>). The reliability estimates for these two models are very high, which indicates that it is possible to reliably distinguish between classrooms and schools. Forty-eight percent of the variance in ELA minutes lies between occasions (i.e., lesson length) within classrooms. Thirty-eight percent of the variance in minutes devoted to ELA lies between classrooms within schools. The remaining 14% lies between schools. Again, the picture is only slightly different in mathematics, where 37% of the variation lies between occasion within classrooms, 42% between classrooms within schools, and 20% between schools.</p>

<p>To give some substantive meaning to the variance decomposition, we again model variation in five hypothetical schools. Following the same procedure used to illustrate the unconditional results above, we estimate the amount of time that students received ELA and mathematics on a day of possible instruction for the average classroom in five schools at different points on a standard distribution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0895904811417580">Table 8</xref>). A student in a school at −1 <italic>SD</italic> below the mean received about 27 fewer minutes of instruction on days when ELA was taught than a student in a school +1 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean.

Moreover, in mathematics, the difference in average lesson length was about 27 min. Although a substantial amount of the variation in lesson length lies between schools, the majority of this variation lies among classrooms within schools.</p>

<title>Compensation Factors</title>
<p>To this point, we have examined duration and frequency independently. We have also examined time spent in ELA and mathematics independently. However, duration and frequency and time devoted to instruction in different subject matter areas may not be independent. Instead, it is likely that these constructs are interdependent. When days of instruction are missed, for example, the duration of lessons may be adjusted to compensate for lost time. In addition, substantial time devoted to ELA may result in a reduction in time devoted to mathematics. In this section, we examine these compensation factors.</p>
<p>To explore compensation between subjects, we calculated the correlation between time spent in ELA and mathematics at the classroom and school level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0895904811417580">Table 10</xref>). The analysis is restricted to the 73% of teachers who completed logs for both ELA and mathematics. All correlations are positive, significant, and very large. This is a surprising finding. One might expect that given the limits imposed by the amount of time available in a school day, additional time devoted to one subject would lead to a reduction in time in another. For ELA and mathematics, this is not the case. Classrooms and schools where students received more ELA instruction also tended to be places where students received <italic>more</italic> mathematics instruction. The correlations were especially high at the school level.</p>

<p>Did students who missed possible days of instruction get longer lessons to make up for lost time? To investigate this question, we ran simple correlations between students’ probability of receiving instruction and average lesson length. We did this at both the classroom and the school level. The correlations are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0895904811417580">Table 11</xref>. Although all of the correlations are negative and relatively small, these results do indicate a small compensation effect. That is, students who receive instruction more frequently tend to have slightly shorter lessons.</p>

<p>Although there is evidence for compensation between duration and frequency, we wondered if the compensation produced relatively equal amounts of instructional time over the course of the school year. To examine this question, we estimated students’ total number of instructional hours over a year by multiplying the percentage of days that instruction occurred and lesson length. Once again, we represent these results for schools and classrooms one and two standard deviations below and above the mean.</p>
<p>At the school level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0895904811417580">Table 12</xref>), students attending a school −1 <italic>SD</italic> below the mean received substantially fewer hours of instruction than students in a school at +1 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean; the difference amounts to 85 hr in ELA and 53 hr in mathematics. Looking at the schools at the extremes shows that there are some elementary schools that are spending twice as much time in ELA or mathematics than other schools.</p>

<p>The variation across classrooms is even larger. Consider first the variation in instruction between classrooms in the average school. In mathematics, a student assigned to a classroom −1 <italic>SD</italic> below the mean in the average school received about 80 fewer hours of instruction over the year than a student assigned to a classroom +1 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean. At the extreme, these differences are roughly 160 hr, that is, more instruction than the average student received in an entire year. The variation across ELA classrooms is even larger. For example, a student in a classroom −1 <italic>SD</italic> below the mean received only half of the amount of ELA instruction compared with a student in a classroom +1 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table13-0895904811417580">Table 13</xref>). Clearly, the small compensation effect reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0895904811417580">Table 11</xref> is too small for lesson length to compensate for missed days of instruction.</p>

<p>Although variation in total time is clearly much larger within schools, this does not mean that the variation between schools is inconsequential. Consider the following example comparing two students attending different schools. The first student is attending an elementary school that is −1 <italic>SD</italic> below the mean. Also, let us assume that this student attends the school for all 5 years of his or her elementary program and receives instruction each year in a classroom at the school mean. The second student attends a nearby school that is +1 <italic>SD</italic> above the mean for 5 years and receives instruction each year in a classroom at the school mean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0895904811417580">Figure 4</xref>). These two students over the course of their elementary years will receive very large differences in the amount of instruction they receive. In both subjects, the differences would approach twice as much instruction as the average student receives in a single year.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>For more than a century, researchers have found that students can expect to receive different amounts of instruction depending on their classroom, school, district, state, or country. However, recent international studies show strong evidence that the problem of instructional variation is much worse in the United States than in high-achieving countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0895904811417580">Hiebert et al., 2003</xref>). The findings from this study both reinforce and advance this long tradition of research on school time. On every dimension we examined, there was substantial variation in instructional time. Both the number of days that a subject is taught (i.e., frequency) and the length of daily lessons (i.e., duration) contribute to variation in instructional time. Although there is evidence that missed days of instruction are compensated for by increasing lesson length, the compensation is small, and when both lesson frequency and duration are combined, there is enormous variation in total time. These results suggest that missed days of instruction are not recovered and should be counted as lost time and arguably lost opportunity to learn.</p>
<p>We found no evidence for compensation in the time spent in ELA and mathematics. In fact, we found the opposite. Students who received more instruction in one subject were likely to also receive more instruction in the other. It is possible that this finding reflects recent policies that focus attention on the core subjects of ELA and mathematics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0895904811417580">The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001</xref>) and consequently less time was devoted to other subjects such as art or history. However, it is also possible that schools and classrooms differ in the extent to which academic instruction is a priority and this finding reflects efficiency in allocating possible time to core academic subjects. Finally, we found that classrooms that devoted less time to instruction were distributed fairly evenly across schools. As a practical matter, this suggests that inequities in the amount of instruction that students receive was a problem shared by the vast majority of students participating in the study.</p>
<p>These analyses have important implications for policy makers and others seeking to improve instruction. Just adding hours to the school day or days to the school year could have limited return in schools and classrooms that make inefficient use of the time already available for instruction. Even when schools and teachers have equal opportunity to deliver instruction to students, some actually deliver that instruction frequently and at increased duration, and others do not.</p>
<p>Simply requiring additional or longer school days will not necessarily yield more time devoted to instruction. Consider schools and teachers that are given more instructional time. The actual use of this “extra” time may vary widely. Some may use it for noninstructional activities, or just take longer to implement their current status quo instruction. Others, however, would use the additional days and hours to increase students’ access to academic content. Increasing students’ access to instruction may require very different types of interventions that focus, for example, on providing teachers and other school-level actors with a variety of incentives and complementary resources for managing instructional time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0895904811417580">3</xref></sup> Finally, it is important to recognize that focusing just on increasing the amount of instruction cannot be the sole target for improvement. Although having time to teach and learn is a critical condition, policy makers and teachers in particular must also attend to the quality of instruction.</p>
<p>One clear limitation of this study is the extent to which these results can be generalized. Even though the schools in the Study of Instructional Improvement are similar in many ways to schools in a nationally representative sample (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0895904811417580">Hill, Rowan, &amp; Ball, 2005</xref>), we are cautious in extending these results beyond the context of this particular study. Although one could certainly argue that the schools in this study and thus the variation demonstrated in these analyses are still contained within American schools in general, the particular variance components could be uniquely related to our sample. Complex descriptive analyses like those presented in our study would be more robust when conducted using nationally or internationally representative probability samples.</p>
<p>Another limitation is that we only had data on how time was spent on two school subjects, ELA and mathematics. Certainly, there are other valuable activities and subjects that should be focused on in school beyond these two subjects. However, we do not have the data to explore the interactions and trade-offs among all, or many, of the other school activities. This could be a fruitful area for future research.</p>
<p>This study raises many questions that are of interest to policy makers and others who want to improve instruction. Is there something causing the large variation in instructional time between schools and between classrooms? Is the variation associated with school structure, size, demographics, teacher background, or class characteristics? Answers to these questions could be helpful for policy makers and other school administrators who can help insure that students receive adequate amounts of instruction. Although these questions are beyond the scope of this article, in a companion analysis, we found that whole school reform programs with strong interventions on instructional time can have a substantial effect by substantially reducing the number of classrooms where students receive very low amounts of instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0895904811417580">Corey, Phelps, Demonte, Harrison, &amp; Ball, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The analyses presented in this article are also intended to advance conceptual and methodological tools. We made a number of key decisions to focus our analysis on constructs relevant to researchers and policy makers interested in school improvement. One pivotal decision was to focus on possible days of instruction. By parsing out days of instruction missed due to teacher and student absenteeism, we focused on days for which the allocation of time to instruction is arguably most directly under the control of teachers, principals, and other school-level actors. We recognize, however, that some schools and associated school improvement programs may have a structure in place that allows the students to progress toward learning goals even when the regular classroom teacher is absent and that such strategies could increase students’ access to instruction on days when their regular teacher is absent. Absenteeism, both on the part of students and teachers, accounts for nearly half of all missed days of instruction and absenteeism rates are also hugely variable across classrooms and schools. If absenteeism were included in the analyses presented in this article, we would report even greater variability in students’ access to instruction.</p>
<p>We also made decisions about what to include in the definition of instructional time. For example, we choose to consider test preparation and field trips as “noninstructional” time and therefore not part of regular instruction. Such decisions are a matter of definition. We recognize that the analyses presented in this article could be modified to construct different composites of instruction. Or the analyses could simply be extended to examine how aspects of schooling such as field trips or test preparation vary for students across classrooms or schools. We do not view this as a weakness or limitation of our analyses. Instead, we think this is simply an illustration that complex descriptive analyses provide many different opportunities to define constructs of interest and to study relevant variation.</p>
<p>By delving into careful descriptive analyses, we have sought to demonstrate that attention to how instructional time is conceptualized, measured, and analyzed can reveal important sources of variation that need to be better understood and studied by researchers. The detailed descriptions provided in this article are not the norm in conventional analyses of variables such as instructional time. When variation is reported and discussed, the norm is to report a mean and standard deviation, sometimes accompanied by histograms like those presented at the opening of this article. Although such reports of distributions can be revealing, they can also mask many important features of variation. The types of analyses used in this article to disaggregate the data and to show variation across multiple constructs provides valuable insights into the amount of instruction students received. It is also important to note that many of the analyses presented were only possible because of the combination of the use of innovative measures, hierarchical modeling techniques, and careful consideration of how to usefully represent results.</p>
<p>We want to emphasize that our focus in this article on instructional time is not intended as an argument that intervening on time alone should be the goal of efforts to improve instruction. Naive policies that only focus, for example, on increasing the length of lessons may do little to improve student learning. Instead, our purpose is to draw attention to the enormous variation in instructional time and to the reality that students, even students in the same school, can receive remarkably different amounts of instruction in ELA and mathematics. We can think of no argument to support this degree of variation in instructional time and expect that students receiving limited amounts of instruction are being deprived of a basic opportunity to learn ELA and mathematics. Of course, ultimately, it is what happens during instruction that will matter most for students’ learning. Taken together, increasing instructional time and improving the content of instruction would be a potent combination. In the hands of a highly skilled teacher, an extra 100 hr of instruction a year could make an enormous difference for student learning. Ensuring that no student is left shortchanged in their basic access to instruction should be a matter of great concern for policy makers, educators, or anyone else interested in improving the quality of schooling.</p>
