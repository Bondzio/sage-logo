<p>There are many new and exciting challenges facing tourism researchers, the field of tourism, and higher education in general. Interestingly, there are a number of recent articles challenging academic research, arguing that it has become much too esoteric and not really relevant to today’s world. How many times have we seen such comments regarding the value of structural equation modeling (SEM) or some other esoteric tool that is used for mining data? On the other hand, other scholars have questioned the rigor of current research where they argue that the contributions of what arguably can be characterized as “descriptive science” as nothing less than fantasy. Still other articles have focused on the integrity of the academic research and our community; this work includes the continuing discussion regarding the implications surrounding A level (or SSCI) journals, the “publish or perish” mentality, and the ability of people to “construct or falsify” data and the many unintended consequences of these issues. Importantly, it seems that through all of this discussion/controversy, the quickly growing scholarly literature in tourism seems to have matured to a state where we can now begin to appreciate the differences in, and value of, various research approaches. Indeed, it seems that much of the existing literature in the leading tourism journals is “problem based” and descriptive while few articles are broadly conceptual, with the goal of building theory or evaluating a complete research idea. Interestingly, this is not simply the case in tourism, but recent articles in marketing and elsewhere have come to the same conclusion. Unfortunately, this trend toward limited-perspective “research focused articles” has had substantial impact on the intellectual development of our field in many ways, including defining the focus of the research problem, the training/education of doctoral students, as well the metrics used for faculty evaluation.</p>
<p>The goal of the Foundations in Tourism Research Series is to provide dedicated space in the <italic>Journal of Travel Research</italic> so that it can encourage further development of conceptual and more comprehensive discussion of critical issues in tourism. It is anticipated that the <italic>Journal</italic> will publish one Foundations article in each issue starting May 2013. The Series will include wholly conceptual and conceptual–empirical articles dealing within a wide range of topics related to tourism. The following table provides basic guidelines for papers that will be published in the Series; this table is based on Yadav (2010), who provides a very penetrating discussion of the consequences of the current culture that is promulgated by the same forces that affect the tourism literature. As can seen, the emphasis of the articles published within the Series is on theory development through the integration of knowledge and the use of substantiated evidence and precise language so as to contribute meaningfully to the field.</p>

<p>Authors are encouraged to submit proposals for articles directly to the editor of the Series. The process of consideration and review will be managed by the Series editor, whereby the idea will first be considered prior to its development. Once the topic of the article has been agreed upon including timing, the paper will be reviewed following standard practices of the Journal. A Series Review Committee has been created to advise the editor in terms of topics/issues that might be included in the Series as well to provide initial manuscript review. On behalf of the Rick Perdue (the editor of the Journal), I hope that the articles included in the Foundations to Tourism Research Series contribute in some way to your research, either directly by supporting/facilitating your research program or by providing alternative perspectives on a particular topic.</p>
