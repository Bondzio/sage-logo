<p>We compared ultrasonography (US)-guided injection, targeting the extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) in de Quervain’s disease (dQD) with septation, to clinical injection. Forty-four wrists were randomly allocated to US-guided or manual (non-US-guided) injection. At 4 weeks, pain was significantly reduced in both groups. Pain on the 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) for the US group was 80.3 (SD 19.6) mm at baseline and 25.6 (SD 15.1) mm at 4 weeks after injection (<italic>p</italic> = 0.004). Values for the manual group were 78.0 (SD 18.5) mm at baseline and 58.2 (SD 21.9) mm at 4 weeks after injection (<italic>p</italic> = 0.04). Pain on the VAS showed a more significant decrease in the US-guided than in the manual injection group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0007) from baseline to 4 weeks after injection. The results of this study suggest US-guided injection targeting the EPB in dQD patients with septation is more effective than manual injection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>De Quervain’s disease (dQD) is a stenosing tenosynovitis of the first compartment of the wrist, which is formed by the tendons of the abductor pollicis longus (APL) and extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411427829">IIyas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411427829">Finkelstein et al., 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411427829">Moore et al., 1997</xref>). There is often septation between the APL and EPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411427829">Aktan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411427829">Volpe et al., 2010</xref>). There are two types of dQD. Type I dQD is characterized by a tight constriction of both tendons by a clear loop-shaped retinaculum with no evidence of septation between the two tendons. Type II dQD is characterized by an evident septation, and the retinaculum compresses only the EPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411427829">Volpe et al., 2010</xref>). We believe that these two types of dQD are caused by an anatomical difference based on septation of the compartment.</p>
<p>Intra-sheath steroid injection is one of the best therapeutic approaches to dQD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411427829">Sawaizumi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411427829">Witt et al., 1991</xref>). However, in some cases (15–20%) it is not sufficiently effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411427829">Richie et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411427829">IIyas et al., 2007</xref>). Intra-sheath injection failure is probably due to the presence of septation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411427829">Mirzanli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411427829">Sawaizumi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411427829">Volpe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193411427829">Zingas et al., 1998</xref>). We hypothesized that, in case of injection failure due to septation, a US-guided injection targeting the EPB might be effective. In dQD cases without septation, the intra-sheath injection will contact the EPB. In this study, we treated only dQD patients with septation.</p>
<p>High-resolution ultrasonography (US) has markedly progressed in recent years. US images are very clear, and US-guided injection systems have been developed. It is now easy to administer injections under US guidance. This study was designed to determine whether US-guided injection targeting the EPB is effective for dQD with septation.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1753193411427829">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>This was a prospective, open-label, randomized study. Randomization was achieved using the envelope method. Patients were allocated using a 1:1 ratio to the US or non-US groups. This study was approved by the appropriate ethics committee (Hiroshima Clinic, Hiroshima City, Hiroshima, Japan).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1753193411427829">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>Candidates were recruited from among patients diagnosed with dQD. The inclusion criteria were a history of pain in the first dorsal compartment of the wrist aggravated by excessive use of the thumb and a positive Finkelstein’s test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411427829">Forman et al., 2005</xref>). Hand surgeons with at least 10-year of clinical experience devised the inclusion criteria. Patients were seen at Hiroshima, Hatta, or Sky Clinic between April 2009 and December 2010. Patients with dQD were eligible if they had active disease (wrist pain VAS &gt; 50 by 100 mm visual analog scale [VAS]), despite prior treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during the previous 4 weeks. All patients were candidates for surgery. Recruited patients underwent US examination by an experienced radiologist. If the patient showed defined septation of the first compartment, they were enrolled in the study. Patients were excluded if they were under 18 years of age, pregnant, had rheumatoid arthritis, or had previously received an intra-sheath injection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1753193411427829">
<title>Study protocol</title>
<p>dQD patients were randomly allocated to US-guided injection targeting the EPB or manual (non-US-guided targeting of the first compartment) injection. The US-guided injection system (Ultra-Pro Needle Guide; CIVICO, Kalona, Iowa, USA) was used for all US-guided injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411427829">Figure 1</xref>). All injections were performed by one of the authors. A mixture of 20 mg of triamcinolone (40 mg/ml) and 1 ml of 1% lidocaine was injected.</p>

</fig>
<p>We conducted questionnaires related to subjective symptoms (wrist pain by 100 mm VAS) at baseline and 4 weeks after injection. All patients with worsening dQD disease activity at 4 weeks were allowed to switch to surgery (the patient’s choice). Number of surgeries and adverse events possibly related to treatment at 6 weeks after injection were assessed. The primary outcome was a reduction in wrist pain (VAS) from baseline to 4 weeks in each group. The secondary outcome was the proportion of patients who switched to surgery within 6 weeks after injection in each group. Permitted concomitant drugs included NSAIDs at stable doses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1753193411427829">
<title>US evaluation and US-guided injection</title>
<p>US examinations at baseline were performed by an experienced radiologist. The first compartment was scanned in short and long axes to compare symptomatic and asymptomatic sides in the same patient, confirm septation between the EPB and APL, and also confirm definite tendinosis. Images were stored from all examinations, and US reliability was examined at the end of the study by the same sonographer as well as an additional one (both experienced).</p>
<p>US-guided injections were performed by an experienced rheumatologist, not by the radiologist performing the US or follow-up evaluations. A Toshiba EU 7000 (Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan) with a high resolution 7.5–14 MHz linear probe was used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1753193411427829">
<title>Clinical evaluation</title>
<p>A rheumatologist with more than 10 years of experience and blinded to the whether the patient was in the US-guided or manual group assessed questionnaires related to subjective symptoms (wrist pain by 100 mm VAS) at baseline and 4 weeks after injection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1753193411427829">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All analyses were carried out on an intention-to-treat basis. Measures of wrist pain (VAS) at baseline and 4 weeks after injections were compared in each group using repeated-measures analysis of variance. The ratios of surgeries total in each group at 6 weeks after injection were compared between groups using the Chi-squared test. Statistically analyses were carried out using SPSS version 15 (IBM, Chicago, Illinois, USA). The level of significance was set at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1753193411427829">
<title>US intra- and inter-observer reliability</title>
<p>Intra-observer reliability of the US assessment was evaluated by recording representative images. The stored images from each patient were assessed under blinded conditions by the same investigator, with a corresponding real-time US examination at least 3 months later. Intra-observer reliability for the US was evaluated by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (2-way mixed effects). Sensitivity to US change was assessed by estimating the smallest detectable difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411427829">Blandt et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193411427829">Wells et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Inter-observer reliability between US investigators was evaluated using Kendall’s W test, with a value &lt; 0.40 considered poor, 0.40–0.50 moderate, 0.50–0.70 good, and 0.70–1 excellent.</p>
<p>This study was approved by the Hiroshima Clinic ethical committee.</p>

<title>US evaluations at baseline</title>
<p>In total, 311 dQD patients were evaluated using US. Of these, 252 lacked clear septation of the first compartment. Fifty-nine dQD patients were suspected to have the septation, but it was unclear in 14 patients. Definite septation was seen in 44 patients. According to US findings, all 44 dQD patients with septation only had tendinosis of the EPB, with no tendinosis of the APL.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>dQD is a stenosing tenosynovitis of the first compartment of the wrist which is formed by the tendons of the APL and EPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411427829">Finkelstein et al., 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411427829">IIyas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411427829">Moore et al., 1997</xref>). However, the main lesion of dQD might be a stenosing tenosynovitis of the EPB alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411427829">Volpe et al., 2010</xref>). In our study, all dQD cases with septation only had tendinosis of the EPB. No dQD patients with septation had tendinosis of the APL. Studies of dQD patients with and without septation are needed to assess the efficacy of US-guided injection targeting the EPB. In dQD cases without septation, we assume that the intra-sheath injection passes around the EPB easily. Hence, we studied dQD patients with septation only.</p>
<p>In this study, US-guided injection targeting the EPB of dQD with septation was found to be more effective than clinically guided manual injection. The same specialist performed both the guided and unguided injections. The post-procedure differences between the two groups suggest that precise injections targeting the EPB are very difficult by the unguided method.</p>
<p>Anatomically, the EPB is a smaller space than the APL, and the EPB is also deeper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411427829">Aktan et al., 1998</xref>). The manual injection (without US guidance) for dQD with septation might not be optimal for the EPB. We believe that US-guided injection is accurate and useful for dQD with septation.</p>
<p>We demonstrated a significant difference in pain scores at 4 weeks between the two groups, although there was a large overlap of confidence intervals. The potential for placebo effect cannot be ignored. Blinded studies of non-US-guided interventions are needed to confirm our results. All patients were candidates for surgery, and some of our study participants elected to switch to surgery early in the study. Our observation period was short, only 4 weeks, and just one injection was given. Further study of a longer duration with several injections is necessary. Furthermore, a study with blinded injections confined to one compartment with no diffusion into other compartments would provide more precise data. US-guided injection targeting of the EPB in dQD patients with septation may allow surgical intervention to be avoided, though we cannot draw a definite conclusion in this regard as the observation time in this study was very short.</p>
