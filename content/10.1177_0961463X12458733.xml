<abstract>
<p>How is competition to be understood as a time-bound activity? While the comparison of task completion success is a central feature of competition, time is routinely used as a principle through which contests are organized, either as a direct measure of success or as a constraining resource that insures the contest is fair. In competitions various models of temporal organization (and sequential turn-taking) organize strategy and produce constraints that lead to the evaluation of success. I present an ethnography of competitive chess to demonstrate the centrality and consequences of temporality in contests in which time is used as a resource. Time shapes chess on the macro-level (for organizing events), the meso-level (as interpersonal engagement), and the micro-level (as psychic pressure). Put together, activities create a <italic>temporal tapestry.</italic> Treating time as a resource in competitive activity emphasizes that rules depend on temporal strategies to create equitable outcomes.</p>

<p>If you take too much time for one move, you have that much less for the rest of your life. (‘Deep Chess’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961463X12458733">Ferlinghetti, 1988</xref>: 48)</p></disp-quote>
<sec id="sec1-0961463X12458733" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The influential Swiss sociologist Norbert Elias argues that while people feel time as a personal reality, it is organized as a communal reality. In effect, chronological experience becomes a form of temporal capital, something to be deployed for strategic ends. Time may feel private, but within social domains it is developed in concert with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961463X12458733">Gibson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0961463X12458733">Sharron, 1982</xref>). Even if time is felt, it is often treated as a resource, as something to systematize social life. Further, technologies of time force us to adjust our interactional engagements through institutional requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961463X12458733">Elias 1992</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>Time as a resource is evident at home and at work – required domains – but this form of temporal organization is particularly salient in the voluntary and expressive domains of game and sport in which worlds are artificial by design. In these realms, participants structure rules of engagement, using time as a means to create equity of participation, providing common temporal expectations and opportunity. Shared temporal regulation defines mnemonic communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0961463X12458733">Zerubavel, 1982</xref>). I address how the regulation of time systematizes competitive activity using chess as a critical case, demonstrating that temporality creates an interaction order on the macro, meso, and micro-level. These dimensions, creating a <italic>temporal tapestry</italic> of action, are not independent, but each shapes the effects of the others.</p>
<p>Competition requires rules that order activity so that an unequal outcome results from an equitable process. Fair access to the use of time is critical to this equality. Time can be used in several ways, directly or implicitly (through sequential turn-taking, turns which may be of variable length). Examining the organization of competition, I refer to five competitive structures, each of which involves a model of fairness, although the explicit relevance of time varies: segmental structuring, completion measures, temporal comparison, shared time, and time as resource.</p>
<p>First, there are turn-taking competitions in which success depends upon independent achievement within <italic>segmental structures</italic> with rotating ownership of the segment. Time is not measured directly, but there is a sequential shifting of control, even if the segments are of variable length. Examples are ‘inning’ games, such as baseball or bowling, or match games such as tennis or ping pong in which one participant has an active role (such as serving the ball). A variant of the segmental form is when the segments are timed, and participants compete to achieve goals in that time period. This is evident in word games, like Taboo, or the television show Password, in which competitors must guess words hinted at by partners in a fixed time period.</p>
<p>A second organizational form is based on the comparison of <italic>completion measures</italic> of a set of tasks that participants compete in parallel without the measurement of time being directly tied to the criterion of judgment. While there is often a turn-taking sequence (as in golf, when the player who is furthest from the hole has priority), the participants perform the same activities together. Success is judged on a numerical metric that defines the efficiency of task completion (golf with its number of strokes per hole is an example, although with 18 holes, golf also constitutes a set of segments).</p>
<p>These forms of organization involve sequence, but not timing as such. In contrast, the most direct use of time involves <italic>temporal comparison</italic>: activities in which the duration to complete an activity is measured and compared with other participants (track events are a case in point). The person with the shortest time to completion wins. Time is explicitly the gauge of success. A fourth organizational form involves <italic>shared time</italic> in which opponents compete to use a period of shared time with the more successful declared the winner (soccer is an example in which a set time is used by both teams).</p>
<p>Finally domains exist in which time is treated as a <italic>resource</italic>, common in competitive two-person games. Each participant is awarded a set amount of time to spend as desired in considering potential moves (chess, checkers, and go are examples). This assumes a period of active calculation prior to each move. The time as given can be used by each of the players, even if one player owns the time. This structure permits the player to use his opponent’s time to calculate and consider. The total amount of time of the contest is an additive result of the separate temporal choices of the competitors.</p>
<p>These structures emphasize that the usage of turn and time is not a personal choice, but part of a tradition or an agreed-upon structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0961463X12458733">Sorokin and Merton 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0961463X12458733">Zerubavel 1997</xref>). In this analysis I focus on the fifth category, examining how in competition time is treated a resource for each participant, although it is, as noted, a resource that the opponent can utilize as well. While this reflects a particular form of leisure organization, it constitutes a more general example of how time is apportioned in competition. The assumption is that each player ‘owns’ a certain amount of time, which can be utilized as a tactical weapon to support one’s calculations or limit those of an opponent. At first it appears that both participants have full control of their temporal resources; however this masks that one’s personal time is utilized in light of the temporal organization of the activity. It operates in light of the organization of events, the strategies of the competitors, and how competitors cope with psychic pressure.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0961463X12458733"><title>Observing chess</title>
<p>For five years (2006–2010) I examined numerous domains of chess through ethnographic observation; this field research was supplemented with in-depth interviews, and extensive analysis of books, magazines, websites, and Internet discussion boards. Most ethnographers study a single site or several parallel sites. However, my goal was to examine the diversity of chess. I wished to examine a cultural field that was characterized by specialization and differentiation, attempting to understand how community is established in a world of status divisions and differential involvement. This required that I immerse myself not in the world of chess but in the worlds of chess.</p>
<p>Specifically I observed at the following locations:
<list id="list1-0961463X12458733" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The Marshall Chess Club on West 10th Street in Greenwich Village, one of the oldest and most prestigious American chess clubs, in both 2006 and 2010: a total of six observations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The open chess tables in Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village on four occasions in 2006.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Elementary school chess programs in New York and Chicago on six occasions in 2006 and 2008.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Weekly meetings of a suburban chess club for four months during 2006 and 2007 and several matches and lessons at a privately-run chess center in Chicago during 2008.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Biweekly meetings of a suburban high school chess team for a season from September 2007 until April 2008.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Weekly meetings of a collegiate chess team for 10 weeks from September until November 2008.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Six private chess lessons in May and June 2008.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Weekly meetings of a private adolescent chess group, taught by a grandmaster, for 10 weeks in February through April 2009.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Weekly matches of a professional chess team in the United States Chess League for 10 weeks from late August to early November 2009.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>During the period 2006–2010, I attended several dozen tournaments, including the World Open, the Chicago Open, the United States Open, the Illinois State High School Chess Championship, the National Youth Action Tournament, the Atlantic City International Tournament, the National High School Tournament, the Super Nationals (a 5000-person tournament in Nashville, held every third year for children and adolescents in high school, junior high school and elementary school), matches in the Chicago Industrial Chess League, the Pan-Am Collegiate Championship, a simul and lecture conducted by former World Champion Anatoly Karpov, high school matches and tournaments, and local tournaments sponsored by the Renaissance Knights in the Chicago area.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Over the years I met a dozen of the top 100 American chess players, and became friends with several. Finally, I relied on my memory of being a chess parent in the late 1980s and early 1990s when I took my son to elementary school tournaments and for two years organized a chess club at my son’s elementary school. I have played chess, but I am not a ‘tournament-level’ player. My goal was not to understand chess strategy, but to understand chess culture.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest challenge of conducting ethnography at chess tournaments is the reality that tournament games are silent. Fortunately there are times before and after games, including meals, meetings, and lectures, as well as website posts, in which slow-moving visuals are bolstered by words. Many chess players are highly verbal and, not coincidentally, opinionated.</p>
<p>During the course of this project, I conducted in-depth interviews with nearly 50 organizers and players at various skill-levels from grandmasters to players of modest abilities. I interviewed adults, collegians, and high school players. These interviews lasted from 45 minutes to three hours.</p>
<p>I also had access to several public Internet sites, including discussion boards operated by the United States Chess Federation and real-time discussion boards during leading chess matches, operated by the Internet Chess Club. I also read several chess blogs regularly. This was bolstered by examining chess literature. Among the magazines I read regularly during my research (2006–2010) were the USCF’s <italic>Chess Life</italic> and the international <italic>New in Chess.</italic> I also spent three days at the John G. White Collection of Chess Literature at the Cleveland Public Library, examining their collection, one of the largest collections of chess literature in the United States, focusing on works from the nineteenth century. Sociologist Antony Puddephatt shared his ethnographic field notes from Canadian tournaments and club meetings and approximately a dozen interviews with tournament-level Canadian players.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0961463X12458733"><title>Temporal collaboration</title>
<p>Chess is a game of mind, a game of heart, and a game of space, but, when played competitively, it is also a game of the clock. Outside of tournament activity chess may have a timeless quality, but even without explicit time limits social pressures impel players not to spend too long considering their next move.</p>
<p>At tournaments players can lose a game in two ways. The first is widely recognized and is essential to chess. One’s king must be in a position where it cannot move out of check (checkmate) or is recognized to be so eventually (leading to a resignation). In informal chess games this is the fundamental outcome: time is not measured. However, tournaments operate with a second form of closure. Players can lose ‘on the board’ or they can lose ‘on the clock’. While players select how much time to use for each move, they have a time limit. If they exceed this, they lose.</p>
<p>Time is so central to tournament chess that it has a formal name, ‘clock management’. Clocktime even matters in games that are not played with a chess clock; there are unstated understandings as to how long a move and a game should take. If one player moves too rapidly, his opponent may feel pressured, if too slow, bored. Both are unsatisfactory; they do not provide the contentment that permits voluntary activity, leading to an indisposition to continue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961463X12458733">Goffman, 1961</xref>).</p>
<p>Time is institutionalized in that the key sanction in a tournament (for instance, the punishment if a cell phone rings) is to subtract time or to give the opponent extra time. In the United States Chess League, the professional league of chess players, if a team switches players scheduled to play in a match after a certain deadline, the opposing team is given a time advantage (Field notes). Time and material have different standing; it is <italic>never</italic> the case that the punishment consists of removing a pawn or permitting an opponent an extra move. That time is used as the sanction suggests that time has a negotiable quality, whereas the moves or pieces in the game are treated as sacred, not to be altered by a rule violation.</p>
<p>Throughout the domain of chess, time matters. It can be conceptualized in macro-terms (the structured temporality of the tournament), meso-terms (the strategic temporality of the game), and micro-terms (the experienced temporality of the player). Time as a resource shapes the event, the relationship between players, and the player’s lived experience. It is essential to the creation of fair competition. These dimensions overlap so that a tournament is organized in light of temporal requirements; within this event, games have temporal structures, and within the game players’ strategies and emotions are shaped by the experience of passing and pressing time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961463X12458733"><title>Macro-temporality: Games just in time</title>
<p>Events have an expected temporal structure, essential for organizing collective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0961463X12458733">Zerubavel, 1979</xref>). These expectations are crucial when multiple stakeholders are present: those who monitor and control the scene and those who participate in it. In practice actors have preferences as to temporal organization as decisions advantage some potential participants and discourage others. In scheduling a tournament the organizer must establish temporal boundaries. How long should a tournament last, a choice that impacts the number and types of players who attend?</p>
<p>Many assert that time has sped up in modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961463X12458733">Elias, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961463X12458733">Glennie and Thrift, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0961463X12458733">Rosa, 2003</xref>). And so it is in chess. Chunks of time are sliced ever more thinly. Prior to the 1860s, games had no formal temporal limits and could last a day or more, constrained only by implicit norms. That timeless time has passed. Currently the United States Open, a nine-round tournament, lasts nine days with one game each day from a Saturday to the following Sunday. Until 1967 the tournament contained 13 rounds over nearly two weeks. Relatively few players now favor a lengthy commitment, and organizers permit players to choose a shorter time period, such as four days, with more games each day. In 2011 more players selected a shorter time frame with most selecting a six-day schedule, followed by a four-day schedule; the nine-day schedule was least popular. During the final days the schedules merge, so that there is a single winner of the Open. Alternative schedules are common in large tournaments.</p>
<p>When a single game is scheduled, it often starts in the late afternoon or early evening. A two-game schedule is played in late morning and late afternoon, permitting late night socializing. In addition, games vary in the time allotted to players. One form of chess (bullet chess) provides each player a minute to make all their moves; blitz gives each player five minutes; action chess is 30 minutes per person. Long-form (‘traditional’) tournaments may be game/60 (60 minutes per person), game/75, game/90, or game/120. The choice determines the number of games that can fit into the schedule. As the choice of the length of a game affects the temporal contour of the tournament, it shapes the commitment necessary to participate, and is linked to temporal agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961463X12458733">Flaherty, 2011</xref>). These commitments are shaped by competing obligations, age, skill, and embeddedness within the chess subculture, and in turn affect the temporal organization of tournaments.</p>
<p>Currently two time limits are common at high-level chess tournaments. The ‘classical’ style has each player receiving two hours (or two-and-a-half hours) for the first 40 moves, one additional hour for the next 20 moves, and then 30 minutes for the rest of the game. In this format (excluding the possibility of time increments, discussed below), games are completed in seven or eight hours: a good day’s work. A second format is used by the World Chess Federation: 90 minutes per player with an additional 30 seconds awarded after each move. This alternative structure is derided by some as too brief for adequate evaluation of moves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0961463X12458733">ten Geuzendam, 2006b</xref>: 339).</p>
<p>To understand how time is perceived in chess is to appreciate changes in the modern social order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961463X12458733">Adam, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961463X12458733">Bluedorn, 2002</xref>). The clock colonizes social life. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961463X12458733">Elias (1992</xref>: 13) points out that clocks are an institution that represents time, not time itself. But as a representation they also provide for intensification. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961463X12458733">Hallman (2003</xref>: 144) notes, ‘The history of chess is a history of acceleration. Nearly every significant change to the game has seen it become faster’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0961463X12458733">Rosa, 2003</xref>). A longstanding belief exists – whether in medieval players with the ‘faster’ movement of pieces across the board, nineteenth-century players institutionalizing a chess clock, or contemporary players with shortened time controls – that the younger generation wishes the game and the world faster. The same desire is seen among those not so committed:<disp-quote>
<p>[It] will be much easier for spectators to follow, with a lively rhythm like every other sport … Chess is for <italic>fast exchange</italic> of ideas … Chess should be like tennis – risky ideas, inventions, for the pleasure of the opponent and the audience. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0961463X12458733">Saidy, 2007</xref>: 26)</p></disp-quote>Compressed time is said to have a moral component, creating more ‘humane,’ shorter games. One organizer remarks, ‘Can you tell me how they can play … and still eat and bathe’ (Field notes). As time is telescoped, tournaments must be shortened and the games must be abbreviated. This changes how one thinks and how one plays. Deliberation is replaced by instinct, building on a cultural logic of efficiency, a structural regulation of time, contributing to the control features of modernity and the rationalization of competition. Lacking this, the event becomes esoteric. With the rare exception of the televised Fischer-Spassky match, only a change in format, creating a dynamic event, will attract corporate sponsors. Games such as tennis, boxing, or poker recreated themselves as rapid events, and some argue that this is necessary in chess (ten <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0961463X12458733">Geuzendam, 2006a</xref>: 31), although this assumes that audiences have the background knowledge that brief commentary can access. One prominent grandmaster explained:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s the 21st century. Life is changing … The only way we get chess on television is if you speed it. And we have to have lively commentary and exciting personalities and develop a show out of it. Just like poker did and golf did and billiards and pool. All these different activities honestly speaking don’t seem visually so exciting either. (Interview)</p></disp-quote>An essayist comments: ‘When all is said and done, the basic and constant visuals in television chess are of two seated players pushing wood. Or, too often for comfort, not pushing it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961463X12458733">Barnes, 1995</xref>: 247). Just as theatrical performances and concerts have been compressed to fit schedules and budgets, so has chess. Recently time controls at the Denker Tournament for High School Champions were halved from three hours per player to 90 minutes. As in much modern life, more things mean shorter things (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0961463X12458733">Robinson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0961463X12458733">Southerton, 2003</xref>). Immediacy trumps deliberation in the politics of time.</p>
<sec id="sec5-0961463X12458733"><title>The technologies of time</title>
<p>Although the rules of how pieces move have been stable since the Middle Ages, the temporal rules of chess have evolved. Tournament time controls are regularly readjusted. Once it was common for chess games to adjourn overnight, typically after 40 moves, when players could review their moves and use as much time as desired for preparation, also part of the temporal organization of the game. With the development of extensive databases and strong computer programs, adjournments were eliminated after 1993. Play and work depend on collective understandings of temporal propriety, linked to how technology shapes the efficient completion of tasks. But such changes, though having real effects, are not treated as affecting the game itself.</p>
<p>It is one thing to believe that chess games should be shortened, but another to organize the activity to make it happen. This requires a marriage of chess and technology. It wasn’t until the last half of the 19th century that time controls were established, first with hourglasses, then chronometers, and finally analog and digital chess clocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961463X12458733">Horowitz and Rothenberg, 1963</xref>). The important 1851 tournament in London, the first major international competition, was played without ‘time controls’. Several games lasted 12 hours and one lasted 20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961463X12458733">Eales, 1985</xref>: 145; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961463X12458733">Hoffman, 2007</xref>: 49). Temporal limits were a function of implicit expectations. Chess players spoke of the skill of <italic>Sitzfleisch</italic> (‘sitting flesh’) – the ability to sit at the table for extended periods. An apocryphal tale claimed that in a match between Paul Morphy and Louis Paulsen, the two waited in silence for 11 hours. When Morphy finally stared at Paulsen, his competitor responded, ‘Oh, is it my move?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961463X12458733">Hoffman, 2007</xref>: 50). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961463X12458733">Bronstein and Smolyan (1982</xref>: 51–52) assert, ‘Multi-hour games are monstrous, like dinosaurs from past ages. They kill lively thought, spread out in time the creative energy of the players’. As chess became institutionalized with tournament schedules, time had to be tamed through rules and procedures. But as with all systems, the choice creates what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961463X12458733">Hoffman (2007</xref>: 50) terms a ‘tyranny of time’, as the availability of time encourages styles of thought and of play. In 1852 players were given a limit of 29 minutes a move, and in 1862 each player had an hourglass to make 24 moves in two hours. The first double chess clock was used in tournament play in 1883, where players had an hour for 15 moves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961463X12458733">Evans, 2007</xref>: 157; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961463X12458733">‘Game Clocks’, 2011</xref>). In the early years the penalty for having one’s time run out was a fine, but subsequently the penalty became game forfeiture. Given that time could only be judged through its mechanical inscription, it is no surprise that players charged opponents with fixing their clocks to gain an advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961463X12458733">Cockburn, 1974</xref>: 55). As noted, the advent of computer programs and databases eliminated overnight adjournments as the availability of cached knowledge would have shaped the outcome. Technology changed the temporal organization of the game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961463X12458733">Landes, 1983</xref>), as in many domains (surgery, secretarial work, and space exploration).</p>
<p>The shortening of the game made time more valuable, and players increasingly ‘lost on time’. This required the development of alternative systems of controlling time. The creation of ‘digital’ or ‘electronic’ clocks proved crucial as these clocks could be programmed. One solution was to have clocks delay for five seconds before starting to count down, a procedure that some players count on. With this technology each player gains a few moments ‘outside of time’ for quick thought and the game can continue, at least until one of the players blunders. Another solution was to add a time increment, such as adding 30 seconds after each move, permitting more extended thought and building the extra time into the game structure. Time can be stopped or gained. Bobby Fischer argued that a chess game should not be lost because a player ran out of time. As a result, he invented (and patented) a clock that could be programmed to add time. A two-hour game was transformed into a 115-minute game with a 30-second increment for each move. Today both time delays and time increments are used at tournaments, although time increments have become more popular at larger and more formal tournaments. This system requires that players learn to program their clocks, emphasizing the connection between technological competence and game competence. The consequence of these changes, particularly the addition of 30 seconds, means that players less frequently lose on time. The choices of the tournament organizers affect outcomes through the experience of a temporal order. As one top player remarked, ‘In several games [without an increment] I was just completely shocked because my time was moving really fast’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0961463X12458733">Peterson, 2006</xref>: 21). In his experience chess time with its artificial increment has come to have an embodied feel, and absence of the increment made judging time challenging. It is not simply the passage of time, but how the technology of time shapes that passage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961463X12458733">Flaherty, 1999</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec6-0961463X12458733"><title>Meso-temporality: Time as a resource</title>
<p>Time structures encounters as well as gatherings. While tournaments are temporally ordered, the interaction scene is structured as well. Participants compete to manage the duration they have been allotted, and they do this in concert with each other. This is dramatically evident in competitive chess in which each player is provided time to hoard or to spend. As one coach emphasized, ‘the clock is a weapon’ (Field notes). But what are the skills of weaponry? While the experience of time results from institutional demands, it also results from strategic choices of actors, emphasizing temporal agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961463X12458733">Flaherty, 2011</xref>). Chess is social in considerable measure because it is temporal, and in this it is similar to other domains. In examining the temporal dynamics of restaurant kitchens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961463X12458733">Fine (1996</xref>: 77; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0961463X12458733">Lauer, 1981</xref>) wrote of the complex and interlinked behaviors building on temporal structures, affecting behavioral coordination and shared commitment.</p>
<p>Two players, forced to wait on each other’s choices, depend on the enforcement of sequence as they coordinate their actions. Sequence is the core of the game. No player can move twice without a response, and no player can refuse to move, even if a move weakens his position (labeled <italic>zugzwang</italic> or ‘compulsion to move’). If no legal move exists and the player is not in check, the game is a draw, termed a <italic>stalemate</italic>, no matter if one player is in a better position. If the game can’t continue, it ends without a victor.</p>
<p>Because the chess clock is visible, the relative temporal position is known by both players. As the temporal resources change, the cognitive and stylistic possibilities of the game shift. Having more time available, particularly at the later stages of the game, has benefits, allowing the resource-rich player to calculate moves. A player with many minutes can play chess deliberatively, while the player with only seconds plays intuitively. As a result, a player with more time may ‘complicate’ the board, trying to force the other to spend time thinking or to make a quick error because of lack of deliberation. A player with more time may move rapidly to deny his opponent the luxury of calculation during the player’s moves. In other words, a player can use an opponent’s time to calculate future moves, which the opponent may strategically deny.</p>
<p>Beyond this to-and-fro quality, chess involves a set of moves that as unfurled represent the game itself. Moves cannot be taken back, institutionalized by the rule that when a piece has been touched it must be moved if there is a legal move possible; if a piece has been moved and the player’s hand removed the move is permanent. The alternation of moves between black and white constitutes the revealed chronology of each game. Action swings back and forth like a metronome. Significantly each move is termed a <italic>tempo</italic>, suggesting the centrality of the temporal. The tempo is the point of action, the moment in which thought becomes behavior, creating ludic punctuation. As Benjamin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961463X12458733">DiCicco-Bloom and David Gibson (2010</xref>: 251) point out:<disp-quote>
<p>A turn is a coveted resource in chess … and it is a cardinal sin to squander one. One can do this, for example, by taking two turns to move a piece that could have been reached in one. In such an instance, Nimzowitsch would say that one has ‘lost a tempo.’ One can also lose a tempo, or several tempi, when one is forced to retreat a piece, especially if that means reversing a previous move, or when one loses a piece that took several turns to develop when there is nothing else to show for the effort.</p></disp-quote>If the sequence of moves constitutes the arrow of narrative, losing a tempo is retreat. Using a tempo wisely forces a response.</p>
<p>Even though chess might seem a desiccated activity, limited in scope when only considering what is on the board, the intensity of concentration – unaware of the surrounding world – or the breaking of that intensity by leaving the board creates a complex temporal tapestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0961463X12458733">Puddephatt, 2008</xref>), tied to skill and experience. In large tournaments – called Swiss tournaments – players are matched on their success in previous rounds. Players with the same record are paired against each other. I imagined that weaker players might need more time to evaluate moves, but I was surprised that the playing hall emptied from the rear. The games of the weakest players end quickly, even if they play the same number of moves as stronger players. They lack the knowledge and history to think deeply. This is true at scholastic tournaments in which games between first graders end before games between fourth graders, and these games end before games between seventh graders. On occasions when children play adults, adults sometimes deliberately play slowly, believing that children lack focus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0961463X12458733">1</xref></sup> For less adept players the excitement of chess is the moves, not the thinking. Thought cannot fill the time allotted.</p>
<p>Ultimately time is a resource that should be used strategically and dramaturgically. There is no one right way to utilize time in chess, in studying for exams, in seduction, or in public speaking. Time is praxis. One must gather oneself and, as pragmatist philosophers assert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961463X12458733">Flaherty and Fine, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0961463X12458733">Mead, 1934</xref>), prepare to meet the responses of others. One’s time management techniques are shaped through feedback.</p>
<p>While <italic>duration</italic> may be the most easily manipulated aspect of chess, simply changing the time limit has complex effects as duration is also a social reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961463X12458733">Flaherty, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961463X12458733">Flaherty and Fine, 2001</xref>): the clock is read in context. With two competitors phenomenology is doubled, and is sometimes intersubjective. Do I experience my two hours the same as I experience your two hours? Similarity reveals active mental engagement; difference involves reactive (or perhaps restful or bored) thought as I wait patiently for your act. I watch you think, as you watch me. I judge you thinking, while you judge me. As a result, players rely on temporal impression management. At the annual World Open, the strongest players often arrived late – even 30 minutes after the game clock has started (a player has an hour to appear before a game is forfeited). During this time, the player might be checking the games of an opponent archived on a database<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0961463X12458733">2</xref></sup> or might simply be conveying confidence. One star player confessed that he liked to be ‘fashionably late’. At one game between two international masters, both players arrived 15 minutes after the game was scheduled (Field notes). Less talented players strive to start precisely on time.</p>
<p>Watching the clock is part of being a professional, and being in time trouble is treated as ‘a sign of bad form’ (Field notes). This stigma was evident in one match that I observed in the United States Chess League; a coach was angered that a player used 80 minutes for the first five moves (each player has 90 minutes for each game). This player was seen as being too cautious against a higher rated player. He found himself in permanent time trouble in a difficult game, and made it worse by choosing a style of play that complicated the board, requiring additional thought. His teammate groused, ‘If you don’t have time why do you go into complications. If there’s a simple way to win, you do it’ (Field notes). This player was too willing to get into time trouble against a stronger competitor.</p>
<p>Chess is not only competitive on the board, but is competitive on the clock. One player may have an hour, while the opponent has only minutes or seconds. The player with sufficient time can use time as an advantage and can complicate the position on the board. One of the greatest chess players – one known for his psychological strategies – was Mikhail Tal, called the ‘Wizard of Riga’. Tal was explicit about his strategy of using time as a weapon:<disp-quote>
<p>After the match [the world championship match in 1960 between Botvinnik and Tal], some commentators tried to tarnish Tal’s achievement by suggesting that the decisive factor was not his tactical brilliance but rather his psychological cunning. In his book on the match … Tal answered his critics with a terse pragmatic defense of the psychological method: ‘I know I made what appeared to be bad moves at times, but they served the purpose of making my opponent use up time, figuring why I made such a move’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961463X12458733">Benko and Hochberg, 1991</xref>: 57)</p></disp-quote>Tal was skilled at playing the clock, transforming time into temporal capital. I heard high school players, suggesting, as did Tal, ‘He was almost out of time. I wanted to complicate [the board position] for him’ (Field notes). Tal understood that the use of time was a strategy, just as much as the position of pieces on the board.</p>
<sec id="sec7-0961463X12458733"><title>Clock management</title>
<p>With the institution of time controls comes the challenge of ‘clock management’. Chess is a rhythmical game: fast and planned, slow and thoughtful, and rushed and intuitive. Given that opposing players may have different amounts of time available, one player might think deliberately, while his opponent, in time trouble, is rushed and stressed. Here the rule that one gets an extra hour after 40 moves changes the player’s rhythm; a player can permit his time to run down, rushing into move 40, and then slow down once again. The rhythm of the game shifts through its temporal organization.</p>
<p>Beyond this, segments of the game have different rhythms. One must have enough time to calculate strategies in the middle game, but leave enough time for the endgame so that one does not select moves without thought. Both players rely on the same temporal playbook. In high-level tournaments, early moves occur rapidly. Players typically select well-researched ‘opening lines’, based on what is called ‘chess theory’. Often the first dozen moves are played quickly. But at a certain point, players ‘leave book’, and play the now complicated middle game with numerous options. Once pieces have been ‘developed’ (meaning that most pieces have been moved from the back row), players have reached the middle game. It is in the middle game in which the bulk of calculation occurs. As writer Julian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961463X12458733">Barnes (1995</xref>: 247) commented about the Kasparov-Short World Championship match, carried on British television:<disp-quote>
<p>The players would in the first few minutes rattle out a familiar opening, until one produced a prepared variation from the known line. The player who had been varied against would then settle down for a long and slumberous ponder while the innovator went off and made himself a cup of tea … After the first eleven moves had been flicked out in couple of minutes, Kasparov varied. Short thought. And thought. Commercial break. And thought. And thought. Second commercial break. And thought. Finally, after using up forty-five minutes of live television time, he castled.</p></disp-quote>Time as a resource in the game came into sharp conflict with time as a resource on television, explaining the absence of televised chess tournaments.</p>
<p>The endgame involves fewer pieces and strong players are aware of certain known patterns (two rooks versus and a rook and a knight; two pawns versus a bishop). Some endgames last a hundred moves or more, but in the traditional time control players do not receive extra time. As a result, at this stage of the game, players may rush, playing intuitively. As one grandmaster put it, ‘You just don’t calculate. You just guess the moves. You play lottery instead of chess. You just throw the piece on some square. It’s an uncomfortable feeling’ (Interview). A writer comments in a similar vein about rushed endings, ‘Players still move chess pieces, but now they’re playing not chess, but something more like table tennis. Clocks bang, pieces hang, pawns race, flags ascend … At this critical stage of each game, manual dexterity rules’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961463X12458733">Jacobs, 2007</xref>: 16).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0961463X12458733">3</xref></sup> The game is no longer to be won by the most thoughtful competitor, but by the most dexterous. At the conclusion of the 2008 US Women’s Championship the final, sudden death ‘Armageddon game’ came down to a wild time scramble when one player had 12 seconds and the other eight seconds. Classical chess had become a blur, requiring different skills. The rules were identical, but the game was different. The final outcome was a time forfeiture in which the winner had a second left. Controversy erupted when video indicated that one player moved before the other pressed her clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961463X12458733">Braunlich, 2008</xref>: 25–27). In their urgency the sequencing of moves was violated. The ending was not satisfactory and procedures have been changed, but <italic>some</italic> ending was necessary to complete the championship in the time allotted. These wild endings remind us that chess has a temporal cycle: steady moves, which become slow, and then become rushed. If the first segment is routine, the second may become stagnant, and the third thoughtless (Interview).</p>
<p>As time controls tightened, a concern was expressed that too many games were ending because a player ‘lost on time’. Players distinguish between games won on the board and those won on the clock, with the former being <italic>real</italic> victories. This belief is so powerful that some players choose to lose on time to preserve self-esteem. In the competition between rivals time is strategy.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0961463X12458733"><title>Micro-temporality: The rush</title>
<p>In chess, as in other hurried activities, there comes a moment in which pressure ratchets up: restaurants, traffic control, or emergency medicine experience a similar pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961463X12458733">Fine, 1990</xref>). To be a ‘professional’ – to be skilled in managing a knowledge regime – one must react instinctively when time is scarce. It takes one set of skills to think calmly, and another to react intuitively. The clock counts down, but the demands continue.</p>
<p>Decisions about the extent of calculation are common when one has time to spend, but as minutes ebb, time’s absence makes itself felt. The chess board becomes a pressured domain. A high school player explained:<disp-quote>
<p>When you are time-pressured, it’s surprising how you can’t think quickly when you need to … This year I think I got used to time pressure more, and once you get used to playing under time pressure, it’s easier to control your emotions … When you play with under two minutes on your clock in scholastic tournaments, it’s like there is a nervous feeling you get, and you don’t know what to do. But once you are used to the nervous feeling, you sort of know how this is going to go. You sort of just get over that and are able to think more clearly once you are used to it. But if you are not used to it, it can be pretty difficult. (Interview)</p></disp-quote>This player may have had as little time as before, but it had a different meaning. Time pressure is managed through experience, often through the subjective allocation of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961463X12458733">Flaherty, 1999</xref>). But there are also personal differences. Some players rarely need the time allocated, calculating with ease, while others gobble their time, and must cope with the belief that they are ‘time pressure players’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961463X12458733">Benko and Hochberg, 1991</xref>: 251). Certain players make an effort to savor the game as it is progressing, in a subjective sense having ‘more’ time available (Michael Flaherty, personal communication, 2012). Grandmaster Hans Ree proposed a parallel between time trouble and drug use: ‘Time trouble is an addiction, perhaps even a physical addiction to the opium-like substances secreted by a chess player’s brain during the time trouble phase’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961463X12458733">Hallman, 2003</xref>: 145). Whatever the linkage between playing chess and getting high, the claim explains the embodied enjoyment of rapid play. Some players – those skilled at rapid chess – have an advantage in that they are primed to be intuitive.</p>
<sec id="sec9-0961463X12458733"><title>Blitz and the rush</title>
<p>The structure of time can alter the meaning of a social act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961463X12458733">Flaherty, 1999</xref>), as well as how information is processed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961463X12458733">Kahneman, 2011</xref>). With action speeded up, sexual intercourse becomes a ‘quickie’. A dinner becomes ‘fast food’. A test becomes a ‘quiz’. Chess, too, has temporal boundaries. Is a chess match of 90 minutes the same game as a match of three hours duration? Both games affect chess ratings identically, but this is <italic>not</italic> the case when the limit drops to five minutes. One can play a single game of ‘correspondence chess’ over two years or a game of ‘bullet chess’ in two minutes. Here I focus on the short forms of chess, labeled ‘speed chess’.</p>
<p>At what point does chess stop being ‘chess’? The temporal structure creates ‘different’ games with different experiences. Game/120 (two hours/person) is recognizably similar to Game/90, and some tournaments include games of both lengths. Game/75 and Game/60 are still ‘real’ chess. In practice, one finds a change in meaning around Game/30, half an hour for each player. Participants clarify the distinction through naming. Game/30 is labeled Action Chess, evident in the tournament sponsored by the United States Chess Federation, called the ‘National Youth Action’ tournament. Each game lasts – at most – an hour. (Games that are at least 10 minutes/player and under an hour are known generically as speed chess or quick chess). Changing the amount of calculation creates a game distinguished from ‘traditional chess’ or often simply from ‘chess’, the longer game being the standard by which variants are judged. As one player said, ‘There’s chess and then there’s blitz’ (Field notes). The salience of the 30-minute boundary is evident in Garry Kasparov’s comment that he played the first ‘serious’ match of ‘rapid chess’ against Nigel Short on the stage of the London Hippodrome: each player had 25 minutes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961463X12458733">Kasparov (2007</xref>: 41) felt that ‘it was still possible to play deep concepts despite the difficulty of calculating deeply on each move. Instead of a profound study of a position we had to rely more on instinct’. The boundary between traditional chess and speed chess is seen in different categories of ratings, a means of distributing status. For a game to be rated in the standard United States Chess Federation rating system, each player must be allocated at least 30 minutes. But as a result of the popularity of speed chess, a separate rating system has also been established, preserving the sanctity of the ratings of the long-form of the game. The boundary is 30-minute chess (Action Chess) which ambiguously counts for both the ‘regular’ and the ‘quick’ rating.</p>
<p>As time controls contract, distinctions increase. Excitement is institutionalized through the organization of the activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961463X12458733">Hochschild, 1984</xref>). Intuition grows, calculation shrinks. A formal game becomes informal; the silence in traditional time controls is replaced by trash talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0961463X12458733">Wendling, 2002</xref>: 175). Before the introduction of digital clocks in the 1990s, handling increments of seconds, chess clubs sponsored ‘Rapid Transit Chess’. An organizer rang a gong or called out ‘move!’ every 10 seconds, and a player had to move immediately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961463X12458733">Horowitz and Rothenberg, 1963</xref>: 12). Time was ladled out in small spoonfuls. Digital clocks provided the technology necessary to create a fast game. Clocks made speed chess possible because time could be measured in tiny increments. Games shrank: 15 minutes, 10 minutes, less. Traditional (or ‘real’) chess is distinguished from the forms of action chess, blitz chess, and bullet chess, each distinguished by different temporal constraints. How far can time shrink? How little can minds and hands accept? Marc Esserman, a well-known American international master, claimed to have created bullet (one-minute) chess. He and his friends began playing one-minute games on the website of the Internet Chess Club. He soon gained a high rating, beating many strong players. Soon the website prevented these games, but a week later gave in, rating these one-minute games. Esserman reports that through Bullet Chess, ‘young people were treating chess as a video game’ (Field notes). The cultural logic of chess as a board game, tied to slow cognitive processing, had been upended by intuition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961463X12458733">Kahneman, 2011</xref>), even if, as is often the case with intuition, it is based upon deeply internalized, tacit knowledge.</p>
<p>In 1858 in an essay in <italic>Chess Monthly</italic>, ‘Chess in Hades’, the American chess editor, (Daniel) Willard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961463X12458733">Fiske (1912</xref>: 13) wrote of ‘those demented wretches who exhibit a morbid fondness for … five-second games’. He wrote with cutting disdain of players who moved too quickly, suggesting that they deserved to bake in the ovens of Hell. These were not gentlemen, but damnable scoundrels. As one book sardonically noted about an early version of blitz:<disp-quote>
<p>There is … a move-on-move insanity, Blitz, which requires no clock, for no time at all is allowed the players. Blitz is a ‘relaxing’ sport to topnotch players, each of whom must counter at the very instant a move is made by the opponent. Blitz is not recommended to persons afflicted with hypertension or cardiac disturbances. Nor is it recommended to persons who are not so afflicted. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961463X12458733">Horowitz and Rothenberg, 1963</xref>: 12)</p></disp-quote>A mature player comments scornfully about one-minute chess:<disp-quote>
<p>It gives you a big advantage in playing with your nerves, but at the same time it causes you to move too quickly without thinking. I think it is a total waste. I hate one minute chess. I just don’t like it because the quality is so bad. We have an instant gratification society. (Field notes)</p></disp-quote>Recognizing that speed chess is particularly common among younger players, one writer, referring to ‘steroid chess’, fears that ‘many of today’s young (under-20) players are being bred without <italic>knowing what serious chess is all about</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961463X12458733">Kopec, 2007</xref>: 42, emphasis added). In a world of short segments and rushed culture, speed chess has a natural audience.</p>
<p>Yet, today rapid chess has cachet, played by the strongest players as well as by the marginal patzer. Grandmasters, tournament-level players, collegians, adolescents, and street players relish the intuitive energy of a fast game. Most popular is the five-minute version of speed chess labeled ‘blitz’. By 2006 the World Blitz Championship was established, since won by some of the strongest Grandmasters in long-form chess.</p>
<p>Temporal boundaries suggest that activities are differentiated, both through the feel of the activity and its social placement. Perhaps they fall under the same canopy: the mile run, the javelin, and the 100-yard hurdles are treated as ‘track-and-field’, although each requires different skills (Interview). As a result of distinct phenomenology, special rules are created for speed chess: rules about touch move, illegal moves, and hitting the clock. These rules are a function of the rushed physicality of blitz. Bodies err, but how should that affect the outcome of the game. One prominent grandmaster remarked:<disp-quote>
<p>I think chess should have all these different elements … You look at running, they have marathon runners and they have 100 meter dash, and they have in-between. I that that all three formats in chess: regular (slow), rapid, and then the blitz (the real fast), I think they should all have their own right and their own champions, and they should live in nice harmony because you want to have the slow games for the real quality games. (Interview)</p></disp-quote>Perhaps blitz is ‘sloppy’ or ‘sacrifices quality’, but it is energizing and embodied. In the process of creating boundaries, a new object or form of interaction is justified through experience. Each novel activity demands legitimacy in the face of marginalization. For David Bronstein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961463X12458733">Bronstein and Smolyan, 1982</xref>: 50) ‘intuition, fantasy, and daring’ are revealed in rapid play itself:<disp-quote>
<p>Corresponding to the rapidity of intuitive thinking and the creative potential concealed in it must be the rhythm, the tempo of play. It is in rapid play that the intuitive mind triumphs … Practically all the top players possess a rapid, intuitive positional grasp … A strong chess player requires only a few minutes of thought to get to the heart of the conflict … In blitz, all shallow, banal and uninteresting situations ‘gallop past’ the mental glance.</p></disp-quote>One international master explained that watching a blitz game allows you to ‘get inside [the player’s] head and see how he thinks’. Books don’t matter, phenomenology does.</p>
<p>Rather than playing one game in an evening, opponents play dozens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961463X12458733">Desjarlais, 2011</xref>: 2). Losses and victories pass quickly. An evening with 30 games has a different texture than an evening with three, limiting cognition and the emotional economy of each event. As a result, each game slides into insignificance. As psychiatrist Charles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961463X12458733">Krauthammer (2002)</xref> suggests, blitz has a therapeutic value in a hyper-competitive world:<disp-quote>
<p>At our club, when you lose with a blunder that instantly illuminates the virtues of assisted suicide, we have a cure. Rack’em up again. Like pool. A new game, right away. We play fast, very fast, so that memories can be erased and defeats immediately avenged … We do not sit in overstuffed chairs smoking pipes in five-hour games. We play like the vagrants in the park – at high speed with clocks ticking so that thinking more than 10 or 20 seconds can be a fatal extravagance … No time to recriminate, let alone ruminate.</p></disp-quote>Krauthammer contrasts the pipe-smoker (wealthy, old) to the vagrant (poor, young), distinguishing between the slow, thoughtful player and the active, intuitive one. Both belong to the world of chess, but with different experienced realities.</p>
<p>Chess involves the phenomenology of time, affecting the experience of participants, drawing them in or pushing them out. All temporal structures have their phenomenology, but in speed chess, the insistent reality of time is especially powerful in altering the balance between thought and deliberation in contrast to emotion and intuition in the context of a competitive scene with opposing interests. But from the tournament to the game to the moves (and movers), temporality serves as capital for creating the complex, layered social world that we describe as chess.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0961463X12458733"><title>Time and the game</title>
<p>As noted at the outset, competition can be organized in various ways through sequence and duration. Although the examination of the politics of time as situated in social worlds has been rare, these local scenes deserve more attention. In particular, treating time as a resource has considerable relevance for understanding temporal order. While every social domain has unique characteristics, competitive chess, so tied to its chronology, is a rich site for investigation. Research on competition addresses how games are framed in light of constraints, how rules are strategically deployed, and how the experience of players affects their involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961463X12458733">DiCicco-Bloom and Gibson, 2010</xref>). Within the world of chess – and much of social life – how events are structured as timed domains shapes action.</p>
<p>Time is a fundamental building block of social order, but in contemporary society it has been telescoped and is increasingly ruled by institutional authorities. We have given control of the clock to those with organizational power. The development of the chess clock, now refined in the digital clock, has transformed free and flexible time into measured and mastered time. The minutes that are barely evident on the older analog chess clock have been replaced by technology that places seconds front-and-center. Chess, a game of days became a game of hours, and then a game of minutes, and now is a game of seconds. Similar changes are evident elsewhere, with the ability to second-guess officials and to determine who crossed a finish line first. This change is evident in the structuring of the tournament, the game, and the experience of the move. On each level the game and the use of time is a consequence of two players in contact.</p>
<p>Temporal organization influences social activity on multiple levels: macro, meso, and micro; these may be different levels, but they are intertwined as evident at tournaments in which the event, the game, and the experience come together. For organized gatherings – tournaments – promoters must create time structures that appeal to potential audiences, and this depends on how much time participants have available and decide to spend. To create an event requires sensitivity to external temporal orders. Within the tournament is the game, and here players strategize their use of available time. They must consider when and how to use the hours and minutes that they have been allocated, and must do this in light of assessing their opponent’s temporal resources in a realm of double phenomenology. Finally, there is the experience of the game, shaped by the pressure that time limits produce. Rushed or bored, excited or routine, competition involves emotion that is shaped by the reality of duration. For organizers, for competitors face-to-face, and for the individual at the table, time must be considered.</p>
<p>Ultimately time is a resource in competition, used by participants and those who organize the participation of others. If long chess is a bore and blitz chess is a blur, they are bores and blurs because those invested in the game find pleasures in thought and in action and they recognize the limits of these pleasures. Whether we are considering traffic patterns, factory lines, food service, or musical events, we bow to the cultural power of time. Just as we have social capital, cultural capital, and material capital, we have <italic>temporal capital</italic>: time is a resource to be strategically deployed. This temporal capital makes activities salient for those who engage and for those who observe.</p>

<fn id="fn1-0961463X12458733"><label>1</label><p>Age is linked to what might be described as <italic>biographic time</italic>. Although younger players may lack focus or discipline, older players may lack energy at the end of lengthy battles. Concentration may dip for those who are either younger or older than their peak age. Older players are certainly more conscious of the effects of age and this informs their chess practices.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn2-0961463X12458733"><label>2</label><p>Players cannot be certain as to their future opponent until the pairings are posted shortly before the formal start of the games. This means that preparation for the match is necessarily truncated. Some players, particularly those who are facing known opponents, feel that it is a valuable use of their time to examine the history of their opponents on the computer (relying on <italic>cybernetic time</italic>). When both players do this, both players receive their full temporal allotment. In round-robin tournaments in which opponents are known (and most particularly in World Championship matches) the time used for preparation can be extensive.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn3-0961463X12458733"><label>3</label><p>One player noted that in blitz chess, some players move their pieces closer to their clocks to avoid losing time in making their moves and then pressing their clock. Even a few milliseconds can matter.</p></fn></fn-group></notes>
