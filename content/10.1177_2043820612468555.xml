The question was answered by 15 students, and according to the examiners’ report,<disp-quote><p>[w]eaker candidates tended merely to provide a list of texts discussed in the lectures. However, the question also elicited some stronger answers, which either demonstrated a wide knowledge of the history of geography and/or addressed some of the conceptual and political issues raised by the idea of a canon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820612468555">School of Geography and the Environment, 2011</xref>: 20).</p></disp-quote>The process of examining is internal and closed to the respective Board of Examiners, but my hunch is that this interesting, and difficult, question emerged from reflections on the debate that grew up around the Charles Darwin anniversaries in 2009, and the perceived consequences these had for memorialisation in geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612468555">Castree, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468555">Driver, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612468555">Powell, 2012</xref>).</p><p>This highlights, for me, the central issue about canonicity raised in this important contribution by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612468555">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>) – that of <italic>pedagogy</italic>. For this reason, I approach this commentary by foregrounding questions about the teaching of geography.</p><p>This is a stimulating paper that will generate significant debate around the issue of canonicity in geography. But as I read this, my overwhelming emotion was nostalgia for space-times past. I have shared many of the same concerns with the authors, around practices of forgetting and ungenerous reading, for a long time, although I have met only one of them, and that very recently, and have corresponded with another only remotely. Nor have we studied at any of the same institutions, nor do we work on the same areas or periods. What we do share, though, is a presence in the same generation that gained their doctorates during the first decade of the 21st century.</p><p>So our holding of this collective disquietude may very well be because we finished our doctoral training in a particular academic job market, and we have since experienced a rapid period of change in global higher education, characterised by institutional restructuring and reorganisation across Europe, North America and elsewhere, in which, as the authors note, distinct geography departments have become rarer and their purposes denuded.</p><p>At the same time, one might pose a question as to how and why a community sharing these concerns still persists? Partly, I think this is a reflection of contrariness that has often been common amongst historical geographers and historians of geography. Traditionally, there would only be one or two in any geography department, and they would tend to be respected by their colleagues as serious scholars, but also viewed as eccentric and, even, outliers. They rarely became Heads of Departments, and even if they did, they usually were not very good at it. This often led to a sense of intellectual loneliness, and a need to feel part of a wider, deeper community of geographical practice that was not available locally and thus tended to be facilitated through wider national and international scholarly networks. It was, though, the efforts of such scholars that have maintained successive generations of interest in geography’s canonical figures and texts, notwithstanding presentism and other dominant narratives.</p><p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612468555">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>) demonstrate, the discussions of a canon are always about the politics of pedagogy. They are about what we were taught, and what we then teach. What we want to remember and what we want to forget. What we want to transmit to future generations and to cognate disciplines. Although explicit talk of the geographical canon has been unusual in geography, there have been attempts over recent decades to compose a canon of sorts, albeit in a different register, using notions of traditions or shared heroes, heroines and practices, whether one thinks of attempts by Richard Hartshorne, David Stoddart, David Livingstone or Gillian Rose.</p><p>In the UK context, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612468555">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>) note, these more recent changes began with new imperatives and requirements for graduate education. It could be argued, for example, that in the 1990s, the MSc Society and Space at the University of Bristol was a pioneer in adapting to a changing education market in human geography, and its model has since been disseminated across a number of other institutions, both in the United Kingdom and further afield. However, in North America, there has been a different approach, both due to the relative weakness of geography as a specialism at the Undergraduate level, and because of the length and depth of graduate education. The sorts of courses mentioned by Billie Turner and Audrey Kobayashi, and discussed by the authors here, are perhaps a peculiarly North American phenomenon, aiming to inculcate a geographical identity for a cohort through canonical readings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612468555">Sauer (1956</xref>) made direct reference to such teaching as part of the process of the education of a geographer. It is perhaps indicative of the relative historical strength of geography in the UK that these courses are/were generally delivered at the Undergraduate level, although there was always significant variation in provision.</p><p>Along these lines, it is important to note that there has been a tradition in histories of geography to address questions through deep engagement with classical/canonical writings, leavened with humour. Trevor Barnes is the expert exponent of his generation. But in their echoing of Peter Gould, this is also a notable feature of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612468555">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>), especially in the opening sections. For a number of reasons, reading this therefore took me back to the decontextualized presentation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612468555">Gould’s (1985)</xref> infamous, and disturbing, ‘Geographia’ images from <italic>The Geographer at Work</italic> in one of these introductory Graduate seminars at the University of British Columbia. I was never forgiven by the course instructor for already having happened to have read <italic>The Geographer at Work</italic> in my local library about 5 years before, when arbitrating over whether to choose to study geography as an undergraduate. Being able to place the image <italic>within</italic> a particular text did not fit the favoured manner of pedagogical instruction for this teacher, which instead was very much ‘sight this image; then rubbish spatial science; then behold the new orthodoxy’. Just as Gould had his own Augean period, so the late 1990s were to have their own ‘emergent vanguard’ in the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>It is here, therefore, that I take issue with the notion articulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612468555">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>) that to be ‘canonical’, a text has to be associated with a ‘founding father’, and the necessary implication that the ‘classic’ should be of more recent vintage. Certain texts produced by certain geographers, of older and of very recent date, have been treated at best sycophantically, and at worst as pseudo-gospel. They have been venerated, uncritically disseminated and in some cases treated as the writings of prophets. In short, they are positioned as canonical. There is a geography to this understanding of the geographical canon. Those figures, texts and practices have been associated with particular sites – even specific Departments of Geography – and they have become orthodoxy as a generation have become employed at a range of new sites and institutions, and have then been involved in the reformulation of curricula and wider institutional restructuring. Canonicity and canon formation have been common throughout geography’s history, whether conscious or not.</p><p>It is, of course, perhaps inevitable that in a journal such as <italic>Dialogues in Human Geography</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612468555">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>) have had to focus on <italic>human</italic> geography, but the relations of different sides of the discipline have been particularly important in the development of canonicity in geography and deserve further comment and study. Franz Boas became so dissatisfied with the dominant environmentalism in geography that during his fieldwork at Cumberland Sound on Baffin Island, he began to develop writings that have since formed the cornerstone of Cultural Anthropology in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612468555">Boas, 1888</xref>). It was, of course, immediately after his final plea for geography, as mentioned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612468555">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>), that Boas left for America in 1887, paving a path well-trodden by future canonical geographers, but also beginning a process that has resulted in a bifurcated understanding of both geographical and anthropological canons.</p><p>There is a bigger question as to whether a field needs to articulate a larger, more defined canon simply for disciplinary survival. Does the perceived lack of a canon mean that geography will always be institutionally weak? If there isn’t a canon, or if it is very weak/vague, then surely it will always be easier for novices to ‘master’. This has advantages for innovative thinking politically, but it does tend to mean that ‘non-geographers’ or, at least, geographical novitiates can often be found making strategic decisions at different levels of the discipline and within specific institutions, about course content, research classifications and even departmental closures. These are huge, important questions, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612468555">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>) deserve congratulation for bringing these questions back into historical focus at a critical moment, and for placing canonicity at the centre of such debates.</p><p>Finally, back to that examination question; those students in that sweaty exam hall were answering as a cohort for the penultimate time. As of July 2012, that examination paper and its respective course are no more. It was replaced, during a wider course review, by a new paper that examines research skills. Perhaps even more worrying is the question: how many readers would, honestly, have chosen to answer it?</p></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2043820612468555"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Boas</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1888</year>) <source>The Central Eskimo</source>. <publisher-loc>Washington, DC</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Bureau of Ethnology</publisher-name>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr2-2043820612468555"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Castree</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2009</year>) <article-title>Commentary: Charles Darwin and the geographers</article-title>. <source>Environment and Planning A</source> <volume>41</volume>(<issue>10</issue>): <fpage>2293</fpage>–<lpage>2298</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr3-2043820612468555"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Driver</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2010</year>) <article-title>Commentary: Charles Darwin and the geographers: unnatural selection</article-title>. <source>Environment and Planning A</source> <volume>42</volume>(<issue>1</issue>): <fpage>1</fpage>–<lpage>4</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr4-2043820612468555"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gould</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1985</year>) <source>The Geographer at Work</source>. <publisher-loc>London, UK and New York, NY</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Routledge and Kegan Paul</publisher-name>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr5-2043820612468555"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Keighren</surname><given-names>IM</given-names></name><name><surname>Abrahamsson</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>della Dora</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2012</year>) <article-title>On canonical geographies</article-title>. <source>Dialogues in Human Geography</source> <volume>2</volume>(<issue>3</issue>). <comment>doi: 10.1177/2043820612468534</comment></citation></ref><ref id="bibr6-2043820612468555"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Powell</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2012</year>) <article-title>Echoes of the new geography?
