<title>Patient Report</title>
<p>A 2-month-old male infant presented to the hospital emergency room after suffering an apneic episode at home. Per his mother, the patient had been in a normal state of health until immediately prior to presentation, at which point he had suddenly become irritable and was crying more than usual. As she prepared to breast-feed the patient, she witnessed him cease breathing for almost a minute. He did not turn blue or appear to be choking and spontaneously resumed normal breathing prior to the arrival of emergency medical service. She denied a history of fever or weight loss in the child and stated that the patient had been feeding, urinating, and stooling normally prior to this episode. He had had no signs or symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, no cough, wheezing, apparent shortness of breath, nor prior episodes of apnea or cyanosis at home. The mother also reported no prior difficulties with breast-feeding and no evidence of abnormal nipple discharge, mastitis, or breast infection.</p>
<p>The patient’s past medical history was significant for premature birth at 29 weeks gestational age via spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 17-year-old primagravida secondary to preterm labor and possible placental abruption. His mother had received adequate prenatal care and had all negative prenatal labs, with the exception of group B streptococcus (GBS) culture, which was not obtained prior to delivery. Birth weight was appropriate for gestational age (1.465 kg, 73.6 percentile) and Apgar’s were 3, 7, and 8 at 1, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively, with the patient being cyanotic and requiring positive pressure ventilation immediately after birth. He was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for higher level of care following delivery, where he remained until 5 days prior to the current presentation.</p>
<p>While in the NICU, the patient continued to be fed with the mother’s breast milk. During his NICU hospitalization he suffered from 2 episodes of GBS sepsis, both presenting with signs and symptoms of respiratory distress. The first episode was treated with 14 days of intravenous (IV) antibiotics (vancomycin was used initially and switched to penicillin when sensitivities were obtained). Four days after treatment of the first episode was completed, the patient began to deteriorate clinically and was again found to have blood cultures that were positive for GBS. A central line was placed and the patient completed 16 days of IV penicillin. Two days after completion of this course of antibiotics, the patient was discharged to home from the NICU in good condition, where he had been stable for 5 days prior to his current presentation.</p>
<p>The patient was transferred from his home via ambulance to the emergency department where he suffered from several more episodes of apnea and was found to be lethargic and hypothermic. The decision was made to admit the patient to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for evaluation, treatment, and respiratory support.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0009922811409203">
<title>Hospital Course</title>
<p>On presentation to the PICU, the patient’s vital signs were as follows: temperature 94.6°F, heart rate 181, blood pressure 75/42 mm Hg, respiratory rate 40, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 2 L of oxygen by nasal cannula. The patient appeared sleepy and difficult to arouse, with a weak cry and minimal spontaneous movements. His anterior fontanelle was soft and flat. His mucus membranes were moist and his neck was supple; he had rhinorrhea and white secretions from his nose and mouth. His cardiovascular exam was normal, with no murmurs or gallops noted and with 2+ distal pulses throughout. No consolidations or wheezing were appreciated on pulmonary auscultation, but the patient’s respiratory status continued to deteriorate; he suffered from repeated episodes of apnea despite increasing oxygen supplementation. The patient was intubated and placed under warming blankets as a sepsis workup was initiated. Labs drawn included a complete blood count, blood and urine cultures, viral panel, and cerebrospinal fluid examination. A chest X-ray and head computed tomographic scan were obtained and read as being within normal limits. Echocardiography was performed to rule out endocarditis and an immunodeficiency laboratory evaluation was completed. Finally, a sample of the mother’s breast milk was obtained and cultured. Intravenous ampicillin and cefotaxime were initiated empirically while culture results were pending.</p>
<p>Initial lab results were as follows: while blood cells 980/mm<sup>3</sup> (65% lymphocytes, 13% segs, 9% bands), hemoglobin 8.8 g/dL, hematocrit 27.2%, and platelets 266 000/mm<sup>3</sup>. Cerebrospinal fluid and urine cultures, as well as a viral respiratory panel, were all negative. Echocardiography revealed no evidence of endocarditis. The blood culture was positive for Gram positive cocci in chains, determined to be <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> (GBS), sensitive to both penicillin and vancomycin. Maternal breast milk was also culture positive for GBS that was sensitive to penicillin and vancomycin. Immune workup revealed low serum quantitative levels of IgG 81 mg/dL (normal 176-581 mg/dL), IgM 14 mg/dL (normal 17-105 mg/dL), and IgA &lt;5 mg/dL (normal 2.8-47 mg/dL), with a normal lymphocyte profile (CD 3, 4, 8, 19, and 20).</p>
<p>The patient improved dramatically on the antibiotic regime and was weaned off of the ventilator on day 3 of hospitalization; ampicillin was discontinued and cefotaxime was administered IV for a total of 14 days. The patient’s mother was counseled to cease breast-feeding, given her positive breast milk cultures, and the child was started on formula. It was felt that the patient’s low levels of immunoglobulins most likely represented either transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy or resulted from prematurity with decreased maternal IgG transfer; however, they could represent primary immunodeficiency. The decision was therefore made to administer one dose of IVIG (500 mg/kg) while in the hospital with continued outpatient follow-up. The patient was discharged home in stable condition 3 weeks after his admission and was found to be doing well at follow-up visits 1 week and 1 month after discharge. Repeat quantitative immunoglobulin determinations indicated that he had transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy compounded by his prematurity.</p>

<p>Recurrent late-onset GBS bacteremia and sepsis resulting from maternal breast milk colonization and transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy/prematurity.</p>

<sec id="section4-0009922811409203">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Group B streptococcus, <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>, is a pathogen that has long been known to cause serious infections in neonates and young infants. Disease caused by GBS can either be classified as early onset, meaning that it occurs in the first 7 days of life, or as late onset when presenting after the first week of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811409203">1</xref></sup> Early-onset GBS disease, which typically manifests in neonates as sepsis, pneumonia, or meningitis, is usually associated with vertical transmission during delivery secondary to maternal vaginal or rectal bacterial colonization. Late-onset GBS disease, on the other hand, is more likely to present as bacteremia, meningitis, or osteomyelitis, and follows infant exposure to infected caregivers, including the mother, nursery staff, or other environmental sources of infection. Although the rate of early-onset GBS has declined significantly in the past 2 decades, largely secondary to increased surveillance of pregnant women and subsequent intrapartum prophylactic antibiotics, the rate of late-onset GBS disease has remained fairly constant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811409203">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recurrent GBS infection, as was seen in our patient, is a fairly rare phenomenon; it has been estimated that only 0.5% to 3.0% of patients with early- or late-onset GBS infections will suffer from a recurrence.2 Infants who present with recurrence often have a past history of prematurity, and, although these recurrences may be multifactorial, a large number have been associated with persistent colonization of the infant’s oropharynx, and/or infected maternal breast milk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811409203">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811409203">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Infected maternal breast milk as a possible source of recurrent GBS infection has been detailed in a number of case reports and has been strongly implicated as a likely cause of recurrent late-onset infection. Wang et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811409203">4</xref></sup> provided a case report of a mother presenting with mastitis just prior to her child’s second episode of GBS disease. Her breast milk was found to have identical GBS cultures to those found in both of her child’s blood culture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811409203">4</xref></sup> Similarly, Kotiw et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811409203">5</xref></sup> examined 3 cases of recurrent GBS disease in infants and carried out random amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction assays (RAPD-PCR) on samples of maternal breast milk and neonatal oral and blood cultures. RAPD-PCR indicated that the GBS strains were identical in the breast milk of mothers and the oral and blood cultures of infants during their recurrent episodes of GBS disease. Of note, not all the mothers in this report had clinical signs of mastitis or skin infection. The authors thus concluded that maternal breast milk serves as an important reservoir of potential GBS infection, even in mothers without clinical evidence of infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811409203">5</xref></sup> Olver et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811409203">6</xref></sup> provided additional evidence of GBS colonization of breast milk in the absence of obvious clinical infection in their case report. They described a case of recurrent GBS disease in an infant (one of a set of triplets) in which expressed maternal breast milk from an asymptomatic mother appeared to be the source of recurrent infection. Of note, the authors also showed that maternal carriage of GBS in breast milk could be eradicated by administration of an appropriate antibiotic to the breast-feeding mother (amoxicillin was used in their patient).6 Although the mother of our patient elected to cease breast feeding altogether, it is feasible for a mother with infected breast milk to continue pumping and discarding her milk while undergoing antibiotic therapy, and to resume breast-feeding once her milk is shown to be clear of GBS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811409203">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The infant presented in this case report is unique because not only did he have recurrent GBS sepsis, most likely attributable to his mother’s infected breast milk, he was also found to have low serum immunoglobulin concentrations. All children undergo a “physiologic” hypogammaglobulinemia at some point during early infancy, usually during the first 3 to 6 months of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811409203">8</xref></sup> At birth, the neonate, who has received serum immunoglobulins transplacentally throughout gestation, has serum IgG levels that are equivalent to those in its mother. After birth, infants begin synthesizing their own immunoglobulins while levels of maternally derived immunoglobulins steadily decline. The result is a temporary physiologic nadir of <italic>immunoglobulin levels</italic>, which eventually rebounds as the infant’s immune system matures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811409203">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In some infants, however, immunoglobulin levels do not rebound from the physiologic nadir as quickly as would be expected, or levels are lower than would be expected for an infant’s age. In these children, a diagnosis of transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy should be considered. Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy (THI) is defined as depression of a given immunoglobulin class by more than two standard deviations below the age-adjusted mean seen in at least two separate samples drawn at least two months apart. Immunoglobulin concentrations must also be seen to trend toward normalcy as the child ages, and there must be no other known immunodeficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811409203">10</xref></sup> Patients with IgG levels that meet the criteria for THI may also have decreased levels of other immunoglobulins; in the study performed by Dorsey and Orange<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811409203">10</xref></sup>, 54% of their THI patients also had IgA levels that were more than two standard deviations below the age-adjusted mean, and 20% had IgM levels that were more than two standard deviations below the mean.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811409203">10</xref></sup> Oftentimes children with THI are asymptomatic, and diagnosis may be made incidentally. Children who are symptomatic tend to present with recurrent infections, often of the upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tract, and frequently also suffer from atopic conditions; very rarely do children present with a serious infection such as sepsis or meningitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811409203">10</xref></sup> THI typically self-resolves by approximately three years of age without any serious sequel; however, normalization of immunoglobulin levels may be delayed in some children until early adolescence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811409203">8</xref></sup> The exact cause of THI has yet to be elucidated, though many researchers have carried out extensive research on the immune systems of affected children. Early studies implicated a numerical and functional deficiency of helper T cells, while more recent studies propose that the pathophysiology may be because of B cell dysregulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811409203">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The patient presented in this case report was found to have decreased levels of IgG as well as reduced levels of quantitative IgM and IgA. Subsequent quantitative immunoglobulin concentrations indicated that this infant met the criteria for transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy. In addition, the infant’s underlying history of prematurity could have resulted in reduced baseline levels of immunoglobulins, secondary to decreased gestational age at delivery.</p>
<p>This case presentation raises the interesting question of whether or not children with recurrent GBS disease should undergo both an immunologic workup and culturing of mother’s breast milk. As discussed earlier, the latter would seem to be prudent, given the overwhelming evidence that maternal breast milk can serve as a reservoir of GBS infection. The question of frequency of reduced immunoglobulin levels in children with recurrent GBS disease, however, appears to have been less well studied. Other than the case report from Simón et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922811409203">12</xref></sup> in 1989, in which a patient with two relapses of GBS sepsis was found to have hypogammaglobulinemia and was administered IVIG on a monthly basis for 16 months, there are few reports of the association between reduced immunoglobulin levels and recurrent GBS infection in infants. It would seem that further studies may be warranted to determine whether or not infants suffering from recurrent GBS infection often have associated hypogammaglobulinemia, as this could perhaps alter treatment strategy and could dictate further follow-up recommendations.</p>
