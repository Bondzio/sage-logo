<p><bold>Objectives</bold>: This prospective, observational, non-randomized study aimed to describe the relationship between treatment regimen prescribed and the quality of life (QoL) of ADHD patients in countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and Eastern Asia over 12 months. <bold>Methods</bold>: 977 Male and female patients aged 6-17 years seeking treatment for symptoms of ADHD were assessed using the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory-4 Parent Checklists, and the Clinical Global Impressions-ADHD-Severity scale. QoL was assessed using the Child Health and Illness Profile-Child Edition parent report form. Patients were grouped according to whether they were prescribed psycho- and/or pharmacotherapy (treatment) or not (no/‘other’ treatment). <bold>Results</bold>: No statistically significant differences were observed between cohorts (treatment vs. no/‘other’ treatment) in terms of change in QoL, although there was improvement over 12 months, with a greater improvement experienced by patients in the treatment cohort in both study regions (CEE and Eastern Asia). Psychoeducation/counselling and methylphenidate were the predominant ADHD treatments prescribed. <bold>Conclusions</bold>: Although both treatment and no/‘other’ treatment cohorts showed improvements in mean QoL over 12 months, the difference was small and not statistically significant. A major limitation was the higher than anticipated number of patients switching treatments, predominantly from the no/‘other’ treatment cohort.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>ADHD is a relatively common psychiatric condition, estimated to occur in approximately 3%-10% of school-aged children worldwide, although prevalence rates vary substantially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054710381480">Faraone, Sergeant, Gillberg, &amp; Biederman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710381480">Froehlich et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054710381480">Gadow et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054710381480">Polanczyk, de Lima, Horta, Biederman, &amp; Rohde, 2007</xref>). The proportionally large volume of studies and data on ADHD from the United States fostered the perception that ADHD was an American construct, but there is now a growing awareness that it is a global phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054710381480">Faraone et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Data on the prevalence of ADHD in non-Western countries, in particular Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and Eastern Asia, are limited but suggest that prevalence rates are similar between Western and non-Western regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054710381480">Erşan, Doğan, Doğan, &amp; Sumer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710381480">Gau, Chong, Chen, &amp; Cheng, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054710381480">Hirfanoğlu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1087054710381480">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>). The prevalence of ADHD in Turkey was estimated to range from 8.1% to 8.6% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054710381480">Erşan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054710381480">Hirfanoğlu, Soysal, Gücüyener, Cansu, &amp; Serdaroğlu, 2008</xref>), which is similar to that of some Western countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054710381480">Faraone et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710381480">Froehlich et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054710381480">Gaub &amp; Carlson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054710381480">Graetz, Sawyer, Hazell, Arney, &amp; Baghurst, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054710381480">Polanczyk et al., 2007</xref>), but considerably lower than that of the Ukraine (19.8%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054710381480">Gadow et al., 2000</xref>). In Taiwan, it is estimated that 7.5%-10% of the pediatric population have ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710381480">Gau et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1087054710381480">Wang, Chong, Chou, &amp; Yang, 1993</xref>), whilst in Japan, approximately 8% of school-aged children are reported to have the condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1087054710381480">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>). The prevalence of hyperactivity symptoms among schoolboys in Hong Kong was estimated to be 9% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054710381480">Leung et al., 1996</xref>), and a Korean study suggested that ADHD may affect up to 12% of nondelinquent adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710381480">Chae, Jung, &amp; Noh, 2001</xref>). Such differences in reported prevalence rates globally and regionally could reflect the various methodological tools used to assess ADHD symptoms, cross-cultural differences in disease recognition and/or possible environmental influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054710381480">Mann et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054710381480">Polanczyk et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>On the basis of these studies from the United States and Europe, ADHD is a substantial burden on family, society and patients, producing significant morbidity in terms of academic, occupational, social, and developmental impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710381480">Goldman, Genel, Bezman, &amp; Slanetz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054710381480">Hechtman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087054710381480">Riley et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, 50% or more of ADHD patients may present with psychiatric comorbidities or learning disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710381480">Goldman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054710381480">Hechtman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1087054710381480">Swanson et al., 1998</xref>). Increasing severity of ADHD is also associated with poor health-related quality of life (QoL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1087054710381480">Riley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054710381480">Topolski et al., 2004</xref>). Treatment plans for ADHD should, therefore, aim to reduce symptoms, enhance functionality, and improve individual and family well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054710381480">Klassen, Miller, &amp; Fine, 2004</xref>). A multimodal therapeutic approach is typically applied to ADHD, involving such conventional modalities as psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy. Treatments also include nonconventional interventions such as alternative or complementary medicines and homeopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710381480">Goldman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054710381480">Pliszka, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1087054710381480">Swanson et al., 1998</xref>). However, treatment practices differ worldwide, and may be influenced by cultural and local factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087054710381480">Ralston &amp; Lorenzo, 2004</xref>). Whilst there is an abundance of data on management practices for ADHD in highly developed Western countries, there are comparatively few studies from other regions, such as CEE and Eastern Asia. Consequently, there is a need to further understand treatment practices for ADHD in these regions, the burden of disease on patients, and to identify factors influencing the management of ADHD that may help form effective treatment strategies.</p>
<p>This study was a large, prospective, observational, non-randomized study designed to provide information about the diagnosis of, and treatment patterns for ADHD and other psychiatric conditions in lesser studied parts of the world: CEE and Eastern Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710381480">Martényi et al., 2009</xref>). Given that there is a gap in the current knowledge of ADHD treatment practices and the impact of ADHD on patient QoL in these regions, this study attempted to redress the balance of information by describing treatment regimens as prescribed in naturalistic, ‘real-life’ clinical settings in a large and diverse patient population from CEE (Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, and Turkey) and Eastern Asia (China, Korea, and Taiwan) consisting of children and adolescents. The primary objective of the study was to describe the relationship between treatment regimen prescribed and QoL over a 12-month period in ADHD patients from these two regions. In addition, the study evaluated the relationship between the severity of ADHD symptoms, psychiatric comorbidities and functional status, and treatment prescribed. We were mainly interested in the broad impact of the initial decision to prescribe conventional ADHD treatments on QoL over 12 months compared with cases where the initial decision was made not to prescribe conventional treatment and so for reasons of practicality, the primary comparison was between two groups; treatment (pharmacological and/or psychotherapy) versus no/“other” treatment (where “other” treatments were of an unconventional nature such as herbal therapies).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1087054710381480">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>Patients eligible for enrollment in the study included male and female child or adolescent outpatients aged 6-17 years who had presented to a physician in the normal course of care with ADHD symptoms. Patient symptoms were described using <italic>The American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th <italic>Edition, Text Revision</italic>; DSM-IV<italic>-TR</italic>) ADHD criteria (inattentive type [ADHD-I], hyperactive or impulsive type [ADHD-HI], and combined type [ADHD-C]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054710381480">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>), or the <italic>World Health Organization International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems</italic> (<italic>10th Revision</italic>; ICD-10) hyperkinetic disorder (HKD) classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1087054710381480">World Health Organization, 1993</xref>). Eligible patients had not been previously diagnosed with or treated for ADHD, and a formal ADHD or HKD diagnosis was not required. Patients were not eligible for enrolment if they had severe mental retardation (unable to attend school due to mental disability), epilepsy or schizophrenia, or were participating simultaneously in a different study that included a treatment intervention and/or investigational drug. Written informed consent was obtained from the parent/guardian of the patients before entry into the observational study. Assent from the patient was also obtained.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1087054710381480">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This was a 12-month, prospective, observational study, designed to examine the relationship between physician-prescribed treatment regimen and QoL of patients diagnosed with ADHD in actual clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710381480">Martényi et al., 2009</xref>). Enrolment was initiated on 13 October 2005 and the final patient visit was on 12 October 2007. On the first visit, patients were assessed for study eligibility and initial observations, and measurements recorded; patient data were recorded for five subsequent visits. The permissible ranges for treatment visits were: 1 week-2 months for Visit 2; 2-5 months for Visit 3; 5-8 months for Visit 4; 8-11 months for Visit 5; and, 11-15 months for Visit 6. Patients were enrolled from 58 sites across CEE and Eastern Asia: 8 in China, 4 in Czech Republic, 10 in Hungary, 5 in Korea, 9 in Romania, 6 in Slovakia, 3 in Taiwan and 13 in Turkey, involving psychiatrists and pediatricians who were selected on the basis of past experience in treating ADHD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1087054710381480">
<title>Treatment Cohorts</title>
<p>Patients could be prescribed any treatment regimen by the physician for the patient’s ADHD symptoms. Treatment decisions were at the sole discretion of the physician, patient or parent/guardian and were independent of study participation. Patients were grouped into the following treatment categories for analysis based on the treatment regimen prescribed at baseline: 1) no treatment, 2) psychotherapy, 3) pharmacotherapy, 4) combined psychotherapy/pharmacotherapy, or 5) ‘other’ treatment only. The ‘no treatment’ cohort included those patients receiving no intervention at baseline assessment. Choice of pharmacotherapy was driven by the regulatory status and local drug availability of different pharmacological agents, and treatment guidelines, in each country/region. Psychotherapy could include formal sessions of psychoeducation and counselling, cognitive-behavioral therapy, hypnotherapy, relaxation therapy, family therapy or psychodynamic therapy conducted by a certified healthcare provider at a regular frequency for an acceptable treatment duration; ‘other’ treatments included educational interventions, speech therapy, occupational therapy, herbal therapy/homeopathy, informal hypnosis, psychomotor/physiotherapy, electroencephalography biofeedback, diet exclusion, diet supplementation and relaxation techniques.</p>
<p>For the major analytic comparisons, patients were separated into two cohorts:</p>
<list id="list1-1087054710381480" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1) Treatment (psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy), 2) No/‘other’ treatment (no or ‘other’ treatment only). If ‘other’ therapies were prescribed in combination with pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy, patients were included in the relevant treatment group. No concomitant medications were excluded from the study and data on concomitant medications were recorded.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1087054710381480">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Demographic data of enrolled patients, including age, gender, educational status, family structure and family history of ADHD were recorded together with the type of diagnostic criteria employed (DSM-IV, ICD-10, or ‘other’). In addition, patients were assessed using a number of rating scales by treating physicians. Clinical severity of ADHD symptoms was measured using the Clinical Global Impressions-ADHD-Severity (CGI-ADHD-S) scale and Category A (all ADHD, Cat.

CSI-4 scores were recorded by the treating physician in consultation with parents. Parent-rated CSI-4 scores were verified by the treating physicians, who also recorded their own ratings.</p>
<p>Psychiatric and behavioral comorbidities of ADHD were assessed by both parents and physicians using categories B-J of the CSI-4 scale (oppositional-defiant disorder [ODD], conduct disorder [CD], generalized anxiety disorder [GAD], specific phobia, obsessions, compulsions, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], motor tics, vocal tics, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder [MDD], dysthymic disorder, autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, social phobia, and separation anxiety disorder [SAD]) and categories L and O (bipolar disorder, substance use) of the Adolescent Symptom Inventory-4 Parent Checklist (ASI-4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710381480">Gadow &amp; Sprafkin, 1997</xref>). Symptom severity scores were calculated for each category along with screening cut-off scores that represent putative diagnostic assessments of these conditions. In this manuscript, we only report results for the physician-rated versions of these scales.</p>
<p>QoL was assessed using the Parent Report Form of the Child Health and Illness Profile-Child Edition (CHIP-CE/PRF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1087054710381480">Riley et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1087054710381480">2004</xref>). The CHIP-CE is a validated generic health-related QoL measure, developed in the United States and Spain. The Parent Report Form assesses the health of the child from the perspective of their parents on five domains (Satisfaction, Comfort, Resilience, Risk Avoidance, and Achievement; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054710381480">Table 1</xref>), which are made up of 12 subdomains. The individual domain (and subdomain) scores may be differentially affected by ADHD and its treatment. Academic, social and other healthcare outcomes, as well as use of concomitant medications, were assessed by parent/guardian-solicited questionnaires.</p>

<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Changes from baseline in QoL over time in both treatment cohorts (treatment/no treatment) prescribed at baseline were assessed using repeated-measures mixed models. A separate model was fitted for each of the five domains of the CHIP-CE (Satisfaction, Comfort, Resilience, Risk avoidance, and Achievement) for the primary analysis. Baseline covariates of treatment cohort, visit number, age, baseline CHIP-CE score, country, gender, treatment by visit number interaction and a propensity score were included to adjust for potential confounding in every model. The primary endpoint per treatment cohort was assessed using the following model: Change in CHIP-CE = Treatment + Visit + Treatment Visit + Age + Baseline Score + Country + Gender + propensity score. The propensity score—the conditional probability of being in the treatment cohort as opposed to the no/‘other’ treatment cohort given a patient’s baseline characteristics—was developed using all baseline covariates considered to be relevant to treatment allocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054710381480">D’Agostino, 1998</xref>). An unstructured covariance matrix was used. Patient data were used only when they remained in their originally prescribed treatment cohort/regimen. For example, patients who remained in their initial treatment cohort/regimen for 6 months and then switched to another were included in the analysis population only up to the time of switching. Analyses included adverse events that occurred only when a patient remained on their original treatment regimen.</p>
<p>All patient data were analyzed unless enrolment criteria were violated, and any records containing missing data were excluded from the analysis. Descriptive statistics were reported using frequency, percentage, mean and standard deviation or median with minimum and maximum when appropriate. Continuous baseline data were compared using a 2-sample t-test for the two-group treatment cohorts, and an F-test for the five-group treatment regimens. Categorical baseline variables were reported using frequency and percentage (patients with missing data were not included in the denominator), and were compared using Fisher’s exact test or chi-square test. A two-sided significance level of 0.05 was specified.</p>
<p>In consideration of the design (observational, non-randomized) and objectives of this study, the sample size estimation was based on achieving a desired precision (based on the 95% confidence interval [CI] width) of the potential between-treatment cohort difference for change in the primary outcome of interest (CHIP-CE scores) and further inflated for expected drop-out over the 12-month duration of the study.</p>
<p>On the basis of these data from the ADHD Observational Research in Europe (ADORE) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087054710381480">Ralston &amp; Lorenzo, 2004</xref>), the standard deviation for the change from baseline to 12-month endpoint in each of the CHIP-CE domain scores was conservatively estimated to be 12 units. In the sample size calculation, the ratio of the treatment:no/‘other’ treatment cohort sizes was estimated to be 10:1 as it was believed that most patients diagnosed with ADHD would initially receive a treatment regimen of pyschotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy.</p>
<p>On grounds of the above rationale, enrolment of 1,100 patients into the study was thus targeted a priori. This was intended to allow detection of cohort differences, with 95% CI of width 5.2 units (2.6 units in either direction) on the individual CHIP-CE domain scores under the following assumptions: 1) standard deviation of 12, 2) ratio of cohort sizes of 10:1, 3) 10% drop out rate, leaving approximately 1,000 evaluable patients at the end of the study. This sample size was intended to allow for modest deviation from the estimated parameters and also some scope for regional and country-level subanalyses.</p>

<title>Demographics and Patient Characteristics</title>
<p>A total of 1,068 patients were enrolled in this international, multicentre study, of whom 977 were eligible for the final analysis; 547 (56.0%) were enrolled from CEE and 430 (44.0%) from Eastern Asia. Of these patients, 258 (26.4%) were from China, 50 (5.1%) from Czech Republic, 92 (9.4%) from Hungary, 92 (9.4%) from Korea, 79 (8.1%) from Romania, 53 (5.4%) from Slovakia, 80 (8.2%) from Taiwan and 273 (27.9%) from Turkey. The key baseline characteristics are illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1087054710381480">Table 2</xref>. Comprehensive baseline demographic data, diagnosis and treatment patterns for the initial study population overall and by region have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710381480">Martényi et al., 2009</xref>). Patients in the treatment cohort were, on average, marginally older than those in the no/‘other’ treatment cohort (mean age: 9.1 years vs. 8.4 years; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087054710381480">Figure 1</xref> shows the age distribution of patients according to treatment regimen prescribed.

No treatment was more frequently prescribed in patients aged 6-8 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087054710381480">Figure 1</xref>). Most enrolled patients were male (81.7%) and a family history of ADHD symptoms was reported in 42.6% of patients, with higher rates of family history reported in the treatment cohort than in patients prescribed no/‘other’ treatment (44.7% vs. 36.1%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1087054710381480">Table 2</xref>).

<title>Treatment cohorts</title>
<p>At study entry, patients were grouped according to whether they were prescribed psycho- and/or pharmacotherapy. Patient symptom severity, comorbidities and health outcomes at baseline for the initial study population have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710381480">Martényi et al., 2009</xref>). Psychiatrists were responsible for all diagnostic and treatment decisions made in CEE, whereas 33.0% of treatment decisions in Asia were made by pediatricians. Overall, 75.3% (736/977) of patients received psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy, and 24.7% (241/977) were prescribed no/‘other’ treatment.</p>
<p>Pharmacotherapy alone was the most commonly prescribed treatment, administered to 40.0% (391/977) of patients at baseline. Combined psycho-/pharmacotherapy was prescribed in 26.6% (260/977) of patients and only 8.7% (85/977) received psychotherapy alone. No treatment was prescribed in 17.1% (167/977) of patients, whilst 7.6% (74/977) were prescribed ‘other’ treatment only at baseline.</p>
<p>Methylphenidate was by far the most commonly prescribed medication in patients receiving any pharmacotherapy initially (45.0%), although it was more frequently prescribed to patients in Asia (58.4%) than in CEE (34.6%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087054710381480">Table 3</xref>). Risperidone and the nonstimulant medication atomoxetine were also prescribed frequently overall, with 7.2% and 4.9% of patients receiving these medications at baseline, respectively; however, at the baseline visit, atomoxetine was prescribed only to patients in CEE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087054710381480">Table 3</xref>). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and antidepressants were widely prescribed, particularly in CEE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087054710381480">Table 3</xref>). Psychoeducation/counselling was the most common form of psychotherapy, prescribed in 32.1% of patients overall, although higher prescription rates were reported from CEE than Asia (42.4% vs. 19.1%, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087054710381480">Table 3</xref>). Cognitive behavioral therapy and family therapy were also frequently prescribed in both regions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087054710381480">Table 3</xref>). The majority of patients prescribed ‘other’ therapies received educational interventions (28.2%). Speech therapy and occupational therapy were more frequently prescribed in CEE than Asia (5.7% and 4.2% vs. 0.5% and 0.0%, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087054710381480">Table 3</xref>), and herbal therapy/homeopathy was prescribed in Asia only (6.7% vs. 0.0%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087054710381480">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Study discontinuation rates were 31.9% (235/736) and 25.3% (61/241) for patients in the treatment and no/‘other’ treatment cohorts at baseline, respectively. The primary reasons for study discontinuation in both treatment cohorts were loss to follow-up (18.3% [179/977] of patients) and parent/caregiver decision (7.8% [76/977] of patients).</p>
<p>There was a high rate of treatment discontinuation and treatment switching observed for the study duration. The proportion of patients remaining on their initial treatment regimen fell dramatically during the study period, with only 10.4% of patients in the no/‘other’ treatment group remaining in that cohort and 30.6% of treated patients remaining on their initially prescribed regimens at 12 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1087054710381480">Figure 2</xref>).

<title>Change in CHIP-CE from baseline (primary objective)</title>
<p>Overall mean standardized CHIP-CE scores at baseline were 43.2, 34.8, 34.0, 33.0 and 30.8 for the domains of comfort, satisfaction, risk avoidance, resilience and achievement, respectively. When analyzing patients only whilst they remained in their initial treatment cohort using a mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) framework, a trend toward improvement over 12 months in all CHIP-CE domains was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1087054710381480">Figure 4A</xref>). Differences in improvement between the patients in their initial treatment cohorts over 12 months were not statistically significant. Overall, the greatest change in mean CHIP-CE score from baseline was shown in the risk avoidance domain (mean change 10.25, 95% CI: 8.31, 12.18) followed by comfort (mean change 8.25, 95% CI: 6.35, 10.15) and achievement (mean change 5.81, 95% CI: 3.84, 7.78; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1087054710381480">Figure 4A</xref>). The overall mean changes in CHIP-CE score from baseline for the domains of resilience and satisfaction were lower, at 4.82 (95% CI: 2.78, 6.86) and 4.68 (95% CI: 2.40, 6.96), respectively. This trend was observed for both study regions, CEE and Eastern Asia. The mean change in standardized CHIP-CE score varied according to treatment regimen, with higher rates of mean change observed in the CHIP-CE domains of risk avoidance, resilience and achievement in patients receiving psychotherapy (mean change in CHIP-CE: 10.68, 6.16 and 11.98, respectively) than for combined psychotherapy/pharmacotherapy (8.72, 5.32, 10.02, respectively), pharmacotherapy (7.81, 4.29, 6.52, respectively), no treatment (6.76, 3.04, 7.76, respectively) or ‘other’ treatment alone (8.65, 4.08, 2.91, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1087054710381480">Figure 4B</xref>). In the CHIP-CE domains of comfort and satisfaction, the highest rates of mean change in CHIP-CE score from baseline were observed in patients prescribed combined psychotherapy/pharmacotherapy (mean change in CHIP-CE: 9.50 and 6.24, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1087054710381480">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between physician-prescribed treatment regimen and QoL of children and adolescents with ADHD symptoms in actual clinical practice over a 12-month period in two lesser studied regions: CEE (Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Turkey) and Eastern Asia (China, Korea and Taiwan). In general, the data presented here reflect observations from clinically-referred ADHD patient samples reported in Western countries: the majority of patients were male, pharmacotherapy and multimodal treatment was widely prescribed, comorbid conditions were common, and there was significant impairment of QoL at baseline. The majority of patients were prescribed treatment at baseline, but there was a high rate of treatment discontinuation and switching throughout the study. Some inter-country and regional variations in ADHD treatment practices were observed, such as a wider use of methylphenidate in Asian countries and psychiatrists as the sole prescribing practitioners in CEE, suggesting that cultural factors, and professional background, may play a role in management decisions for ADHD.</p>
<p>In this study sample, the majority of patients were male, which is congruent with the literature supporting a higher prevalence of ADHD in males, particularly in clinically-referred populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710381480">Aras, Varol Tas, &amp; Unlu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054710381480">Erşan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710381480">Froehlich et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054710381480">Hirfanoğlu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1087054710381480">Swanson et al., 1998</xref>). Gender-based referral bias that is unfavorable toward young females—who are less likely to manifest disruptive, hyperactive ADHD symptoms than young males—has been reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710381480">Aras et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054710381480">Biederman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054710381480">Quinn &amp; Wigal, 2004</xref>). Patients prescribed treatment were older than those prescribed no/‘other’ treatment. Age distribution patterns of patients in the treatment cohorts/regimens suggest more patients are initially diagnosed at a younger age. However, this result probably reflects ascertainment bias in this sample as younger children were more likely to be enrolled because prior ADHD diagnosis and treatment were exclusion criteria. The baseline age distribution data also suggest a tendency for younger patients to be prescribed no treatment at baseline, following which they may be monitored before being prescribed therapy; treatment was more often prescribed in slightly older patients (7-9 years of age). This result may reflect clinical practice in these regions.</p>
<p>Pharmacotherapy alone was the most common treatment for ADHD in both study regions, although a substantial proportion of patients received multimodal psychological and pharmacological therapy, which has been shown to effectively reduce ADHD symptoms in studies in the United States and also in Turkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054710381480">Ercan, Varan, &amp; Deniz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1087054710381480">The MTA Cooperative Group, 1999</xref>). Methylphenidate was the most commonly administered pharmacotherapy overall, reflecting the predominance of stimulant medications in the pharmacological management of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710381480">Aras et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710381480">Goldman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054710381480">Pliszka, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054710381480">Prasad et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, methylphenidate was more widely used in Eastern Asia than in CEE, which may be a result of differential drug availability in different countries in both regions. For example, during the study period, methylphenidate and the nonstimulant atomoxetine were not available in Slovakia, where risperidone was the primary pharmacotherapy prescribed. Similarly, in Romania, methylphenidate was unavailable and patients received atomoxetine, risperidone or mood stabilizers primarily. However, in the Czech Republic, methylphenidate, which is indicated for the treatment of HKD, was available during the study period, but not atomoxetine. A wider range of medications were available or utilized for ADHD in CEE than in Eastern Asia, including SSRIs and other antidepressants. This supports findings from a recent study of prescribing practices in a child and adolescent psychiatry outpatient clinic in Turkey, in which stimulants and SSRIs were the most frequently prescribed medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710381480">Aras et al., 2007</xref>). Treatment choice was, therefore, dependent on drug availability. Psychoeducation/counselling was the most common psychotherapy administered in this study, although it was prescribed much more frequently in Eastern Asia than in CEE, which again highlights differences in treatment practices between the two regions. The relatively high rates of psychoeducation/counselling in Eastern Asia may reflect a tendency to prescribe behavioral therapies in young children rather than pharmacotherapy initially. Pyschotherapy/counselling may also be more readily accepted by parents/guardians as these interventions may provide more support for patients’ parents and families than pharmacotherapy alone, particularly in very young patients who contributed to a large proportion of the study sample.</p>
<p>This variability in treatment prescription patterns could, in part, be a consequence of the normal practices of the treating physician, but cultural factors may also play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054710381480">Erol, Simsek, Oner, &amp; Munir, 2008</xref>). The lack of standardized management guidelines for ADHD in some countries may have also produced inter- and intra-regional variability in treatment practices. It is important to note that even though psychiatrists were responsible for all diagnoses made and treatment prescribed in CEE, a third of patients in Eastern Asia were diagnosed and prescribed treatments by pediatricians, which may have influenced treatment decisions. The marked change in distribution of pharmacotherapies and ‘other’ treatments prescribed from baseline may also reflect the selection of therapeutic modalities with more favorable efficacy and safety profiles, contributing to the high rates of treatment switching seen in this study.</p>
<p>Treatment discontinuation and switching rates were underestimated in the study design phase. Study discontinuation started at an early stage, with approximately 69.7% of patients remaining by the end of the study period, primarily because they were lost to follow-up or withdrawn from the study at a parent/caregiver’s request. Patients also switched treatments early in the study, with the majority of treatment switches occurring within the first month of treatment. This may reflect a high variability in patient response to treatment, and perhaps also parental influences over treatment preference; a study in Taiwan suggested that parents of children with severe inattention symptoms may be more likely to request treatment switches to improve their children’s attention or academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054710381480">Gau et al., 2008</xref>). It is difficult to draw precise conclusions about treatment patterns from these data because the complex migration of patients out of the study or into different treatment regimens over 12 months—particularly from the no/‘other’ treatment cohort—reduced the specified analysis population sample size and thus limited the statistical power of the analysis along with the ability to make clear associations. The high rate of treatment switching early in the study may also reflect management strategies for ADHD in these regions; it may be common practice in some countries to implement nonpharmacological treatment initially in patients with mild ADHD symptoms, and to prescribe conventional pharmacotherapies on subsequent visits if initial approaches prove inadequate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710381480">Aras et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of the primary objective, the overall mean standardized CHIP-CE scores at baseline were low for the five domains of Satisfaction, Comfort, Risk Avoidance, Resilience and Achievement, suggesting that most patients experienced a poor QoL. This is in accordance with other studies demonstrating a low health-related QoL in individuals with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054710381480">Escobar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054710381480">Klassen et al., 2004</xref>). Both treatment and no/‘other’ treatment cohorts showed mean improvements in QoL—reflected by increasing mean score in these five CHIP-CE domains—over 12 months, although there was no statistically significant difference between either cohort. However, the mean change in CHIP-CE score was higher in the treatment cohort for four of the five domains. One possible explanation is that very few patients remained in their original treatment cohort throughout the study, which limited the statistical power to detect differences at 12 months. In addition, many patients received off-label pharmacotherapies—some SSRIs, which are not indicated for ADHD, were prescribed, for example—which may have had a limited effect on alleviating the symptoms of ADHD. As this was an observational study, there was no intention to compare different treatment regimens and it is therefore unclear whether more favorable treatment responses were observed in patients receiving pharmacotherapies with different modes of action. One other possible explanation for the lack of separation between the treatment and no/‘other’ treatment cohorts in terms of CHIP-CE over 12 months may be the length of treatment visit. The large number of measures recorded in this study exceeded those typically used in routine visits; assessment of the CSI-4 required at least 30 min of detailed communication with the patients and their parents. This extended period of communication focusing on the patient’s symptoms may have provided an indirect therapeutic benefit, especially in the no/‘other’ treatment cohort; length of visit has been shown to improve participation of pediatric patients during physician visits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710381480">Cox, Smith, Brown, &amp; Fitzpatrick, 2007</xref>). Improvements in patient QoL were paralleled by improvements in ADHD symptoms at 12 months, as shown by decreasing CGI-ADHD-S scores in both treatment cohorts. However, these changes in CGI-ADHD-S scores were quantitatively small and so the clinical significance of these data is unclear.</p>
<p>As reported in previous baseline subanalyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710381480">Martényi et al., 2009</xref>), psychiatric comorbidities were common in this study, which is in agreement with other published reports of comorbidity prevalence rates in ADHD patients (Ambrosini &amp; Berrettini, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710381480">Bangs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054710381480">Barkley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054710381480">Elia et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054710381480">Ercan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054710381480">Erol et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054710381480">Erşan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710381480">Goldman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054710381480">Nolan, Gadow, &amp; Sprafkin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054710381480">Prasad et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1087054710381480">The MTA Cooperative Group, 1999</xref>). There was a substantial reduction in the proportion of patients meeting CSI-4 screening cut-off scores for the majority of reported comorbidities overall at 12 months. This is consistent with the results of the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA), which found that multimodal therapy produced long-term beneficial effects in oppositional/aggressive behaviors, internalizing symptoms, peer interactions, and parent-child relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1087054710381480">The MTA Cooperative Group, 1999</xref>). However, caution is required in interpreting the current comorbidity prevalence rates, not only due to the nature of the sample, but also because the CSI and ASI are behavior rating scales that do not provide qualifying criteria such as functional impairment and age of onset. As such, these tools do not allow a formal diagnosis and may overestimate the prevalence of comorbidities reported here relative to formal clinical diagnoses used in other studies.</p>
<p>Of the patients who received pharmacotherapy in this study, 68.8% experienced an adverse event, which may have contributed to the high rate of treatment discontinuation, although most adverse events were mild. Study discontinuation following adverse events related to pharmacotherapies for ADHD has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054710381480">Prince, 2006</xref>). Stimulant medications—which were the predominant form of pharmacotherapy prescribed in this study—whilst clinically beneficial, are often associated with appetite inhibition, sleep deprivation and headaches, which comprised the majority of adverse events observed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710381480">Goldman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1087054710381480">Swanson et al., 1998</xref>). However, because this analysis included only those adverse events that occurred when a patient remained on their original treatment regimen, it is difficult to identify clear associations between adverse events and treatment discontinuation, given the high rates of switching observed. In addition, the data reported here may not represent treatment-emergent adverse events as a large proportion of patients reported adverse events at baseline, with higher rates observed in patients prescribed treatment initially. Furthermore, these data may not provide a fair comparison between treatment cohorts as patients in the no/‘other’ treatment cohort switched early and had a short timeframe to report adverse events. Patients prescribed treatment initially were more likely to remain on that therapy for longer, with more opportunity to develop and report adverse events.</p>
<p>There are other limitations that should be acknowledged when interpreting these observational data. Although the naturalistic and noninterventional design allowed the inclusion of patients who may have been ineligible for clinical trials, the lack of randomization and blinding may have introduced biases when comparing groups. Importantly, the high degree of patients switching between treatment cohorts (and between regimens within the treatment cohorts) over 12 months meant treatment patterns were numerous and complex. The pre-specified analysis population based on patient data only while they remained in their initial treatment cohort in a MMRM framework resulted in a reduced analysis population at 12 months in both cohorts, and increasingly hypothetical and imprecise estimates of change from baseline QoL at 12 months. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054710381480">Faries, Ascher-Svanum, and Belger (2007)</xref> conceded that assessing treatment effectiveness in longitudinal observational data is complicated as patients may change medications at any time. However, the application of various statistical methods to eliminate switching effects, such as epoch analyses, on-drug subset analyses, and marginal structural models, can generate reasonably consistent nonzero treatment effect estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054710381480">Faries et al., 2007</xref>). A sensitivity analysis looking at only completers who remained in their original treatment cohort produced similar estimates of treatment effect to the primary analysis. In addition to the issues arising from treatment switching, the study cannot be assumed to be representative of the general pediatric ADHD population of CEE and Eastern Asia as it included only those patients whose symptoms and impairment were of sufficient severity to warrant clinical referral. The selection of participating physicians was also pragmatic rather than representative.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The findings of this study contribute toward improving the understanding of ADHD and its management in CEE and Eastern Asia. Although the high degree of patient switching limited the power of the study to detect differences in QoL between treatment cohorts over time, it is clear that patient QoL improved for both treatment cohorts over 12 months and that treatment practices varied between regions. These data consequently provide an insight into current treatment practices for ADHD in two generally understudied regions, which may help improve the clinical knowledge, treatment and outcomes of ADHD.</p>
