<sec id="sec10-0961203313476359"><title>Purpose</title>
<p>LupusPRO is a disease-targeted, patient-reported, outcome measure that was developed and validated among US patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To expand the availability and use of the tool, we undertook a cross-cultural adaptation and validation study of the Spanish-translated version of the LupusPRO.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0961203313476359"><title>Method</title>
<p>Forward and back translations of the 43-item English LupusPRO were undertaken and pretested in five individuals. The finalized Spanish version was administered to 211 SLE patients of Hispanic ancestry from the US and Latin America. Short Form-36 (Spanish) and Spanish LupusPRO were also administered. Disease activity was ascertained using the systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index. A Spanish LupusPRO questionnaire that could be completed within 2–3 days was mailed to SLE patients of Hispanic ancestry and they mailed it back. Internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, criterion validity (against disease activity or health status) and convergent validity were tested. All reported <italic>p</italic> values are two-tailed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0961203313476359"><title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 211 Spanish-speaking SLE patients (90% women) participated. Test-retest reliability of LupusPRO domains ranged from 0.80–0.95, while internal consistency reliability of the domains ranged from 0.71–0.96. Convergent validity with corresponding domains of the SF-36 was present. All health-related quality of life domains of the LupusPRO (except procreation) performed well against disease activity measures, establishing its criterion validity. Confirmatory factor analysis showed a good fit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0961203313476359"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The Spanish LupusPRO has fair psychometric properties and is now available to be included in clinical trials and in longitudinal studies for testing of responsiveness to change.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961203313476359" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has a significant impact on the physical, social and psychological health of patients. For the most part, physician assessments of health outcomes are used in clinical care and research. These have been found to be poorly correlated with patient assessments of disease activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313476359">1</xref></sup> and quality of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313476359">2</xref></sup> in SLE. Patients themselves are the best source for ascertaining the effects of the disease or of its treatment on daily and important aspects of their life. Therefore, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), used in conjunction with physician assessments of disease activity and damage, are important health outcome measures for patient care and research. To make such a PRO tool universally available to SLE patients, the Food and Drug Administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313476359">3</xref></sup> recommends cross-cultural adaptation of existing PRO tools. This would not only allow for efficient use of time and resources, but also allow expanded research possibilities, especially comparative research that requires a standard tool that has been cross-culturally adapted into various languages. Herein, we describe a cross-cultural adaptation and validation study undertaken by us for Spanish-speaking SLE patients.</p>
<p>LupusPRO is a disease-targeted, patient-reported, outcome measure that was developed and validated among US SLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313476359">4</xref></sup> The tool was developed using feedback from male and female SLE patients with varied ethnic backgrounds, and includes a comprehensive assessment in health and non-health areas of quality of life. In addition, LupusPRO includes pertinent SLE domains that are not yet available in other SLE-targeted, patient-reported outcome measures. These include lupus medications, cognition, procreation, body image, lupus symptoms, pain/vitality, desires/goals, coping, social support and satisfaction with care. We herein report the results of a cross-cultural validation study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313476359">5</xref></sup> of the translated version of the LupusPRO in Spanish-speaking SLE patients within the US and Latin America.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203313476359" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>LupusPRO has two constructs: health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and non-health-related quality of life (Non-HRQoL). HRQoL domains are: (1) Lupus symptoms, (2) Lupus medications, (3) Physical health [Themes: Physical function and role physical], (4) Emotional health [Themes: Emotional function and role emotional, (5) Pain/Vitality (Themes: Fatigue, Sleep), (6) Procreation [Themes: Sexual health and reproduction], (7) Cognition, and (8) Body Image. Non-HRQoL domains are: (1) Desires/Goals, (2) Coping (3) Relationship/Social Support, and (4) Satisfaction with Care. Individual domain scores, total HRQoL and total non-HRQoL scores range from 0–100, where higher scores indicate better health.</p>
<p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of each of the participating institutions. Adult patients (≥ 18 years) meeting American College of Rheumatology <italic>(</italic>ACR) classification criteria for SLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313476359">6</xref></sup> were eligible for enrollment if they were able to read and understand Spanish.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0961203313476359"><title>Translation</title>
<p>To develop the Spanish LupusPRO, forward and back translations of the 43-item English LupusPRO were undertaken using standard guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313476359">7</xref></sup> The original translations into Spanish were conducted by a certified translation company familiar with the cross-cultural linguistic adaptation process using forward and backwards translation techniques once. Two translators of each language were involved in the process of forwards and backwards translations. The back translation version in English was reviewed thoroughly by the first author to check for maintenance of concepts and essence of the tool. The translated tool was then pretested among five Spanish-speaking individuals. No significant changes were suggested. The tool was reviewed by a native Spanish-speaking rheumatologist (GA) and minor changes were made to it in favor of frequently used and simplified words. Final translations involved two linguists from Mexico, two from Argentina, and five from the United States. Based on this feedback no more than 2–3 word changes were made to the tool. The final tool was additionally pretested among five SLE patients in both Mexico and Argentina, and led to no more changes.</p>
<p>The finalized Spanish version was administered to 211 consenting Spanish-speaking SLE patients from the United States and Latin America.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203313476359"><title>Validation</title>
<p>Psychometric properties studied included reliability and validity. Reliability of a survey measure refers to the stability and equivalence (or reproducibility) of measures of the same concept over time or across methods of gathering the data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313476359">8</xref></sup> The estimates of reliability reflect the extent to which (a) different questions that are assumed to tap the same concept are correlated (Internal consistency reliability), and (b) the same question yields consistent results at different points in time provided no significant changes in health have occurred (Test-retest reliability).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313476359">8</xref></sup> The validity of survey questions refers to the degree to which there are systematic differences between the information obtained in response to the questions relative to (a) the full meaning of the concept they were intended to express, (b) related questions about the same concept, and (c) theories or hypotheses about their relationships to other concepts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313476359">8</xref></sup> Such differences generally reflect assessments of content validity, criterion validity and construct validity.</p>
<p>Data on the following variables were collected at a baseline visit (T1): demographic information, clinical and serological characteristics, disease activity and damage assessment. In addition, the Spanish LupusPRO (T1), the Spanish version of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313476359">9</xref></sup> and the EuroQoL visual analog scale (VAS) (1–100) of health status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313476359">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313476359">11</xref></sup> were self-administered by all participating patients at that time. Higher scores on the SF-36 and the EuroQoL VAS denote better health. Another Spanish LupusPRO questionnaire was provided to patients. It was to be completed within 2–3 days of T1 (T2), and was to be mailed back to us or dropped off in person at the study site.</p>
<p>Disease activity was ascertained using the Physician Global Assessment (PGA) and the Safety of Estrogen in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment SLE Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313476359">12</xref></sup> and the Lupus Foundation of America (LFA) defined Flare (Yes/No).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203313476359">13</xref></sup> Cumulative damage from either the disease or the therapies used to treat it were assessed using the Systemic Lupus International Collaborative Clinics/American College of Rheumatology (SLICC/ACR-SDI) Damage Index.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203313476359">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The conceptual framework (hypothesized item to scale relationships) of the LupusPRO was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) appropriate for categorical data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0961203313476359"><title>Statistics</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics and distribution of data of the study cohort on demographics, clinical features and HRQoL were evaluated. In our study internal consistency reliability for each domain was evaluated using Cronbach’s alpha, where an alpha &gt; 0.70 is considered acceptable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313476359">15</xref></sup> Test-retest reliability was determined by evaluating the agreement between patient responses to each domain at two time points. Content validity was assumed to be present as the survey tool was developed from feedback from SLE patients. Construct validity was evaluated based on the strength of correlation of LupusPRO with related domains on the SF-36 using Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Criterion validity of the LupusPRO was based on its correlation with either health status, measures of disease activity, or damage. Correlations were classified as strong (<italic>r</italic> ≥ 0.5), moderate (0.3 ≤, <italic>r</italic> &lt; 0.5), weak (0.1 ≤, <italic>r</italic> &lt; 0.3, or absent (<italic>r</italic> &lt; 0.1).</p>
<p>CFA was done with the LupusPRO item responses using a robust weighted least squares estimator and Mplus software.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313476359">16</xref></sup> The goodness of fit of the hypothesized item to scale relationships (multi-factor) was evaluated with the Comparative Fit Index and the Tucker Lewis Index. These indices are comparative fit indices that quantify the size of the difference between the examined model and the independence model (i.e., a standard comparison model that asserts that none of the components in the model are related), with higher scores indicating larger differences. It is recommended that these two indices be 0.9 or greater as evidence of an acceptable model fit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313476359">17</xref></sup> All reported <italic>p</italic> values are two-tailed.</p>

<p>Two-hundred and eleven subjects (91% women) were enrolled (Illinois 16, California 80, Puerto Rico 25, Mexico 34 and Argentina 56). Twenty percent had less than a high school education, and 44% were never married. The median (IQR) age and disease duration were 36 (18.5) and seven (eight) years. The median (IQR) PGA and SELENA-SLEDAI scores were 1.0 (1.3) and 2 (6). The median (IQR) SDI scores were 0 (1). LFA flare data were available for 155 patients. Of these, 34 percent had an LFA-defined flare at the baseline visit (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203313476359">Table 1</xref>).

<p>SLE itself or its treatments may profoundly affect the physical as well as the mental, social, psychological, and sexual well-being of a person’s life. Thus far, patient-reported outcomes in lupus have usually been measured in longitudinal studies and in some clinical trials using a generic QoL (quality of life) tool.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203313476359">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313476359">19</xref></sup> The Short Form 20 was found to perform better than the Health Assessment Questionnaire;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203313476359">20</xref></sup> however, with the availability of the SF-36 and its Vitality domain, the latter has become more frequently used in lupus studies. The SF-36 has been found to be responsive to changes in disease;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313476359">19</xref>,21</sup> however, some studies show that the tool was either not responsive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203313476359">22</xref></sup> or that changes observed were related to non-lupus manifestations such as fibromyalgia and not lupus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203313476359">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Development of disease-targeted QoL measures is relatively new in lupus, and was undertaken to fill in gaps in some generic, patient-reported health outcome measures.<sup>23–25</sup> During validation of the LupusQoL in the United States, patients noted that some important issues were not captured by LupusQoL, such as lupus medication side effects, memory and concentration, concerns about pregnancy, effects of SLE on vocational aspirations and finances, support available, medical care, etc. Furthermore, LupusQoL was derived from female patients with SLE. LupusPRO, a lupus-targeted patient-reported outcome tool, was therefore developed from an ethnically heterogeneous group of US SLE patients of both genders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313476359">4</xref></sup> with the intent of capturing all pertinent issues affecting their quality of life from their own perspective. It has fair psychometric properties and preliminary studies indicate responsiveness to change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961203313476359">26</xref></sup> In the study reported herein, a version of LupusPRO that was translated into Spanish was cross-culturally adapted and validated whilst preserving the equivalence of the QoL instrument. The study included ethnically diverse Spanish-speaking SLE populations from the continental United States (Illinois, California), from the island of Puerto Rico, and from the two Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America (Mexico and Argentina) with the highest number of individuals attending outpatient SLE clinics. LupusPRO exhibited fair reliability and validity. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the hypothesized item to scale structure as the original LupusPRO and had an excellent fit.</p>
<p>The lack of longitudinal data to assess its responsiveness and minimally important differences between the different domains of the LupusPRO are certainly limitations of our study. Disease activity of the study patients was mild, which is expected of patients seen in outpatient settings. Low disease activity in this study cohort may limit the study’s generalizability. Further studies in cohorts with more active disease are indicated. Finally, the instrument may need local adaptations before its widespread use in other Latin American countries as well as in Spain. Strengths of the study include participation of a relatively large Spanish-speaking population of SLE patients that were genetically, culturally and geographically heterogeneous, as well as the inclusion of the LFA definition of flare and of the EuroQoL VAS.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Spanish LupusPRO has fair psychometric properties and has advantages over the existent SLE-targeted patient-reported tools. It is now available for use by Spanish-speaking SLE patients. It can now be included in clinical trials and in longitudinal studies involving SLE patients of Spanish ancestry in the United States and Latin America, especially for testing responsiveness to changes in disease severity or in treatment effects.</p>
