<p>These two books on theology and the market represent the wide divergence in Christian ethics today on approaches to capitalism and the market. Both began as PhDs, with Lee studying in Edinburgh, and Poole in Cambridge. Both women have a business background. Lee was an accountant with Ernst and Young, and now teaches at the China Graduate School of Theology, Hong Kong. Poole began by studying theology, worked for the Church Commissioners, and then did an MBA at Edinburgh. After this she worked at first Deloittes, and now teaches public leadership at Ashridge Business School. Lee is firmly rooted in the Reformed tradition, and much of the book is a very clear and helpful description of Federalist theology from the late sixteenth century, and its application today. Her dialogue partners are Reformed theologians such as Barth, Bavinck, Stackhouse, and Cortina (from the Netherlands). Pool concentrates on the Anglican school that flourished in England, from the 1980s onwards, including Atherton, Preston, Higginson, Brown and myself. Lee is concerned to reform capitalism by creating a covenant ethos alongside the law of contract. Poole focuses instead on the views of the Church of England about capitalism, and her work therefore includes both the theologians mentioned above but also the reports and debates of the General Synod. Prominent in these debates were well-known ethicists such as Bishops Richard Harries and Peter Selby. Lee’s book establishes her context by an extensive review of literature about employment contracts, but otherwise it is primarily a work of historical theology that then moves into an application of covenant relations to the world of employment. Poole is far more contextual. It begins with the debates on capitalism after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and it ends with the debate on the financial crisis in Synod in February, 2009.</p>
<p>The great strength of Lee’s work is her careful exegesis of the work of Johannes Althusius, who published <italic>Politica</italic> in 1603. This made his name, and he moved to become chief magistrate at Emden for the next 34 years until his death in 1638. What is excellent in Lee’s work is her attention to the context of his writings, and the way in which Althusius transformed the debate on federalist theology. However, it suffered the vagaries of academic fashion, and it was ignored from the late seventeenth century until its revival at the end of the nineteenth century. He is now part of the canon of Continental (primarily Dutch) social ethicists, including Kuyper, with whom Reformed social ethicists in the last fifty years since Barth have engaged. Lee’s work is the most thorough study of Althusius so far. Covenantal theology had originally been largely doctrinal, with debates about the nature of God’s relationship with his creation. It was the genius of Althusius to take the concept of covenant and apply it to what in Lutheran theology would be called the ‘orders of creation’. The form of citizenship in social and political relations, and the way in which associations combine to covenant together and so form a government, were his distinctive contributions to the debate. He justified economic inequality so long as distribution can be performed according to needs. Out of this historical account Lee then establishes a covenant ethic for modern social and economic life, drawing especially on the work of Max Stackhouse. The covenant is universal (Noachic, rather than Abrahamic) and includes non-believers. Its purpose is to embody in legislation in the social, political and economic realm the covenant which God has with humankind. Lee is well aware that economies do not function this way, but rather depend on contractual legislation. Her resolution of this tension is to keep the law of contract, but to contextualise it in an overall ethos of covenant loyalty. This would not be prescriptive, but the attention paid to a humanising ethos of the covenant would transform employment relationships. Hence her work is entitled ‘The Two Pillars of the Market’. Contract and covenant work together: contractual law promotes efficiency but can be heartless, while covenant relationships are what in other secular writing on the market would be called ‘humane and ethical capitalism’.</p>
<p>I have two reservations about this excellent work, though they are essentially only qualifications to what is a very promising first publication by this theologian. The treatment of Adam Smith is established by a careful reading of the economic, and sociological, literature on Smith’s corpus. All this is again carefully done. What she misses is the highly creative reconstruction which A. M. C. Waterman has made of the close connection between theology, philosophy and economics in this period. In his two magisterial works, <italic>Revolution, Economics and Religion: Christian Political Theology 1798–1833</italic>, published twenty years ago, and then in <italic>Political Economy and Christian Theology since the Enlightenment</italic> (2004), Waterman presents Smith as no deist at all, and with a fairly Augustinian worldview. ‘I have attempted to show that one may construe the text <italic>Wealth of Nations</italic> as containing, and possibly even as shaped by, a quasi-Augustinian account of the way God responds to human sin by using the consequences of sin both as a punishment and as a remedy’ (2004, pp. 104-105). It is a pity that when Lee is so careful to contextualise Althusius in the context of the seventeenth century that she then goes on to present Smith as a self-interested deist, and ignores Waterman altogether. My second concern is about the application of the covenant/contract to employment practices. This will always be the tricky part, and she seems to assume a fairly benign management which communicates a set of practices to the workforce (p. 203). There are two problems here. First, Lee seems to assume that the workers will be grateful for this management initiative, and she seems a little naïve on employer/employee relationships. There are examples where it has worked (I have no wish to be cynical) but it would take a great deal of careful planning, which Lee ignores. Secondly, and more profoundly, Althusius worked with a very suggestive model of small self-governing organisations in the seventeenth century which collaborated together to form a city state. Why then does she not explore the extensive theory and practice of co-operatives in economic life, such as most notably the Basque co-operative at Mondragon started by a Catholic priest at the end of the Spanish Civil War? It is noticeable that Poole is far more aware of co-operative practices than Lee is, citing examples of small workshops through to the John Lewis partnership. In spite of these caveats, this study is a splendid example of deep involvement in Reformed theology and economic analysis, and I hope Lee does more work in this area.</p>
<p>Poole’s work is very different, as noted above. It is an assured piece of theological analysis, which first looks at the debates in General Synod from the late 1980s to 2009, and then examines the work of the theologians who debated the economic issues of the time. What sets this work apart is a very careful third chapter which constructs a careful typology of theological engagement, first in types of theology (Niebuhr, Cobb, Jones and Kort), and then what she calls etiquette, which concentrates on methodology (Tracy, Lindbeck, Frei and Williams). These two analyses are brought together with a deeply informed knowledge of economic and business theory, and the final chapter is a highly persuasive critique both of General Synod and of English, Anglican theologians in terms of their sensitivity to her methodological and economic analysis. She is clear that while both Synod and theological output acquitted themselves well in this period, nevertheless there were lacunae. In particular, ‘the meta-analysis of typologies suggested a general trend in theology towards addressing believers, and a tendency when speaking into an asymmetric belief context to focus on etiquette rather than content’ (p. 168). This is a powerful critique, and in view of the fact that the theological wind is now behind Radical Orthodoxy or a more Barthian approach to economics, those who work in the business world are even less likely to find theology engaging with their concerns. Some would of course say that this is not the concern of theology, but Poole has done her homework and she is well aware that such a move could be legitimated by Frei. Her concern is that there is a major crisis at present about the legitimacy of free market capitalism, after the 2007–8 financial crises, and it is important that the Christian community (church and academic theology) engages with this. Whatever the merits of a theological method which begins with the Christian life, it will end up not taking the current crisis with full seriousness. Poole knows many will disagree with her, but she defends her position very well. In view also of the fact that churches are still major investors in the market (especially the Church of England, and it is worth remembering that Poole worked for the Church Commissioners in the early 1990s when even then there were financial crises, though not of the same scale as now), there must also be a major question about ecclesiastical integrity, if some bishops deny the moral standing of capitalism.</p>
<p>However, Poole does not simply raise awkward questions about how theology engages with the wider public debate on the future of the global market, or shine a light on the inconsistencies of institutional church practice. What she is excellent at doing is providing a record of two things. On the one hand, she analyses very well the theological debate about the market in England from the mid-1980s to comparatively recent times. Secondly, she gives one of the few accounts of how the Church of England and the ecumenical body Council of Churches in Britain and Ireland (CCBI, which became CTBI) engaged in economic critique of the Thatcherite culture of its day. She highlights the influence of Ronald Preston, and how his theological style (deeply informed in economics, Niebuhrian in theology, and seeking to be very accessible) was gradually replaced in theology by a debate between two approaches to capitalism. On the one hand there were Tim Gorringe and Peter Selby, who were deeply critical not only of capitalism, but also both of the financial markets and the debt culture which came to be associated with global capitalism. (She also mentions Michael Northcott in her extensive footnotes, but points out that his anti-capitalist stance is embedded in his environmental writings.) On the other side, there were a group of theologians influenced by Preston but seeking their re-interpretation of this tradition, including Atherton, Brown and myself. Finally there were those from a more evangelical position, such as Richard Higginson (who also supervised Poole’s thesis). Higginson, like businessmen such as Wright and Green, sought to educate the business community about the need for higher ethical standards. This account of the theological debate is clear, penetrating, and well-informed. In terms of the account of the General Synod, she captures all too well both its professionalism, engagement with government and business, and high standards of its reports, but also its tendency to seek a consensus view on most issues. There was a comfortable desire to help those who were being displaced by economic restructuring, which was both genuinely compassionate but also somewhat paternalistic. Poole’s acute business knowledge, no doubt hard won at Deloittes, is well used here. She has many recommendations about how Synod could engage better, and yet her judgements are always informed about the difficulty of communication in an increasingly secular world. The book is an outstanding example of theological method, business knowledge, and ecclesial awareness. The price is sadly very high, but I hope the book is widely read.</p>
<p>Two very different books, then, one showing an excellent grasp of Reformed historical theology, with a good ability to engage in current theological debates, and a willingness to try a very bold and risky attempt in applying theology to employment practices. The other is far more analytic and methodological, which will become the standard account of the theological debate about capitalism in England at the end of the twentieth century. Theology and economics is inevitably a fairly specialist world: these two books have contributed a great deal to its continuing vitality.</p>
