<abstract>
<p>We investigated the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Primary Care Health Centers (n = 14) in Thessaly (central Greece) recruited 436 participants, mean age 71 (50-79) years. Peripheral arterial disease was considered present if the ankle–brachial index (ABI) was &lt;0.9 or &gt;1.4 in at least 1 leg. Asymptomatic PAD was defined as an abnormal ABI and no symptoms or history of limb revascularization. The prevalence of PAD was 13% (mostly asymptomatic, 11.7%). Only 5 (8.77%) of 57 patients with PAD were aware of their disease and only in these patients were the physicians aware of the presence of PAD. The risk factors associated with PAD were age, smoking, and the combination of diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease. All symptomatic patients were on antiplatelet therapy but 33% did not take statins. For asymptomatic patients, 74.5% were not on antiplatelet therapy and 57% did not receive statins. In the primary health care setting, PAD is underdiagnosed and undertreated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is very common in male population aged &gt;50 years and affects approximately 8 million people in the United States.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712439092">1</xref>
</sup> Its presence is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) mortality and morbidity,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712439092">1</xref>
</sup> and for this reason, early detection in the general population is important. Because of the association of PAD with high incidence of CV events (acute myocardial infarction and stroke) that seriously affect the quality of life of patients, PAD has a considerable individual, economic, and social impact and it is now recognized as a health burden worldwide.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319712439092">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The importance of early detection of PAD, ideally when it is asymptomatic is derived from the fact that for each patient presenting with symptomatic PAD, it is estimated that there are 1 to 6 other patients with asymptomatic disease.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003319712439092">3</xref>
</sup> Interestingly, there is evidence from large trials that patient and physician awareness of the disease is very low.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003319712439092">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003319712439092"/>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003319712439092"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003319712439092">7</xref>
</sup> Additionally, PAD remains neglected and undertreated in a considerable percentage because of the attitude of both patients and physicians.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003319712439092">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003319712439092">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In Greece, there are neither national data on the prevalence of PAD nor an established screening program or guidelines for early detection and treatment in the primary care setting. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of PAD in Thessaly, a region of Central Greece and to assess the physician and patient awareness of the disease as well as the risk factors associated with PAD and the level of its treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0003319712439092" sec-type="methods">
<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<p>Between February and July 2011, 436 patients participated in the study from 14 Primary Health Centers in the region of Thessaly. The relevant population that was included in the study was invited with the benefit of the cooperation with the physicians of the local Primary Health Care Centers. Patients were enrolled if they were aged 50 to 79 years.</p>
<p>A questionnaire was used for the purpose of the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003319712439092">Table 1</xref>). This contained 4 domains (personal details, risk factors, past history, and clinical examination) with 17 questions in total. Two of the questions were related to the awareness of the disease from both patients and doctors. The ankle–brachial index (ABI) was measured in both legs using a portable Doppler device 5-mHz (Hadeco Minidop ES-100 VX). The measurement was done with the patient in a supine position after 5 minutes of rest. The ABI for each leg was separately calculated by dividing the higher of the 2 ankle systolic pressures in that leg by the higher brachial systolic pressure from both arms. The participant was considered to have PAD if ABI was &lt;0.9 or &gt;1.4 in at least 1 leg. Postmenopausal women were asked about the use of hormone replacement therapy. The presence of history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and stroke was recorded.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>For selected categorical variables, the Pearson chi-square test was used. Regression (Forward logistic regression) method was used for the estimation of the variables: age, sex, tobacco use, diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia, hypertension, and duration of treatment of these conditions. A 2-sided <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered significant. Logistic statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0.</p>

The prevalence of PAD was 13% (57 of 436 people screened). Most importantly, asymptomatic PAD (ABI &lt;0.9 or &gt;1.4 and no symptoms or history of limb revascularization) prevailed (11.7%, 51 of 436 people screened). Only 5 (8.77%) of 57 patients with PAD were aware of their disease, and only in these patients were the physicians aware of the presence of PAD.</p>

<p>Risk factors associated with PAD were age (<italic>P</italic> = .021), smoking (<italic>P</italic> = .000), and the combination of CAD with DM (<italic>P</italic> = .021). While in patients with DM the risk of PAD was not significantly high; in the presence of DM and CAD, the risk was 5.5 times higher (95% CI: 1.28-23.5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0003319712439092">Figure 1</xref>). For each packet of cigarettes smoked every month, the risk of PAD was increased by approximately 4.6% (95% CI: 2.4%-6.8%). As far as the age is concerned, for every additional year the risk of PAD increased by approximately 10%.</p>

<p>From 57 patients who had PAD, 6 were symptomatic and 51 were asymptomatic. All symptomatic patients were on antiplatelet therapy, while 33% of them did not take statins. Among the asymptomatic patients, 74.5% were not on antiplatelet therapy and 57% did not receive statins.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study shows that in our region the prevalence of PAD, especially asymptomatic PAD, is prominent in participants aged 50 to 70 years. Similar findings have been found in several other studies in various parts of the world.</p>
<p>Baseline data collected from the ADVANCE (Atherosclerotic Disease VAscular functioN and genetiC Epidemiology) study showed that the prevalence of PAD in 1017 healthy individuals aged 60 to 69 years was estimated to be 2% (ABI &lt;0.9), with significant risk factors being smoking, poor physical exercise, and high body mass index.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003319712439092">10</xref>
</sup> Especially in the presence of smoking, the prevalence increased<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003319712439092">10</xref>
</sup> to 6.6% and this was also documented in another study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003319712439092">11</xref>
</sup> In a similar study, Cacoub et al examined 5679 individuals aged over 55 years and found a PAD prevalence of 28%, concluding that PAD is associated with increased CV morbidity and mortality and that the disease is underdiagnosed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003319712439092">12</xref>
</sup> Prevalence of PAD is increasing with advanced age.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003319712439092">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003319712439092">14</xref>
</sup> Signorelli et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003319712439092">15</xref>
</sup> found that the prevalence of PAD among 3412 individuals aged 30 to 80 years was 2.5%, whereas Kroger et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003319712439092">16</xref>
</sup> in a sample of 4735 patients aged 45 to 75 years found a prevalence of approximately 6%.</p>
<p>In the Swiss study (Swiss Atherothrombosis Study), 25 351 participants, aged 55 years or older, were examined by means of ABI measurement and the estimated prevalence of asymptomatic PAD was 2.7%. The total PAD prevalence also including the symptomatic patients was 3.7% and all these patients carried an increased risk of atherothrombosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003319712439092">17</xref>
</sup> In a large German epidemiological study in which 344 doctors of the Primary Health Care service participated, including 6880 participants aged over 65 years, the prevalence of PAD was nearly 20% in men and 17% in women.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003319712439092">18</xref>
</sup> Patients with PAD were older in age and had as risk factors DM, hypertension, and dyslipidemia more often than non-PAD patients.</p>
<p>In the national survey National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in the United States, 2174 individuals aged over 40 years were included and the prevalence was 4.3%, whereas in a subgroup of patients aged over 70 years, the prevalence reached nearly up to 15%. In the same study, black race, smoking status, DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and impaired renal function were positively associated with the risk of PAD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003319712439092">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the PARTERNS (Peripheral Artery Disease Detection, Awareness, and Treatment in Primary Care) study,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003319712439092">4</xref>
</sup> ABI measurement was performed in 6979 and the participants were categorized according to their age in those aged 50 to 69 years and in those 70 years or older with history of smoking or DM. Using an ABI cutoff point of 0.9, the prevalence of PAD was 29%. PAD only was present in 13% and the remaining 16% had PAD associated with disease in at least 1 other CV bed (CAD, stroke, and abdominal aortic aneurysm). Smoking, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and DM were all identified as risk factors.</p>
<p>In the Rotterdam study, the PAD prevalence was 19% among 7717 individuals aged over 55 years, while intermittent claudication (IC) was present only in 6.3%, showing that the disease is present in a higher percentage despite the absence of symptoms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003319712439092">20</xref>
</sup> Additionally, male sex, advancing age, and smoking were increasing the risk of PAD by 1.5-fold, arterial hypertension by 2-fold, and CAD almost tripled the risk.</p>
<p>In the study of Murabito et al,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003319712439092">21</xref>
</sup>1554 men and 1759 women were registered from the Framingham Offspring Study with a mean age of 59 years. The prevalence of PAD was 3.9% and smoking and hypertension were the main risk factors for the disease. In the study of Stoffers et al,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003319712439092">22</xref>
</sup> the prevalence of PAD among 3171 individuals aged 45 to 74 years, using a questionnaire and ABI measurement (pathologic &lt; 0.95) was 7%. Similarly, in the study of Newman et al,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003319712439092">23</xref>
</sup> including 5084 patients aged over 65 years, the prevalence was 11% with a inverse correlation between ABI and the risk factors for CV disease. In the Minesota Regional Peripheral Arterial Screening Program,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003319712439092">24</xref>
</sup> the prevalence of PAD was 26.5% (ABI &lt; 0.85 was considered abnormal). These patients showed poorer quality of life as well as awareness about their disease.</p>
<p>In the Limburg study,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0003319712439092">25</xref>
</sup> 3650 individuals participated with an age range of 40 to 78 years. The prevalence of asymptomatic disease was almost about 9% and age, smoking status, hypertension, and DM were the main risk factors. In the Edinburgh Artery Study,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003319712439092">26</xref>
</sup> the prevalence of asymptomatic PAD among 1592 participants aged 50 to 74 years was 8%, while the prevalence of IC was 4.5%. Increasing age and lower social status were associated with PAD, while patients with severe PAD were also at higher risk of CAD. In the study of Sritara et al,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003319712439092">27</xref>
</sup> the prevalence of PAD was approximately 5% among 2305 participants aged 52 to 73 years from Thailand.</p>
<p>Also our study shows that PAD remains underdiagnosed and undertreated in primary health care setting. Interestingly, the percentage of the physicians who were aware about the presence of PAD in their patients was similar with that of the patients being aware about their disease. This may allow the speculation that physicians at the primary health care in our region rarely investigate their patients for the presence of PAD despite the presence of atherosclerotic risk factors.</p>
<p>Patients with asymptomatic PAD represent those at high risk of future CV events if undertreated.<sup>

</sup> Also, a considerable percentage of patients with PAD may have impaired renal function and this can be improved by statin treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0003319712439092">30</xref>
</sup> However, PAD remains underdiagnosed even in the presence of some of the well-known vascular risk factors. Patients and physicians express an attitude to neglect the seriousness of PAD and the physicians do not consider as important the rigorous treatment of risk factors.<sup>

</sup> Aggressive treatment of risk factors and modification of the lifestyle and behavior (eg, regular exercise and smoking cessation), especially at the symptomatic stage are of paramount importance to minimize CV morbidity and mortality.<sup>

<p>In our study, 74.5% of the asymptomatic patients were not on antiplatelet therapy and 59.7% did not receive statins despite the presence of risk factors. Interestingly, 33% of the symptomatic patients did not take statins. It has been clearly shown in 2 studies that patients with symptomatic PAD presenting to vascular surgery services were not on the appropriate treatment from their primary care physicians.<sup>

<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>The main weakness of our study was that risk factors were registered according to the evidence derived from the participants and not all of them had been subjected to diagnostic investigations. Blood samples for the confirmation of DM and dyslipidemia were not performed. Therefore, patients with glucose intolerance as well as with dyslipidemia and hypertension may have been unregistered influencing our findings. Additionally, these data reflect the prevalence of PAD in urban regions of Central Greece and thus it cannot be considered as representative of the diverse Greek population living in big cities with different lifestyle habits.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0003319712439092">
<title>Final Remarks and Conclusions</title>
<p>Peripheral arterial disease was prevalent at a considerable percentage in our population. However, it remained underdiagnosed and undertreated at a high percentage at the level of primary health care. As the population is aging, the incidence of PAD is likely to increase with an inevitable high demand on health care resources for the treatment of established and complicated disease. Primary care physician education may improve early detection and treatment, which will contribute to the reduction of CV morbidity and mortality.</p>
