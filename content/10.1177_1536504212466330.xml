<abstract>
<p>The classroom is a social space, and how students experience and perceive that space shapes how they approach their classrooms and what they do in them. Margaret Austin Smith uses ethnographic data of college students’ classroom experiences to demonstrate the degree of importance understanding students’ ways of knowing the classroom has on the effectiveness of teaching and learning relationships.</p>

<p>“This professor moves too fast,” Allie says, referring not so much to the pace of the course, but to the massive deck of text-heavy slides the professor zooms through each day. In her quest to copy down PowerPoints verbatim, Allie has filled nearly two notebooks so far this semester. Today, about 50 of the 150 students who are enrolled are present in class. They are tapping out messages on phones, launching Angry Birds graphics onto the next level of a video game, Facebooking on their laptops, and parking their smartphones on keyboards so that they can do all of these things at once. Others scribble down notes each time the slide changes before hustling back to the messages on their phones.</p>

<p>The professor speaks faster as class time dwindles. The noise in the room becomes its own dismissal bell. The professor calmly raises her voice to call out over the zip of bags and laptop cases, over the clunk of folding desks and students exiting the classroom: “Any questions?”</p>
<p>Scenes such as this are fodder for claims that classrooms are becoming obsolete. Today, anyone with access to the Internet can take classes at globally renowned higher education institutions and pose their questions at any time, from any place, to teachers, researchers, and expansive audiences alike. However, my two-year ethnographic study of undergraduate students’ classroom experiences convinces me that classrooms are not outmoded, but remain spaces of rich potential for students and teachers to learn about teaching and learning relationships. By understanding how students know the classroom as a social space, we can open up new possibilities for those teaching and learning relationships.</p>
<sec id="section1-1536504212466330">
<title>Ready-Made Knowledge</title>
<p>Early in the twentieth century, the philosopher and reformer John Dewey warned educators about questions that came “ready-made.” The experience of articulating questions, and engaging with others through the questioning process, Dewey believed, matters more than getting the “answers.” Classrooms are spaces for posing questions. Without such questioning, Dewey worried that the “record of knowledge” would be mistaken for knowledge itself. That kind of education, he believed, could scarcely prepare students to participate in and contribute to a democracy. Classroom experiences should offer students opportunities to participate in democratic deliberation and dialogue.</p>
<p>Today, contrary to Dewey’s ideas, policy makers, media organizations, school systems, college admissions, honor societies, and others tend to look at students through “achievement” goggles. National policies, from Equality of Educational Opportunity to A Nation at Risk, and from No Child Left Behind to Race to the Top, reflect what education scholar Linda Valli calls “test culture.” Students learn to see the classroom as a place where they are “test-takers.” And they see their teachers as “test-managers.” In a study of the impact of Bush-era No Child Left Behind reforms on elementary school teachers’ and administrators, one reading specialist admitted to Valli’s team, “I don’t always know [students] by face, but I know them by data.”</p>
<p>Data on “achievement”—or standardized measurements of students’ performances in schools—play such a powerful role in U.S. education policy and practice that some teachers even boast about being “data-driven.” Education scholar Larry Cuban blogs, “I like numbers. Numbers are facts…[D]ata-driven instruction [is] a way of making teaching less subjective, more objective, less experience-based, more scientific.” Educator Paulo Freire called such practices “banking.” In this scenario, teaching and learning center on the transmission of facts—or pieces of knowledge that are considered already fully formed, and that exist separately from those teachers and learners. Tests gauge how well students have been taught test-taking skills—how well they’ve banked.</p>
<p>Promotion and tenure obligations turn faculty attention toward publication and make rigor in undergraduate instruction hard to come by, according to sociologists Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa. In their 2011 book, Academically Adrift, they show that professors avoid giving assignments and grades that might lead to negative course evaluations, as such evaluations tend to be the primary way in which their teaching factors into their career advancement. Plus, they simply do not have enough time to offer the kind of substantive, intensive feedback necessary to make rigorous assignments worth students’ while. Non-tenure track instructors teach hundreds of students a semester, often at multiple institutions simultaneously.</p>
<p>Arum and Roksa suggest that we improve accountability in college classrooms by teaching students critical thinking skills which, they argue, are the capital students need in a knowledge economy and in a democracy. Such skills, they say, can be measured through performance assessments. To make the college classroom “meaningful and consequential for students,” we need to monitor undergraduate learning as much as we do elementary and secondary school. Testing students and comparing their scores over time and across institutions, Arum and Roksa argue, can make faculty accountable for student learning.</p>
<p>But student learning is a social process that requires cultivating relationships among people. The relationship between a student and teacher—or any other giver of feedback, for that matter—impacts how a student understands and uses that feedback. In other words, it is the relationship that gives the feedback meaning and consequence.</p>

<title>Testing the Limits</title>
<p>Jim, a biology major and a returning student who is several decades older than many of his classmates, praises the “exceptional job” his department does in providing multiple opportunities for students to engage with professors, researchers, and biological knowledge and innovation. Yet he observes that test scores often “crush people’s spirits.” Many of his younger classmates, he says, feel immense pressure around tests and test preparation—pressure that may keep them from “playing with” ideas and concepts, and discourage them from seeking out learning opportunities that don’t immediately translate to higher scores, or standout resumes. Cultivating relationships can take time and energy away from improving test scores and building lines on one’s resume.</p>
<p>Test culture, large lecture classrooms, and the sorts of faculty obligations that Arum and Roksa describe can move dialogue, and the questioning process that Dewey so valued, to the edges of students’ understandings of their classrooms. “[Teachers] get frustrated because we’re not keeping up,” and they “expect us to answer questions while we’re copying down the slides,” said Felicia, a senior criminology major. “They’re like ‘Come on guys, keep up,’ and you’ll hear people like, ‘Wait a minute, wait a minute.’ It’s like you are so focused on getting the information that you are not comprehending the method or the meaning behind the information they are giving us.” The experience, as Felecia puts it, is one of getting: receive and store this content; figure out later how it is relevant to you, or simply trust that it is, or it will be, relevant.</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jason, a senior majoring in kinesiology, seems to agree, “Professors add in stuff, they’ll say stuff like, ‘That’s not on the slides.’ It’s so rushed, they don’t care about the students—or no, it’s not that, it’s just they know they need to get through all this material that we have to know for the test, so there’s just a lot.” When I asked him whether he feels comfortable asking questions about something he might not understand in a lecture, he said, “You can definitely ask a question, but you’re so busy writing stuff down it’s hard to think of them. You can definitely ask later, but sometimes you’re more timid in a class with 200 people or 100 people.” Jason wonders if it is him, if he is just “not really good at multitasking,” because when he “writes stuff down,” he says, “I kind of hear what the professor is saying, but maybe not well enough to think of a question.”</p>
<p>After a test, he rarely asks for feedback about something he missed. “Feedback is just like an X—wrong,” he says. “We don’t usually discuss exams [in class], it’s just like, go look it up, look up the right answer or talk with classmates—talking with classmates afterwards, when you’re leaving, is a way to find out the right answer.” Discussing exams, he says, becomes a sort of “a bonding experience.” As he puts it, “I don’t want to say, ‘traumatic,’ because that’s the wrong word, but dire situations bring students together. That’s when classmates talk to each other most: after the exam.”</p>

<p>When classrooms center on “getting” answers, relationships and questions move to the margins. Discussion sections are one way in which large research universities in particular separate out questions (and relationships) from the “core” of the classroom. With different classrooms, different meeting times, and different classroom leaders, the discussion is both physically and psychologically distant from at least some of students’ classes—and for some students, separate from the purpose of the course.</p>
<p>David, a sophomore engineering major, explains, “[I]t feels dragged out. Like, we need 15 minutes but we have to stay for 50. In contrast, he says, “The articles we read are really straightforward. It’s not like there’s a lot of hypothetical thinking. Once a person makes a point, like, you can’t disagree. That’s about it.” Framing the discussion section in this way excuses his “slack[ing] off on doing the work.” Even students who take a different approach understand this. Pallavi, a sophomore neurobiology major, puts it this way: “Most people tend not to go” to discussion sections. “I mean, if you understand what is going on in class, if you can do well without going, then it’s fine.”</p>

<p>Engaging thinking means engaging people: it is a social process, inextricable from the identities and experiences of both students and faculty. Sociologists Cheryl Albers, Sarah Nell Rusche, and Kendra Jason use active and experiential learning to demonstrate how social contexts, relationships, and interactions matter in making the classroom a space where students’ own inquiries become a primary vehicle for engaging course content, enabling students to take what happens in the classroom beyond the classroom. When students and teachers see each other as people with rich, lived experiences that give them unique vantage points on course content, it makes a difference in student learning.</p>
<p>But active learning programs often go against some students’ expectations of what a “normal” classroom should look like. Cheryl Albers found that for some honors students at her university, an active learning classroom challenged assumptions of how to excel. When we combine anxieties about what it takes to “make the grade” with content that challenges deeply held understandings of the social world, the results can be unsettling.</p>
<p>Allie, who is white and upper-middle class, reflects on one such experience in a public health class: “I don’t know if I should be saying this right now…but [we] had to tie every single thing…into like, diversity. And it felt extremely forced…Don’t get me wrong: I love the diversity at this school, but it just felt so forced…Like it wasn’t even related to our topic, and it just felt almost like someone was forcing it in there. And she asked multiple questions about diversity in public health, and that wasn’t in the course description at all. It didn’t count as a diversity requirement or anything.”</p>
<p>Aware of the prevalence of this perspective, some students doubt that active learning approaches can do enough to bring out the dialogue instructors aim for. As senior public health major AJ puts it, “It’s just not going to go as far as you want it to go.” Sarah, a senior political science major, has seen perspectives like AJ’s and Allie’s. Over time, she says, students start to “walk away from [classes] knowing some people.” For Sarah, you can only challenge perspectives like Allie’s and exceed expectations like AJ’s when you know the people who hold those perspectives and expectations and can know something about the experiences through which they formed them.</p>

<p>Chemistry major Danielle agrees that knowing people matters. Otherwise, she worries, technical questions become the safest way to initiate a conversation: “I really don’t know what to say. I want to have a relationship with [my professors], but I am really nervous and I don’t know what to talk to them about. Like, ‘Hi, my name is Dani, help me study or something?’”</p>

<title>Resisting, Engaging</title>
<p>When students see questions as belonging on the margins of classroom time and space, they approach the classroom as a place for “getting” content. Just as they resist these terms, however, they may participate in recreating them. They do so in myriad ways: Angry Birds, truancy, slacking off, tuning out, or, like Allie, making demands. But as writer Sanyika Shakur observes, romantic representations of resistance often ring hollow: resistance without vision—without dialogue and organized action in support of that vision—is not enough. At times, it may even be counterproductive.</p>

<p>Senior sociology major Chloe and one of her professors, illustrate a path toward possibilities of engagement. When Chloe listened to a lecture, her thumbs barely left her smartphone, working Twitter and instant messages simultaneously. These are her notes—key class points rearticulated into 140-characters of text, to which friends and followers respond almost immediately. As usual, one commenter was more active than all the rest: her grandmother. “She’s obsessed,” says Chloe.</p>
<p>Chloe emails any slideshows or video clips from her classes to her grandmother who then shares them with her friends at work, and writes or calls Chloe back with related stories and responses. Chloe tweets and instant messages in all her classes. She began doing this to fight off boredom, she says. But she continues it because she learns best when she can put what she’s learning into conversation with the people she cares about most.</p>
<p>Once, when a professor assigned a critique of a concept they had been studying in class, Chloe wrote about her covert—or not so covert—tweeting and messaging. The next class meeting, her professor read out the comments Chloe admitted soliciting and receiving during his class. Chloe was touched.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the personal feedback that was so important to Chloe: it was the fact that her professor used what she wrote. In the next paper, Chloe eagerly engaged the assignment. This time, she was working for more than a grade: she was working to see their conversation continue.</p>
