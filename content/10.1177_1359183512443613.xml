<abstract>
<p>This article provides a multisensory approach to the past and suggests new possibilities for assessing history through the senses. Using a phenomenological approach, the author analyses how the domestic space of Southern Brazilian <italic>estâncias</italic>, ranches dedicated to livestock farming, dynamically influenced the social identities of their inhabitants in the 19th century. She argues that what people saw, heard, smelt, touched and tasted in their daily lives, as well as the intensity and frequency of these sensory experiences, was dependent not simply on their own bodily capability as human beings, but also on their social status. The article also explores how the rancher’s house, the slave quarters and the barn, the three buildings that constituted the <italic>estância’s</italic> core complex, influenced the development of particular body routines and the creation and reproduction of particular somatic spaces. The methodology presented here invites a sensorial exploration of historical sites, contributing to a more humanised account of the relationship between individuals and things.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Channelled into our beings through our senses, material forms play an essential role in the creation of our identity. Architectural forms, in particular, are key elements in the construction of our social identity: they stand for or challenge social organization, connect or set people apart, integrate communities or promote segregation. Most of the time, they act as physical reminders of socio-cultural rules and conventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1359183512443613">Sanders, 1990</xref>), influencing behaviour and communicating and asserting status, power and roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359183512443613">Rapoport, 1990</xref>). Power relations, as embodied in architecture, figure prominently on building forms of various types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359183512443613">Preston Blier, 2006</xref>: 245), which render material and immaterial the increasingly unstable terms of social life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359183512443613">Buchli, 2002</xref>: 211).</p>
<p>Among all types of built forms, the house has perhaps the most significant influence in society, being part of people’s lives since birth. The very materiality of the house objectifies in many ways social rules and values that are learnt by people through their bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359183512443613">Bourdieu, 1977</xref>). The house and the body thus cannot be dissociated; they are intimately linked both physically and conceptually, constituting the basic cognitive models used to structure, think through and experience the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359183512443613">Carsten and Hugh-Jones, 1995a</xref>). Interpreting houses therefore is a way of interpreting how human beings dwell in the world and, in the process, construct their identities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1359183512443613">Seamon and Mugerauer, 1985</xref>). It is also, as many have demonstrated, a way of interpreting societies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359183512443613">Beaudry, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359183512443613">Bender et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359183512443613">Buchli, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359183512443613">Carsten and Hugh-Jones, 1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359183512443613">Chapman and Hockey, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359183512443613">Freyre, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359183512443613">Helliwell, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359183512443613">Kent, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359183512443613">Miller, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359183512443613">Parker Pearson and Richards, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359183512443613">Rapoport, 2002[1969]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1359183512443613">Wason, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, I will interpret how the domestic space of Southern Brazilian <italic>estâncias</italic>, ranches dedicated to livestock farming, dynamically influenced the social identities of their inhabitants in the 19th century. Through a phenomenological analysis, I will discuss how, in these properties, the presence and absence, the discontinuity and variability of materiality created a shared identity among individuals who belonged to the same social class. In Brazil, where phenomenological archaeology is in its early days (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359183512443613">Cabral, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359183512443613">Hilbert, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359183512443613">Rahmeier, 2007</xref>), this study represents a contribution towards a more humanised account of the relationship between individuals and things (for an account of the theoretical approaches in Brazilian archaeology see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359183512443613">Lima, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359183512443613">Reis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359183512443613">Funari, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359183512443613">Funari et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359183512443613">Hilbert, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359183512443613">2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359183512443613">Kern, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359183512443613">Leone et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359183512443613">Mazz, 1999</xref>, among others). Particularly within the scope of Brazilian historical archaeology, this analysis suggests new possibilities for the interpretation of sites that have been explored only through excavations and based on written and oral sources. Added to these existing practices, phenomenology invites a sensorial exploration of the past which does not disregard maps, architectural plans and historical documents, but goes beyond them.</p>
<p>My focus will be the domestic landscape that constituted the <italic>estância’s</italic> core complex, formed by the rancher’s house, the slave quarters (<italic>senzala</italic>) and the barn where the herdsmen (<italic>peões</italic>) lived. Individually, these three houses symbolise the status of their inhabitants. Collectively, they demonstrate the social structure to which they belonged.</p>

<title>Social relations and the domestic space of the <italic>estâncias</italic> of Rio Grande do Sul</title>
<p>The <italic>estâncias</italic> of Rio Grande do Sul, the southernmost state of Brazil, were the main suppliers of the mules used for transport in São Paulo and Minas Gerais, and of the cattle used in properties dedicated to the production of <italic>charque</italic>, salted and sun-dried beef, which was extensively sold to other parts of the country as food for slaves. The herding of cows and mules gave Rio Grande do Sul its geopolitical and social contours, and the <italic>estâncias</italic> constituted the core of the economy, the established culture and socio-political organization of the state during the 18th and 19th centuries. Ranchers, mostly of European ancestry, formed the social elite, being the most powerful landowning class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359183512443613">Oliven, 2000</xref>). Indigenous and African people constituted the labour force of the <italic>estâncias</italic>, where they lived and carried out field and domestic activities, respectively as paid workforce and as slaves.</p>
<p>Slaves could raise their own chickens and grow vegetables for their own consumption or for sale. They could sometimes leave the <italic>estância</italic> to buy or sell products, deliver messages and to participate in wars between their owners. They crossed the fields on horses, and there were even slaves who sailed boats unguarded. Although most of them returned to the <italic>estâncias</italic>, there were many cases of escape and of new communities being formed (the <italic>quilombos</italic>). But the adversities of the life outside the <italic>estância</italic> could be so significant that conforming to the ranch dynamics could represent a guarantee of survival. If slaves conformed to the system, their lives could differ greatly from the lives of slaves in other parts of Brazil (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1359183512443613">Saint-Hilaire, 2002</xref>). In the <italic>estâncias</italic>, they had access to food and shelter. Working in the domestic area, slaves could sleep in the <italic>senzala</italic> or inside the rancher’s house, for example in the kitchen, corridors, bedrooms and alcoves, next to their master’s bed or against the walls. Those working with cattle usually slept in the <italic>senzala</italic> or in barns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1359183512443613">Silva, 2004</xref>), where they would share the space with Indigenous men who worked as <italic>peões</italic>.</p>
<p>The wage and status of <italic>peões</italic> depended on their area of expertise (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1359183512443613">Zarth, 2002</xref>). <italic>Peões roceiros</italic> worked in the subsistence agricultural production of the <italic>estância. Posteiros</italic> were in charge of areas that were far from the core complex; they were usually married and allowed to live with their family in a simple house (a post) in the field they had to take care of. <italic>Capatazes</italic> took care of the <italic>estância</italic> when the rancher was out. Like the <italic>posteiros</italic>, they also could have their family living with them. <italic>Campeiros</italic> were exclusively tasked with activities involving cattle, such as breaking in horses and dipping; they were unmarried men and employed in the <italic>estância</italic> on a temporary basis. Women rarely worked with cattle.</p>
<p><italic>Peões</italic> (as well as slaves) took part in several battles in which the ranchers were involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1359183512443613">Torronteguy, 1994</xref>). For example, they fought in the Farrapos War (1835–1845), an uprising led by the ranchers against the Brazilian Government, and the Paraguayan War (or War of the Triple Alliance, 1864–1870), an armed conflict that involved several South American countries. Their participation in wars was rewarded with discourses of exaltation regarding their courage – praise that did not, however, improve their social condition.</p>
<p>In theory free but in reality marginalized, Indigenous <italic>peões</italic> were known in rural society for their nomadic and errant character. They used to migrate from one <italic>estância</italic> to the next, a characteristic commonly linked to their Indigenous heritage and their socioeconomic condition. The wandering life of the <italic>peões</italic>, first condemned by the European elite, was afterwards converted into an image of bravery and freedom, which still stands for the identity of the <italic>Gaúcho</italic>, the citizen of the state of Rio Grande do Sul. In the social construction of their identity, the inhabitants of Rio Grande do Sul<disp-quote>
<p>use elements that refer to a glorious past, dominated by the figure of the <italic>Gaúcho</italic>, a word that initially meant a vagabond and cattle thief but later came to refer to the mounted ranch hand or soldier, but always and above all, the figure of the horseman. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359183512443613">Oliven, 2006</xref>: 308)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast to other areas of Brazil where the farmers were not directly involved in rural tasks, such as in the sugar cane plantations of the Northeast or the coffee plantations of the Southeast, in the <italic>estâncias</italic> they sometimes worked alongside slaves and free <italic>peões</italic>, principally when branding or dipping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359183512443613">Maestri, 2008</xref>: 257). These activities, which commonly developed into big social events, were narrated in a way that created an idea of equality among classes that was transferred to the interpretation of the rural society of Rio Grande do Sul as a whole (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359183512443613">Fortes, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359183512443613">Goulart, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1359183512443613">Vellinho, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1359183512443613">Vianna, 1987</xref>). Even if taken at face value, this (supposed) social equality would come to an end as soon as cattle work was finished and the men headed home. Enveloping their inhabitants as a kind of extended tissue of their bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359183512443613">Lang, 1985</xref>: 204), the home, as part of the individual’s self, would reassure through its materiality the kind of social identity assigned to its occupiers in this rural society.</p>
<p>Although the inhabitants of an <italic>estância</italic> could interact with its domestic space in different ways, the houses that were part of it were always there, persistently communicating the values objectified in their materiality. Their daily material experience resulted in different physical sensations: the sensory experience to which a slave woman was exposed differed from the experiences constituting the lives of a cattle herder or a rancher. This was not a case of materiality simply dictating bodily experience, but of material forms offering certain possibilities for physical experience – of their colours, dimensions, concreteness, odours, noises and flavours. What people saw, heard, smelt, touched and tasted in their daily lives, as well as the intensity and frequency of these sensory experiences, was dependent not simply on their own bodily capability as human beings, but also on their social status and their duties in the <italic>estância</italic>, which were in turn linked to their ethnicity and gender. Through their social practices, meanings were realized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359183512443613">Parker Pearson and Richards, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there were no rules relating to the construction of houses in the <italic>estâncias</italic> of Rio Grande do Sul (in contrast to the neighbouring Argentinean Pampas, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359183512443613">Brittez, 2006</xref>), a pattern can still be identified. The rancher’s house was the largest and most solidly built structure. It usually occupied a privileged location (such as the top of a hill), had between three and five bedrooms, a corridor, hall, living room, dining room, kitchen, guest room, alcove and prayer niche. The barn, usually a simple rectangular building, had as many internal partitions as required as it was used as a kitchen, mill, store, storage place, corral, hen house, pigsty, lodging for travellers, slave quarters and also to accommodate the free labour force. Slave quarters were smaller than the other buildings and did not have internal partitions. They were commonly built with disposable materials such as broken tiles and bricks. The rancher’s house had covered floors, usually with wood. In the barn and the slave quarters, the floors were made only of beaten soil. Commonly, the rancher’s house was painted inside, sometimes with floral motifs on the walls and ceiling. Outside it was white, with a vibrant coloured low stripe, usually blue, red, green or yellow, matching the door and window frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359183512443613">Luccas, 1997</xref>). The barn occasionally received a lick of paint, but the slave quarters were not painted. Few of these buildings have remained, the rancher’s house being the structure most frequently found today, followed by barns and, rarely, the slave quarters. A rare example of an <italic>estância</italic> where these three core structures could still be found when this research was conducted was Vista Alegre, in the northwest of Rio Grande do Sul (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1359183512443613">Figure 1</xref>). Built in the middle of the 19th century, Vista Alegre illustrated the pattern of settlement followed by other <italic>estâncias</italic> in the same area. It was there that I developed the phenomenological analysis presented below.</p>

<title>Materiality, social roles and the senses: <italic>Estância</italic> Vista Alegre</title>
<p>The couple who founded Vista Alegre, Serafim and Carolina Correa de Barros, built their house in the 1840s, and had their 11 children there. Serafim and Carolina belonged to the first generations of Luso-Brazilians born in northwestern Rio Grande do Sul. Serafim fought in several wars, such as the Farrapos and the Paraguayan Wars, and when the Brazilian army was created (after the Paraguayan War) he was awarded the post of Honorary Colonel.</p>
<p>Serafim Correa de Barros died in 1886, Carolina pre-deceased him, dying in 1884. Her post-mortem inventory registered the ownership of 2618 animals, including pigs, sheep, horses, mules and cows, the last two categories being the most valued animals. The inventory also registers the ownership of 14 slaves – 8 men, who probably worked as herders, and six women, who were probably in charge of domestic tasks. These numbers may have been higher when the cattle economy was stronger.</p>
<p>The positions occupied by the slaves in Vista Alegre were mentioned only in the inventory of Serafim. Written between 1886 and 1891, a period when the <italic>estâncias</italic> were losing their economic importance and slavery was being abolished, it registers only 724 animals and six slaves. The occupations of three of the slaves are mentioned: José worked as a <italic>campeiro</italic> (in charge of cattle-related work), Delphina as a dressmaker and Laurentina as a cook. The occupations of João, who was defined as an ailing slave, Victorino and Maria are not specified in the inventory. We cannot discover how many Indigenous <italic>peões</italic> lived in Vista Alegre as the registers do not mention them (they were not considered property). But we can still find details of the barn where the <italic>campeiros</italic> lived, in the core complex of the <italic>estância</italic>.</p>
<p>In what follows, I will describe the three houses that constituted the core complex of Vista Alegre (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1359183512443613">Figures 2</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1359183512443613">5</xref>) in order to explore how their material forms may have been experienced by their inhabitants in the past, when the <italic>estância</italic> was functioning.</p>

<title>The rancher’s house</title>
<p>High above the surrounding countryside and prominent in contrast to the other architectural forms, the rancher’s house is the first structure we see when approaching Vista Alegre. The large and robust walls of the rancher’s house were made of bricks and blocks of sandstone set on basalt, cemented with a mixture of manure and mud. The walls were smooth, angular, painted and plastered both on the inside and outside. Some steps led into the house, which had a wooden floor set on a wooden beam and a tiled roof – features highly valued at the time. The elevation of the floor allowed room for a basement, a feature not present in the other buildings. A robust layer of wood was placed under the high ceiling, which was supported by wooden beams and trellis. Only the rancher’s house featured a high roof and external decorations. There were ornamental concrete lines between the roof and the wall on all sides but the back of the house, and a prominent positioning of lines was found on the eaves which faced the main road and the circulation area from which visitors would arrive. The structure of the rancher’s house helped to reduce the effects of inclement weather, a useful characteristic in a region where temperatures can vary between sub zero and around 40°C. There were doors and windows on all sides of the house, providing a wide view of the landscape and allowing a better surveillance of the site. Through the side windows, the rancher and his family could see the road, barn, cattle enclosure, slave quarters and the orchard. The view through the front windows, which revealed an immense area of open fields, limited only by the horizon, must have been very impressive (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1359183512443613">Figures 6</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1359183512443613">8</xref>). The width and height of the windows also assured ventilation and light in the interior of the house, providing a feeling of openness and an atmosphere in which odours would soon disappear. External sounds could be controlled by the opening and shutting of windows and the thick walls isolated internal sounds. In this way, there was greater privacy in the rancher’s house than in the other buildings. Noises from the animals in the cattle enclosure, from the road, slave quarters and the barn could be heard when the windows were open but could be avoided when they were shut. The wardrobes, desks, dining tables, chairs and beds probably stopped the reverberation of voices and the clink of cutlery (a silver dinner service being used on special occasions). With several rooms – although not enough rooms for each family member – the house allowed some privacy and also created different suitable ambiences for different activities. The rancher’s family would gather around the dining table to enjoy food prepared in the kitchen or outside the house, such as jams, bread, meat, beans, potatoes and rice. The bedrooms, dining room, office, living room and kitchen created different areas for various social activities inside the rancher’s house.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1359183512443613-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>At the back of the rancher’s house there is an annexe, which seems to have been constructed some time after the main house. This simple two-room construction is used today as a kitchen and bedroom. The floor of the brick-built annexe is high, but not as high as that of the main house so there is no room for a basement. This annexe is of a simpler architectural design compared to the rest of the house, with a lower ceiling and no roof or floor covering. A door separates the annexe from the rest of the house, and a step connects its kitchen to what is today only used as a dining room.</p>

<sec id="section5-1359183512443613">
<title>The slave quarters (<italic>senzala</italic>)</title>
<p>The slave quarters cannot be seen from the public road and are only visible from inside the Vista Alegre core complex. The walls of this building were patchy and uneven, made of broken bricks and unshaped blocks of basalt and sandstone. The gaps between the stones and bricks were filled with broken roof tiles. A mud paste was added to these materials, but only in some places and in a random fashion. The natural colour of these materials resulted in a messy combination of ochre, brown and grey. The building was unpainted both inside and outside and the tiled roof was supported by wooden beams and trellis. The floor was level with the exterior ground and made of beaten soil, which softened the sounds produced in the building. There were probably neither cutlery nor furnishings. The stones, clay and soil gave this building a distinctive kind of raw smell. Gaps in the walls and the absence of lining under the roof meant that there was no insulation; heat and cold easily penetrated the building. The voices of its inhabitants could be heard clearly outside; the noises of birds, cattle, of people moving around could also be clearly heard from within the slave quarters. This one-room building had two doors facing the back of the rancher’s house where the rancher’s kitchen was located. Possibly it also had a back door, which led to the vegetable garden. The views from the front doors were quite restricted, and faced the area where the slaves worked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1359183512443613">Figures 9</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1359183512443613">11</xref>).</p>

<p>A one-room annexe made of thin bricks is attached to one side of the slave quarters. It was probably built more recently to serve as a kitchen; its interior was plastered with cement and painted. The back wall was not coated with finishing materials as only the walls that faced the other houses received this treatment. The floor of the annexe was raised by about 50 cm and made of brick. This construction had one window and one door, which faced, respectively, the back of the ranch, probably once the site of the vegetable garden, and the back of the rancher’s house.</p>

<title>The barn</title>
<p>Almost unnoticeable from the main road is the barn. There the men were accommodated in a kind of temporary shelter. The wandering life of the <italic>peões</italic> seems to have been transposed to the materiality of the place where they lived: like the backs of their horses, the barn contained just what was necessary to make their lives bearable. There was no lining under the roof, no flooring, the walls, although built with bricks, were thin and the furniture, if any, was very simple – just sufficient for sleeping and storing personal belongings. There were probably just a few nails on the walls on which to hang clothes and the <italic>peões’</italic> equipment: riding hats, back pads, harnesses, whips, etc. This equipment was always at hand for the <italic>peões</italic> and signified their field activities. The many doors facilitated circulation between the inside and outside, which gave the <italic>peões</italic> immediate access to the animals. The barn’s facade and the side that faced the circulation area were plastered with cement and also received a lick of paint, but the walls facing the back of the ranch and the cattle enclosure were finished only with plaster. The interior of the barn received no finishing. It was also covered with tiles supported by wooden beams and trellis, but the barn floor, like that of the slave quarters, was made of beaten soil and was at the same level as the ground outside. The front of the barn was aligned with the back of the rancher’s house. Through the windows it was possible to see the cattle enclosure, slave quarters and rancher’s house. Although the view from the barn was not very restricted, it did not give the same feeling of expansiveness as the view from the rancher’s house.</p>
<p>The barn was also a place to congregate, where men sat by the fire to eat, drink, chat, sing and play the guitar, a tradition still very much alive in Rio Grande do Sul today. It was not a place for women: ‘the bunkhouse had always been a male preserve in the countryside’ (Lessa, 1985, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359183512443613">Oliven, 2000</xref>: 132). Meat was a large part of their diet – beef being preferred to pork, lamb or chicken. Fish was not eaten. <italic>Peões</italic> used to pierce the meat with long sword-like skewers and grill it over an open fire, a practice that gave birth to the <italic>churrasco</italic>, the Brazilian barbecue. Although it was common for all the men who inhabited the <italic>estâncias</italic> to gather in the barn when a <italic>churrasco</italic> was being prepared, its actual consumption was marked by social differences: ribs for the <italic>peões</italic>, accompanied by manioc flour; the best cuts of beef, preferably off the bone, for the landowners. Peaches were abundant in the <italic>estâncias</italic>. Potatoes, butternut squash and corn grew easily, but vegetables in general were not much appreciated. The diet of <italic>peões</italic> and slaves consisted only of beef, manioc flour and hard biscuits made of maize flour, sometimes soaked in milk. <italic>Mate</italic> (also called <italic>chimarrão</italic>), a traditional Indigenous tea, was always available: imbibed as a stimulant early in the morning, as an aperitif before lunch, accompanying meals or after meals as a digestive. Drinking <italic>mate</italic> eventually became a social practice in Rio Grande do Sul, common to all classes. As it could be stored for long periods, <italic>charque</italic> produced in the <italic>estância</italic> became a practical product that was always available and kept in the barn. In the rancher’s house, it was usually served to unexpected guests, when it was commonly mixed with rice as a risotto; in the barn and slave quarters, it was consumed more often, usually on its own or with bread. The fire lit on the floor in the barn warmed the men, heated the water for the <italic>mate</italic> and grilled the meat of the barbecue. The smell of the smoke, of the animals kept nearby, the <italic>charque</italic> and the fat from the beef when a barbecue was being prepared all created a characteristic odour.</p>
<p>While the houses can be read as a microcosm of the social world, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359183512443613">Bourdieu (2000)</xref> suggests in his analysis of the Berber Kabyle house, in this study they cannot be treated straightforwardly in their individuality since they were all constructed and inhabited according to the dominant rancher’s view of the world. Therefore, the sensory experiences people had while living in the rancher’s house, slave quarters and barn were systematically linked to the way the society was organized. In what follows, I will explore these experiences in relation to the tasks carried out by people in the domestic space of Vista Alegre.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section7-1359183512443613">
<title>Domestic space and somatic spaces</title>
<p>The core complex of the <italic>estâncias</italic> can be understood as the Maussian ‘collective context’ that formed and informed the social constitution of its practitioners (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359183512443613">Schlanger, 1998</xref>: 198). Through embodiment, the ultimate core of identity formation, which allows people to develop notions of individual and social self (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1359183512443613">Tilley, 2006</xref>), particular identities were formed. Although organic and in constant elaboration, ‘open to formulation and reformulation’ (p. 8), these identities were rooted in the ‘spacializing’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359183512443613">Merleau-Ponty, 2006</xref>) domestic space where daily activities took place. It was a space replete with places that were created and sensed by people in different ways, through bodily participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359183512443613">Grange, 1985</xref>: 83). Time and history, inscribed and inseparable from these places, were also inseparable from the bodies that sustained them and reproduced the culture located in them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359183512443613">Casey, 1996</xref>: 37).</p>
<p>The dynamics of an <italic>estância</italic> required that the labour force be always at hand. At Vista Alegre, the houses are located next to each other, 10 metres being the maximum distance between them. The corporeal routines carried out among these houses resulted in the creation of different somatic spaces (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1359183512443613">Figure 12</xref> later): the subordinate space for domestic activities, essentially occupied by slaves, the non-productive space designated for the landowner elite and the space provided for tasks related to the cattle. Even if subjectively motivated, individuals’ responses to the materiality of these spaces, through action and movement, were objective. In this dialectic process of internalization/externalization, individual and collective identities were created and reproduced.</p>

<sec id="section8-1359183512443613">
<title>Worlds connected and worlds apart: the houses and their doors</title>
<p>The doors of the houses at Vista Alegre played an important role in the construction of the social identities of the people who inhabited the <italic>estância</italic>. They allowed for the creation of spaces with different meanings in which body routines were developed according to the ranch dynamics and social roles. The meaning of these architectural doors is an entry point to understanding the meaning of personal doors. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359183512443613">Lang (1985</xref>: 204) suggests: ‘though a door can be seen purely as a physical object – the functional solution to transition – it also can be viewed as a new access and disclosure of the world.’</p>
<p>The disposition of the doors at certain points of the rancher’s house, the slave quarters and the barn suggests that certain directions were taken by the landowners, the free workers and the slaves when carrying out their daily activities in the core complex of the ranch. The various doors of the houses did not simply connect inside and outside, but also gave access to different worlds (see p. 205).</p>
<p>The back door of the rancher’s house linked the landowners to the slave quarters: approximately five steps were enough to connect these two worlds. The door in the west led to the barn, connecting the rancher’s family to the universe of the <italic>peões</italic>. The eastern door led to a group of trees that provided some shade as well as protection from passers-by. The front door connected the rancher’s family with an open world. It faced the road that led to other universes – other people, the town, other properties, etc. – and also gave access to an open view in which the green of the fields met the blue of the skies. This door opened up endless possibilities, if not physically, at least in people’s minds. It connected the rancher’s family to the anxiety of receiving guests for a party, mourners for a funeral, the doctor for a visit, the priest for a baptism.</p>
<p>From the outside, the doors of the rancher’s house also gave access to different universes – all of them private and virtually restricted to specific social categories. The back door, opposite the slave quarters, led into the kitchen, a female space. To the women it was, to a great extent, a place for work. The west door led to the office – a male place, linked to activities concerning cattle. It was a place for counting, reporting, calculating, receiving remuneration and doing business. The steps of this door connected the employees to the landowner’s universe. The east door was probably used only (or mainly) by the rancher’s family. It gave access to the protection and secrecy of the bedrooms.</p>
<p>The front door, higher than the other doors of the house, was used for the circulation of equals – people who were part of the landowner’s social group. It gave access to the rooms that were designated, for example, for private meetings and receiving the family’s guests. Steps legitimized an entrance to the building through this door and provided a certain level of formality to this part of the house.</p>
<p>For the inhabitants of the barn, this building may have acted as an extension of the fields and cattle-ranching activities. From the outside, the front doors gave access to the male world of the <italic>gaúcho</italic>. The east door, next to the water well and opposite the slave quarters and the kitchens (the <italic>senzala</italic>’s annexe and the main house’s kitchen), led to the room where <italic>charque</italic> was prepared. The doors on the back of the barn connected this building to the cattle enclosure and to a path that led to the open fields where the cattle roamed free. The front doors of the barn faced the rancher’s office and the road. The doors in the room containing the fireplace connected this part of the barn with both the front and back areas of the <italic>estância</italic>.</p>
<p>The two doors of the slave quarters, opposite the back of the rancher’s house, connected this building to the area where domestic activities took place, such as the water well, the kitchen of the rancher’s house and the area where <italic>charque</italic> would be produced. Its back door, if there was one, led to the vegetable garden.</p>

<title>Somatic spaces</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1359183512443613">Tilley (1994</xref>: 16) argues: ‘through time–space routines of movement a person knows where she or he is in relation to familiar places and objects and “how to go on” in the world.’ These routines of movement constitute the somatic space, ‘a space of habitual and unselfconscious action, of sensory experience and bodily movement’. While carrying out the tasks required by the daily life of the <italic>estância</italic>, people interacted with certain architectural spaces, which influenced the development of particular body routines and therefore the creation and reproduction of particular somatic spaces. Consequently, slaves, free workers and the landowner’s family may have developed different notions of self. These notions were linked to their experiences of the material forms of the <italic>estância</italic> and to the somatic spaces that originated from these experiences.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1359183512443613">Figure 12</xref> illustrates how different somatic spaces may have been created in connection with people’s roles in Vista Alegre. As shown in the diagram, the front of the rancher’s house, a non-productive space designated for the transit of the elite, allowed for more possibilities of movement. By contrast, the circulation of slaves between the <italic>senzala</italic> and the rancher’s house probably instantiated a highly restrictive somatic space: this area was restricted to the back of the main house and to the surroundings of the <italic>senzala</italic>, where the stove, water well, kitchen and vegetable garden were located. The physical routines performed by the domestic slaves in the rancher’s house were conditioned by the materiality of this building and the tasks they had to carry out inside, such as tidying up, sewing, cleaning, setting the table, cooking and serving food. The area where the domestic slaves worked thus can be interpreted as a subordinate space. If we consider the cattle-related activities carried out within the Vista Alegre domestic space, we can see that the physical daily routines of the <italic>peões</italic> were probably more flexible than those of the domestic slaves. The various doors connecting the barn’s interior and exterior areas allowed for a much higher corporeal mobility. The place used by the rancher for payments and administrative issues also suggested a particular routine: it was situated inside the rancher’s house, in an office to which direct access was possible through the door that faced the barn. The area where <italic>peões</italic> worked can therefore be considered an intermediate space.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this article, I have suggested a model for thinking through the world rather than a model of the world. Based on my bodily experience of the landscape of an <italic>estância</italic>, I tried to understand (as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359183512443613">Grange, 1985</xref>: 77) and interpret the society that was part of it. It was more than a matter of walking, observing and describing building materials. Even so, the subjectivity of this study was limited to and oriented by the physical sensations provoked by stimuli to the senses when in contact with the material forms of Vista Alegre. Subjectivity, therefore, was mediated by the objectiveness present in the physical contact of the body with the materiality of the <italic>estância</italic>. Being there, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1359183512443613">Tilley (1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1359183512443613">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1359183512443613">2008)</xref>, was a means I have used to grasp the dynamic landscape of the <italic>estâncias</italic> and to elaborate on some interpretations of the people who lived there; on the possibilities afforded or experienced by their bodies when interacting with that space.</p>
<p>It was not my aim to provide an interpretation of the ranch society according to my own subjective judgments of their comfort, happiness, sorrows or loneliness – I am aware that the groups involved in the context I have analysed would have had different understandings of these (a matter well discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359183512443613">Rapoport, 2002[1969]</xref>). Although I wanted to approach the formation of social identities through embodiment, it was not possible to reconstruct the landscapes of the mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359183512443613">Basso, 1996</xref>: 55) that were generated when people sensed the materiality of the <italic>estância</italic> in the 19th century. It was impossible to replicate their habitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359183512443613">Bourdieu, 1977</xref>). I also admit that the life of the inhabitants of Vista Alegre was not merely contemplative or guided by the idea of ‘experiencing the world as it is’, in the origin of the phenomena. I am very conscious of the limitations of my research but I am also aware that the perspective presented here can offer a richer, more complete understanding of people and things.</p>
<p>Understanding history through a phenomenological perspective has brought to attention information not available from written and archaeological sources alone. Reconstructing the sensory experiences of people in the <italic>estâncias</italic> has allowed me to understand how a productive landscape created different somatic spaces, transmitting a structure of feeling from one generation to another. This multisensory approach has provided an alternative to the abstract perspective commonly offered by studies of past societies, which tend to ignore the sensory dimension of human existence and, as a result, present history through disembodied accounts in which people’s lives are portrayed as mute, odourless, bland, deaf and with no tactile experiences – as if the past were bodiless.</p>
<p>Today, barns, slave quarters and ranchers’ houses represent their past as history and memory, as the ‘having-been-there of past people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1359183512443613">Thomas, 2007</xref>: 18). These houses constitute a dynamic landscape that at the same time evokes the past and makes sense of the present. Even though the society of Rio Grande do Sul has changed, incorporating new roles and types of relationships, people in this state still know the ‘right’ place that ranchers, slaves and <italic>peões</italic> occupied in an <italic>estância</italic> and are able to point out the houses where these people lived. Knowing how this ‘rightness’ may have concretely affected the way people experienced flavours, odours, colours, textures and sounds is a way of interpreting history, people and things through a more humanized approach. It is a form of reassessing the past and, more importantly, of re-evaluating the present.</p>
