<title>Objective:</title>
<p>An RU486-inducible recombinant adenovirus-Nrf2 construct (Ad-RUNrf2) was constructed and expressed in H460 cells to determine whether <italic>Nrf2</italic> gene expression can be regulated and to observe the effect of the adenovirus Ad-RUNrf2 on inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and apoptotic factors that mediate paraquat (PQ)-induced A549 cell injury.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The <italic>Nrf2</italic> gene within the RU486 (mifepristone)-inducible system was introduced into an adenovirus vector. A549 cells were transfected with Ad-RUNrf2, and <italic>Nrf2</italic> expression was detected using Western blotting and real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RT-PCR, Western blots and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used for observing the effect of RU486-induced <italic>Nrf2</italic> expression on the inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)), oxidative stress factors (catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA)) and apoptosis factors (caspase-3, caspase-9 and cytochrome C) that mediated PQ-induced A549 cell injury.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results:</title>
<p>After infection of H460 cells by Ad-RUNrf2, RT-PCR and Western blot analyses showed that <italic>Nrf2</italic> expression increased with additional RU486 doses. IL-6 and TNF-α protein and gene expression levels were significantly reduced, and IL-10 protein levels were significantly increased. Although IL-10 expression increased, it remained significantly lower than that of noninduced adenovirus infection and the simple virus exposure group. RU486 induced a significant reduction in MDA expression and increased CAT protein levels. Caspase-9 and caspase-3 protein and gene expression levels decreased in the RU486 induction group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Cytochrome C protein levels were not significantly reduced, but its gene expression was significantly decreased (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Ad-RUNrf2 adenovirus was successfully constructed and can be stably expressed and regulated in cells. Ad-RUNrf2 can reduce PQ-induced inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis in A549 cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Paraquat (PQ) is a quaternary ammonium bipyridyl compound (1,1′-dimethyl-4, 4′-bipyridylium dichloride), which is a fastacting, nonselective compound that destroys tissues of green plants on contact and by translocation within the plant. The mechanism of PQ poisoning remains unclear but is often associated with increased oxidative stress and activation of inflammatory and immune responses. Our previous research has found that inflammation and oxidation play important roles in PQ-induced lung injury. Although studies found that antioxidants can reduce the toxic effects of PQ,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0960327112450902">1</xref>
</sup> their efficacy is not ideal. Nrf2 can bind with the antioxidant response element (ARE) in oxidative stress and plays an important role in the regulation of liver phase I and phase II detoxification enzymes.<sup>

</sup> We speculate that if intracellular <italic>Nrf2</italic> gene expression can be increased and maintained at a certain level, the generation of endogenous antioxidants, such as CAT and superoxide dismutase (SOD), may be improved to enhance cellular antioxidant capacity, thereby reducing or treating lung injury induced by PQ.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>We inserted the <italic>Nrf2</italic> gene into an adenovirus vector and regulated its expression with an RU486 (mifepristone)-inducible system in order to prevent potential adverse effects due to continued activation and overexpression of the gene.<sup>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Nrf2 is key factor in regulating the expression of antioxidants. Nrf2 separates from Keap1 under oxidative stress and translocates to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, Nrf2 forms heterodimers with a small Maf protein, and these heterodimers bind to AREs, thus activating a variety of antioxidant and detoxification enzymes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0960327112450902">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0960327112450902">10</xref>
</sup> In addition, Nrf2 plays an antiapoptotic role by inhibiting the Fas pathway.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0960327112450902">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0960327112450902">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0960327112450902">12</xref>
</sup> We speculated that cells infected with an adenovirus carrying an inducible <italic>Nrf2</italic> gene would have an increase in expression of antioxidant and detoxification enzymes, thus enhancing resistance to PQ-induced oxidative stress. To enhance Nrf2 activity in cells but avoid excessive activation of Nrf2, the <italic>Nrf2</italic> gene under the control of an RU486 (mifepristone)-inducible system was introduced in an adenovirus vector to achieve the regulation of <italic>Nrf2</italic> gene expression and protein activity.</p>
<p>The RU486 system is an inducible expression system used in mammalian cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0960327112450902">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0960327112450902"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0960327112450902">15</xref>
</sup> Its activation and expression levels depend on the concentration of RU486 used for induction. Within a certain range, target gene expression is proportional to the RU486 dose. The security of the system is due to the absence of the GAL4 in mammalian cells, so RU486 cannot activate any endogenous genes. Additionally, the amount of RU486 required to activate the system is very low, approximately 1000 times lower than the dose used for abortion (10 mg/kg).</p>
<p>In this experiment, we successfully constructed an RU486-inducible <italic>Nrf2</italic> gene expression system using an adenovirus vector. LUC and Dsred were used for the verification of the RU486 regulation system. The results showed that the Renilla luciferase (RLUC) red firefly luciferase enzyme and red fluorescent expression was low in the absence of RU486. As the RU486 dose gradually increased, either firefly luciferase enzyme or red fluorescent increased, suggesting that the RU486 regulation system was stable and that the expression was dependent on the concentration of RU486. In addition, RT-PCR and Western blots showed that the expression of Nrf2 peaked after 24 h of RU486 induction. The expression value of Nrf2 decreased over time and depended on the amount of RU486 used for induction, which is consistent with previous reports.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0960327112450902">15</xref>
</sup> Therefore, <italic>Nrf2</italic> gene and protein concentration were RU486 dose- and time-dependent within the RU486 regulation system.</p>
<p>PQ can produce a large number of free radicals and upsets the intracellular oxidative/antioxidant balance, injuring cells and tissues directly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0960327112450902">

</sup> PQ poisoning caused oxidative stress increases and activation of inflammatory and immune responses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0960327112450902">18</xref>
</sup> Matters and Scandalios found PQ treatments resulting in a 40% increase in superoxide dismutase activity and catalase activity. Then Komada et al found a protective effect of transfection with SOD genes against extracellular superoxide anion-induced cytotoxicity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0960327112450902">19</xref>
</sup> In addition, Some research found that PQ can increase the incidences of Parkinson's disease. The Nrf2/Trx axis as a new target to block these pathways and protect from oxidant exposure such as that found in Parkinson.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0960327112450902">20</xref>
</sup> A literature review revealed that A549 cells are similar to alveolar type II cells in terms of cell specificity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0960327112450902">21</xref>
</sup> Alveolar type II epithelial cells can uptake PQ actively through amine channels.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0960327112450902">22</xref>
</sup> Alveolar type II epithelial cells are one of the main targets of PQ poisoning, and their severe injury is a main cause of alveolar hemorrhage, edema and hypoxemia. Therefore, we studied A549 cells and observed cellular injury induced by PQ after Ad-RUNrf2 adenovirus infection and Nrf2 induction. Examination of inflammatory cytokine protein and gene expression levels found that IL-6 and TNF-α gene and protein expression is the lowest during RU486 induction, while anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 showed the opposite trend and increased after RU486 induction of Nrf2. Therefore, Nrf2 induction balanced the expression of anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, we concluded that A549 cells with Ad-RUNrf2-mediated <italic>Nrf2</italic> gene expression were resistant to the PQ-induced inflammatory response, which is consistent with the view that Nrf2 and ARE play an important role in immune and inflammatory pathways.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0960327112450902">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0960327112450902">23</xref>
</sup> Although SOD protein concentrations were not detected, the significant increase in CAT expression and decrease in MDA expression suggest that Ad-RUNrf2 can reduce the oxidative stress induced by PQ. A549 apoptotic factors (caspase-3, caspase-9 and cytochrome C) were reduced when Nrf2 expression was induced, suggesting that <italic>Nrf2</italic> expression plays a significant role in reducing A549 apoptosis. These results provide technical support and a theoretical basis for further animal experiments.</p>
