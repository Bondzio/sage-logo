<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the mid-1980s, the curtain was raised on reforms in old-age insurance in China. For more than 2 decades, there has been remarkable progress in such reforms. However, China is a huge and populous country with a long-term binary economic structure and imbalanced regional economic development. During the transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy, the China’s old-age insurance system has faced significant difficulties, the biggest of which is a huge deficit in pension funds. “Old-age insurance is the most important system arrangement of social security system, the success of old-age insurance even decides the success of social security system.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886368712440489">1</xref></sup> Therefore, the scale of the pension fund deficit, the government funding measures and the resulting impact have become a focus issue. This article provides a detailed analysis and research on the issues mentioned above.</p>

<sec id="section2-0886368712440489">
<title>The Formation and Size of the Pension Fund Deficit</title>
<p>What is the scale of the pension fund gap in China? In 2005, the former secretary of the Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MOLSS),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886368712440489">1</xref></sup> in an interview with a reporter of <italic>Beijing Time</italic>, acknowledged that the deficit was up to RMB (Renminbi) 2,500 billion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0886368712440489">2</xref></sup> In the same time frame, the Social Security Institute of the College of Public Administration of Renmin University of China released a different estimate—RMB 8,000 billion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0886368712440489">3</xref></sup> However, according to a report published by the World Bank in 2005, the fund gap was projected to grow from 2001 to 2075 by as much as RMB 9,150 billion. These different estimates result from different calculation assumptions. Because of factors such as population aging and life expectancy, investment risk and an imperfect management system, it is impossible to measure the exact scale of China’s pension fund deficit. But the fact is that the gap is huge.</p>
<sec id="section3-0886368712440489">
<title>Failure to Liquidate the Transition Cost</title>
<p>In 1986, China began to reform the traditional old-age insurance system. For employees under the labor contract system, old-age insurance was based on a social pooling model. This means that both enterprises and employees were expected to contribute a specified ratio based on pay-as-you-go (PAYG) terms. The main purpose of the reform was to reduce and balance the heavy burden on businesses and to attempt to introduce an individual contribution mechanism. In 1993, the reform of social pooling was combined with individual accounts. Also at this time, the government started to explore approaches to reform. During this period of exploration, the management of social pooling and individual accounts was combined.</p>
<p>In July 1997, the State Council issued the “Decision on Establishment a Unified Basic Old-Age Insurance System for Enterprises Employees” (Paper No. 26), detailing the establishment of a social pooling system for the basic old-age insurance fund at the provincial level along with the implementation of social-pooling-plus-individual-accounts schemes. The PAYG model was applied to the social pooling accounts, whereas the funded model was applied to individual accounts.</p>
<p>Under Paper No. 26, urban employees were divided into three groups to make a smooth transition from the former PAYG system to the new system. The people who had already retired in 1997 were called “old men”, those who were still working in 1997 were called “middle men”, and the people who joined after 1997 were categorized as “new men”.</p>
<p>For the “old men”, their pension benefit is totally paid from social pooling funds. For the “middle men”, they receive a basic pension income, plus a transition pension (the career years times a certain coefficient) and the accumulation of individual accounts. For the “new men”, their benefit level is based on the new scheme. The pension expenditure for the “old men” and “middle men” (except the accumulation of individual accounts) was referred to as the “transition cost” which to date has not been liquidated by the government. However, in 1995, the State Council permitted the local government to use the funds in individual accounts to pay pensions, which led to the emptying of individual accounts. Since 1997, the deficit in empty accounts has ballooned each year (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886368712440489">Table 1</xref>). The key factor contributing to the creation of empty accounts is the acknowledgment of the transition cost at the time of the reform.</p>

<title>Default Contribution and Early Retirement</title>
<p>The coverage of China’s old-age insurance system mainly focuses on the employees from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and collective-owned enterprises (COEs). But during the period from 1995 to 2004, the restructuring of SOEs and COEs resulted in serious unemployment. In 1994, SOEs and COEs accounted for 149 million and 110 million employees, respectively, which was the peak since the formation of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). However, the number of employees fell sharply to 106 million and 64 million in 2004, respectively. That is to say, nearly 89 million employees were laid off during the 10 years. This means that during the period, the number of employees of SOEs decreased by one third, whereas that of COEs reduced by two fifths. The unemployment risk was rapidly transferred to the old-age insurance system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0886368712440489">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>On one hand, some enterprises and employees facing financial problems could not afford the insurance premiums or just underpaid the contribution. Some enterprises even reduced the total payroll and the number of actual employees so as to avoid having to contribute. All this led to a huge loss in the collection and payment of insurance premiums in the social-pooling-plus-individual-accounts scheme. The data show that it was only in 2000 that the loss of funds in basic old-age insurance reached RMB 30 billion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0886368712440489">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, at that time, the central government issued some papers about early retirement. Certain employees can retire before the legal retirement age (which is 60 for males, 55 for female cadres and 50 for female employees) on account of sickness, because of injury on the job and in certain trades. Employees of the bankrupt SOEs can retire 5 years ahead of the legal retirement age. The local government regarded early retirement as an effective measure to downsize for efficiency, therefore early retirement, both legal and illegal, became a common phenomenon. According to the calculations made by the MOLSS, if 1 million employees retired 5 years earlier than the normal retirement age, the cost of the extended years of pension payment and the reduction of pension contributions would bring a fluctuation as enormous as RMB 34 billion to the accumulation of pension funds.</p>

<title>The Irreversible Impact of the Aging Population</title>
<p>China has the largest population in the world. The fifth national demographic census in 2000 revealed that the population above 60 and 65 years exceeded 10% and 7% of the total population, respectively. By the end of April 2011, according to the sixth national demographic census, the number of people older than 60 and 65 years had increased to 13.3% and 8.9% of the total population, respectively. Population aging is very evident in China. Naturally, as the population ages, the demand for old-age benefits increases.</p>
<p>One notable problem is that among the people covered by old-age insurance, the number of individuals contributing to the system is significantly less than the number of retirees. Since 2001, the average annual increase in individuals contributing has been 4.0%, whereas that of retirees was 6.6%.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0886368712440489">6</xref></sup> The rapid increase in the demand for pension benefits coincides with the current limited aggregate value of the fund. The funds available are not adequate to meet the real demand, which will surely cause a crisis in pension payments and a huge deficit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0886368712440489">
<title>The Benefit Guideline and Government’s Funding Measures</title>
<p>The old-age insurance system is an element of macro social policy in China. To guarantee normal operation of the system, the central government issued a guideline of “two guarantees”: One ensures the payment of pension benefits on time and in full, and the second ensures the payment of basic living benefit for laid-off employees on time and in full. In the last 10 years, with the rapid expansion of the national economy, the development and building of a harmonious society has become the basic governing principle in China. Because of the emerging crisis in the implementation of the old-age insurance system, the Chinese government has adopted a series of feasible measures to cope with the future challenge of sustainability and adequacy of pension payment.</p>
<sec id="section7-0886368712440489">
<title>Creation of the National Social Security Fund</title>
<p>The National Social Security Fund (NSSF) is a strategic reserve fund held by the central government, established in 2000 and managed by the National Council for Social Security Fund (NCSFF). NSSF aims to be a solution to the problem of supporting future social security expenditures and other social security needs for the aging population. The funding sources of the NSSF are as follows: (a) budget allocation by the central government, (b) allocation from the lottery public welfare fund, (c) capital derived from reduction or transfer of state-owned shares, (d) capital raised in other ways with approval of the State Council, (f) investment proceeds from equity assets. From 2000 to 2010, the amount allocated by the central government amounted to RMB 443.7 billion, which was the main funding source of NSFF (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886368712440489">Table 2</xref>). After 2005, other channels became more important funding sources. Since 2001, NSFF has invested a portion of the fund. By the end of 2010, the total assets came to RMB 856.69 billion. Of the total, the amount of investment proceeds was RMB 277.26 billion, with an average annual rate of return on investment of 9.17%.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0886368712440489">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>Pilot Reforms to Fund Individual Accounts</title>
<p>In 2001, the Chinese government began to implement the pilot reform for funding individual accounts in Liaoning province (which has a traditional heavy industry base). Later in 2004, the pilot was extended to Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces. In September 2006, the State Council chose several areas<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886368712440489">1</xref></sup> to implement the pilot reform in line with the practice of the three northeastern provinces. In 2008, Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces started the pilot reform depending on their own funds. By the end of 2009, therefore, 13 provinces and cities had implemented the pilot reform.</p>
<p>The fundamental issue in funding individual accounts is allocating funds in the government’s budget. The basic policy in the pilot reform in Liaoning province was that 8% of the employee contribution was designated to individual accounts, while the central government provided supplemental funding (from 2001 to 2006, RMB 1.4 billion was added every year). In Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces, 5% of the employee contribution was designated to individual accounts; the fund was augmented in the central and local budgets by 3.75% and 1.25%, respectively. In 2006, according to the ratification of the State Council, in the new round of reforms, the central budget supplemented the fund in the central and western areas, while the more heavily developed east coast areas, such as Shanghai city, funded individual accounts from the local government budgets.</p>
<p>During this period, the Chinese government released a series of papers to regulate and optimize the management of individual accounts and to separate the management of social pooling accounts and individual accounts. The traditional mixed-management method set up the social-pooling-plus-individual-accounts model in name only; the PAYG model was still continued in practice. However, the pilot reform focused on establishing a finance-sharing mechanism among different governments, enterprises and individuals to clarify management duties and to promote the transition from PAYG to a partially funded system. With the extension of the pilot reform, the aggregate in individual accounts is growing larger and larger. In Liaoning province, as an example, from 2001 to 2006 the funds in individual accounts reached RMB 28.2 billion. By the end of 2010, the total funds in individual accounts amounted to RMB 203.9 billion in the 13 provinces and cities.</p>

<sec id="section9-0886368712440489">
<title>Increased Financial Assistance to Basic Old-Age Insurance</title>
<p>In the mid- to late 1990s, because of the complexity of the reform and the government’s limited budget, expenditure for old-age insurance from the national budget was absent. Although modest funds were allocated, they were only used to accomplish the compromise made to the public by means of final financial guarantee (such as two guarantees). Since 2001, the model and structure of China’s central budget have been modified, and the social security subsidy is included in the budget.</p>
<p>The outline of China’s Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2005-2010) clearly stated that the funding of social security benefits should be increased to elevate the pooling level of basic old-age insurance. The intention is to support the reform of basic old-age insurance and to attach more importance to the cause of social security. Government’s goal is now to build a social security system matching with the level of economic development. Since the start of the new century, the subsidy to basic old-age insurance from the central and local governments has increased steadily.

<title>Policy Implications and Evaluation</title>
<p>The reform of the old-age insurance system in China has introduced several innovations in practice. The design of the social-pooling-plus-individual-accounts model in the basic old-age insurance system is very unique. Although there were initial difficulties, the system is now exhibiting stable development through government’s ceaseless efforts. In the beginning, the system only covered employees in SOEs and COEs in cities, but in 1999 coverage was extended to employees of foreign-funded enterprises (see the box below), private companies and other companies in cities. Moreover, provinces (autonomous regions) and municipalities have the right to extend the coverage to the self-employed. In 2002, flexible employees in cities were included, a further extension of coverage. At the same time, the rolling balance of basic old-age insurance is increasing year after year.

<p>Legal Provisions Applied to Foreign-Funded Enterprises</p>
<p>In China, the Social Insurance Law of the People’s Republic of China and Interim Measures for the Participation in Social Insurance of Foreigners Employed in China was implemented in 2011.* According to the provisions, foreign-funded enterprises must carry out social insurance registration with local social insurance agencies to participate in social insurance (including old-age insurance, health insurance, unemployment insurance, working accident insurance and maternity insurance), which should be clearly stated in the employment contracts.</p>
<p>If the enterprise fails to make the registration, it will be ordered to make corrections within a time limit by the social insurance administrative department. If the corrections are not made within the time limit, a 100% to 300% fine will be imposed on the enterprise and the person in charge with direct responsibility or other personnel with direct responsibility will also be fined.</p>
<p>Both Chinese employees and foreign employees must be covered by the social insurance system. The enterprises are expected to make a payroll contribution to all the various social insurance schemes for employees, while the employees are supposed to make their own contribution.</p>
<p>If the enterprises fail to pay the social insurance premiums on time and in full, the collection agencies will issue an order to pay up or makeup the deficit within a prescribed time limit. Apart from that, a late-payment fine of 0.05% per day, counting from the date when the amount became overdue, should be paid. If the payment is not made within the time limit, a 100% to 300% fine will be imposed by the administrative departments.</p>
<p>Moreover, collection agencies have the right to inquire of banks and other financial institutions about the enterprises’ financial accounts. After applying to related administrative departments for a premium allocation decision, the collection agencies will inform the bank and other financial institutions with a written notice to withhold the social insurance premiums. If the account balance is not enough to pay the premiums, the collection agencies will require the enterprises to offer a guarantee and sign a delayed-payment agreement.</p>

<p>The reform of the social security program should guarantee all people the basic necessities of life and the right to share the fruits of economic development. It is under this principle that the Chinese government has made a number of arrangements to adjust the basic pension of retirees from enterprises to a higher level based on salary and increases in the cost of living. From 2004 to 2010, the monthly basic pension for retirees has increased from more than RMB 700 to more than RMB 1,300.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0886368712440489">8</xref></sup> The report on the work of the government for the Year 2011 pointed out that there was an average 10% increase per year over the past 7 years in the basic pension for enterprise retirees.</p>
<p>After more than 10 years of effort, the reform of the basic old-age insurance system, with its social-pooling-plus-individual-accounts model, has achieved some progress, with universal satisfaction. Between 2004 and 2005, the American scholar Mark Frazier collaborated with academic institutions and a commercial research firm to conduct a series of social surveys that concluded that Chinese people have confidence in the future of the old-age insurance system on the whole.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0886368712440489">9</xref></sup> As for the liquidation of the pension fund deficit, their analysis concluded that, on the basis of the current system and the continued rapid growth of the economy, the Chinese government has the ability to close the gap within 40 to 50 years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0886368712440489">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The conclusion reached by Professor Zheng-Gongcheng from Renming University is that China’s old-age insurance system, based on the social-pooling-plus-individual-accounts model, is sound. Although this model still needs further revision and improvement, as far as the framework and related factors of the system are concerned, when compared with other countries, the financial crisis caused by population aging in developed countries would not occur in China for a long time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0886368712440489">11</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Obviously, China will be confronted with continuing challenges in the future as its population ages—for example, improving the basic old-age insurance system with the social-pooling-plus-individual-accounts model, funding all individual accounts, finding ways to fund the transition cost, balancing urban and rural development, covering all people who should be covered and ensuring that pension funds are adequate. The National Development and Reform Commission laid out the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011-2015), which put forward that a social security system covering all urban and rural areas should be established and improved on. The goal of improving the implementation of the old-age insurance system for urban employees and residents, and realizing the national pooling of basic pension funds was specifically addressed. With the gradual completion of the reform tasks, it is believed that the Chinese government has the ability to finally cope with the challenge of its aging population.</p>
