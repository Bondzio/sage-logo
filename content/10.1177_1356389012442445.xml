<abstract>
<p>Jointly conducted with a coalition of HIV/AIDS community-based organizations (CBOs), this evaluability assessment sought to better understand the factors that affect the feasibility of a participatory program evaluation to be undertaken in partnership with the CBOs’ non-governmental-organization members and public-health agencies. Participatory evaluations and partnerships are grounded in social and institutional authority structures that unavoidably influence researchers and evaluators. The construction of a theoretical framework for socio-political evaluability assessment of participatory evaluations is a necessary precondition for the coalition’s members to engage effectively in evaluation research with other partners.</p>

<sec id="section2-1356389012442445">
<title>Socio-political analysis prior to participatory evaluation</title>
<p>Participatory evaluation seeks to bring together multiple actors from different organizations and diverse points of view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356389012442445">Cousins and Whitmore, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356389012442445">Guba and Lincoln, 1989</xref>). Its aim is to ensure program appropriateness and accountability to community groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356389012442445">Springett, 2001</xref>). Participatory evaluation can be pluralist, practical and even emancipatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356389012442445">Ridde, 2006</xref>). The methodology can foster a learning environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356389012442445">Suarez-Herrera et al., 2009</xref>). Nonetheless, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356389012442445">House and Howe’s (1999)</xref> critique remains relevant: power relations among the stakeholders may jeopardize the inclusion of all values in a deliberative process. Not all the voices brought together in the participatory process are always able to be heard and to orient actions through the technical process of democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356389012442445">Plottu and Plottu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356389012442445">Wendhausen, 2002</xref>). Moreover, the traditional use of consultations as a democratic process for decision making can be a participatory device with the potential to favour those who have formal decision-making power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356389012442445">Burton, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In public-health programs that require partnerships between the State and civil society organizations (CSOs), the evaluation process is often characterized by diverging perspective vis-a-vis the requirement of evaluation. This is true even when evaluation is conducted with a participatory perspective. Typically, State agencies conceive program evaluations as an exercise with the potential to improve programs and subsequently population health while community organizations tend to perceive it as a nuisance that interferes with action. When confronted with such opposite and diverging options, Friedberg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356389012442445">1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356389012442445">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356389012442445">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356389012442445">2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356389012442445">2005b</xref>) argues that sociology cannot provide solutions: it defines the problem.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1356389012442445">
<title>Theoretical perspective</title>
<p>In Friedberg’s sociology of organization, organized action can be analyzed according to three dimensions. One dimension is the <italic>will</italic> or <italic>managerial discourse.</italic> It represents the ideal organization, the strategic direction and the project that orients decisions and actions. Another dimension is made up of <italic>formal</italic> or <italic>apparent</italic> structures representing the materiality and objective features of an organization, such as organizational charts, buildings, and so on. The third dimension consists of deep or <italic>informal structures</italic> produced by social interactions. They represent the human side of the enterprise and the organization’s real structure. The deep structures are difficult to appraise because they are not formalized in official discourse and written documentation. They remain in a State of ‘opacity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356389012442445">March, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356389012442445">2004b</xref>) that Friedberg calls ‘clandestine management.’ Few studies have explored this third dimension with community-based organizations. The present study, jointly conducted with CBOs, seeks to make those structures apparent in participatory program evaluations and to propose a theoretical framework for a socio-political evaluability assessment.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356389012442445">Friedberg (1997)</xref> views organizations as concrete systems made up of relatively autonomous actors linked by strategic inter-dependences and who maintain cooperative relations. He conceptualizes power relations as the potential influence that organizations can have in the negotiations and the formalization of rules. In this view, the relationship among the three dimensions presents two faces of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356389012442445">Friedberg, 2005</xref>a): prescription and practice. The prescriptive side consists of the rule makers who, through a formal set of rules, dictate ‘what must be.’ The second facet is found in the deep and informal structures of praxis or social-actor practices. Social actors base their actions on the opportunities and constraints encountered in apparent structures, which are contaminated by the logic of deep structures. The three dimensions are always present in all levels of the organization; however, each dimension is relatively autonomous and develops at its own pace and with its own logic.</p>
<p>In this article, we argue that an exploration of the interplays between these three dimensions of organized action is beneficial to participatory evaluation. In line with the ‘expansion’ of the concept of evaluability assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356389012442445">Beaudry and Gauthier, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356389012442445">Leviton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356389012442445">Meeres et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1356389012442445">Mercer and Goel, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356389012442445">Thurston and Potvin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356389012442445">Thurston et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1356389012442445">Wholey, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356389012442445">Wholey et al., 1994</xref>), we analyze <italic>socio-political evaluability assessment</italic> as a necessary component of the pre-evaluation process. We began our work using Friedberg’s theory of organization and then developed it through an examination of the first author’s fieldwork within the framework of a participatory evaluative research project. Taking conceptual guidance from Friedberg’s views on formal and informal organizational structures, we articulated our conceptualization through the examination of the inter-organizational partnership relations between State-run public-health agencies and civil society.</p>

<title>The context of a coalition</title>
<p>In Canada, with the rise of partnerships between the State and civil society within the network of federal and provincial public services, CBOs have expressed a desire to actively participate in defining evaluation requirements that are associated with the funding programs that provide them with resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356389012442445">ARPEOC, 2005</xref>). The program related to this study was the AIDS Community Action Program (ACAP), a federal program based on partnership with community organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356389012442445">Public Health Agency of Canada, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356389012442445">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356389012442445">2009</xref>). An intentional sample was made up of the 37 diversified groups related to the Coalition of community organizations against AIDS in Quebec, Canada (COCQ-sida).</p>
<p>The members of the Coalition have a long record of participatory evaluation that dates back to the early 1990s (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356389012442445">Jalbert et al., 1997</xref>). The first HIV/AIDS CBO evaluation tools were developed with a view to situating evaluation as a part of the collective action. These tools included assessments from diverse actors directly involved in HIV/AIDS community actions. The ‘Shared Appreciation Group’ – a term coined by a community member – was proposed as a way to give voice to CBOs. Each group of actors in a CBO is invited to express its point of view regarding the CBO’s mission and collective actions. These groups are typically: board members, staff, users, volunteers and partners. This initial work resulted in <italic>Epsilon. A Self-Evaluation Guide for Community Organizations</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356389012442445">Jalbert et al., 1997</xref>), published in French and English. A second guide specifically designed for staff and volunteers followed the first initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356389012442445">Zúñiga and Luly, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Within this context, we define socio-political evaluability assessment as an analysis of the conditions involved in participatory evaluation processes. Evaluation is more than merely applying preconceived data-collection methods and an interpretive canvas. Given that participatory research has incorporated a public-health context of alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356389012442445">Mantoura et al., 2007</xref>), it <italic>ipso facto</italic> incorporates structural and power relations (positions, action capacities, social constraints) that both interfere with and are relevant to the analysis.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Between 2004 and 2007, the first author conducted volunteer work that led her to participate in: (a) the Provincial Coalition General Assemblies; (b) the collective construction of evaluative tools for interventions with members of CBOs; (c) a networking meeting of knowledge sharing expertise with regional HIV/AIDS CBOs and national public-health agents; (d) informative workshops and training about the HIV/AIDS Coalition community evaluation guide; (e) collaborative self- evaluation activities with the Coalition based on the Community Evaluation Guide with another coalition of groups working with young peer educators; (f) volunteer activities with people living with AIDS; and (g) provincial HIV/AIDS academic conferences.</p>
<p>The evaluative research project began with an attempt to understand the logic of their inter-relationships and then their relationships with the public-health agencies, which act largely as funding bodies. Four sources of information were mobilized in a continuum between direct action and intellectual organization:</p>
<list id="list1-1356389012442445" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>a critical review of the literature;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>collective discussions with actors involved in the community organizations as a device for reflexive practice;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>direct participation in developing and testing evaluation tools; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>volunteer work in collective social-support action and supporting CBOs users.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The formal research and participatory insertions in five HIV/AIDS CBO members of the Coalition comprised over 500 hours, which included more than 400 hours of volunteer participation and more than 100 hours of participatory observation. There were 105 visits linked to volunteer participation and 29 visits linked to other activities. Activities were undertaken with five Coalition member CBOs in urban, semi-urban, urban-rural, and metropolitan regions. The research protocol included 13 group interviews with a total of 47 participants.</p>
<p>The group interviews focused both on the HIV/AIDS CBOs’ activities with people living with HIV/AIDS and the possible ways of evaluating their activities at the local level and bridging the distance between funding sources, the requirements of abstract models of evaluation, and the real operating conditions of community groups. The coalition tool ‘Strategic Analysis of Strengths and Weaknesses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356389012442445">Zúñiga and Luly, 2005</xref>) was used to explore the reconstruction of the community group’s history (experiences, competencies, routines, fieldwork) in order to visualize the ‘project’ as a realistic projection into the future. It looked at internal relationships (organizational dynamics, atmosphere of cooperation, administrative control, forms of participation, etc.) and external relationships (interpersonal dynamics, information, contacts, alliances, network, etc.).</p>
<p>The data reduction, display and conclusion drawing/verification overlapped during the data collection to make up the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356389012442445">Miles and Huberman, 1994</xref>: 11–12). The fieldwork took place in the daily life of HIV/AIDS CBOs. The results from direct observation were gathered in an auto-ethnographic journal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356389012442445">Ellis and Bochner, 2003</xref>). It embedded the role evaluator/researcher in a cooperative relationship with the Coalition, the CBOs and people living with AIDS. Continued presence in the field as a volunteer allowed the early presentation of results to the coalition groups’ member participants. They were asked to read the notes, comment on the analysis, and suggest further interpretations. They decided which results should be made available in the general coalition assemblies and publications. The group interviews raised a number of factors: (a) the relative autonomy of the decision-making process; (b) recognition of different levels of participation in negotiating objectives and conditions of success; (c) the impact of inequalities on evaluation outcomes; (d) the cultural diversity of inter-organizational partnership settings; and (e) the presence of internal colonization. Other publications detail these conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356389012442445">Laperrière, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356389012442445">2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>Guided by the prolonged volunteer engagement and proximity, the first author drafted an early version of the theoretical framework. She constructed the framework’s ‘assemblage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356389012442445">Latour, 2005</xref>) out of conversations, individual and collective discussions with coordinators and meetings with people living with HIV and permanent members of the Coalition. She inductively conceptualized the pattern of relationships among the actors involved. Based on French theories of sociology of organization, it was gradually modified and remodelled as the fieldwork progressed. The meanings that emerged from the data, both from observations and group interviews, were tested for their plausibility and their verifiability during the frequent exchanges with HIV/AIDS community groups and the Coalition’s coordinating body. The final version was completed after the research immersion.</p>

<title>Social relations of visible and invisibles structures: Direct and indirect influence</title>
<p>In 2003, initial exchanges with the Coalition network highlighted that members needed a better understanding of the status and relationships of all members, as members were variously directly and indirectly involved in the community group’s social action. This was exemplified by the following verbal comment in one General Assembly Meeting: ‘We cannot talk freely; we have spies among us.’</p>
<p>Some CBO members commented that tensions were becoming apparent among various groups of actors involved in HIV/AIDS interventions, for the most part between public-health agencies (State) and CBOs (civil society). The tensions were commonly understood as the consequences of the divergent expectations held by the State and the civil society representatives. These tensions emerged when they tried to agree an evaluation process that would involve participation and partnership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356389012442445">Zúñiga and Luly, 2005</xref>). It appeared that these groups had discrepant ways of defining evaluation:</p>
<list id="list2-1356389012442445" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Representatives of funding agencies valued the assessment of the achievement of formal objectives stemming from contractual relationships;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Representatives of community organizations valued both the urgency of trying to respond to the assessed needs of users, and program actors who related the program objectives to the contextual conditions.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Direct participation had an impact on the development of the Coalition community-based evaluation guide (2004–5), as follows. The Coalition and its members expressed concerns about evaluations that were undertaken by public-health agencies. The daily pragmatic activities of program actors and volunteers to meet user needs often went unnoticed by national program evaluations. Community efforts were often seen as redirecting energy toward other needs rather than meeting the explicit and agreed-upon objectives of the national program to deliver services to HIV-infected people. Community actors, however, felt that they had to work beyond the mandate for which the funds had been allotted. An ‘experimental mode’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356389012442445">Laperrière, 2009b</xref>) was perceived as hindering their capacity to work with the unpredictability and uncertainty of daily interventions for people living with HIV.</p>
<p>Discussions within groups revealed the need for a collective understanding of the social and political structures, before undertaking participatory evaluation. Two research questions were presented at the Coalition’s annual general meeting in March 2005 and reformulated on the basis of discussions with the HIV/AIDS CBOs involved in the research:</p>
<list id="list3-1356389012442445" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(1) How do social factors influence the feasibility (evaluability assessment) of the evaluation (which is anticipated by the public-health program and to be undertaken in partnership with community organizations)?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(2) How does the relative autonomy of high-level decision makers impact:</p></list-item>
</list>
<list id="list4-1356389012442445" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>their participation in negotiating the objectives and conditions of success,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>inequalities in implementation strategies, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the cultural diversity of local and micro-local settings?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In order to explore these questions, the research goal was reframed as an analysis of the formal and informal inter-organizational structures in the establishment of partnership and decision making regarding evaluation. Based on an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356389012442445">Laperrière and Zúñiga, 2006</xref>), the starting point was therefore the need to identify the actors involved (users, staff, administrators, public-health agents, coalition, others) and to make visible the power relations and vertical control influences in their relations.</p>
<p>An initial model, made up of four features related to the actors involved in the participatory evaluation process, started to emerge. The four features were:</p>
<list id="list5-1356389012442445" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the actors’ identity with regard to the program;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>their relative positions of domination (power and control over the actions of others) or complicity with other actors;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>how power was exercised (physical and symbolic violence, direct or indirect influence, whether vertical relations encompassed more or less areas of control than entailed by hierarchical control) and attendant processes of <underline>imposed socializations</underline>;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the response to those <underline>imposed socializations</underline>.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Through group interviews with the CBOs’ participants, we discovered that the reality of the relationships was much more complex than the expected, formal structure, which is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356389012442445">Figure 1a</xref>. The national public-health program is conceived as a ‘social totality’ whereby the same or very similar actions take place in all the relevant CBOs (targeting users with HIV/AIDS and people at risk). This view of things implies a linear program transfer, which is in contradiction with the local actors’ expectations of continuous and more egalitarian exchanges with public-health agencies.</p>

</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356389012442445">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the distance between the ‘ideal perception’ of social relations and a more realistic one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356389012442445">Figure 1b</xref>). In the logical frameworks of the national program, deep, informal relations are relegated to an anecdotal status. Doing so creates an impression of order and subsumes complex specificities within the idea of homogeneity. This impression enhances the belief of the equality of all the organizations in a partnership (CBOs, Coalition, and public-health agencies).</p>
<p>Thus, idealistic representations camouflage ‘deeper issues’ in order to avoid the inclusion of indirect and messier relations of informal influence. These relations could be out of step with official policy discourses of harmony and homogeneity. The public discourse obscures the power relations of influence favouring indirect actors such as public servants or politicians. Alliances reduce the diffusion of awkward incidents, which are nevertheless present in informal hallway conversations.</p>
<p>The more involved the researcher became within the informal structures of organizations during volunteer work, the more pertinent it became to include the influence of outside actors in the analysis. In schematic terms, working with autonomous actors in collectives like the CBOs requires a shift from a perception dominated by totality, unity and hierarchical structure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356389012442445">Figure 1a</xref>) to one that grasps and takes into account the underlying and theoretically unruly everyday relations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356389012442445">Figure 1b</xref>). The Coalition did not operate in vertical decision-making organizational structures, such as is the case with bureaucracies typical of national public-health agencies.</p>
<p>A more realistic representation of the public-health program and its evaluation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356389012442445">Figure 1b</xref>) would take into account the relations among the diverse partners and the indirect influence of other actors to maintain the partnership (administrators, politicians, civil servants, friends, etc.). A wide variety of actors was formally involved (senior civil servants responsible for coordinating national program evaluation), co-opted (some members of CBOs) or marginalized (users of services other than those advocated by the public-health program, such as those focused on the plight of homelessness and poverty).</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356389012442445">Figure 1a</xref>, all actors are subsumed under the upper levels of control, which unifies them and think<italic>s</italic> and act<italic>s</italic> as their legitimate voice. This apparently tidy structure conceals the real differences in power and networking among actors. Formal structures transform interpersonal relations into impersonal claims: ‘The Ministry is studying the matter.’ These structures favour a discursive hierarchy consisting of two languages. The first language is the stilted, imposed and artificial one found in a program’s formulation. It is passively accepted as the expression of a formal authority. The second one (related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356389012442445">Figure 1b</xref>) is stigmatized as ‘anecdotal and colloquial.’ More suited to confirming the indirect influences of complicities and alliances, it is perceived as hypercritical, cynical and, therefore, a threat to unity. As a delinquent discourse, the second language has to be hidden under the gracious appearance of the language in which the program is presented.</p>

<title>Evaluating under the tension between formality and informality</title>
<p>A conceptualization of the socio-political framework for evaluability assessment emerged out of the group interviews and field observations. The participatory evaluation process usually seeks to connect so-called opposed partners (representatives of the national program and community groups). The frequent exchanges between CBOs and the Coalition led to a novel conceptualization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356389012442445">Figure 2</xref>) to better validate the expected and partly unforeseeable results of their joint actions. While the views of the State and of the community might appear to be opposed to one another, they are interlinked.</p>

</fig>
<p>At one pole (the State and the social), the action prescribed by the program (discursive authority) and the method (know-how) fit together. In this case, the local actions evaluated by a participatory evaluation would be in concordance with those prescribed by the national public-health agency. The image of a social totality (unified, structured, and hierarchical) would be the idealistic model, and the evaluation model would derive from this representation.</p>
<p>At the other pole (civil society and the community), grassroots action is singular and differs from a predetermined method. In this case, the local actions evaluated by a participatory evaluation would be valued by autonomy, existential uniqueness and identity. The image of concrete singularity (diffused, unstructured, and horizontal) would be the idealistic model, and the evaluation would derive from this representation.</p>
<p>The two poles illustrate the earlier concerns about participatory evaluation expressed by the Coalition members: the differences in perspectives between them and the public-health agencies. The progressive discussions showed, rather, a more complex network of interorganizational relationships between the poles. One view encourages the idea of a community that values the world of formal organizations and rigid evaluation processes. The other values a vision offering a close-up view of structures and objectivity as a progressively constructed consensus. The participatory evaluation process might act as if those beliefs can be brought together in a certain dialogue at a specific moment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356389012442445">Figure 2</xref> reminds us of the complexity of the notion of participation. In the face-off between an informal network and an institutionalized conceptual structure, it is important to underline the contributions and expectations of both partners.</p>
<p>For the informal network, participation means the recognition of a future partner as one with whom one shares basic values. The partner can be incorporated because it is trusted as ‘one of us.’ It is a known social entity and shares common interests. Participation and partnership have worked to render both understood and shared. For the formal totality, on the other hand, this sense of partnership can be difficult to incorporate. It is easy for a formal structure to think that participation is a contractual relationship based on conceptual explicitness. Both parts will have a clear idea of the obligations and benefits to be derived from the relationships in a contract.</p>
<p>Solidarity means trust based on an experience of sharing. Clear-headed binding agreements take it for granted that when all questions are answered, trust will follow. Social totality masks a relationship traversed by tensions, in which mistrust of the unknown is the obstacle to sharing. It takes a concerted effort to realize that participation has to be built by strengthening both trust and clarity of purpose. Planning logic follows the taken-for-granted expectation that the project will only be presented to potential participants for their acceptance. All decisions about problem definition, objectives, settings, and activities have already been made. However, the participants might subsequently feel that the formal agreement does not exactly encompass the actions they recognize as their own.</p>
<p>Diversity in values, interests, strategies and behaviours will necessarily reappear in a participatory-evaluation negotiation process. Within each social reality and within each collective or individual actor, there is a never-ending tension between the attainment of a stable and unified totality and the respect of genuine diversity. A government is more than its head; a director is more than an all-powerful dictator. Neither organizational charts nor procedural protocols can suffice as a full response to future challenges.</p>
<p>Formal structures mix with informal ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356389012442445">Friedberg, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356389012442445">2005</xref>a). An authentic participatory-evaluation process that encompasses both government frameworks (here, HIV/AIDS public-health program) and civil society actions (here, HIV/AIDS CBOs) can be tempted to claim the autonomy of the inner member (here, the person living with HIV/AIDS). In this case, the singularity is conceived in terms of existential uniqueness, identity and autonomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356389012442445">Figure 2</xref>). This movement constructs a subjective sense of belonging among those who share this perspective. In a partnership, the unofficial grassroots CBO partner network will ground its activities in its collectively constructed meaning, which will have to be shared with the official and institutionalized partner (State public-health agencies). The challenge here is to grasp social action and the ways in which it confronts both formal structures and informal social conglomerates.</p>
<p>In participatory evaluation involving the State (including government agencies, semi-public and government-funded organizations) and civil society, the process is torn between a normative evaluation and a more communitarian one. The former tries to impose formal structures on what appears to be amorphous social agitation; the latter struggles to be an alternative that keeps alive the vitality of primary ties. Both perspectives have their corresponding challenges. The official viewpoint and its discourse must become understandable to their community partners; the community has the dual task of grasping its own experience and decoding the official discourse of their unavoidable interlocutor.</p>

<title>Inter-organizational structures and meanings: The construction of an inclusive discourse</title>
<p>Based on empirical observations and group interviews with a coalition and its members, we developed a theoretical framework for a socio-political evaluability assessment of participatory evaluation. This conceptualization highlights the need to take into account in a preliminary analysis values and interests, informal alliances and oppositions, and personality-tainted role definitions. A participatory-evaluation process that limits analysis to the parameters of formal rationality, formal structures and assigned roles, does so at the cost of impoverished results bound to lead to a sense of mutual misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The commonly held view that formal structures are only a formality and that CBOs are characterized by a totally fluid atmosphere of unstructured and unspoken spontaneity is mistaken. Formal bureaucracies and informal groups must establish a dialogue precisely because they are not perfect examples of the ideal types they convey, and because ideal types cannot be transformed into concrete ideals of order versus harmony. A participatory-evaluation process would benefit from including a collective identification of the evaluation themes, the methodologies underlying the choice of methods and the mechanisms to be set in place to conduct the evaluation. The resulting socio-political evaluability assessment will include the often-implicit cultural, social and political factors that affect the way in which the participatory-evaluation process is carried out in a partnership.</p>
<p>Programming, evaluation and evaluability assessment are grounded in social and institutional authority structures within particular socio-political systems that inevitably influence the actors involved and their practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356389012442445">House, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356389012442445">House and Howe, 1999</xref>). This tension takes the form of pressure exerted from above by abstract theoretical conceptualizations generated by governmental and academic centres of excellence.</p>
<p>Centres of expertise generally take it for granted that their conceptions are shared, consensual and univocal for all the actors involved in a proposed set of actions. They neglect to take into account the permanent distance between formalized and generalized collective entities (hierarchies, formal control structures) and demands for autonomy and for the primacy of the meanings of informal entities. Faced by these presuppositions, unofficial structures increase their power through implicit rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356389012442445">Friedberg, 1997</xref>), cunning strategies and astuteness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356389012442445">Detienne and Venant, 1975</xref>). Bureaucratic efforts to control through rules that ignore the vitality of informal processes court their inevitable failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356389012442445">Mintzberg et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Ideal types of social organization are opposed only as ideas. It is necessary to go beyond the two ‘sectors’ in opposition: good community groups and evil bureaucrats. Field actors and policy makers are neither opposed nor mutually incompatible. The grounding in concrete local situations is never absent or forgotten by health-program planners and model-makers, and the meaning, aims and processes of implementation and evaluation is not absent in the thorough processes of ‘reflective practitioners.’ The criticism of the ‘either–or’ approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356389012442445">Friedberg, 2000</xref>) should weaken the search for ‘ideal types’ (Weber), which could take dichotomies as empirical starting points.</p>

<title>The necessity of local contextualization with personal and experiential knowledge</title>
<p>Local contextualization and personal knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356389012442445">Polanyi, 1964</xref>) enrich the understanding of a socio-political evaluability assessment by providing a better awareness of the actor network and the interrelations that constitute the participatory-evaluation reality. Rootman and Steimetz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356389012442445">2002</xref>: 9) stress the importance of focusing evaluation on day-to-day action by creating strong links between researchers and practitioners to better meet the needs of communities. In their view, these links are increased via the development of the ability of communities to conduct research and evaluations in order to use results jointly viewed as a database to increase the effectiveness of organizational, community and political health strategies.</p>
<p>This consideration of the local is all the more important given that the socio-political network can be made up of formal and informal actors inserted in vertical relations of control and influence that can neglect a program’s unforeseeable aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356389012442445">Laperrière and Zúñiga, 2006</xref>) as well as the danger it entails for local actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356389012442445">Laperrière, 2008</xref>). Programs that encompass a local perspective gain a better understanding of how they are integrated within the social world through social relations and local political debates, in particular between institutional organizations representing the State and civil society (community organizations). This production involves ‘the attentive observation of the scenes’ in which several actors or ‘agents’ of the local public-health space are active. To better understand what is going on, concrete insertion in the context is a prerequisite for taking into account local contextualization.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356389012442445">Jacob and Rothmayr (2009)</xref> argue for a better comprehension of the evaluation political context. They point out that the evaluation initiative derives mostly from managers responsible for the implementation of the program, the public administrators or the governmental agents for control and program accountability: ‘The one who calls the tune is the one who pays the tune.’ Public agents would reproduce the same political and administrative habits and procedures in which evaluative practices progress to an institutionalization rather than a space for civil-society participation in evaluation decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356389012442445">Jacob and Rothmayr, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The study focused on the civil-society perspective. We chose to strengthen the inclusion of local understanding in centralized planning, rather than to oppose them. The choice also arises from an ethical choice of justice and equity. CBOs possess fewer networks and resources to defend their perspective in the evaluation arena. We were able to discuss the implicit matters among us, which, otherwise, would have remained in the realm of informal private conversations. Moreover, we learned from the process of collective discussions and how to bring the political dimensions of participatory evaluation between civil society and State into the public sphere.</p>
