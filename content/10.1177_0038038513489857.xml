<p>In this book Sarah Pink attempts to join ethnography of the mundane domestic practices of everyday life with a call to arms for an activism embodied in those very same processes. Rejecting the simple binary opposition of the everyday as mundane versus activism as public, explosive and explicit she argues that, ‘Indeed it is possible to understand everyday life as a site that has equal potential for activist practices as those of a global political arena’ (p. 5). The book is divided into nine fairly short chapters, the first three of which are largely theoretical and methodological. The following five chapters are ethnographically informed, moving from Chapter Four which gives a fascinating account of washing the dishes, to Chapter Five on laundry practices, followed by a chapter on a community garden project, to a chapter on the Cittaslow movement. The account thus moves spatially from the kitchen to the home to the neighborhood to the town – and lastly to the internet.</p>
<p>The book follows in that fine sociological tradition of placing values at the core of research – in doing so Sarah Pink follows in the tradition of C. Wright Mills and more recently Les Back who wrote the wonderful <italic>Art of Listening</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038038513489857">2007</xref>). The first three chapters of the book are an excellent overview and reinterpretation of theorizing the everyday from the perspective of activism and will be very useful for students of the everyday. The following chapters attempt to traverse the terrain from everyday practices to potential sites for an activism embodied in those self same practices – what I refer to as a ‘from here to there’ strategy. It is in this move, from the here to the there, that problems arise in Pink’s analysis. In the process of writing this review I tried out Chapter Four, ‘Beyond Doing the Dishes: Putting Kitchen Practices in Place’ on my third year ‘everyday-life’ undergraduates. (Might I add here that these empirically based chapters demonstrate what a fine ethnographer of the everyday Sarah Pink is?) The chapter is based largely on two ethnographic accounts of washing up – that of Nicola who has a penchant for extremely clean and shiny glasses and Paul who lives in a shared house – who isn’t so fussy about washing up but who has to ration the hot water used for washing. My students took to the topic with enthusiasm and engaged with the work of Bourdieu in order to understand the way in which kitchen practices such as ‘the clean kitchen’ and ‘the clean glass’ are located in the cultural domain and the manner in which identity is thereby linked to the presentation of the self in the home, etc. The kitchen becomes a vessel for these cultural predispositions. Pink wishes to make this a central point in her analysis when she says:<disp-quote>
<p>… a theory of place allows us to understand kitchen practices as part of a kitchen ecology constituted through movements of persons and things (which includes practices), rather than as something that is done in a priori determined localities. The further implications of this approach open up ways of thinking about kitchen practices in terms of wider issues. (pp. 62–3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Yet the problem with this, picked up by my students, was that the actual examples used – the richness of the ‘here’ in the chapter, did not move towards activism at all – the activism becomes a brief exhortation at the end of the chapter with the connection between the ‘here’ and the ‘there’ appearing at best contingent. The chapter also made me think about my own practices of water use – which is the issue that Pink is addressing in this chapter. As a child I spent my summers at my grandparents’ farm in the mountains of Corsica. They had no piped water supply, so my task of the day was to carry two large buckets of ice-cold mountain stream water the two hundred yards from the stream to the house. We used the water sparingly of course. However, the Corsican experience of rationing of water never extended to my use of water in the UK, where water coming from the tap freely had its own magical quality of abundance. I had to wait till I lived in a house where the water was metered to make the connection of cost to volume. Personal narratives of domestic practices are neither necessarily linear nor non-contradictory. Their relationship to wider social forces might be recognized but not acted upon. The exhortation to activism has its own logic in a world, to use Adorno’s words, that increasingly resembles a global factory. But returning to my students – one of my colleagues is writing a book on anti-computing – we critically discuss the notion of 24/7 availability – my students look anxious – they grasp their smart phones reassuringly – their digital sherpa to everyday life in the 21st century.</p>
