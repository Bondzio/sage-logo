<abstract>
<p>Efforts to improve research outcomes have resulted in genomic researchers being confronted with complex and seemingly contradictory instructions about how to perform their tasks. For example, increasing pressure to commercialise (academic) research is paralleled by pressure to collaborate, share data, and disseminate knowledge quickly so as to encourage scientific progress, maximise research impact, and meet humanitarian goals. This article briefly explores some of the relevant instructions in Canada and the United Kingdom and concludes that commercialisation and more open collaborative practices are not necessarily irreconcilable. They should be viewed as complementary elements of an innovation framework for which more evidence must be gathered with respect to the impact of this coexistence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most of the leading international instruments relevant, either directly or indirectly, to biomedical research state in no uncertain terms that researchers have a duty to share scientific knowledge and that society has the right to share in the benefits of scientific knowledge.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0968533212441887">1</xref>
</sup> Of course, these instruments do not stipulate how this goal is to be achieved and the existing policy setting is complex and contradictory, or seemingly so, leaving many academic researchers unsure as to how they should appropriately perform their task. On the one hand, they are told to partner with industry and to commercialize their research, presumably to maximize wealth and benefit through the quicker translation of research into products; on the other hand, they are encouraged to share data and disseminate knowledge quickly so as to foster scientific progress and meet humanitarian goals. The matter is further complicated by the fact that research is becoming more expensive, research structures are growing more complex and fractured and innovation levels, at least in the pharmaceutical setting, are not increasing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0968533212441887">2</xref>
</sup> This short paper highlights these conflicting messages in the bioscience sector, which has been the subject of significant expectation and support, and suggests that a rational, holistic course is not impossible. In doing so, we focus on Canada and the UK, both of which might be expected to take a lead in clarifying the message to academic researchers and rationalizing the expectations to which they are held (because they are major actors in bioscience research and have experienced both the ‘commercialization’ and ‘openness’ pressures).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0968533212441887">
<title>Message 1: Commercialize and translate</title>
<p>The pressure to ‘translate’ research into socially useful products more quickly and effectively has grown sharper since the addition of a ‘third role’ for universities in the 1990s; they became vehicles for economic development as well as institutions of knowledge production and knowledge transmission.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0968533212441887">3</xref>
</sup> This shift has resulted in increasing expectations that university researchers will produce research with commercial potential. This has engendered increased partnerships with industry and the adoption of a more entrepreneurial approach to their activities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0968533212441887">4</xref>
</sup> This imperative to commercialize university research has been replicated around the world in policy statements, university technology transfer office (TTO) mandates and ‘toolkits’, and funding opportunities and requirements.</p>
<p>In Canada, the commercialization objective has been built into the enabling legislation of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), which articulates one CIHR’s objectives as ‘facilitating the commercialization of health research in Canada and promoting economic development through health research in Canada’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0968533212441887">5</xref>
</sup> Similarly, the National Research Council has adopted a strategy that downplays basic research and emphasizes work that will attract industry partners and generate revenue.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0968533212441887">6</xref>
</sup> The Canadian Networks of Centres of Excellence (NCE) programme, developed in 1989 to mobilize Canada’s best research teams, has been developed around the idea of altering the academic culture and making it more commercial.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0968533212441887">7</xref>
</sup> The NCE also stated that it would focus in the coming years on increasing industrial investment in research and development partnerships and accelerating the commercialization of technologies, products and services.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0968533212441887">8</xref>
</sup> This imperative is recreated at the science-specific level: the Canadian Stem Cell Network is mandated to support the commercialization of its funded research, and it has provided funds and produced practical advice to facilitate commercialization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0968533212441887">9</xref>
</sup> Similarly, and reflective of its <italic>Guidelines for Funding Large-Scale Genomics Research Projects</italic>,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0968533212441887">10</xref>
</sup> Genome Canada, which supports large-scale genomic and proteomic projects, launched the Entrepreneurship Education in Genomics programme to facilitate value creation and capture skills within the genomics research community.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0968533212441887">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the UK, numerous policies and funding programmes are aimed at encouraging and improving university-to-business technology transfer,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0968533212441887">12</xref>
</sup> and in 2011 the government announced a £220 million programme to translate the UK’s research strengths, including those around stem cell research, into manufacturing success by facilitating academia–industry partnering.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0968533212441887">13</xref>
</sup> This notion of university–industry collaboration and commercialization of outputs has spilled over into funding agency policies. For example, the Medical Research Council (MRC) <italic>Good Research Practice </italic>policy articulates an economic mission and stipulates that MRC-funded researchers are expected to maximize the prospects of research being taken into practice through the commercial route by protecting intellectual property rights.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0968533212441887">14</xref>
</sup> This policy also states that traditionally commercial and knowledge-enclosing material transfer agreements (MTAs) and confidentiality agreements are important for protecting resources that may have value. In its <italic>Strategic Plan</italic>,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0968533212441887">15</xref>
</sup> the Biotechnology and Biomedical Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) states that, in partnership with other funders, it will develop a better understanding of the various routes and barriers to translation in different sectors, and will seek to deliver innovative solutions, focusing not only on intellectual property but more broadly on intellectual assets. These commercialization policies are expounded by traditionally solidarity-based institutions such as the Department of Health (DOH). In its <italic>Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care</italic>,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0968533212441887">16</xref>
</sup> the DOH states that the National Health Service (NHS) is an important contributor to innovation, capable of capturing new technologies and ensuring that those inventions which can make more income available for improving the health service are appropriately developed and exploited.</p>
<p>Empirical research has confirmed the mounting intensity of this pressure to commercialize.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0968533212441887">17</xref>
</sup> For example, all respondents in a recent study of Canadian TTOs reported that they believed that commercialization pressure has increased over the past 10–15 years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0968533212441887">18</xref>
</sup> So, not only are pressures mounting, but researchers and administrators are becoming increasingly sensitive to those pressures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0968533212441887">
<title>Message 2: Collaborate and data share</title>
<p>Conversely, there is also a movement to openly share scientific knowledge. Partially reflecting the open access and open innovation movements, this movement aims to create a more open, collegial and collaborative research environment. It is justified on the basis that making data more readily available will reinforce open scientific enquiry and stimulate new investigations and analyses. This open collaborative movement should be led by the scientific community to ensure (1) data quality, (2) the formation of good practice and (3) the natural embedding of sharing into the scientific culture.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0968533212441887">19</xref>
</sup> In the bioscience sectors, this model has been pushed by the research community itself and by interested leading international organizations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0968533212441887">20</xref>
</sup> With respect to the latter, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has stipulated that the value of data lies in their use, and that full and open access to data should be adopted as the international norm associated with publicly funded research, so that expensive and unnecessary duplication of data collection can be avoided and the overall efficiency of publicly funded research can be improved.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0968533212441887">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Strangely, given their position with respect to the first pro-commercialization message, some of the strongest support for open scientific collaboration has come from research funders. Genome Canada has proclaimed the principle of ‘rapid sharing’ for projects that it funds, and several of its policies expound the key elements and benefits of this position.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0968533212441887">22</xref>
</sup> In addition, Genome Canada will review applicants’ proposed data- and resource-sharing plans to verify that they conform to its data-sharing policies. Similarly, the CIHR has expressed its ‘fundamental interest in ensuring that the findings that result from the research it funds, including research publications and publication-related data, are available to the widest possible audience, and at the earliest possible opportunity’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0968533212441887">23</xref>
</sup> This message is equally embraced in the UK, where, for example, the MRC has characterized publicly funded research data as a public good, stipulating that data should be shared in a timely and responsible manner and that restrictions imposed on access to publicly funded data should be limited.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0968533212441887">24</xref>
</sup> Like the MRC, the BBSRC opines that bioscience datasets are important to the wider scientific community, and it has made data sharing a prerequisite to funding, even offering substantive support for managing and sharing data.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0968533212441887">25</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This open scientific collaboration philosophy has resulted in the creation of a range of open-access journals, publicly accessible biobanks and the issuance, by a large group of health research funders, of a <italic>Joint Statement of Purpose</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0968533212441887">26</xref>
</sup> Based on the principles of equity, ethics and efficiency, the <italic>Joint Statement</italic> sets out these funders’ belief that making datasets available to those beyond the original collectors in a timely and responsible manner will generate faster progress in improving health, better value for money and higher-quality science. The signatories have agreed to work jointly and to call on other actors, including governments, to adopt data-access policies that promote sharing and use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0968533212441887">
<title>How to move forward?</title>
<p>On the surface, these policy trends seem to create an untenable situation for the academic research community, and various scholars have argued that the pressure to commercialize conflicts directly with the idea of free exchange of scientific knowledge.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0968533212441887">27</xref>
</sup> Empirical research fortifies the concern that commercialization pressure hurts open scientific collaboration by encouraging academic secrecy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0968533212441887">28</xref>
</sup> In any event, it is undeniable that there exists a tension. However, as we articulate elsewhere,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0968533212441887">29</xref>
</sup> this tension does not necessitate true policy incompatibility. It is possible that, within this tension, a positive balance could be created that would appropriately service both science and society. To achieve this, both mandates could (and should) be approached as complementary strategies within a larger framework of activities aimed at getting the optimal social and economic value from academic innovation. The difficulty (and the task before us as a research community) will be to rationally blend the two mandates into a unified and effective policy on expectations in scientific practice; one that is comprehensible and accessible to researchers working ‘at the coal face’.</p>
<p>At least two phenomena serve as strong barriers to achieving this end. The first is the disorganized accumulation of seemingly contradictory political mandates that have grown out of the many policy and funding bodies that shape this field; they have coalesced into a complex cacophony of instruments that seem to ignore or speak past each other on a collection of issues, not least data sharing. The second is the quite narrow definition of value that informs the ‘commercialization’ mandate; a definition that relies almost solely on the counting of patents, licences and MTAs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0968533212441887">30</xref>
</sup> This emphasis has led to data withholding and a retreat from traditional academic norms of disinterested scientific exchange and, tellingly, has not led to the outcomes envisioned.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0968533212441887">31</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>What is to be done? First and foremost, a broader, richer, more comprehensive definition of ‘value’ must be agreed. It must be expanded to incorporate ‘social benefit’. In short, the financial model that relies on counting and/or valuing patents created or licences agreed must give way to a more innovative, more holistic and more nuanced assessment that includes recognition of (and measures for) a wider range of possible returns on investment. Such an approach should measure whether, how and to what extent the research contributed to, inter alia:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>capacity building (education, network formation);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>public engagement (or public understanding of science and technology);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>knowledge and material sharing amongst research institutions;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>policy and practice revision/innovation;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>incremental innovation outcomes;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>material research outcomes (i.e. inventions); and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>more traditional commercial outputs (e.g. patents, licences, MTAs, etc.).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In some circles, this more comprehensive approach has been termed research ‘valorization’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0968533212441887">32</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Second, we must refine the academic innovation framework, tailoring and streamlining its constitutional instruments for the realities and pressures of the 21st century. This would involve silencing the policy and guideline ‘noise’ that currently exists, and creating for researchers a more rationalized and user-friendly regime; a more ‘optimal’ regime with greater opportunities for one-stop guidance that better reflects the realities and needs of modern researchers. The consequences of the prevailing lack of strategy coordination are well documented.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0968533212441887">33</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Ultimately, we must determine how best to integrate the various policy approaches to innovation into a single coherent (and potentially testable/measurable) framework that would encompass both open scientific collaboration and commercialization into a global and flexible approach. In doing so, again as we note elsewhere, it will be important to generate further empirical data so as to:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>document practices and difficulties encountered by researchers trying to navigate innovations policies and their potentially conflicting demands;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>determine the degree to which the contemporary innovation ethos conflicts with existing norms of scientific inquiry; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>determine whether policy tensions are, in aggregate, harmful, and how they could be made more effective.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>This research would also be central to generating ideas (and eventually consensus) around key issues such as (1) agreeing on a shared lexicon of terms, (2) reorientating TTO and academic–industry mandates, (3) uniting behind a broader common ‘value-generating’ strategy and ‘value-measuring’ framework and (4) rationalizing and harmonizing guiding instruments and practices.</p>
<p>Obviously, all of the above is no mean task, particularly when one considers that it ought to be pursued across jurisdictions. However, given the increasingly central role of scientific inquiry in our lives and economy, this work seems essential. Indeed, if we wish to encourage and then to extract the greatest value from our research investments, this is a reasonable way forward despite the difficulties that can be predicted.</p>
