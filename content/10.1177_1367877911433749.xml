<abstract>
<p>This article examines a cultural and creative industries park project – the White Horse Lake Eco-creative City on land outside the urban centre of Hangzhou, China, which uses an imaginary rural lifestyle as its key attraction. By analysing government policies and development plans, and through interviews with initiators, managers and creative practitioners, the article first assesses the geographical position, that is, the impact of locality with regard to both hard and soft infrastructure of the project; it then examines the synergies and tensions embedded in the strategic goals, that is, to build the right city for ‘four comforts’ (<italic>siyi</italic>, 四宜) – for residence, for business, for travel and for culture. The article concludes that Chinese-style cultural conversion remains locked in a top-down ideological framework, one that rural residents and the new ‘creative class’ are expected to respect.</p>

<body>
<p>Influenced by the aptly named ‘creativity fever’, China is trying to make a transition from ‘made in China’ to ‘created in China’, from low-cost labour-intensive manufacturing and processing to higher-value goods and services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367877911433749">Keane, 2007</xref>). Increasingly, these developments are following a pattern: ‘creative clusters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367877911433749">DCMS, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367877911433749">Mommaas, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367877911433749">Turok, 2003</xref>) are designated in places where signs of creative activity exist, or they are established in post-industrial urban spaces in the hope that they will renew and transform them. Competition for clusters not only occurs at the level of the city, but also districts. It is usually the district government’s responsibility to develop, maintain and market the creative clusters.</p>
<p>Creative industries are usually attracted to large cities which can accommodate a critical mass of artists and ‘no-collar workers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367877911433749">Florida, 2002</xref>). The problem for creative workers is that they are caught between a desire to remain in the city centre and the rising cost of living there. Leaving the central business district (CBD) for the city fringes is often a cruel reality for many artists, forced to forgo their renovated urban neighbourhoods because of rising rents. Meanwhile, these marginal spaces, often described as disadvantaged and dysfunctional urban sprawl, are looking for a revival opportunity. In order to attract creative talent, they are retrofitted with affordable housing, well-designed civic spaces and convenient transportation. In addition, such developments emphasize the restoration and protection of natural landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367877911433749">Dunham-Jones and Williamson, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This aspiration is well illustrated by the White Horse Lake Eco-creative City project in an eastern city of China – Hangzhou (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1367877911433749">Figure 1</xref>), which aims to build ‘a right city for “four comforts” (<italic>siyi</italic>, 四宜) – for residence, for business, for travel and for culture’ on land outside the urban centre, exploiting the attractiveness of the rural lifestyle. Utilizing policy and document analysis, as well as in-depth interviews with initiators, managers and creative practitioners, I examine the geographical positioning of the project in order to understand why this location was chosen and reasons for creative people to relocate; then, using the ‘four comforts’, I examine synergies and tensions.</p>

<title>Choice of place: city centre or urban fringe?</title>
<p>Various sets of indices are used to evaluate, rank or help to stimulate the creativity of cities. These indices are offered to local governments, usually at a consultant’s price. The best-known examples are Florida’s ‘3T’ – Talent, Technology and Tolerance model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367877911433749">Florida, 2005</xref>) and Landry’s ‘mental toolkit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367877911433749">Landry, 2008</xref>). However, critiques of creative city policy suggest that their analyses are ‘homogenized, prescriptive geographies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367877911433749">Collis et al., 2009</xref>). In response, the UK’s Department of Culture, Media and Sports (DCMS) identifies its aim of avoiding this ‘homogenization’ problem in its <italic>Creative Britain: New Talents for the New Economy</italic>:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The Government wants to see each region identify and exploit its area of comparative advantage in the creative industries; not every region should try to copy London, but each area should support those industries that have the best capacity for local production and skilled recruitment. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367877911433749">DCMS, 2008</xref>: 58)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A different type of landscape has gradually arisen. The urban fringe, the transitional zone between urban and rural areas, which in the past has been regarded as ‘planning’s last frontier’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367877911433749">Montgomery, 2005</xref>: 14) is now viewed as ‘a priceless resource’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367877911433749">Derudder and Witlox, 2005</xref>), one that contributes to ‘sustainable urbanisation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367877911433749">Sennett, 2008</xref>). In this revision the aesthetics and functionality of landscape is re-imagined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367877911433749">Li, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>These cities are striving for recognition as creative hubs; they aspire to become members of various national and international ‘creative cities networks’, regardless of their history, cultural specifications and economic base. In this regard the creative cluster has become a central organizing concept for creative industries policies. Creative clusters appear in many places – they assume responsibility for urban regeneration as well as suburban redevelopment. The rural locale in the urban fringe is also included. For instance, there are 4000 artists living in Songzhuang on the eastern side of Beijing in the Tongzhou district; there are also thousands of artists living in Caochangdi near the Capital Airport. Elsewhere in China, the story is similar.</p>
<p>This new phase of development has attracted the attention of architects, public officials, real estate professionals and scholars in urban planning and regional development, demographics, marketing and cultural geography. Researchers have conducted interviews with residents and practitioners to investigate the relationships between the ‘aspiration’ of creativity and the space ‘to be creative’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367877911433749">Collis et al., 2009</xref>). These studies describe spontaneous gatherings of people in specific locations, mostly from outside the locale; hence they reveal how creative migration impacts on work practices and lifestyles, often in unplanned ways. In contrast, a planned cluster has more to do with urban planning, place branding, strategies to attract business and people, and large-scale construction or conversion of existing structures. Therefore, the study of this government-planned White Horse Lake Eco-creative City is expected to offer different perspective from that observed in the above studies.</p>

<title>White Horse Lake Eco-creative City project: a brief review</title>
<p>The White Horse Lake area is situated in the southern part of Hangzhou High-tech Industry Development Zone (Binjiang) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1367877911433749">Figure 2</xref>). It is both a National High-tech Zone accredited by the State Council and an administrative district of Hangzhou. Mountains and creeks surround the area, providing a natural landscape with potential for tourism. Around the White Horse Lake area there are several historical heritage sites, such as the City of the King of Yue (built in 493 <sc>bc</sc>), the Xixing Canal (excavated in 301–312), and the Guanshan Temple (first built in late 12th century). These indicate the former prosperity of this area.</p>

<p>The publicity for the High-tech Zone (Binjiang) promotes its dramatic development in industries such as micro-electronic information, biomedicine, optical-mechanical-electrical integration, and various computer applications. Among the eight recognized cultural and creative industries (CCIs) in Hangzhou, namely, information service, animation and gaming, design service, modern media, crafts, education and training, cultural recreation and tourism, and cultural exhibition, the High-tech Zone also claims advantages especially in the information service and animation and gaming sectors: the district has a National Animation Base designated by the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television. Data suggests that the local creative economy is on the rise. In 2008, CCIs generated RMB 6.5 billion of added value with an increased rate of 44.4 percent; it accounted for 24.9 percent of the district’s GDP. From January to June 2009, CCIs reached RMB 3.535 billion with an increase over the previous period of 30 percent. By the end of 2008, there were 1722 CCI enterprises, comprising 37 percent of the district’s enterprises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367877911433749">Hangzhou High-tech Zone government, 2009</xref>). These figures are significant, even taking into account the tendency of local governments in China to inflate data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367877911433749">Keane, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>With increasingly uneven development between the south and north of the Binjiang district, together with problems of limited land resource and a low employment rate due to modernization, the municipal and district government proposed the development of White Horse Lake area in accordance with Hangzhou’s ambition of becoming a ‘national cultural and creative industries centre’. In November 2007, the High-tech Zone (Binjiang) signed a project authorization document and design contract with the China Academy of Art (CAA). In April 2008, the municipal committee, municipal government, district Party committee, management committee and district government held a White Horse Lake Eco-creative City Mobilization Meeting and officially began construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367877911433749">White Horse Lake Eco-creative City Construction Headquarters, 2009</xref>), in line with the Conceptual Framework and the Three Years Action Plan drafted by the CAA. An experimental precinct – China Academy of Art SOHO Creative Park (SOHO Park for short) was opened in April 2009, and the whole construction will be completed in 2014.</p>
<p>The White Horse Lake Eco-creative City (Eco-creative City for short) has a designated area of 20.5 sq. km, making it the largest cultural and creative industry area in Hangzhou in terms of the scale and industrial infrastructure. It involves 18 villages and a population of 52,000. It is 20 minutes by road to the Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport and is close to the No. 1 Urban Subway and the planned No. 6 Urban Subway.</p>
<p>The overall strategic goal is described as providing the ‘four comforts’ (<italic>siyi</italic>, 四宜), namely, ‘a right city for residence, for business, for travel and for culture’. With a view to the larger picture rather than just a state-level cultural and creative industries district, the project identifies the construction of travel and leisure resorts as well as business centres with elaborate architecture design.</p>
<p>As a young project which is still in the mid-stage of construction, it is too early to comment on overall performance. However, intrigued by its policy and propaganda significance, my aim is to assess the attributes of the locality as well as to identify synergies and tensions between the multiple purposes of the project. My investigation provides a lens on the experimental SOHO Park as well as the larger project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1367877911433749">
<title>Standing in the fringe: the impact of locality</title>
<p>The chief design consultant of the White Horse Lake Eco-creative City, the CAA has taken an initiative with its ‘experimental’ SOHO Park in Shanyi Village, which won the Global 500 Roll of Honour for Environmental Achievement (United Nations Environment Programme) in 1988. The key attraction is the SOHOs (‘small office home office’, i.e. work spaces) converted from farmhouses – thereby providing an opportunity of working in a better natural environment while keeping pace with the fashionable work style. The second attraction is that the farmhouse SOHOs are offered to eligible creative teams free for three years. The admission criteria are (1) the participants must be involved in one of the eight subsectors of cultural and creative industries recognized by municipal government; and (2) they must attain an annual production value of RMB 5 million (excluding start-up businesses).</p>
<p>With the endorsement of the CAA, 30 teams, including at least one from each cultural and creative sector, soon signed contracts with the CAA Creative Industries Development Co. (CAACID). From a close examination of the teams it is not difficult to find preferential treatment – about half of the work studios are owned by directors of faculties and accomplished painters and designers of the CAA. A few institutions, such as the CAACID and the Atelier Pierre Bleue, founded by the dean of School of Arts and Design of the CAA, are even nominated as the ‘CAA practice base’, offering internships to students or graduates from the CAA.</p>
<p>Subsequent phases of the project will use additional design institutions with no explicit links to the CAA and it would be useful to assess their inputs. However, in the current stage of development, the opinions of the residents in the SOHO Park are most suitable for examining the immediate impacts of the locality. The analysis below is approached from two aspects: hard infrastructure (transportation and life amenities) and soft infrastructure (communication, cooperation and a sense of common identity).</p>
<sec id="section4-1367877911433749">
<title>Hard infrastructure</title>
<p>Interviews with the creative professionals in SOHO Park reveal that attitudes to hard infrastructure are mixed. Public transportation is minimal – only one bus line operates to the SOHO Park, every 45 minutes from 6.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. However, many respondents believe that the transportation is getting better as a commuter bus is now running between CBD and the SOHO Park.</p>
<p>Most of the companies have their own kitchens and cooks. Moreover, there are tennis courts and basketball courts for recreation. The mountain backing the SOHO Park and the lakes and the surrounding farmlands provide promising locations for meetings, for breaks – and, critically, for obtaining inspiration.</p>
<p>One interviewee, who has a team of ten people working in art exhibition and magazine production, was critical of facilities: ‘The staff cannot leave after 5.30 p.m. as there is no bus and seldom can they see a taxi … it takes too long and is too much trouble for my staff to get there.’ With regard to the work environment, he continues: ‘I tried to work on my artwork in the Park at 4 a.m., it was so quiet, scary quiet … we are creative people; we have requirements for the quality of life (i.e. café and pubs).’ The interviewee therefore maintains his business in the CBD, which is close to the West Lake, the CAA and cafés and pubs. Only one or two employees go to the work studio in SOHO Park, and they go there occasionally.</p>
<p>A solution is to actively improve transportation. Wang Baile, CEO of Baile Creative Design Institution, said that his company provides RMB 50,000 per person as a subsidy for those of his employees who wish to purchase a private car. In a country where the rate of owning a car is still low, this is a strong incentive. Driving is the most convenient way to reach the Park. In the long run, however, this rubs up against the vision of the ‘eco’: it brings new negative externalities like increased carbon emission and heavy traffic congestion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1367877911433749">
<title>Soft infrastructure</title>
<p>Soft infrastructure, or the so-called ‘creative milieu’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367877911433749">Landry, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367877911433749">Montgomery, 2007</xref>) is the other important measurement of the impact of locality. The geographical proximity is expected to form a ‘clustering’ effect and increase the possibility for cooperation. The CEO of the West Lake Exhibition Company, Li Shuilin says:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We have been paying much attention to the cultural and creative industries parks in Hangzhou – the resources can be shared between the enterprises and a good environment and government support are provided. I enjoyed working with designers, planning professionals and the deans of CAA faculties. The hard infrastructure will be better, and so will the atmosphere (<italic>fenwei</italic>, 氛围). We have had many discussions on projects or cooperation with other enterprises. (interview, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A young administrator from the Animation Game Factory comments:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Comparing to the National Animation Base (Binjiang), here is more artistic … currently we do not have cooperation with other work studios, but a good relationship is being built as we are working in the same precinct. Animation games industry covers many areas, so there is much potential and opportunity for cooperation. (interview, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Professor Wang Xueqing, dean of the School of Arts and Design, CAA, converted a four-storey farmhouse into his Atelier Pierre Bleue to host his and his students’ work. He is confident in his team’s design, but he recognizes that the tasks of production and marketing require good cooperation. He believes that the ‘clustering’ effect is still in the initial stage:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>An interactive system will take years to form … I think an ideal creative environment should have creative people, activities, enterprises, as well as convenient transportation and government support. It is a multi-faceted issue. (interview, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Based on these observations, the locational advantages fall short of what has been advertised; the necessary facilities are still lacking and the construction needs to be more carefully integrated into the natural settlement instead of ruining it with inappropriate architecture design, pollution and traffic. As in many projects in China, expediency overrules logistics: the choice of location is made by the government in the hope of accelerating urbanization and redeveloping the countryside.</p>
<p>The creative industries precincts are more likely to be viewed as a method that fits the Chinese way of doing things; people generally believe in the ‘clustering’ approach; after all, it is a form of collectivism with references to the past when city people engaged with nature – the creative teams and enterprises are placed together; here the sparks of creativity are lit by nature. As we can see, most interviewees agree that there is likely to be cooperation because they are all working in one precinct. What’s more, a sense of responsibility and a common identity is anticipated. It is not difficult to see the idealism of such a project in a nation with tradition of ‘collective culture’. Echoing the spirit of collaboration, Professor Wang, in a White Horse Lake ‘Creative Ideas’ Forum, called for all the residential enterprises to work together to build a better SOHO Park.</p>
<p>The above evidence provides participants’ understanding of the positioning of the SOHO Park and the White Horse Eco-creative City Project. Despite the optimism of these stakeholders and artists, there are a number of important challenges yet to be overcome. Using the framework of the ‘four comforts’, the following section examines synergies and tensions.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1367877911433749">
<title>Synergies and tensions in ‘four comforts’ – for residence, for business, for travel and for culture</title>
<sec id="section7-1367877911433749">
<title>Residence</title>
<p>The Eco-creative City has already had a substantial impact on the indigenous residents – on farmers’ lives. About 500 farmhouses in three villages have been commandeered for the rural SOHO scheme. Farmers are encouraged to sell their houses to the government – each household can enjoy 50 sq. m per person (although households with a child can receive 90 sq. m) in the nearby apartments built for them; or they can rent their houses to the creative teams and earn an annual income of RMB 100,000. In future, there will be a ‘high-quality creative residence system’ combining eco-technology and architectural design.</p>
<p>One perspective on this development is that it makes better use of the generous space occupied by small households: the farmhouses become stylish work studios, providing more aesthetic and economic value; on the other hand, the farmers are actively and organically involved in the modernization process by diversifying their income (i.e. rent) and increasing the opportunities of engaging in related service industries. Eventually, the co-residence of farmers, creative practitioner and tourists will influence the farmers’ lifestyles and raise the level of their ‘civilization’ (<italic>wenming</italic>, 文明).</p>
<p>In reality, however, it has taken time for the farmers to understand and accept the initiative. Evidence shows that disputes occur when the house owners are dissatisfied with the conversion. Moreover, the ‘high-quality creative residence system’ is more likely to be designed for creative celebrities or professionals, or whoever can afford the property price. The farmers are pushed to the periphery of this Eco-creative City.</p>
<p>In contrast to the crossroads situation facing people in small/rural communities in other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367877911433749">Overton, 2009</xref>), the farmers in China have few choices if their houses are included in the plan. The second stage of rural SOHO conversion involves more owners’ participation – farmers are responsible for converting the surface of the farmhouses according to the design drawing. Outside of the conversion site of Chenjia Village next to the SOHO Park, there is a huge billboard indicating the policy of relocation and reward schemes relating the conversion progress: all the conversion should be finished within three months; conversions completed within one month will receive a subsidy of RMB 3000 per household; those within two months will receive RMB 2000 per household; and those within three months will receive RMB 1000 per household.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1367877911433749">
<title>Business</title>
<p>The commandeered farmhouses provide space to host businesses. In addition, as one of the ten designated cultural and creative industries park projects in Hangzhou, there are plans for more amenities to support business. Because of proximity to the National Animation Base, the project adopts animation industry development as its core goal. The much anticipated animation plaza was completed in October 2010 and will be the permanent site of the China International Cartoon and Animation Festival (CICAF). Moreover, two cartoon creative parks are in construction, based on anchor tenants: Zhongnan Animation TV and Film Ltd and GreatDreams Cartoon Group.</p>
<p>In order to form a complete cultural and creative industrial chain which includes the eight sectors recognized by the municipal government, some sub-projects are being developed. These include the construction of a creative information service park, a returnee start-ups park, a sampling platform for industrial design and creative products, and a grand hotel to host international conferences on creative industries. Some ‘bright points’ (<italic>liangdian</italic>, 亮点) include a creative factory for transferring high-technology achievements into brand resources, creative fund schemes for absorbing private investment, a creative college for training, research and incubation, and a ‘creative alliance’ – a non-profit institution combing enterprises, universities and government to link talent, creativity, capital and technology.</p>
<p>All the schemes are designed to create a highly productive base – they are intended to attract high-level investment and cooperation from both national and international investors and partners. However, little attention at the planning stage has been paid to small and medium enterprises and retailing opportunities like cafés, pubs, bookstores, record shops, boutiques and an art market. This lack of a this milieu not only presents difficulties for the creative professionals working in the place, but also generates problems for tourism.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1367877911433749">
<title>Travel</title>
<p>The key attraction of the White Horse Lake Eco-creative City, as perceived literally, means to be the combination of ‘eco’ and ‘creative’.</p>
<p>The creative industries are usually expected to bring buzz to a place, ‘often the creative industries provide the soft infrastructure of tourism development … the small art-orientated enterprises that create local fashion, small consumer goods, galleries, shops, stylish bars and cafés that city visitors enjoy visiting independently’, says Philip Dodd in conversation with Jeanne-Marie Gescher in <italic>The Chinese Dream</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877911433749">Gescher and Dodd, 2008</xref>: 485). How then to create ‘buzz’? It seems at this stage there is much emphasis on the mysterious term ‘creative’, as if this buzz word by itself will simply do the job. The project intends to build some public art facilities such as the Animation Museum, the Zhu Deyong Humour Museum, and the Culture of Fishing Museum, etc. In addition, the rural SOHOs, exhibition halls, hotel and museum serve as a showcase for the urban and architectural aesthetics; for example, all the rural SOHOs of the second-stage conversion are expected to be ‘one house, one style’ and the buildings of the Animation Plaza are designed in the shape of ‘mountain and river’. These amenities, along with the planned events and festivals, such as annual international conference on creative industries and the China International Cartoon and Animation Festivals, and the opportunities to participate in ‘creation’ facilitated by the openness of work studios, promise an experiential creative trip for visitors and tourists.</p>
<p>‘Eco’ is the other key attraction. It is based on three ingredients: the first is the knowledge-intensive nature of creative industries. Using ‘individual creativity’ as raw material, creative industries are often assumed to be ‘green’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367877911433749">China Pictorial, 2010</xref>) and to have unlimited potential. Second, the rural SOHO concept is friendly to environment as it avoids large-scale demolition and reconstruction. Third, it is based on the beautiful natural landscape and an emerging sight-seeing eco-agriculture business. Initiatives include renovating the roads, paths and the historical places of interest.</p>

<sec id="section10-1367877911433749">
<title>Culture</title>
<p>There are two issues relevant to the theme of culture; the first reflects the idea of ‘civilization’ (<italic>wenming</italic>, 文明), which is a key term in Chinese government propaganda. The project is designed to echo the ‘building a new socialist countryside’ initiative released by the State Council. The ‘CPC Central Committee decision on major issues concerning rural reform and development’ notes:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The socialist culture construction is the important content and guarantee of building a new socialist countryside. We should insist on using the socialist advanced culture to occupy the rural front … to level up the ideological and moral quality … (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367877911433749">State Council of the People’s Republic of China, 2008</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, this does not imply that these creative professionals are representatives of socialism; in contrast, the avant-garde arts of 798 Arts District and Songzhuang Artist Village are often have themes critical of socialist society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367877911433749">Ulfstjerne, 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, the appearance of the better-educated creative professionals is intended to have a strong ‘uplifting’ impact on the farmers, for instance, to make many work and lifestyle possibilities, rather than just farming, more accessible.</p>
<p>In turn, the rural lifestyle may also have some influence on the creative workers. Some reports of the Eco-creative City project use the gimmick ‘celebrities are moving to the countryside to be farmers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367877911433749">Hua, 2009</xref>). Being trapped in the crowded, noisy and air-polluted city, people are hoping for a sea change effect by going back to the countryside, being closer to the nature and communing with the good-natured farmers. Yu Weizhong speaks of life in the Park by referring to a famous literary work by the Eastern Jin Dynasty writer Tao Yuanming (365–427), in which the author yearns for an idyllic lifestyle: ‘while picking asters neath the Eastern fence, my gaze upon the Southern mountain rests’ (from ‘Drinking’ (<italic>yinjiu</italic>), in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367877911433749">Wu, 1992</xref>). In this vision, the rural area no longer presents an image of poor, culturally deprived and back roads existence, but conjures up open spaces, freedom, and simplicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367877911433749">Overton, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>The second issue related to culture is its relationship to ‘economic development’.</p>
<p>Ideally, the ‘harvesting of both Socialist material and spiritual civilization’ which originated from Deng Xiaoping’s speech ‘Implementing the adjustment of policy to ensure stability and unity’ in December 1980 is expected to achieve results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367877911433749">CCCPC Party Literature Editing Committee, 1994</xref>). However, as the economic base determines the superstructure, in a developing country like China, the economy is still the starting point for all initiatives and measurements: in other words ‘economic creativity’ is prioritized. As a regional development agenda, the White Horse Lake Eco-creative City Project is hoping to bring economic prosperity marked by higher property prices, tax revenues, tourism incomes and the brand of a creative city. A redistribution of resources – specifically land and investment incentives – is designed to attract the right mix of people and activities, which will in turn make the locality thrive. Cultural and creative industries or, more generally, creative industries, is selected because:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It [creative industries] is significant in ‘building and sustaining vibrant communities’ by functioning as ‘magnets for small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs), talented employees, and extensive networks that value-add in otherwise isolated areas and contribute to regional regeneration and reputation building’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367877911433749">Lea et al., 2009</xref>: 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<title>Conclusion: transferring creativity to a rural locale</title>
<p>With the financial support of government, proximity to high-tech enterprises and the animation base, with support from the CAA, and with the experience of maintaining tourism and exhibition businesses, the White Horse Lake Eco-creative City Project advertised a utopian vision, one in which farmers and creative professionals work together and nurture each other, in a harmonious way.</p>
<p>The point that we need to bear in mind, however, is that such reconstruction is not separate from the ideological repositioning of China as a ‘creative-harmonious’ society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1367877911433749">1</xref></sup> The collapsing together of creativity and harmony obscures the ideological means–ends infrastructure. In the end people are asked to be more productive, much as before, but to be productive in a creative and harmonious way. In this sense the new theme reflects the past, with some notable shifts. In the revolutionary period (from the mid 1940s to 1978) the farmer-peasants educated the intellectuals and artists in how to be good socialists; now the boot is on the other foot; the urban bourgeoisie move to the country and provide the means to raise the level of consciousness of the farmers. This is cultural reconversion Chinese style. ‘Culture’ is gradually recognized as ‘soft power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367877911433749">Hu, 2007</xref>) in the national scripts which determine to reverse the ‘cultural deficit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367877911433749">Crienglish.com, 2007</xref>) and strengthen China’s ‘cultural competitiveness’. By emphasizing cultural and creative industries, the government expects to turn the consumers’ attention from Italian brand names, Hollywood movies, Korean TV dramas and Japanese <italic>manga</italic> to the domestic market.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367877911433749">DeFillippi et al. (2007)</xref> have identified what they call a ‘difference paradox’ among the many managerial and organizational challenges in the cultural economy. This is reflected in a dilemma of whether to craft idiosyncratic solutions or provide standardized solutions to recurring problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367877911433749">DeFillippi et al., 2007</xref>). In the case of the Eco-creative City Project, ‘crafted planning’ is essential. In addition to the current conceptual framework, further plans will be needed along with the construction process; tensions interwoven in the ‘goals’ should be noted. This also implies a tolerant attitude to a more diversified culture, in contrast to the past where the emphasis was on a dominant and relatively homogeneous ‘Socialist culture’. Moreover, the project requires long-term investment from government and private organizations, which might be the greatest challenge to the expectation of ‘catching up’ with the Western ethos of ‘creativity’ and of winning the competition between districts, and then between cities.</p>
