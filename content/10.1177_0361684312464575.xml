         <abstract>
            <p>The present study examined whether positive portrayals of feminist men could increase men’s sense of solidarity with feminists and, through it, their intentions to engage in collective action in support of women. A sample of 102 mostly White men between the ages of 18 and 63 was recruited from Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing marketplace. They were exposed to a short article either portraying feminist men in a positive light, a negative light, or describing the history of feminism without mentioning men. Men who read the positive portrayal article expressed more solidarity with feminists and greater intentions to engage in collective action in support of women than men who read either the history of feminism article or the negative portrayal article. Feminist solidarity fully mediated the relationship between positive portrayals of feminist men and collective action intentions. Consistent with research among women, the findings demonstrate that feeling connected to feminists is an important antecedent of men’s collective action in support of women. They also suggest a novel approach for involving men in collective action in support of women: building a positive image of feminist men. The implications of the findings for the men’s role in the feminist movement are discussed.</p>

      <p>Stereotypes of feminist women have mixed content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0361684312464575">Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, &amp; Xu, 2002</xref>). College students evaluate feminists less positively than women in general; they also perceive them as more masculine and less likely to be heterosexual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684312464575">Anderson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0361684312464575">Twenge &amp; Zucker, 1999</xref>). Even undergraduate women who identify themselves as feminists think that the “typical” feminist has political views that are more radical than their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0361684312464575">Liss, Hoffner, &amp; Crawford, 2000</xref>). Conversely, feminist women are also seen as more competent, intelligent, and confident than women in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684312464575">Anderson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0361684312464575">Berryman-Fink &amp; Verderber, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0361684312464575">Fiske et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0361684312464575">Twenge &amp; Zucker, 1999</xref>). Thus, feminists fit the profile of an envied group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0361684312464575">Fiske et al., 2002</xref>): deserving of grudging respect, but also distrusted and disliked.</p>
      <p>The lack of a positive image of feminists is one reason why college-aged women, at least, are reluctant to adopt a feminist identity even when they support nontraditional gender roles and gender equality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0361684312464575">Alexander &amp; Ryan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0361684312464575">Liss, O’Connor, Morosky, &amp; Crawford, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0361684312464575">Nelson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0361684312464575">Reid &amp; Purcell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0361684312464575">Roy, Weibust, &amp; Miller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0361684312464575">Toller, Suter, &amp; Trautman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0361684312464575">Williams &amp; Wittig, 1997</xref>). Social identity theory states that people derive value and meaning from the groups to which they belong and want those groups to be seen in a positive light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0361684312464575">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979</xref>). People may be hesitant to identify with a group that others do not value. In fact, undergraduate women who are exposed to positive stereotypes of feminists are twice as likely to identify with them as women who are exposed to negative or neutral portrayals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0361684312464575">Roy et al., 2007</xref>). Even if women do not personally endorse negative views of feminists, they recognize that others do and that these beliefs might be applied to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0361684312464575">Suter &amp; Toller, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0361684312464575">Twenge &amp; Zucker, 1999</xref>). Portraying feminists positively makes it possible for women to embrace a feminist identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0361684312464575">Roy et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
      <p>It has also been suggested that positive portrayals of feminists strengthen women’s “commitment to social action” to improve their group’s position in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0361684312464575">Roy et al., 2007</xref>, p. 155). If positive portrayals of feminists do strengthen women’s commitment to action, it is likely because of feminist identification. Identification with an activist group, such as feminists, is a stronger predictor of collective action among disadvantaged group members than identification with a larger social category, such as women, according to the social identity model of collective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0361684312464575">van Zomeren, Postmes, &amp; Spears, 2008</xref>). Feeling strong ties to the gay movement, for example, predicts collective action above and beyond identifying oneself as gay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0361684312464575">Simon et al., 1998</xref>). Among women, feminist identification has been linked to reports of past collective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0361684312464575">Liss, Crawford, &amp; Popp, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0361684312464575">Nelson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0361684312464575">Yoder, Tobias, &amp; Snell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0361684312464575">Zucker, 2004</xref>), intentions to participate in collective action, and also actual collective action 1 year later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0361684312464575">Kelly &amp; Breinlinger, 1995</xref>). Thus, it seems likely that feminist identification would explain any relationship between positive portrayals of feminists and collective action, at least among women.</p>
      <p>For men, the potential stigma of feminism may also be strong. It has been suggested that feminist men may be seen as feminine men because the feminist label is strongly associated with women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684312464575">Anderson, 2009</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0361684312464575">Kimmel (2010</xref>, p. 218) has argued, “Ever since the origins of the American women’s movement, pro-feminist men have had their manhood questioned. Pro-feminist men were consistently vilified by other men, jeered as they marched in demonstrations, mocked in the media, and even physically attacked.” Recent research supports Kimmel’s observation. Compared to men in general, feminist men were rated by college-aged women and men as less potent (or masculine) and more likely to be gay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684312464575">Anderson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0361684312464575">Twenge &amp; Zucker, 1999</xref>). Although women evaluated feminist men more positively than men in general (e.g., more warm, affectionate, and kind), they also saw them as less attractive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684312464575">Anderson, 2009</xref>). The combination of warm evaluative traits with low masculinity and lesser attractiveness fits a stereotypically feminine profile of a group that is liked, but that deserves little respect. The lack of positive portrayals of feminist men may make men reluctant to identify with feminists and also less likely to engage in behaviors that could be construed as “feminist,” such as taking collective action in support of women. Although some authors have proposed these relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684312464575">Anderson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0361684312464575">Kimmel, 2010</xref>), none is known to have tested them directly.</p>
      <p>Feminist identification may be the link between positive portrayals of feminist men and men’s collective action in support of women. The political solidarity model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0361684312464575">Subašić, Reynolds, &amp; Turner, 2008</xref>) and the extension of the social identity model of collective action to advantaged groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0361684312464575">van Zomeren, Postmes, Spears, &amp; Bettache, 2011</xref>) both state that solidarity-based collective action depends on identity; specifically, it depends on the degree to which members of an advantaged group, such as men, can share a positive, activist identity with members of a disadvantaged group, such as women. Because both men and women can identify with feminists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0361684312464575">Kimmel, 2010</xref>) and because feminists are an activist group concerned, in part, with improving women’s position in society, it seems likely that men will be more willing to take action in support of women to the extent that they identify with feminists. Some support for this argument can be found in research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0361684312464575">Becker and Swim (2011)</xref>. They observed that men were more likely to sign an anti-sexism petition if they empathized with women’s experiences of sexism—simply attending to the frequency of sexism was not enough. Additional support can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0361684312464575">White’s (2008)</xref> qualitative study of 20 African American men who identified as feminists. She found that feminist men felt a close bond with other feminists and engaged in a variety of forms of collective action in support of women. Establishing positive views of male feminists may be one factor that makes such a shared identity possible.</p>
      <p>Social identification has multiple components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0361684312464575">Ashmore, Deaux, &amp; McLaughlin-Volpe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0361684312464575">Leach et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0361684312464575">Sellers, Smith, Shelton, Rowley, &amp; Chavous, 1998</xref>). People vary not only in terms of whether or not they self-categorize as a group member (e.g., “I am a feminist”) but also in how positively they feel about their group (e.g., “I am glad to be a feminist”), how central it is to their self-concept (e.g., “Being a feminist is an important part of how I see myself”), and how much of a bond they feel with other group members (e.g., “I feel a bond with feminists”). In two samples of Dutch students and across three different identities (i.e., Dutch, European, and University student), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0361684312464575">Leach et al. (2008)</xref> found that these components of identity could be distinguished. Of these components, they argued that solidarity is most strongly associated with “coordination with other group members” and “group-based activity,” such as collective action (p. 147). Thus, in the present study, we examine men’s solidarity with feminists.</p>
      <p>The current study has three main aims. The first is to test whether the finding that positive portrayals of feminist women increase feminist self-identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0361684312464575">Roy et al., 2007</xref>) can be extended to one component of feminist identity—feminist solidarity—among men. We expect that exposing men to a positive portrayal of feminist men (e.g., being just, intelligent, confident, and attractive) will increase their connection to feminists (Hypothesis 1). The second aim of our study is to examine whether positive portrayals of feminist men can also influence men’s intentions to take collective action in support of women, as has been suggested by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684312464575">Anderson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0361684312464575">Kimmel, 2010</xref>). We expect that exposing men to a positive portrayal of feminist men will increase their intentions to engage in collective action in support of women (Hypothesis 2). The third aim of our study is to examine whether solidarity with feminists explains the proposed relationship between positive portrayals of feminist men and collective action. It has been argued that members of majority or advantaged groups (e.g., men) are more likely to take action in support of a minority or disadvantaged group (e.g., women) when they establish a positive sense of solidarity with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0361684312464575">Subašić et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, we expect that feminist solidarity will fully mediate the relationship between positive portrayals of feminist men and men’s intentions to engage in collective action in support of women (Hypothesis 3).</p>
      <p>Our study builds on Roy, Weibust, and Miller’s (2007) experiment with undergraduate women. The researchers exposed participants to one of three paragraphs ostensibly written by another student. One paragraph portrayed feminists in a positive light, one portrayed them negatively, and a control condition discussed “genetically engineered food” (p. 149). The researchers assessed a number of dependent variables, including a single-item measure of feminist identification (i.e., “Do you consider yourself a feminist?” with response options: “yes,” “no,” and “don’t know”; p. 149), feminist attitudes (e.g., nontraditional gender role attitudes), gender identification, and performance self-esteem. Relevant to our study, the researchers found that women who read the positive paragraph were more likely to identify as a feminist than women who read the negative or control paragraphs. Feminist identification did not differ across the latter two conditions. The researchers also found that women who read the positive paragraph were more likely to support nontraditional gender roles than women who read the control paragraph and that feminist identification mediated the relationship between the paragraph condition and support for nontraditional gender roles.</p>
      <p>In addition to focusing on men, our research deviates from the Roy et al. (2007) experiment in three ways. First, whereas their study included a control condition that had nothing to do with feminism, the present experiment includes a control condition that describes the “history of feminism” but does not discuss how other people view feminists. Our goal is to hold the salience of feminism constant across conditions. Second, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0361684312464575">Roy et al. (2007)</xref> used a single-item measure of feminist identification, we focus on solidarity with feminists, which is understood as the component of feminist identification most relevant to collective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0361684312464575">Leach et al., 2008</xref>). Third, and related, we included intentions to engage in collective action in support of women as a dependent variable.</p>

            <p>One hundred and seventeen men residing in the United States participated in a web-based experiment through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk; www.mturk.com). They were compensated with $.50. MTurk is an online crowdsourcing marketplace where people can complete short tasks for small amounts of compensation. MTurk compares favorably to American college student samples and other internet samples in terms of demographic diversity and has been shown to produce reliable data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0361684312464575">Buhrmester, Kwang, &amp; Gosling, 2011</xref>). Well-established findings in social and cognitive psychology have been replicated with MTurk samples, offering evidence that it produces valid data as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0361684312464575">Horton, Rand, &amp; Zeckhauser, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0361684312464575">Mason &amp; Suri, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0361684312464575">Paolacci, Chandler, &amp; Ipeirotis, 2010</xref>).</p>
            <p>Five participants were removed from analyses for failing to complete at least of one of two basic quality control items embedded in the study (e.g., “Please choose ‘agree’ for this item”); nine participants were removed for failing a reading check that asked them to correctly report the topic of the article that they read; and one participant was removed for failing to report his age. The removed participants were not distributed equally across conditions, χ<sup>2</sup>(2, <italic>N</italic> = 117) = 7.62, <italic>p</italic> = .022. There were more removed participants in the negative condition (<italic>n</italic> = 10), than in either the neutral (<italic>n</italic> = 2) or the positive condition (<italic>n</italic> = 3).<sup>

Two participants reported their ethnicity as human, and two other participants reported it as American. In terms of socioeconomic status (SES), 29 men reported that “My family has a hard time buying the things we need”; 36 reported “My family has just enough money for the things we need”; 34 reported “My family has no problem buying the things we need and sometimes we can also buy special things”; and the remaining 4 reported “My family has enough money to buy pretty much anything we want.” All participants confirmed that they were in fact male.</p>

            <title>Procedure</title>
            <p>Participants clicked on a link to participate in a study titled “Reading comprehension and social opinions (MALE PARTICIPANTS ONLY).” The link directed them to the online experiment, which was administered using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684312464575">Qualtrics (2009)</xref> survey software. We used the software’s automatic randomization feature to randomly assign men to read one of three articles. One article portrayed feminist men in a positive light, one article portrayed them in a negative light, and one article described the history of the feminist movement and did not mention men. In order to present participants with realistic portrayals, the content for the positive and negative portrayals articles was derived from actual positive and negative stereotypes of feminist men reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684312464575">Anderson (2009)</xref>. The history of feminism article allowed us to compare the positive and negative portrayals to simple exposure to the topic of feminism, irrespective of the portrayal of men. The full text of each article appears in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0361684312464575">Appendix A</xref>. With the final sample of 102 men, 37 men read the positive portrayals article, 31 men read the negative portrayals article, and 34 men read the history of feminism article.</p>
            <p>Consistent with the description of the study, participants were asked to correctly identify the topic of the article that they read after the experimental manipulation. They also completed two manipulation checks: one in which they reported their perceptions of how feminist men are viewed in society and the other in which they assessed the credibility of the article that they read (described below). A quality control item was embedded in the manipulation check (“Please choose ‘Agree’ for this item”). After the manipulation check participants completed measures of feminist solidarity and collective action intentions. A second quality control item was embedded in the collective action scale (“Please choose ‘Undecided’ for this item”). Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted to investigate whether the men from each of the three article conditions differed significantly on demographic variables (i.e., SES, ethnicity, age). No significant mean differences were found among groups.</p>

            <title>Measures</title>
            <p>Unless otherwise indicated, all items were assessed on a 7-point scale from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 7 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). All scale scores were obtained by averaging item ratings. Higher scores on each scale indicate higher levels of the variable measured.</p>
            <sec id="section5-0361684312464575">
               <title>Manipulation checks</title>
               <p>To assess the effectiveness of our manipulation, we asked participants to respond to the same 5 items in all three conditions regarding the positivity of beliefs about feminist men in society based on the article that they read. Two positively worded items were adapted from the public regard subscale of the Collective Self-Esteem scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0361684312464575">Luhtanen &amp; Crocker, 1992</xref>). In the original scale, the items refer to groups in general; we changed them to refer to feminist men. The items were “Feminist men are considered to be good by others” and “Others respect feminist men.” We also included three negatively worded items, which were reverse-scored: “Negative stereotypes of feminist men exist within our society”; “Many people hold negative stereotypes of feminist men”; and “Most people consider feminist men, on the average, to be more feminine than other men.” Cronbach’s α for responses to the 5 items was .92. In addition, to confirm that the three articles were equally believable, we included a measure of article credibility. Men responded to five statements, “The article that I read at the beginning of this questionnaire was [credible/ convincing/ trustworthy/ realistic/ reliable].” Cronbach’s α for responses to these items was .92.</p>

            <sec id="section6-0361684312464575">
               <title>Feminist solidarity</title>
               <p>We measured feminist solidarity with the solidarity subscale of Leach et al.’s (2008) Multicomponent Model of In-group Identification, which has been previously validated in two samples of Dutch students across three different identities (Dutch, European, and University student). Leach et al. found that the solidarity subscale was associated with the four other components of the Multicomponent Model of In-group Identification, as well as with five other existing measures of group identification. We measured solidarity instead of other components of ingroup identity (e.g., centrality, satisfaction) because it has been argued to be the most closely related to group-serving behaviors, such as collective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0361684312464575">Leach et al., 2008</xref>)—especially action by members of advantaged groups, such as men, on behalf of disadvantaged groups, such as women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0361684312464575">Subašić et al., 2008</xref>). We followed Leach et al.’s instructions to adapt the subscale, keeping the stems for the 3 items and inserting our target group. The 3 items were “I feel a bond with feminists,” “I feel solidarity with feminists,” and “I feel committed to feminism.”<sup>

                  </sup> Cronbach’s α for responses to the items was .96, which is similar to what Leach et al. found across their student samples (αs = .88 to .90).</p>

            <sec id="section7-0361684312464575">
               <title>Collective action intentions</title>
               <p>Few studies have assessed men’s intentions to engage in collective action in support of women. In one exception, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0361684312464575">Iyer and Ryan (2009)</xref> assessed intentions to challenge the appointment of women to leadership positions only under difficult circumstances (i.e., the glass cliff), a very specific phenomenon. We sought a more general measure. For this purpose, we adapted 9 items from Kelly and Breinlinger’s (1995) 12-item collective action scale, which was shown to be reliable (α = .82) in a sample of British women from activist groups and postgraduate courses and which was strongly associated with identification as an activist. Responses were assessed on a 7-point scale from 1 (<italic>I will never do this</italic>) to 7 (<italic>I will do this for sure</italic>).</p>
               <p>We did not include 3 of the 12 items in our initial instrument. One was excluded because it referred to illegal activities (“Breaking the law, e.g., blocking the road with a street demonstration”). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0361684312464575">Kelly and Breinlinger (1995</xref>, p. 49) found that support for this item was low, and other research has demonstrated that legal and illegal forms of collective action represent independent constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0361684312464575">Sabucedo &amp; Arce, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0361684312464575">Tausch et al., 2011</xref>). A second item was excluded because it would have been difficult to answer for men who did not belong to formal groups or organizations (“Raising women’s issues in groups or organizations”). A third item was excluded because it referred to Congress (“Contact your [congressperson]”). The current study was conducted at a time when trust and job approval for Congress were both at historic lows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0361684312464575">Saad, 2011</xref>).</p>
               <p>Because we did not have information about the construct validity of these 9 items in a sample of men, we submitted them to an exploratory factor analysis (Principal Axis Factoring using Promax rotation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0361684312464575">Fabrigar, Wegener, MacCallum, &amp; Strahan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0361684312464575">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001</xref>). We retained two factors, explaining a total of 76.60% of the variance. On each factor, we retained items with loadings higher than .32 and cross-loadings below .32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0361684312464575">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2001</xref>). Six items loaded on a first factor explaining 65.30% of the variance. All factor loadings in the pattern matrix were greater than .72 and no cross-loading exceeded .15. These items included whether participants thought they would: “Act as a spokesman for a particular women's issue,” “Spend time working for a women’s campaign (e.g., fund-raising),” “Attend women's meetings or workshops,” “Take part in a rally or demonstration in support of women's rights,” “Attend demonstrations, protests, or rallies about women's issues,” and “Contact media (e.g., radio, TV, newspaper) in regards to women's issues.” Cronbach’s α for responses to the items on the scale was .95.</p>
               <p>Three items loaded on a second factor explaining an additional 11.83% of the variance. All factor loadings in the pattern matrix were greater than .46, and no cross-loading exceeded .26. Two of these items had loaded on an “informal participation” factor in Kelly and Breinlinger’s (1995) study (“Discussing women’s issues with friends or colleagues”; “Reading articles, journals or watching films about women’s issues”). A third item had loaded on an “individual protest” in Kelly and Breinlinger’s (1995) study (“Signing a petition”). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0361684312464575">van Zomeren, Leach, and Spears (2010</xref>; footnote 2, p. 1057) had found that a similar item cross-loaded on group identity in an exploratory factor analysis. Because we were interested in formal collective action and concerned about possible overlap between our collective action intentions and feminist solidarity measures, we did not include these 3 items in any analyses.</p>

         <p>Descriptive statistics and correlations among all study variables are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0361684312464575">Table 1</xref>. Analyses proceeded in three steps. First, separate ANOVAs were conducted on the manipulation checks to test whether the article manipulation had the intended effect. Second, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted to test whether positive portrayals of feminist men increased feminist solidarity (Hypothesis 1) and intentions to engage in collective action in support of women (Hypothesis 2) relative to the negative portrayal and neutral conditions. We followed up the MANOVA with separate ANOVAs for each dependent variable, and then we conducted pairwise comparisons between the means (Tukey’s HSD). Third, a mediation analysis was conducted using multiple regression analyses to test whether feminist solidarity mediated the effect of positive portrayals of feminist men on intentions to engage in collective action (Hypothesis 3). Data were inspected for violations of the assumptions of the analyses that were conducted (normality, homogeneity of variance) and none were found. We also included age, ethnic group, and SES as potential covariates in all analyses and none were significant. In all cases, the pattern of results remained the same. One participant was missing an item on the positivity of beliefs about feminist men in society scale. We imputed the grand mean of the scale for his score.</p>

            <p>Hypothesis 3 stated that solidarity with feminists would fully mediate the relationship between positive portrayals of feminist men and intentions to engage in collective action on behalf of women. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to test for mediation, following the steps outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0361684312464575">Baron and Kenny (1986)</xref> and utilizing the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) macro developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0361684312464575">Preacher and Hayes (2008)</xref>. Because we expected that only a positive portrayal of feminist men would increase feminist solidarity and collective action and because we did not observe differences between the negative and neutral conditions in the ANOVAs, we coded the former condition as 1 and the latter two conditions as 0 in our mediation analysis.<sup>

            <p>Consistent with the results of the ANOVAs, positive portrayals of feminist men, the independent variable, significantly increased collective action intentions, the dependent variable (path c)—meeting the first requirement for mediation. Similarly, positive portrayals also increased feminist solidarity, the proposed mediator (path a), meeting the second requirement. The third requirement for mediation is that the mediator, feminist solidarity, is positively and significantly linked to the dependent variable, collective action intentions, which it was (path b). Baron and Kenny’s (1986) fourth and last requirement for mediation is that the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable is reduced when the mediator is also entered into the model. In fact, positive portrayals of feminist men no longer predicted collective action intentions when feminist solidarity was simultaneously entered into the model (path c′). Meanwhile, feminist solidarity remained a significant predictor of collective action intentions, β = .58, <italic>SE</italic> = .07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. This pattern provided strong support for Hypothesis 3.</p>
            <p>Bootstrapping methods were utilized to evaluate the certainty of the indirect effect and, thus, the proposed mediation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0361684312464575">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0361684312464575">Shrout &amp; Bolger, 2002</xref>). Bootstrapping creates confidence intervals for the indirect effect by estimating it across repeated samples of the data set. It is recommended over parametric tests (Sobel’s test; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0361684312464575">Sobel, 1986</xref>) in smaller samples in which the sampling distribution of the indirect effect is unlikely to be normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684312464575">MacKinnon, Lockwood, &amp; Williams, 2004</xref>). We calculated the bias corrected 99% confidence intervals (CI) for the indirect effect across 5,000 resamples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0361684312464575">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008</xref>). The indirect effect was significant, as indicated by CIs that did not cross 0,<italic> b</italic> = .83, bias-corrected 99% CI [.39, 1.29], confirming the significance of the mediation. As expected, feminist solidarity fully mediated the effect of positive portrayals of feminist men on intentions to engage in collective action in support of women.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>The present study investigated the effect of portrayals of male feminists on men’s solidarity with feminists and intentions to take collective action in support of women. First, portrayals of male feminists were effectively manipulated. Men believed that male feminists were viewed somewhat negatively after reading a neutral article on the history of the feminist movement. Exposure to negative stereotypes reinforced these negative beliefs. Exposure to a more positive portrayal, however, reversed the valence. After reading a positive portrayal of feminist men, men thought that male feminists were viewed somewhat positively. These results suggest that, whereas male feminists are generally seen in a negative light, these beliefs can be reversed by emphasizing that men can be feminists and that feminist men possess many good qualities.</p>
         <p>Second, as expected, positive portrayals of feminist men increased solidarity with feminists compared to negative portrayals and the neutral condition. They also increased men’s intentions to take collective action in support of women. When we accounted for feminist solidarity, the effect of positive portrayals on collective action was eliminated, indicating that feminist solidarity fully mediated the relationship between positive portrayals and collective action. In other words, men who were exposed to positive portrayals were more likely to feel solidarity with feminists and, as a result, had stronger intentions to engage in collective action in support of women.</p>
         <p>The present study offers the first known evidence that portrayals of feminist men can increase solidarity with feminists and collective action in support of women, a relationship that other researchers have suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684312464575">Anderson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0361684312464575">Roy et al., 2007</xref>). It also extends the well-established finding that identifying with feminists facilitates collective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0361684312464575">Henderson-King &amp; Stewart, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0361684312464575">Kelly &amp; Breinlinger, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0361684312464575">Liss et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0361684312464575">Nelson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0361684312464575">Williams &amp; Wittig, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0361684312464575">Yoder et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0361684312464575">Zucker, 2004</xref>). Not only does the pattern hold true for men as well as for women, but also the causal relationship is shown here in an experimental paradigm, rather than in correlational research reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0361684312464575">Williams &amp; Wittig, 1997</xref>). Our results are broadly consistent with the political solidarity model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0361684312464575">Subašić et al., 2008</xref>) and the extension of the social identity model of collective action to advantaged groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0361684312464575">van Zomeren et al., 2011</xref>), both of which argue that action by members of privileged groups in support of less advantaged groups depends on their ability to form a shared, positive identity with them. For men, feminism is just such an identity.</p>
         <p>Our results are also consistent with the argument that people may be more willing to identify with feminists when they construe a feminist identity as inclusive of their own self-views. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0361684312464575">Moradi, Martin, and Brewster (2012)</xref> recently tested this idea in a college-student sample composed primarily of women. The researchers found that a classroom intervention designed to broaden students’ ideas about who can be a feminist decreased students’ sense that being a feminist would be inconsistent with their positive views of themselves and increased their feminist identification. It may be that positive portrayals of feminist men similarly enable men to perceive being feminists as consistent with how they see themselves as individuals.</p>
         <p>That a positive portrayal of feminist men increased feminist solidarity and collective action intentions—but a negative portrayal did not decrease either—is consistent with research on exposure to feminist stereotypes and identification among women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0361684312464575">Roy et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0361684312464575">Roy et al. (2007)</xref> also found that positive portrayals of feminist women increased women’s identification with them, whereas a negative portrayal had no effect relative to a control. They argue that this pattern may be because feminists are already viewed so negatively that providing women with additional stereotypic information does not make views any worse. Our manipulation check sheds additional light on this explanation, at least with respect to stereotypes of male feminists. Participants did think that other people had relatively negative views of feminist men even in the neutral condition; but exposure to negative portrayals of male feminists made them worse. We suggest an alternative explanation for the lack of effect in the negative condition: It may not be the presence of a negative stigma that keeps men from identifying as feminists and engaging in collective action in support of women; rather, it may be the absence of positive regard. It is not enough to portray feminist men as <italic>not</italic> feminine or <italic>not</italic> bad. To encourage men to feel solidarity with feminists, it would appear more effective to portray feminist men as like other men, <italic>only better</italic>. This explanation is also consistent with the political solidarity model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0361684312464575">Subašić et al., 2008</xref>), which argues that eliminating the barriers to identification is not enough to establish solidarity between privileged and disadvantaged group members; the groups must also forge a new identity that allows them to see their existing group memberships—in this case, their gender—in a positive light.</p>
         <p>In the current study, we assessed two particular components of men’s feminist identification: Male feminist public regard (as a manipulation check) and feminist solidarity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0361684312464575">Ashmore et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0361684312464575">Leach et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0361684312464575">Roccas, Sagiv, Schwatrz, Halevy, &amp; Eidelson, 2008</xref> for reviews of different components of identification). We did so for theoretical reasons. We manipulated people’s perceptions of others’ evaluation of feminists (i.e., feminist public regard) because earlier researchers have argued that it influences feminist identification among women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0361684312464575">Suter &amp; Toller, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0361684312464575">Twenge &amp; Zucker, 1999</xref>). This is not to say that people’s personal attitudes about feminists (i.e., feminist private regard) also do not influence feminist identification—indeed, many researchers have shown that they do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0361684312464575">Liss et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0361684312464575">Nelson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0361684312464575">Reid &amp; Purcell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0361684312464575">Roy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0361684312464575">Williams &amp; Wittig, 1997</xref>). By randomly assigning men to conditions, however, we expect that men with different attitudes would have been equally distributed across groups in our true experiment.</p>
         <p>We assessed feminist solidarity because it is believed to be the component of identity most likely to predict collective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0361684312464575">Leach et al., 2008</xref>), especially collective action by members of privileged groups in support of members of disadvantaged groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0361684312464575">Subašić et al., 2008</xref>). Still, it would be worthwhile for future researchers to examine whether portrayals of male feminists have similar effects on other components of feminist identification, such as the choice to adopt the label feminist as self-descriptive or the centrality of the category in the overall self-concept. Further, we focused on collective action intentions as an outcome of feminist solidarity. It would be worthwhile to assess actual engagement in collective action as well. Existing research has shown similar effects of predictors of collective action on behaviors as on behavioral intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0361684312464575">van Zomeren et al., 2008</xref>), although somewhat smaller in the former than in the latter case. However, it is possible that expressing solidarity with feminists and intent to engage in collective action is the end point in some men’s participation in feminism. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0361684312464575">Kimmel (2010)</xref> has argued, calling oneself a feminist can be a symbolic act that allows men to feel good about themselves without actually doing anything, a practice that has been labeled “premature self-congratulation.” Finally, it would also be worthwhile to examine the impact of feminist identification on other outcomes, such as gender-role attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0361684312464575">Roy et al., 2007</xref>), behavior in romantic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0361684312464575">Rudman &amp; Phelan, 2007</xref>), and evaluations of feminists who make claims of discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0361684312464575">Roy, Weibust, &amp; Miller, 2009</xref>).</p>
         <sec id="section13-0361684312464575">
            <title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
            <p>The results of our study should be considered in the light of several methodological limitations. The portrayals of feminist men were not parallel across conditions. The conditions differed in terms of how positively feminist men were portrayed, but the positive condition also gave more examples of feminist men’s activism than the negative condition. Further, only the negative condition discussed other men’s evaluations of feminist men. These differences make it difficult to know if the observed effects are due to how positively men are evaluated, as we have argued, or to how frequently they are linked to activism or the source of their evaluations. Future research should address these alternative explanations. We would note that other men have less positive views of feminist men than women do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684312464575">Anderson, 2009</xref>). Thus, positivity may be confounded with source of evaluation in the real world. Further, the positive portrayals condition differed not only from the negative portrayals condition on all variables but also from a history of feminism condition in which feminist men were not mentioned at all.</p>
            <p>Another limitation of our positive portrayal article is that it argued that women see feminist men as “highly attractive and better long-term companions than non-feminist men.” This statement may be limited to heterosexual feminist women, who prefer partners who do not conform to masculine norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0361684312464575">Backus &amp; Mahalik, 2011</xref>) and who are less likely to view feminism as a problem for their romantic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0361684312464575">Rudman &amp; Fairchild, 2007</xref>). Still, there is evidence that heterosexual women report more stable, equitable, higher-quality relationships when they perceive that their partner is a feminist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0361684312464575">Rudman &amp; Phelan, 2007</xref>). Future positive portrayals of feminist men should emphasize these findings.</p>
            <p>It is also important to point out that our results were obtained in a sample that was 79% White or Caucasian. The situation is likely different for men of color, who have different beliefs surrounding gender and masculinity than White men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0361684312464575">Abreu, Goodyear, Campos, &amp; Newcomb, 2000</xref>) and who are sometimes devalued <italic>as men</italic> because of their race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0361684312464575">Liang, Salcedo, &amp; Miller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0361684312464575">O'Neil, 2008</xref>). This may influence the degree to which they see feminist men in a positive light or see feminism as contradicting or complementing notions of masculinity. The same may be said for sexual minorities and other men who face sexual stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0361684312464575">Herek, 2007</xref>). Because we did not ask participants to report their sexual orientation, we cannot say whether our results would generalize to these populations.</p>
            <p>Portraying feminist men in a positive light is one way to increase men’s solidarity with feminists and intentions to engage in collective action in support of women, but it is not the only way. Recent research conducted at a Hong Kong University showed that members of a privileged ethnic group were more willing to identify with and engage in collective action in support of a disadvantaged ethnic group to the extent that they held strong moral convictions about discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0361684312464575">van Zomeren et al., 2011</xref>, study 2). Strong moral convictions may likewise increase men’s solidarity with feminists and support for collective action, a promising direction for future research.</p>

Learning that many men support feminism—and that their contributions are valued by others—may increase men’s solidarity with feminists and intentions to engage in collective action in support of women (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0361684312464575">Kimmel &amp; Mossmiller, 1992</xref>, for a resource). bell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0361684312464575">hooks (1984</xref>, p. 83) has argued that “since men are the primary agents maintaining and supporting sexism and sexist oppression, they can only be successfully eradicated if men are compelled to assume responsibility for transforming their consciousness and the consciousness of society as a whole.” Our research shows that positive portrayals of feminist men may help move men toward hooks’ goal by increasing men’s feelings of solidarity with feminists and by promoting collective action in support of women. Knowing how and why men engage in collective action in support of women does not tell us what happens once they do get involved; still, the current research indicates a first step in encouraging men to be “comrades in the struggle” for feminism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0361684312464575">hooks, 1984</xref>).</p>

               <title>Positive Portrayal</title>
               <p>Though most people who identify as feminists are women, a growing number of men are identifying as feminists. Many view these individuals as progressive men who recognize the injustices in our society and try to fix them. Feminist men are frequently seen as intelligent, active members of their communities, and promoters of positive change. They do this by volunteering at organizations that seek to end violence against women, or by educating people about sexism’s presence in our society. One study found that feminist men are perceived by a majority of the population as confident and individualistic. Women also evaluated these men as highly attractive and better long-term companions than nonfeminist men. A number of feminist writers argue that men’s identification with the women’s rights movement is necessary for furthering the feminist cause. In the words of one scholar, author of <italic>Feminist Men are Not Unicorns</italic>, “identifying as a feminist is the strongest stand that men can take in the struggle against sexism directed at women.” Writers continue to argue that men should be encouraged to participate in the feminist movement.</p>

               <title>Negative Portrayal</title>
               <p>Though most people who identify as feminists are women, a growing number of men are identifying as feminists. Many perceive these men as feminine and sensitive individuals. Many feminist men are seen as submissive and are sometimes accused of accepting the viewpoint that “men are bad.” They are perceived as working against their gender by claiming that men frequently discriminate against women at work, or by attending protests campaigning against men’s actions. One study found that women view feminist men as less masculine and less attractive than nonfeminist men, despite the fact that the men are proponents of women’s rights. Other men see male feminists as being weak-willed and afraid to stand up for their gender. Some scholars argue that men cannot be feminists because of the intrinsic differences between the sexes. Women argue that men cannot be feminists simply because they are not women. In the words of one scholar men are, “granted inherent privileges that prevent them from identifying with feminists struggles, thus making it impossible for them to identify with feminists.”</p>

               <title>History of Feminism</title>
               <p>The feminist movement refers to a series of campaigns or reforms on issues such as reproductive rights, domestic violence, maternity leave, equal pay, women’s suffrage, sexual harassment, and sexual violence. Some historians point to the late 18th century as the beginning of the modern movement in the western world and argue that it has gone through three waves. The first wave was oriented around the station of middle or upper-class White women, and involved suffrage and political equality. Second-wave feminism attempted to further combat social and cultural inequalities. Third-wave feminism includes renewed campaigning for women’s greater influence in politics. The history, events, and structure of the feminist movement are closely related to the broader transformations of gender roles taking place in American culture. The feminist movement worked and continues to work against the status quo in American society.</p>

               <p>When we ran the analyses with all 117 original participants included, the pattern of results was the same as when we ran them with the 15 excluded participants. We report the results of analyses with excluded participants because we were reluctant to include men who did not read the article manipulation or who did not pay attention to the self-report items.</p>

               <p>An anonymous reviewer noted that the word “feminism” in the last item represents an ideology, not a group. We used the term because we thought that “I feel committed to feminists” was awkward and ambiguous and that participants would strongly associate “feminism” with “feminists.” In support of our contention, responses to the items on the scale were highly reliable, and all items loaded on a single factor explaining 92.95% of the variance in an exploratory factor analysis (Principal Axis Factoring with Promax rotation; all loadings &gt; .93). In addition, conducting all analyses with a feminist solidarity scale composed of just the two “feminist” items yields the same pattern of results.</p>

               <p>Separate mediation analyses were conducted comparing the negative with positive portrayal conditions and the neutral with positive portrayal conditions. Both yielded the same pattern of full mediation reported in the results and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0361684312464575">Figure 1</xref>. An analysis that compared the negative portrayals condition with the positive and neutral conditions combined did not meet the requirements for mediation.
