<abstract>
<p>Few studies have assessed the differences between organizational and third-party websites, especially with regards to applicant quality. Organizational websites are hypothesized to bring in higher quality applicants than third-party websites because of the amount of organization-specific information they contain. This study assesses perceived differences between web recruitment sources in applicant quality using a convenience sample of resumes from job applicants from a midsize company. Resumes were rated by human resource personnel in terms of applicant quality. The organizational website contained higher quality applicants on average compared to four third-party website sources.</p>

<body>
<p>Web recruitment has been highly utilized by companies since the inception of the Internet; yet, research has not fully explored the differences between organizational and third-party websites. Knowledge of such differences will help companies select the recruitment sources that will bring in the best applicants. For example, a company may need to decide how much to spend on posting open positions on online sources or even consider building a new recruitment-specific website to post positions. A company may prevent wasting time and resources and attract the best applicants by being familiar with the benefits of each website type.</p>
<p>Approximately 90% of large US companies now use web recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894439311402147">Dineen, Ling, Ash, &amp; DelVecchio, 2007</xref>). Online or web recruitment sources such as an organization’s career page or job search engine (i.e., Monster.com) allow organizations to immediately post jobs, which applicants can search for and view quickly. Regional boundaries do not affect web recruitment like most newspapers or job fairs; thus, job posts can often be accessed anywhere in the world at any time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894439311402147">Zusman &amp; Landis, 2002</xref>). It is no wonder that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894439311402147">Chapman and Webster’s (2003)</xref> study revealed that human resource managers now believe that the use of newspapers will decrease in the future.</p>
<p>The most frequently reported benefit of web recruitment for human resource departments is a larger applicant pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894439311402147">Chapman &amp; Webster, 2003</xref>); however, a larger applicant pool requires more time and money to review a larger amount of applications, especially if the pool contains many unqualified applicants. Cost savings have also been shown including 25% less time spent on recruitment processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894439311402147">Crispin &amp; Mehler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894439311402147">Wildstrom, 1999</xref>). Finally, web recruitment allots more control to job seekers over the information sought and viewed compared to traditional job sources, such as newspapers or career fairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894439311402147">Allen, Mahto, &amp; Otondo, 2007</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-0894439311402147">
<title>The Importance of Recruitment Messages</title>
<p>The actual content of the recruitment websites is important to attract, engage, and influence applicant reactions and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894439311402147">Cober, Brown, Blumental, Doverspike, &amp; Levy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894439311402147">Dineen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894439311402147">Dineen &amp; Noe, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439311402147">Palmer (2002)</xref> sees content as the amount and variety of available information that is congruent with a viewer’s objectives when viewing the website. Organizations manage the information they make available on recruitment websites, which can influence applicants’ perceptions and/or the images that they form about an organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894439311402147">Cober, Brown, Keeping, &amp; Levy, 2004</xref>). For example, some organizations choose to highlight workplace awards they have received or provide information about their company’s products and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439311402147">Cappelli, 2001</xref>). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894439311402147">Braddy, Meade, and Kroustalis (2006)</xref> found that company websites transmit important information to applicants about their culture through the manipulation of website design features and recruitment messages.</p>
<p>The amount of information that different recruitment websites provide to applicants is an important factor in applicant reactions and decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894439311402147">Barber &amp; Roehling, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894439311402147">Cober et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894439311402147">Nielson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894439311402147">Zottoli &amp; Wanous, 2000</xref>). Too much information may overwhelm job seekers, while too little may leave them unsatisfied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894439311402147">Cober et al., 2000</xref>). Missing information about an organization and job appears to be problematic in recruitment; job seekers cope with missing information by making inferences of their own about an organization, and the types of inferences job seekers make vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894439311402147">Barber &amp; Roehling, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894439311402147">Maurer, Howe, and Lee (1992)</xref> found that the lack of information decreased the likelihood that applicants would accept a job offer. Finally, applicants may have difficulty obtaining information about an organization and jobs available leading to fewer decisions to apply to an organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894439311402147">Cable &amp; Turban, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Today, many organizations now customize their recruitment messages to create greater positive affect toward an organization and to encourage applicants to apply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439311402147">Cappelli, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894439311402147">Dineen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894439311402147">Dineen &amp; Noe, 2009</xref>). A message is customized when it targets recruitment information to individual job seekers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894439311402147">Dineen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894439311402147">Dineen &amp; Noe, 2009</xref>). For example, a telemarketing company may target college students for entry-level positions by suggesting that these positions are excellent opportunities for part-time work while the students are in school. Also, more realistic information about the job allows applicants to make informed decisions when applying to jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894439311402147">Phillips, 1998</xref>). The specificity of the recruitment message increases the effectiveness of customization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894439311402147">Dineen &amp; Noe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894439311402147">Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894439311402147">Roberson, Collins, &amp; Oreg, 2005</xref>). Research has suggested that customizing recruitment messages can lead to better fitting applicants, smaller applicant pools, and higher applicant quality in the applicant pool. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894439311402147">Dineen and colleagues (2007)</xref> found that good website aesthetics and customized information are more likely to motivate applicants that perceive themselves to be a poor fit to abandon the application process than motivate applicants that perceive themselves as a good fit to continue the application process. Unfortunately, few companies have utilized message customization in their recruitment strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439311402147">Cappelli, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894439311402147">Dineen &amp; Noe, 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-0894439311402147">
<title>Organizational Recruitment Websites</title>
<p>Around 90% of US companies, small and large, are using their own career pages or job-specific websites for recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894439311402147">Chapman &amp; Webster, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894439311402147">Cober et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894439311402147">2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439311402147">Peter’s (2001)</xref> indicated that after a company’s own home page, the company’s career or recruitment websites was the next most likely page to be viewed in general. It is suggested that up to 80% of applicants submit their resumes through organizational websites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894439311402147">Slywotzky, 1999</xref>); but, few have compared the differences in staffing outcomes between organizational and third-party web recruitment websites.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0894439311402147">
<title>Third-Party Websites</title>
<p>Third-party websites are different than organizational websites because they allow recruiters to post jobs onto a website that is not owned by their own organization. The third-party website then categorizes the job post to allow job seekers to search using a number of different search fields. Search fields or categories include keyword, location, company, industry, occupation, job title, and job type. Most third-party websites sort out applicants that may not fit with an organization based on two categories: (a) mobility (willingness to relocate or travel) and (b) available start dates. However, large volumes of resumes from unqualified applicants still get passed on to recruiters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439311402147">Cappelli, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>These websites have risen in use and popularity by both job seekers and organizations alike since the creation of Monster.com (1994) Careerbuilder.com (1995). Ten years ago, it was estimated that Monster.com’s database contained at least 13% of the US labor force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439311402147">Cappelli, 2001</xref>). A more recent estimate suggests that millions use third-party websites per month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894439311402147">Jones &amp; Dages, 2003</xref>). One reason for this suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439311402147">Cappelli (2001)</xref> is that third-party websites are seen as more trustworthy and objective by applicants than information provided from employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439311402147">Cappelli, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Contrarily, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894439311402147">Cober and colleagues (2000)</xref> suggested that third-party websites merely provide generic job-relevant information and do not provide much unique organizational information to prospective employees. Third-party websites may limit the amount of information applicants can gain about a job and organization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894439311402147">Braddy et al. (2006)</xref> suggest that this may be due to the costs of posting jobs on third-party websites. However, job seekers can navigate away from a company’s third-party post to learn more about the company. Likely for these reasons, some organizations immediately direct applicants to their own recruitment websites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894439311402147">Zusman &amp; Landis, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Current Research</title>
<p>This study assesses perceived differences in applicant quality using applicants from different web recruitment sources (both organizational and third-party). Applicant quality for the purpose of this study refers to judgments made by recruiters about applicants based on congruency with posted job descriptions and other job and organizational attributes. Applicant quality ratings were contained in an organizational database, which contained biographical information and the source through which applicants learned about a position vacancy. This study assesses if applicant quality is different between recruitment sources, specifically organizational websites, and third-party websites.</p>
<p>Building off of the suggestions of past research that organizational websites provide greater organizational-specific information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894439311402147">Braddy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894439311402147">Cober et al., 2000</xref>), this article proposes based on past research that:<disp-quote>
<p>Hypothesis 1: Significant differences will be found between organizational and third-party sources in perceived applicant quality, such that organizational website sources will yield higher perceptions of applicant quality compared to third-party websites.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This study used a convenience sample of resumes from job applicants rated by human resource personnel from a midsize publishing company (around 200 employees) in Minnesota. Resumes and cover letters were entered into an applicant database and given one rating by human resource personnel in terms of applicant quality. Position vacancies that were applied for ranged in job type from entry-level to mid-level managerial positions. Many positions were specialized such as print buyer or graphic designer.</p>
<p>This study compares the average ratings of applicant quality of five web recruitment sources: (a) An organizational website; (b) Careerbuilder.com; (c) Monster.com; (d) MarketingJobs.com; and (e) StarTribune.com. Identical information was posted on all websites for each job post so long as word limits were not constraining. Recruitment information remained posted on all five websites until the positions were filled. The source that applicants heard about the job posting was noted in the database. This notation was made only since around January of 2008 and the data was collected in August of 2009. Additionally, gender as perceived by the human resource personnel from the names provided on the resumes and cover letters and places of residence were entered into the database.</p>
<p>The sample for this study contained 1179 resumes rated by human resource personnel, using a 5-point rating scale (e.g., A, A/B, B, B/C, or C). The human resource employees were rated by both the director of recruitment and her female assistant. Occasionally, a male summer intern assisted in rating resumes as well. The recruitment director reviewed ratings by the assistant and interns and determined the final score. In the dataset, ratings were converted to numerical ratings (A = 5; A/B = 4; B = 3; B/C = 2; C = 1). Biographical information and ratings were subsequently entered into the applicant database. The database contained 605 (51.3%) female applicants, 500 (42.4%) male applicants, and 74 (6.3%) uncategorized. The majority of applicants (943, 80.0%) resided in Minnesota; thus, 236 (20.0%) resided outside the State.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0894439311402147">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to explore differences between recruitment sources. Contrast tests were used to assess the differences between the two types of web recruitment sources: (a) An organizational website and (b) the four third-party web sources. Post hoc analyses included the Games-Howell procedure for analyzing differences between each source. Two <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to explore differences between genders and places of residence.</p>
<p>Applicant ratings were not normally distributed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894439311402147">Figure 1</xref>
). The majority of resumes were given C ratings (44.105%). The second largest group of resumes and cover letters received B’s (27.566%). The B/C rating was the least prevalent (7.209%).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The one-way ANOVA and contrast test findings confirm findings of past research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439311402147">Cappelli, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894439311402147">Cober et al., 2000</xref>) regarding the differences between online recruitment sources and recruitment outcomes. Organizational websites appear to be superior in their ability to draw in quality applicants. Though this study did not manipulate the recruitment information made available on each type of website, the findings suggest that organizational websites present more important information to applicants than third-party websites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894439311402147">Braddy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894439311402147">Cober et al., 2000</xref>). A future experimental study could look for an interaction effect between website type, recruitment messages, and applicant quality. This study could perhaps explain the reasons for the post hoc differences found between Monster and Careerbuilder.</p>
<p>In this study it is important to note the difference in the average quality of applicants and the distribution of applicant quality scores. The source that generated the most applicants, Careerbuilder.com also generated the most low quality applicants; however, it also provided the same number of high quality applicants as the organization’s website. Organizations that want to gain a critical mass of high quality applicants may still want to use third-party websites, but they must be willing to deal with a large number of low-quality applicants. Future research should work to further minimize the number of low scoring applicants in recruitment pools.</p>
<p>The post hoc findings regarding the effects of gender align with past findings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894439311402147">Etaugh &amp; Kasley, 1981</xref>).Women often have perceived the characteristics of selection systems as unfair because they may have a greater degree of sensitivity to the fairness of selection systems compared to men; thus, the findings of this study indicate the possibility of a self-fulfilling prophecy in women’s perceptions of fairness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894439311402147">Chapman, Uggerslev, Carroll, Piasentin, &amp; Jones, 2005</xref>). Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894439311402147">Etaugh and Kasley’s (1981)</xref> study found that participants rated male applicants higher than females when given identical application materials. Job type may also have an influence (not assessed in this study), such that the effects of gender bias are higher with jobs traditionally seen as of a masculine nature as found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894439311402147">Gerdes and Garber (1983)</xref>. Finally, the absence of an interaction effect between gender and recruitment source indicates that women and men may not be inclined to use different sources for job searches. Future research on recruitment regarding gender differences should continue to focus on recruiters’ perceptions of applicant quality.</p>
<p>The significant differences found between in-state and out-of-state applicants are also interesting to note. This finding is particularly interesting because of the potential costs of relocation packages and the fact that websites can be viewed across the world in contrast with regional job listings. No studies to this date have researched in-depth the reasons for these differences in the web recruitment context.</p>
<p>This sample may have been limited by the non-normal distribution of ratings. However, significant differences were still found between recruitment sources, such that organizational websites provided higher quality applicants than third-party websites. The sample may also been limited by the uneven amounts of ratings from each recruitment source. Future studies should work to confirm or deny these findings as well as control for the statistical and sampling limitations seen in this study.</p>
<p>This study provides insight into why third-party websites generate such large applicant pools as seen by the distribution of applications received and rated. Clearly, third-party websites have a larger applicant pool to draw from as seen by the distribution of recruitment sources. Naturally, the use of multiple sources increases the amount of applicants to solicit from. Companies that want to increase their applicant pools should continue to utilize multiple sources, specifically third-party sources; however, if companies desire to filter out more poor fitting applicants from their applicant pools, then they may consider customizing their own organizational website. This customization will allow the company more control over the amount and specificity of information presented. Unfortunately, it still remains unclear why organizational websites attracted more qualified applicants in this study; only future studies can tell.</p>
