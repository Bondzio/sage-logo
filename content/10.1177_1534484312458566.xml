<abstract>
<p>This article is a response to the preceding article (Alagaraja &amp; Wang, 2012) on developing a National Human Resource Development Strategy Model. While the article makes significant contributions to the body of literature on National Human Resource Development, there are some limitations to the article, including the selection of the two countries of India and China; unaddressed challenges in these two countries; an imprecise application of the concept of a model; the attempt to create a model based on only two countries; the databases used for the literature review; and the inadequacy of the model developed in the article. Several recommendations for future research are also proposed.</p>

<p>“Towards the Development of a National HRD Strategy Model: Cases of India and China” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312458566">Alagaraja &amp; Wang, 2012</xref>) makes an excellent contribution to the growing number of articles that are addressing National Human Resource Development (NHRD), helping us move toward a theory of NHRD, as called for by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534484312458566">Wang and Swanson (2008)</xref> and concurred in by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534484312458566">McLean, Lynham, Azevedo, Lawrence, and Nafukho (2008)</xref>. Because there are so many differences among the world’s countries and because the concept, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312458566">Alagaraja and Wang (2012)</xref> is so complex, McLean et al. anticipated that the process of reaching a theory would be difficult, if not impossible, because one size will never fit all of the countries. Yet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312458566">Alagaraja and Wang (2012)</xref> propose as the purpose of their article the ability to “describe and prescribe NHRD strategies” (p. 3). The descriptions in this article do contribute to the growing body of literature that helps us to understand NHRD better, at least in the specific contexts of India and China. But to expect any such description to “prescribe” (p. 3) is going to be futile.</p>
<p>NHRD has become a popular research topic. At the recent European Human Resource Development (HRD) conference in Portugal, for example, there were two papers explicitly on the topic of NHRD, while closely related papers were also presented on workforce development, national vocational education, sustainability and sufficiency economies, local or community development, military HRD, civil service development, national health services, children’s services, public administration, and others. It is clear that HRD has burst from its former constraints of corporate focus alone. So the choice of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312458566">Alagaraja and Wang (2012)</xref> to concentrate on a preliminary effort at moving the concept of NHRD forward is commendable and important within HRD.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are problems with some of the assumptions made (but not articulated) and limitations (not stated) that do limit the extent to which this article really addresses the desire for a strategic NHRD model. The purpose of this response article is to highlight areas where greater caution is needed. I will also offer some recommendations for moving the research interest in NHRD forward.</p>
<sec id="section1-1534484312458566">
<title>Country Selection</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312458566">Alagaraja and Wang (2012)</xref> chose two of the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) countries to compare. This is a legitimate choice given the amount of interest that exists today in these emerging economies that have continued to grow in spite of the worldwide recession. Furthermore, both countries are in Asia, and, as accurately identified, there has been less (but not no) focus on Asia. Given the national origins of Alagaraja and Wang, this choice is not surprising and, in fact, is an advantage in providing us with cultural understandings and language abilities that would not be available to scholars from outside of these two countries.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in terms of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312458566">Alagaraja and Wang’s (2012)</xref> objective of model-development, any two-country comparison is going to be very limited. It will add another piece to the puzzle, but it is like one piece in a 1,000 piece jigsaw puzzle—necessary but still a long ways to go.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1534484312458566">
<title>Unaddressed NHRD Challenges in These Two Countries</title>
<p>I am not an expert on either country. Nevertheless, my experiences working in both countries suggest that there are some issues that create real challenges for both countries that were not addressed in the article.</p>
<p>First, both countries have some cultural characteristics that appear to be impediments in an economy that requires a creative workforce able to work effectively in innovation. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534484312458566">Hofstede, Hofstede, and Minkov (2010)</xref>, both countries are high in power distance. This could be a factor in restricting innovation in such countries. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534484312458566">L.D. McLean (2011)</xref> found, one factor that contributes to innovation, as measured by patent submissions, is non-controlling supervisors, a condition much more likely to be found in a low power distance culture.</p>
<p>Second, because of its one-child policy, China now has a gap of some 40 to 60 million more men than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534484312458566">Baculinao, 2004</xref>). This disparity has the potential of being disruptive both socially and economically.</p>
<p>Third, both countries continue to face huge disparities between urban and rural populations. So, while both countries have experienced almost unprecedented economic growth, this growth has been limited to urban settings, leaving a discontented agricultural sector that has not experienced similar economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534484312458566">Fan, Chan-Kang, &amp; Mukhenee, 2005</xref>). In 2009, China ranked 28th of 140 countries for its income disparity, though India does much better, ranking 80th but on much older data (2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534484312458566">Country comparison, n.d.</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1534484312458566">
<title>Modeling</title>
<p>The concept of models is embedded in the article, and creating a model for NHRD strategy is the objective of the article. Yet, in spite of many references throughout the article to model, nowhere in the article did <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312458566">Alagaraja and Wang(2012)</xref> define what they mean by model.</p>
<p>There are many interpretations of model. One such interpretation is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534484312458566">Wiersman and Jurs (2009)</xref>:<disp-quote>
<p>Models are hypothesized or conceptualized descriptions of the relationships (connections) between (sic.) a number of variables. They are attempts to explain phenomena… However, simply conceptualizing a model is not an adequate research endeavor. The model must be specified in terms of its variables and tested with observed data. (p. 309)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This description is consistent with most definitions of research models. Given this definition, and the fact that there are no variables in any of the models discussed in the article, including the outcome model, both the title and the use within the article are inappropriate. Typology, as suggested at one point in the article, or description may be more accurate than the use of model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1534484312458566">
<title>Cross-Country Comparisons</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312458566">Alagaraja and Wang(2012)</xref> argued that the best way to create a model is through cross-country comparisons, and they argued further that there have been very few such studies. They claimed that this study was filling a “gap,” and they claimed that their work would “more accurately examine” (p. 2) the concept of NHRD. In fact, two of the references that they relied on extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534484312458566">Lynham, Paprock, &amp; Cunningham, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534484312458566">McLean, Cho, &amp; Osman-Gani, 2004</xref>), though not included in their references, provided multiple cross-country comparisons. The difference between these two works and the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312458566">Alagaraja and Wang (2012)</xref> is that the current authors provided much more detail in their comparison. Nevertheless, for accuracy, the claim of greater detail is valid, while the claims of uniqueness and greater accuracy, are not, unless the authors wish to argue that the country case studies and the cross-country comparisons of the earlier works were not accurate and that they did not do cross-country comparisons.</p>
<p>However, to make the argument that two-country comparisons are essential for developing a robust model is problematic. There are currently 196 countries in the world. I went way back to my college math course to calculate the number of combinations of two country comparisons among the 196 countries, and this would currently require 19,110 research studies! I recognize that some will argue that this includes some very small economies that are not as important as emerging economies such as India and China. Nevertheless, NHRD, for those small economies, may be more important to them than for the larger economies. Yet, it is obviously the case that this number of research studies will never be conducted. Therefore, we need to continue to urge the continuation of both single case NHRD studies and multiple cross-country studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1534484312458566">
<title>Databases Used</title>
<p>Unfortunately, we do not know what data bases were used in conducting the literature review. All we know is that there were two literature searches—one HRD and one non-HRD. But what does that really mean? Given the lack of a clear and widely accepted definition of HRD, it is difficult to know what each search would include. What we are told is that the non-HRD search included economics and sociology, but why just those two areas? In fact, given Alagaraja and Wang’s comments, public policy should also have been included. What about vocational education, career and technical education, and education? Were such journals included in the HRD literature, or was such literature overlooked in the literature review?</p>
<p>Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312458566">Alagaraja and Wang (2012)</xref> claimed that the HRD and non-HRD literature contained different foci (developing and underdeveloped countries versus developed countries). Yet, their review of the literature does not support this conclusion. Both types of literature contain reference to countries across this entire continuum.</p>
<p>What we are also not told is whether literature in the two target countries was included in the literature review. India has a well-developed literature presence in HRD, as well as in other fields potentially associated with NHRD. In fact, given that India appears to have been the first country to have a Ministry of Education and HRD, one might reasonably expect education journals in the country to focus on NHRD. But I do not know if databases exist for Indian professional journals or, if available, if they were used in the literature review for this article.</p>
<p>Then we have the problem with language. Most Chinese literature exists in Chinese languages only. As one author has Chinese language expertise, it is possible that this literature was reviewed. But we simply don’t know. And I am uncertain about the existence of databases in China, as well. As with all literature reviews, there are generally language limitations. So, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312458566">Alagaraja and Wang (2012)</xref> concluded that there are nine models (in Table 1, p. 415), it seems viable that there could be literature in French, Spanish, German, Russian, and so on that were not available to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312458566">Alagaraja and Wang (2012)</xref> because of language problems or the absence of such literature in existing and available data bases. I wish that this were not the case for scholars in HRD, but it is a limitation that we all face in doing research. Thus, not only does this require us to state such a limitation, but it also reminds us to be modest in the claims that we make about the existence of other literature.</p>

<sec id="section6-1534484312458566">
<title>Inadequacy of Model Developed</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312458566">Alagaraja and Wang(2012)</xref> rightly classified the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534484312458566">McLean et al. (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534484312458566">Lynham et al. (2006)</xref> as static, at a given point in time. Figure 1 does add an historical perspective to the NHRD approaches used within the two countries of interest: India and China. However, while expanding the depiction historically, this figure, too, is static, reflecting the situation only today. It does not project into the future to suggest the direction the two countries are moving and where they are likely to be at some point in the future.</p>
<p>There is a further concern about the figure in the article. What is depicted in Figure 1 (p. 424) is not a model. There are no variables. There are no hypothesized relationships. In fact, this figure would be more accurately described as an historical typology rather than a model. It is because of the lack of any variables that it is impossible to use the existing knowledge to predict where these countries are likely to be at some time in the future.</p>
<p>Another concern is that the figure depicts only the economic and perhaps historical perspectives, even after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312458566">Alagaraja and Wang (2012)</xref> rightly criticized existing literature for not being more holistic in their perspective of NHRD. Where in Figure 1 is there any indication of the other important characteristics of NHRD, such as health, safety, education, culture, demographic characteristics, income disparities, and other factors that influence NHRD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1534484312458566">
<title>Recommendations for Future Research</title>
<p>All of the NHRD research with which I am familiar looks at the outcome effects of an NHRD approach within a country. What would be very beneficial is to acquire information on the process of creating an NHRD approach within a country. How do countries go about creating NHRD policies and practices? Where does the impetus come for moving a country toward an NHRD approach?</p>
<p>Another valuable research approach would be to conduct mega-research on numerous countries at one time, instead of continuing to rely on one-country and two-country case studies. We have a good example of how this could be done with a published article authored by more than 40 authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534484312458566">Ralston et al., 2011</xref>), each representing a different country of 41, with a lead researcher responsible for synthesizing the results across all of the countries. Given the value gained from this study of two countries, imagine how powerful the results would be if we could conduct such a mega study.</p>
<p>While there are clearly benefits in having research done by someone from the culture of interest, there is also benefit from having scholars from outside of the culture at least partnering in the research. Perhaps this occurred in the current study, but there is no apparent evidence that such is the case. This recommendation is similar to recommendations commonly made in the organization development field to have internal and external consultants partnering to bring different perspectives to the practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534484312458566">McLean, 2006</xref>), and, in this case, to the research.</p>
<p>We are now far enough along in efforts of countries to experiment with NHRD that have failed. Understanding why countries failed and how they attempted to correct those aspects that failed will help us understand the concept of NHRD in a much better way. Most of the existing research has assumed that existing efforts have succeeded, when it is clear that there have been failures or at least areas identified in which changes are needed. Having a more balanced perspective of NHRD efforts will be beneficial in improving such practices moving forward.</p>
<p>Research that explores more holistic perspectives of NHRD is critical. All of the approaches identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312458566">Alagaraja and Wang (2012)</xref> focus almost exclusively on economic development. Future research needs to expand this view of NHRD to confront the complexity that exists within countries requiring NHRD approaches.</p>
<p>What is particularly valuable to scholars interested in NHRD is that we continue to be at early stages in research, meaning that there is a great deal of research that will be needing on NHRD to move us forward in our understanding of the concept. Almost any research done on NHRD will contribute to the growing body of literatureon NHRD. If it will ever be possible for us to create a theory or model of NHRD, there will have to be an extensive database of countries that have embraced NHRD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1534484312458566">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312458566">Alagaraja and Wang (2012)</xref> have made major contributions to our understanding about NHRD and how countries can move between different approaches to NHRD over time. Their review of the literature, especially that in the non-HRD literature, has provided new insights into our conceptualizations of NHRD. I hope that Alagaraja and Wang’s rebuttal will shed light on some of the concerns raised in this response</p>
