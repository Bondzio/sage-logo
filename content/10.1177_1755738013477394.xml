<abstract>
<p>In the UK, cancer accounted for 30% of all deaths registered in 2011, with a rate of 2083 deaths per million population for males and 1513 deaths per million population for females. At some point in their journey, many of these patients will receive treatment with chemotherapy. As the survival rates for cancer increase, GPs will see increased numbers of patients suffering from long term side effects of treatment, some of which are currently unknown. There are hundreds of different chemotherapy agents and agents are administered in many different combinations. Although it would be impossible to know the mechanism of action and side effect profile of each one, GPs need to be aware of the general principles of chemotherapy treatment, the potentially dangerous side effects and how to manage them. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of chemotherapy treatment, the common side effects, the management of these and the role of the GP in relation to the care given by the oncology team.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1755738013477394"><title>What causes cancer?</title>
<p>The cell cycle is a series of events that produces DNA duplication and cell division. In a healthy cell growth, promoting and growth restraining signals are carefully balanced to ensure that cell division only occurs when required. Programmed cell death (termed ‘apoptosis’) is also at work to remove unwanted cells. In a tumour cell this fine balance of events is disrupted and unrestrained cell division occurs. In addition, apoptosis may no longer operate correctly, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells.</p>
<p>Cancers start from a single cell or small group of cells that have undergone single or multiple gene mutations. Many different factors can result in gene mutations, including age, carcinogens, familial mutations, viruses, immunosuppression and lifestyle.</p>
<p>There are three different types of genes that contribute to making a cell cancerous:
<list id="list2-1755738013477394" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Oncogenes: encourage the cell to multiply; mutations in oncogenes will cause rapid proliferation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tumour suppressor genes, e.g. p53: specifically stop cells multiplying and encourage apoptosis; if they stop working, the cell will carry on multiplying</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>DNA repair genes: normally repair any damage to the cell’s DNA; if they are not working then faulty or mutated DNA is replicated</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Current statistics from Cancer Research show that the three most common cancers for females in 2009 were breast, lung and bowel cancer. The most common for males were lung, bowel and prostate cancer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1755738013477394"><title>What is chemotherapy?</title>
<p>The term ‘chemotherapy’ can refer to the use of any drug, but ‘cytotoxic chemotherapy’ refers specifically to drugs that kill cells. Chemotherapy agents can fall into two groups: those that act on cells during the dividing phase of the cell cycle (cell-cycle-specific chemotherapies) and drugs that work whilst cells are in the resting phase of the cell cycle (non-cell-cycle-specific chemotherapies).</p>
<p>There are many different types of chemotherapies used (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1755738013477394">Box 1</xref>). With the development of so many different regimes, there is a great deal of crossover between chemotherapies, regimes and cancer type. The online resource ‘Chemocare’ takes each chemotherapy, gives information on the type of chemotherapy it is, how it works, which sorts of cancer it treats and its side effect profile. This is also a useful website to point patients to if they are keen to know more about their treatment.

<p>When planning chemotherapy a number of factors are taken into account including the type of cells affected, the rate at which they divide and the time at which the chemotherapy is likely to be effective. Treatment regimes are usually made up of both cell-cycle-specific and non-cell-cycle-specific chemotherapies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately cytotoxic chemotherapies do not differentiate between healthy cells and cancer cells. The drugs are usually more effective at killing rapidly dividing cells, which is typical of cancer cells. However, numerous healthy cells are destroyed in the process and take time to grow back; therefore serious side effects can occur.</p>
<p>As well as chemotherapy, other therapies are used to treat cancer such as: targeted therapies (monoclonal antibodies, angiogenesis inhibitors), biologic response modifiers and hormone therapies. More information and a simple overview of these therapies can be found on the online resource ‘Chemocare’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1755738013477394"><title>Short term side effects of chemotherapy</title>
<p>Some side effects of chemotherapy treatment are immediate, such as allergic reaction or extravasation of chemotherapy, but patients are more likely to encounter the side effects that develop over the days or weeks after chemotherapy is initiated. The short term side effects are usually dealt with by the oncology team as the patient often has open access. At times patients may present to their GP instead of their oncology team and due to the potentially serious nature of chemotherapy side effects, it is important that, as GPs, we have a good understanding of them.</p>
<sec id="sec5-1755738013477394"><title>Myelosuppression</title>
<p>There is a very high turnover of cells in bone marrow and therefore it is very sensitive to cytotoxic chemotherapy. The main constituents of blood produced by the bone marrow are platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells. Chemotherapy treatment does not immediately cause these cell counts to drop because in a chemotherapy naive person there are sufficient cells in the peripheral bloodstream. As the peripheral cells die off and are not replaced by the bone marrow, the cell count falls. Therefore this drop in cell counts does not occur until at least a week after the chemotherapy is given. The point at which cell count in the peripheral blood is at its lowest is called the ‘nadir'. In the case of white cells and platelets this is usually 7–10 days after administration of chemotherapy. For red blood cells it is usually 3–4 weeks after treatment has started. The timing of the nadir will be slightly different for different chemotherapies and there is detailed information regarding this on the ‘Chemocare’ website.</p>
<p>Although having low counts in any of these bone marrow constituents can cause serious problems, neutropenia is immediately life threatening. Having a neutrophil concentration lower than 1.5 × 10<sup>9</sup>/l is widely accepted as a definition of neutropenia. Having a low count results in the body's ability to fight infection being greatly compromised, which can cause minor infections to become serious and potentially lead to overwhelming sepsis. There are no symptoms of neutropenia in and of itself, but in anyone where there is the possibility of being neutropenic, the following symptoms or signs must be taken very seriously:
<list id="list3-1755738013477394" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Temperature (over 38℃ or under 36℃ and unwell with signs of infection)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Rigors/sweating</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cough or difficulty in breathing</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Diarrhoea/vomiting</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sore throat/mouth</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Erythema of skin</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dysuria</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Painful/swollen joints</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>It is often the case that the only symptom or sign of infection in a neutropenic person is a raised temperature. If a high temperature is present and neutropenia is a possibility, then the patient must be referred to secondary care for assessment immediately. Keeping such a patient at home whilst blood results are awaited can be dangerous as deterioration can happen rapidly. If other symptoms listed are present but there is no raised temperature and the patient is not particularly unwell, then it is possible that the patient could be managed at home providing adequate support structures and follow-up are in place. It also needs to be strongly reiterated that patients who develop a temperature or deteriorate in any way must seek medical help immediately (as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1755738013477394">Box 2</xref> emphasises).

<p>Thrombocytopenia is another result of myelosuppresion. It is defined as a platelet concentration lower than 100 × 10<sup>9</sup>/l. If a patient has received chemotherapy in the last couple of weeks and has signs of active bleeding (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1755738013477394">Box 3</xref>), refer for assessment including a full blood count and potential platelet transfusion.

<p>Anaemia commonly occurs 3–4 weeks after receiving chemotherapy as the lifespan of an erythrocyte is longer than a platelet or neutrophil. If anaemia is suspected and the clinical symptoms and signs are not severe, then it is appropriate to check blood in the community and then arrange for a blood transfusion as a day patient if needed.</p>
<p>Patients with anaemia may present with:

<sec id="sec6-1755738013477394"><title>Nausea and vomiting</title>
<p>Over the last decade there has been a development in the anti-emetic regimes used with chemotherapies, which has led to a better quality of life for patients. Despite this, nausea and vomiting can still be problematic. Nausea and vomiting varies in the fact that it can present immediately after chemotherapy is given or a few days later. It can often last for days at a time and then gradually subsides.</p>
<p>The main cause of these symptoms in patients receiving chemotherapy is activation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone. D2 and 5HT 3 receptors at the chemoreceptor trigger zone are activated by the circulating chemotherapy and cause nausea and vomiting. The anti-emetics that have a greater affinity to these receptors are domperidone, metoclopramide, haloperidol and 5HT3 antagonists such as ondansetron. 5HT3 antagonists should not be used for more than 5 days as they can cause constipation. Metoclopramide is probably the least effective anti-emetic but has good prokinetic action; it should not be used with cyclizine as these anti-emetics are thought to share the same pathway and therefore render each other ineffective.</p>
<p>However, alternative causes and mechanisms for nausea and vomiting must also be considered, such as anxiety, which is also known as ‘anticipatory nausea or vomiting’. It is important that nausea and vomiting are assessed in isolation as the causes and treatment can be quite different. It is far more effective to prevent nausea and vomiting rather than to treat it and depending on the emetic risk of the chemotherapy, anti-emetics are often given prior to the administration of chemotherapy. The American Society of Clinical Oncology has detailed information about the emetic risk of chemotherapies and which anti-emetics are used prior to administration.</p>
<p>Prolonged unremitting nausea is extremely debilitating and profoundly affects quality of life during chemotherapy. Prolonged vomiting can potentially be life threatening as the body becomes dehydrated, so careful assessment is required, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1755738013477394">Table 1</xref> demonstrates.

<p>Patients are usually discharged with a supply of anti-emetics after chemotherapy treatment. However, in particularly severe cases patients may need alternative combinations of medicines or the medication given by an intramuscular or intravenous route. It is important that GPs are aware of the mechanism of the nausea or vomiting, what receptors are being activated and therefore what the most appropriate anti-emetics are to prescribe and in what combinations. When dealing with anticipatory symptoms, non-pharmacological remedies are often helpful, such as massage, muscle relaxation and other complimentary therapies. The local palliative care team is a very good source of help and information when needed and there are many online resources (e.g. the North Yorkshire and York Primary Care Trust document on nausea and vomiting).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1755738013477394"><title>Diarrhoea</title>
<p>In patients receiving chemotherapy, the causes of diarrhoea can be multifactorial. As well as the chemotherapy itself, radiotherapy, medications, supplemental feeding and anxiety can all play a part. It can present at any point in the patient journey, but certain chemotherapy agents can alter the function of the small bowel, leading to changes in secretion and absorption, which can cause diarrhoea. This would usually occur a couple of days after administration of the chemotherapy or with some regimens that involve taking a course of chemotherapy tablets for a couple of weeks per cycle, and can last the entire time the chemotherapy tablets are being taken. Prolonged diarrhoea can lead to discomfort, poor quality of life, electrolyte imbalance and potential life threatening dehydration. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1755738013477394">Table 2</xref> shows how diarrhoea can be assessed and graded.

<p>When assessing patients with diarrhoea, oral intake and clinical hydration status need to be considered. Anti-diarrhoeal medication (e.g. loperamide or codeine) can be given but if a patient is continuing to have diarrhoea, is dehydrated, has moderate/severe abdominal cramping or blood in the stools, refer for specialist assessment and treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1755738013477394"><title>Constipation</title>
<p>Constipation can also be a problem for patients undergoing chemotherapy. This can be caused by certain chemotherapies such as vincristine or vinblastine, but it is quite commonly the result of medications given to ease the side effects of chemotherapy, such as anti-emetics (5HT3 antagonists) and dexamethasone. Most patients will be able to manage with dietary advice and laxatives. These are often initiated by the oncology team, with the GP becoming involved with ongoing prescribing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1755738013477394"><title>Oral mucositis</title>
<p>Oral mucositis is a result of inflammation of the epithelial cells lining the mouth and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1755738013477394">Fig. 1</xref> gives examples of this condition. It usually develops a few days after chemotherapy has been administered and tends to settle after a week. The severity can range from mild oral discomfort through to florid mucosal ulceration, making eating and drinking extremely difficult. The timing of onset often coincides with the patient being neutropenic and therefore vulnerable to oral infection, particularly thrush. If a patient complains of soreness of the mouth it is imperative to check for the presence of oral thrush and treat if needed. Prompt treatment of oral thrush with a course of anti-fungals can prevent deterioration and distress to the patient. This can be prescribed in primary care, but if patients are febrile or unable to tolerate food or fluids then they should be referred to secondary care for urgent assessment.
<fig id="fig1-1755738013477394" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Examples of oral mucositis</p>
<p>Reproduced with permission from the Virtual Medical Centre.com</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1755738013477394-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Some chemotherapies are known to be high risk for causing mucosal ulceration such as methotrexate. Folinic acid is given with chemotherapy as in some cases it has been shown to prevent or reduce the occurrence of ulceration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1755738013477394">Sugita, Matsushita, Kashiwazaki, Kosugi and Takahashi, 2012</xref>). The evidence for this, however, is controversial. Soreness of the mouth can also be eased by using local anaesthetic mouthwashes such as benzydamine hydrochloride spray, which can be diluted with water if it causes stinging.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1755738013477394"><title>Palmar–plantar syndrome</title>
<p>It is thought that palmar–plantar syndrome (also called palmar–plantar erythrodysesthesia) is caused by small amounts of the chemotherapy leaking from the capillaries (extravasation) into tissues of the palms and soles. The leakage causes redness, tenderness, tingling and occasionally peeling and blistering of the skin. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1755738013477394">Figure 2</xref> gives an example of a presentation of palmar–plantar syndrome. Palmar–plantar syndrome tends to develop 3–4 weeks after the initiation of chemotherapy rather than being an immediate side effect.
<fig id="fig2-1755738013477394" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Example of palmar plantar syndrome</p>
<p>Reprinted from European Journal of Oncology Nursing, 11(3), Webster-Gandy JD, How C, Harrold K, Palmar–plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE): A literature review with commentary on experience in a cancer centre, pages 238–247, Copyright (2007), with permission from Elsevier</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1755738013477394-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Taking measures to prevent palmar–plantar syndrome is important. Patients should be advised to reduce activities such as long walks, using tools that cause excessive friction and prolonged exposure to hot water. Keeping the skin thoroughly moisturised can also help with reducing the risk of peeling. The severity of palmar–plantar syndrome is graded from one to four, with grade one being painless erythema and grade four affecting the ability to walk and potentially requiring hospitalisation with infection. There is evidence than pyridoxine (vitamin B6) can be used to help treat the syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1755738013477394">Fabian, Molina, Slavic, Dahlberg and Giri, 1990</xref>), but one of the most important factors in the ongoing management of the condition is to ensure that the chemotherapy prescriber is aware so that doses can be reduced or the length between cycles increased.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1755738013477394"><title>Nail changes</title>
<p>Some chemotherapies can cause nails to become flaky, brittle and occasionally discolour. This commonly starts to happen 3–4 weeks after starting treatment. Patients should be advised to keep them short, reducing the likelihood of them splitting. Nail varnish can be used to hide discoloration. These changes are usually reversible and gradually resolve over months once treatment with chemotherapy has finished.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1755738013477394"><title>Neurotoxicity</title>
<p>Peripheral sensory neuropathy is the most common form of neurotoxicity due to chemotherapy. It normally presents at least 3–4 weeks after the initiation of chemotherapy and often increases in severity with cumulative doses. It is most common with three particular groups used in chemotherapy: the vinca alkaloids, taxanes and platinum compounds. Presentation is usually with tingling or pins and needles in the fingers or toes, which can gradually spread if no action is taken and affect the rest of the limb. Patients who are severely affected can develop numbness, which makes fine motor movements such as doing up buttons or typing very difficult. This can have a profound effect on quality of life and so it is important that symptoms are assessed and documented on a regular basis. If patients present to primary care, it is important to alert the appropriate healthcare professional so changes to treatment can be made, as peripheral neuropathy is a dose-related side effect.</p>
<p>Neuropathy is generally reversible once the administration of chemotherapy has stopped, but this may take months. Recognising the symptoms early and taking action reduces the risk of permanent damage. If permanent damage does occur then patients often find benefit from treatment with tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline) or anti-epileptic agents (e.g. pregabalin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1755738013477394">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec13-1755738013477394"><title>Hair loss and hair thinning</title>
<p>Many chemotherapies may not cause complete hair loss but thin the hair. Although hair loss or hair thinning is not as physiologically serious as some of the other side effects, it can be devastating psychologically for some people. Hair loss normally occurs 3–4 weeks after chemotherapy is initiated and is usually temporary. Hair tends to start growing back a couple of months after chemotherapy is completed. The risk of hair loss is linked to which specific cytotoxic therapies are given. With some treatments hair loss is inevitable but with others it may not occur at all.</p>
<p>There are various methods suggested to try and reduce the risk of hair loss, such as wearing a ‘cold cap'. This causes vasoconstriction of the vessels supplying the scalp, thus reducing the blood supply to the hair follicles and reducing the effect of the circulating chemotherapy. Cold caps do carry potential risk due to the possibility of scalp metastases and the fact that due to the vasoconstriction, the administered chemotherapy may not adequately reach these areas. The most common way to deal with the problem of hair loss is to have a wig fitted and local oncology centres usually have access to wig and scarf fitting services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1755738013477394"><title>Altered nutritional status</title>
<p>Chemotherapy has a direct effect on the nutritional status of the patient due to a number of factors such as:
<list id="list8-1755738013477394" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Anorexia</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Nausea and vomiting</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Stomatitis</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Taste alteration</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Constipation or diarrhoea</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Colitis</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The cancer itself can cause changes to nutritional status by reducing appetite due to brain or liver metastases, gut obstruction and the psychological effects of having cancer. Many patients will have already started to lose weight and have evidence of malnutrition at presentation. Malnutrition increases the risk of infection and results in a poorer response to therapy and a faster decline in patient function. It is very important that the nutritional status of the patient is assessed promptly to try and prevent malnutrition. Nutritional supplements should be considered when patients have lost more than 10% of their body weight in the last 6 months. These are often initiated by secondary care and ongoing prescriptions continued by primary care. It can take time to find the appropriate supplement for each patient as patients can find them unpalatable. There is a lot of information about the nutritional care of people with cancer on the Macmillan website, including online learning modules.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1755738013477394"><title>Fatigue</title>
<p>Fatigue is a very common problem in patients receiving chemotherapy. It tends to develop within the first week or two of treatment, and as treatment continues can become more prominent. Once chemotherapy treatment has finished, it can take up to a year for the fatigue to fade. It is important to reassure the patient that tiredness is a normal part of treatment with chemotherapy and being active is a good way of coping with some of the physical changes and stress that treatment with chemotherapy can cause. The Macmillan website has an excellent section on ‘being active during treatments’. Patients can be pointed to this resource. When assessing a patient presenting with fatigue, it is important to consider other possible causes such as:
<list id="list9-1755738013477394" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Anaemia</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pain</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Clinical depression</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Infection</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1755738013477394"><title>Long term side effects of chemotherapy</title>
<p>It is important for GPs to be aware of the long term side effects of chemotherapy treatment as these are more likely to present to the GP than the short term side effects. As oncological treatment advances, there is a growing emphasis on ensuring that patients have a good quality of life after chemotherapy treatment, as opposed to survival bring the only aim. As increased knowledge is gained of long term side effects of chemotherapy, both doctors and patients can make more informed decisions regarding treatment, giving greater consideration to a patient’s future quality of life.</p>
<sec id="sec17-1755738013477394"><title>Infertility</title>
<p>Chemotherapy can adversely affect fertility, which can be particularly concerning for younger patients. Chemotherapy drugs damage the ovaries and affect non-replaceable oocytes and follicle development. Amenorrhoea is experienced by the majority of patients undergoing chemotherapy as a result of their treatment. In approximately a third of patients, spontaneous resolution of the menstrual cycle will occur and can continue for 6 months after treatment completion. Unfortunately the effect of chemotherapy on ovarian function can be permanent. Older women are more likely to be affected permanently and certain chemotherapy agents have a greater chance of causing non-reversible problems, for example the alkaysing agents. For women in whom fertility is a particular concern, options such as embryo or oocyte cryopreservation can be considered prior to chemotherapy treatment commencing.</p>
<p>Male fertility can also be affected by certain chemotherapy agents, e.g. cisplatin. One of the uses of cisplatin is in the treatment of testicular cancer, which is a malignancy that tends to affect younger men. The majority of patients receiving cisplatin will become azoospermic, but this is temporary in more than half of patients. It is worth noting, however, that it can take up to 3 years for spermatogenesis to recommence following treatment. Cryopreservation can also be discussed with male patients at risk of fertility problems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-1755738013477394"><title>Development of second primary cancers</title>
<p>Patients who have had a primary malignancy during their life time are at increased risk of developing a second primary cancer. Along with other factors, this increased risk is partly due to treatment, including chemotherapy. Two malignancies that are thought to be associated with chemotherapy treatment are acute myeloid leukemia and myelolodysplastic syndrome. As GPs we should have a higher index of suspicion of possible underlying malignancy in patients who have received chemotherapy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-1755738013477394"><title>Neurotoxicity</title>
<p>Chemotherapy can potentially affect cognitive functioning due to its neurotoxic effect. Research in this area is ongoing and further clarity needs to be gained. At present there is no treatment for chemotherapy-induced cognitive decline and methods of avoiding the problem developing are yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Although 30–40%of patients receiving chemotherapy will be affected by peripheral neuropathy to a certain extent, in some it can prove to be a long term problem. In addition to treatment of any discomfort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1755738013477394">NICE, 2010</xref>) with anticonvulsants or tricylic antidepressants, GPs can also give advice to patients to prevent further harm as a result of their sensory impairment. Such advice may include reminding patients to monitor their skin, advising them to wear correctly fitting shoes, ensuring that water is set at a safe temperature and professional podiatry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-1755738013477394"><title>Cardiovascular</title>
<p>Chemotherapy treatments have varying effects on the cardiovascular system depending upon the specific drug used. The anthracyclines are a group of widely used chemotherapy drugs that are known to cause cardiac failure. Cardiac complications of chemotherapy include chronic heart failure, hypertension, ischaemia, fibrosis, pericarditis and arrhythmias. As well as drug choice, patient factors also influence the likelihood of cardiac complications arising, for example older patients with underlying hypertension or other cardiac problems are at increased risk. The dose of chemotherapy and the route by which it is given also play a part. Although cardiac complications can arise in the short term, symptoms of cardiovascular complications may not become evident for years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-1755738013477394"><title>Chronic fatigue</title>
<p>The cause of chronic fatigue in patients treated with chemotherapy is multifactoral in origin and can be related to both the cancer itself as well as the treatment. Female patients and those treated for breast cancer and Hodgkin’s disease are more likely to be affected by chronic fatigue than other patient groups. Chronic fatigue can have a significant impact on patients’ lives, and discussing strategies to manage this symptom is helpful. Ensuring that a balance is achieved between exercise and rest and keeping a ‘fatigue diary’ to help patients identify when energy levels are highest can help patients to make the most of their time. Considering psychological input and complimentary therapies such as massage and aromatherapy can also be useful. GPs can provide valuable support to patients adjusting to this challenging symptom which can persist after treatment has been completed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-1755738013477394"><title>Pulmonary fibrosis</title>
<p>Lung fibrosis can be a long term complication of chemotherapy treatment. Certain chemotherapy agents have a higher propensity for causing fibrosis, for example bleomycin. Patients at increased risk include smokers, patients who have received mediastinal radiotherapy and those being treated with high doses.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-1755738013477394"><title>Patient education</title>
<p>Patient education is extremely important when a person is undergoing chemotherapy treatment. Because of the potentially serious side effects, in particular neutropenic sepsis, it is vital that the patient is aware of what symptoms to be vigilant for, and exactly what action should be taken should they arise. The department administering the chemotherapy will provide relevant information which should be in both a written and verbal format.</p>
<p>The National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death 2008 (NCEPOD- 2008) investigated patients who died within 30 days of receiving chemotherapy or systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT). The aim of the enquiry was to take a critical look at where the care of the patients who died could have been improved and to ascertain if there were any preventable deaths. Although the enquiry does not relate directly to the work of general practitioners, it is important to ask is there is anything GPs can do to improve patient care in the 30 days after receiving chemotherapy, and therefore reduce the risk of death. Part of the report showed that ‘17% of patients in the study who had a grade three or four toxicity delayed seeking help for 24 hours' (NCEPOD: SACT, 2008). Reasons for this were not made explicit, but often patients are not sure who they should be contacting when they experience symptoms.</p>
<p>The role of the GP during treatment is particularly important when managing vulnerable patients or those in difficult social situations where a support network may be lacking. GPs often have unique insight into a patient’s family background which can be especially useful in patients receiving chemotherapy. Such information can be used to ensure that key family members are involved and informed about treatment and can be used to anticipate problems. The impact of the continuity of care that GPs can provide to patients who will have seen numerous different healthcare professionals throughout their illnesses must not be underestimated.</p>
<p>GPs play an important part in patient education and can check patients’ understanding of the advice given to them. By clarifying information and providing further explanation if needed, GPs can help decrease the risks associated with chemotherapy. Making sure that patients know exactly how to get help is also key. Patients receiving chemotherapy are given ‘Alert Cards’ to carry in their wallets at all times. These cards contain information such as their consultant’s name, details of symptoms to watch out for, emergency contact numbers and action to be taken should they develop a temperature.</p>
<p>When practices receive notification that a patient is receiving chemotherapy it is helpful for the information to be documented clearly so it is immediately apparent that the patient is at risk of complications of chemotherapy. Documenting ‘neutropenic risk’ as an active problem in the electronic records or having ‘alerts’ on the notes can be a helpful strategy in ensuring staff are aware of the patient’s treatment. Informing reception of the importance of such alerts is also important.</p>
<p>GPs may like further information about specific chemotherapy treatments, in which case the hospital may be able to provide relevant leaflets. Information can also be obtained via the Information Prescription Resource which can be accessed via the NHS choices website and provides accurate helpful information to both patient and healthcare professional. Treatment summaries are now being used to communicate details of treatment and possible side effects to GPs. Having up-to-date records being sent through to GPs will improve patient care and provide valuable information to the GP as to what side effects to watch out for.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-1755738013477394"><title>Patient referral pathways</title>
<p>As well as patients being educated as to when and how to access medical help, GPs also need to be aware of how to refer patients and seek specialist advice. Although referral pathways will inevitably vary according to local policy, there are likely to be similarities in services available between trusts. Hospital trusts will tend to have a lead chemotherapy nurse who can be contacted directly at all times, possibly via a bleep number, which can be obtained via the hospital switchboard. Out of hours there should also be a chemotherapy nurse available, although this nurse may be based on the ward. Chemotherapy nurses are helpful for providing advice relating to both routine queries and urgent problems. There may also be an acute oncology team able to assist with any concerns. As a GP it is useful to know how to refer patients on chemotherapy both in and out of hours and to know whether this is via the medical registrar on call, chemotherapy nurse, oncology team or ward. Knowledge of this information will enable patients with possible neutropenic sepsis to be managed efficiently and safely.</p>
