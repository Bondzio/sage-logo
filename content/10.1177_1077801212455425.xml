<p>This issue of <italic>Violence Against Women</italic> opens with two articles on dating violence. First, Tameka Gillum and Gloria DiFulvio report the findings of their study of dating violence among sexual minority youth, aged 18 to 24. As Gillum and DiFulvio point out, most studies of dating violence among this understudied population have concentrated on trying to estimate prevalence. But Gillum and DiFulvio’s focus was on the youth’s perceptions of factors that contribute to dating violence among same-sex couples. Their participants discussed several themes, including internalized and societal homophobia, negotiating socially prescribed gender roles and, among women in their sample, assuming a “female connection.” Gillum and DiFulvio discuss the service implications of these findings as well as issues that should be explored in future research.</p>
<p>Barbara Ball and her colleagues discuss a program for reducing dating violence, the Expect Respect program. Expect Respect is a selective prevention strategy that uses support groups for middle school and high school students—female and male—who are at risk of perpetrating and/or being victimized by peer and dating violence. Ball et al. report that the preliminary findings from their evaluation of Expect Respect indicate significant increases in healthy relationship skills among the students who complete the program. Moreover, perpetration and victimization rates were significantly lower at program completion among a subsample of participants who had above average baseline levels of perpetration and victimization—an encouraging finding, to say the least.</p>
<p>Mieko Yoshihama, Aparna Ramakrishnan, Amy Hammock, and Mahmooda Pasha also discuss an IPV prevention program, the Shanti Program. Yoshihama and her colleagues report the process through which they collaborated with leaders of the Gujarati community (an Asian Indian community) in a Midwestern city to develop the program that includes a social marketing campaign and other activities that address IPV at various levels: individual, relationship/family, organization, and community. Their experiences will be helpful to other researchers and advocates who wish to develop population-specific IPV prevention programming.</p>
<p>Conny Roggeband examines policy responses to IPV in her article, which focuses on the evolution of legislation in the Netherlands and Spain from 1980 to 2009. Roggeband documents the different trajectories IPV policies have taken in these two countries. She shows how The Netherlands, which started out with a strong, feminist-informed response, has gradually marginalized IPV as a policy issue. In contrast, Spain, which got off to a slow start in responding to IPV, has recently developed what Roggeband considers innovative and far reaching policies. Roggeband argues that her research underlines the importance of frame negotiation, left-wing governments, and strong feminist mobilization in securing and sustaining meaningful policy responses to IPV.</p>
<p>The remaining articles in this issue look at factors that increase IPV risk. Lana Zannettino discusses IPV victimization among women in Liberian refugee communities in South Australia. Through focus group interviews, Zannettino found that women in this community perceive the disruption of traditional gender roles as contributing to IPV in a variety of ways. In addition, however, Zannettino emphasizes the need to understand Liberian refugee women’s experiences of IPV in the context of the prolonged and acute trauma and stress induced by war, loss, displacement, and resettlement.</p>
<p>Sunita Kishor analyzes data from the Demographic and Health Surveys from six developing countries in different parts of the world to determine the relationship between IPV and the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The DHS uses nationally representative samples of married and cohabiting couples. Kishor reports that IPV significantly increases STI risk, and this relationship remains robust even when controlling for other contributing factors, including husband’s self-reported STI status and women’s high-risk behaviors. So strong is the effect of IPV on STI risk that Kishor argues it is as important a contributing factor as other well-recognized risk factors, including multiple sexual partners and unprotected sex. Kishor’s findings have important implications for prevention and intervention programming not only in developing countries but also in economically developed ones as well.</p>
