<abstract>
<p>Perspectives on ageism have focused on descriptive stereotypes concerning what older people allegedly are. By contrast, we introduce <italic>prescriptive</italic> stereotypes that attempt to control how older people should be: encouraging active Succession of envied resources, preventing passive Consumption of shared resources, and avoidance of symbolic, ingroup identity resources. Six studies test these domains, utilizing vignette experiments and simulated behavioral interactions. Across studies, younger (compared with middle-aged and older) raters most resented elder violators of prescriptive stereotypes. Moreover, these younger participants were most polarized toward older targets (compared with middle-aged and younger analogues)—rewarding elders most for prescription adherences and punishing them most for violations. Taken together, these findings offer a novel approach to ageist prescriptions, which disproportionately target older people, are most endorsed by younger people, and suggest how elders shift from receiving the default prejudice of pity to either prescriptive resentment or reward.</p>

<p>A burgeoning older population necessitates greater focus on aging and intergenerational relations. One issue of increasing importance is ageism and its risks for targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167213480043">North &amp; Fiske, 2012</xref>). Despite negative consequences, age discrimination has seemed a mere second-class civil rights issue in labor and legal circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167213480043">Cohen, 2009</xref>). Social psychologists, too, have long established the salience of age in interpersonal judgments but have seldom examined ageism, compared with racism and sexism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213480043">Nelson, 2004</xref>). As a likely cause and consequence of such widespread disregard, this form of prejudice is currently one of the most socially condoned—or as some claim, the most prevalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167213480043">Age Concern, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167213480043">Banaji, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In confronting the understudied topic of ageism, this article departs from traditional views that center on default, <italic>descriptive</italic> perceptions of what older people are like. Instead, we focus on should-based, <italic>prescriptive</italic> beliefs about older people’s use of certain social resources. We identify three key ways in which older people are expected to limit their resource usage: acceding to <italic>Succession</italic> of enviable resources, limiting <italic>Consumption</italic> of shared resources, and avoiding symbolic <italic>Identity</italic> invasions. In all cases, we propose that younger people are the most likely to endorse such expectations of elders.</p>
<p>This standpoint presents three implications. First, a prescriptive approach goes beyond descriptive stereotypes about older people’s physical or cognitive capabilities per se. Second, implicating younger people as the focal ageists posits age differences in ageist endorsers not found by descriptive approaches (which have implicated people of all ages—including older people themselves—as holding equivalent general attitudes toward “older people”). Finally, elder subtypes emerge: those who abide by age-based expectations, and those who do not. This article thus provides novel ways of understanding intergenerational, ageist tensions—particularly important in a rapidly graying society that will soon find its traditional age structure altered.</p>
<sec id="section1-0146167213480043">
<title>Descriptive Perspectives: Ageism Held Across Age Groups</title>
<p>Ageism theories mainly focus on descriptions of what older people (allegedly) are—generally centering on perceptions of illness, incompetence, invisibility, and irrelevance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167213480043">North &amp; Fiske, 2012</xref>, for a review). These descriptive stereotypes have shaped virtually all existing explanations for ageism: Individual-level theories often focus on mortality and related anxieties or physical repulsion as spurring age-based prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167213480043">Greenberg, Schimel, &amp; Martens, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0146167213480043">Palmore, 2003</xref>). At the group level, maintaining psychological distance from elders may bolster group self-worth or adaptively favor the fittest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167213480043">Burnstein, Crandall, &amp; Kitayama, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167213480043">Kite &amp; Wagner, 2004</xref>). Group-level perspectives also characterize elders as descriptively nonreciprocating, low-status, and pitiable—or high-warmth and low-competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167213480043">Cuddy &amp; Fiske, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167213480043">Cottrell &amp; Neuberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167213480043">Cuddy, Norton, &amp; Fiske, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167213480043">Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, &amp; Xu, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The focus on elders’ descriptive characteristics yields considerable agreement across age groups. Persistently, old and young alike hold negative attitudes toward the concepts of “old people” and the “elderly,” both explicitly and implicitly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167213480043">Greenberg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167213480043">Kimmel, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167213480043">Kite &amp; Wagner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167213480043">Nosek, Banaji, &amp; Greenwald, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0146167213480043">Rodin &amp; Langer, 1980</xref>). Stereotype Content Model research has failed to find participant age differences in placing older people squarely in a high-warmth, low-competence cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167213480043">Cuddy, Fiske, &amp; Glick, 2007</xref>). Even development-focused studies—which emphasize increased complexity in older-age perceptions across the life span—find common, negative elder stereotypes to persist through old age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167213480043">Heckhausen, Dixon, &amp; Baltes, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0146167213480043">Rothermund &amp; Brandstadter, 2003</xref>). This holds even in Eastern cultures believed to revere elders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167213480043">Harwood et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Descriptive ageist beliefs spur older people to dissociate themselves psychologically from their own age group, considering themselves younger at heart than those typical of their actual age group, in order to maintain a positive self-image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0146167213480043">Weiss &amp; Lang, 2011</xref>). Thus, unlike many other forms of prejudice, descriptive ageism differs in that many of its perpetrators include its most salient targets. Whereas descriptive ageist stereotypes span perceivers of all ages, prescriptive age-based beliefs may differ, for reasons discussed next.</p>

<sec id="section2-0146167213480043">
<title>Toward a Prescriptive Approach: Age-Group Interdependence and Possible Tensions</title>
<p>Common phrases (“Act your age!”; “Isn’t he too old for that?”) indicate expectations for age-based behavior, as do formative psychological theories (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167213480043">Erikson, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0146167213480043">Piaget, 1971</xref>). Nevertheless, social-psychological investigations of prescriptive prejudices virtually always center on gender-based expectations, generally upheld by men and targeting women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167213480043">Burgess &amp; Borgida, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167213480043">Fiske &amp; Stevens, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167213480043">Prentice &amp; Carranza, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0146167213480043">Rudman, 1998</xref>). For instance, the prescriptive belief that women should be nice fosters backlash when they act in threateningly agentic ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167213480043">Carli &amp; Eagly, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167213480043">Eagly &amp; Karau, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167213480043">Rudman &amp; Glick, 2001</xref>). Thus, in contrast to mere norms or expectancies—typically shared by everyone in a given society—prescriptive stereotypes typically involve one group disproportionately targeting another, so as to foster some degree of social control.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding its focus in gender, prescriptive stereotype research has unearthed an important divergence from descriptive stereotypes: Whereas descriptive beliefs tend to be held comparably across groups (which, as noted, includes descriptive ageist beliefs), prescriptive stereotypes tend to be espoused unevenly. Indeed, despite mostly agreeing about descriptive gender stereotypes, men and women differ in their endorsement of prescriptive ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167213480043">Burgess &amp; Borgida, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167213480043">Martin, Osmond, Hesselbart, &amp; Wood, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0146167213480043">Twenge, 1997</xref>). Theoretically, this is because men and women are highly interdependent in their outcomes, although men’s higher societal status means that subjugating women directly benefits them. Controlling stereotypes about women’s traditional powerless roles protect men’s own privileged status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0146167213480043">Pratto, Stallworth, Sidanius, &amp; Siers, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Given its predominantly descriptive focus, the ageism literature has not considered the possibility of a similar descriptive-prescriptive endorsement disparity. Nevertheless, parallels exist between age and gender: Age groups are clearly interdependent, in the family and broader society. Moreover, resembling gender’s traditional power imbalances, age groups do not hold equal status: Across many domains, a curvilinear pattern emerges, with younger and older age taking a comparatively low-status backseat to middle-agers (e.g., in income level, entrepreneurship, and cultural exposure; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167213480043">Gerbner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0146167213480043">Szafran, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0146167213480043">U.S. Census Bureau, 2009</xref>). Consequently, people of all ages perceive middle-aged people as the highest in status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167213480043">European Social Survey, 2008</xref>), and the most entitled to maximal societal resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167213480043">Garstka, Hummert, &amp; Branscombe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167213480043">Garstka, Schmitt, Branscombe, &amp; Hummert, 2004</xref>). In other words, age groups take turns, at different levels of privilege.</p>
<p>Given middle-agers’ relative high-status security and the age-progression of resources—with older people at the front, potentially blocking that orderly sequence—we posit that younger people stand the most to gain from older people’s relinquishing or avoiding age-related resources. After all, younger people lack resources, whereas older people who already had their turn are perceived as less entitled than middle-agers. Therefore, older people might face greater expectations to transition away from various forms of resource access, and might face backlash (similar to agentic women) when they overstep prescriptive boundaries—and earn reward when they adhere to them. Such a pattern would contradict research on descriptive elder stereotypes, whereby older people’s nonconformity often goes ignored, persistent even in the face of stereotype-incongruent behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167213480043">Cuddy et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Potential Domains of Resource-Based, Ageist Prescriptions</title>
<p>Generational-tension themes in the ageism literature suggest probable sectors of prescriptive ageism. We focus on three overarching domains, though we acknowledge the possibility of other areas.</p>
<sec id="section4-0146167213480043">
<title>Transition of Desirable Resources and Positions: Succession</title>
<sec id="section5-0146167213480043">
<title>Employment</title>
<p>Recent job markets have increased layoffs, prolonged unemployment, postponed retirement, and fostered age-discrimination lawsuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167213480043">AARP, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167213480043">Elmer, 2009</xref>). All-too-common beliefs about older workers involve perceived inflexibility, resistance to change and training, and health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0146167213480043">Loretto &amp; White, 2006</xref>), despite evidence that job performance does not decrease with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167213480043">Liden, Stilwell, &amp; Ferris, 1996</xref>). From the perspective of younger people, elders’ delayed retirement limits their own opportunities, potentially intensifying prescriptions concerning older people’s prolonged employment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0146167213480043">
<title>Wealth and influence</title>
<p>Younger people might particularly resent elders’ political sway, given that younger people have much longer to live into a future over which they feel little control. The youth-advocacy group Americans for a Society Free From Age Restrictions argues that young-age voting restrictions reflect “taxation without representation”—restricting the political power of the young, who nevertheless are taxed on their income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167213480043">ASFAR, n.d</xref>.). Older people also comprise a substantially powerful, ever-growing voting bloc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167213480043">Binstock, 2011</xref>). In addition, older people tend to have more accumulated wealth than the young, and face the pejorative “greedy geezer” stereotype, persistent for centuries in Western culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167213480043">Covey, 1991</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0146167213480043">
<title>Depletion of Shared Public Goods: Consumption</title>
<p>Common debates concerning a growing older population center on shared entitlements. With Medicare and Social Security due to run out sooner than expected, many young people feel disproportionately disadvantaged by current resource distributions to older populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0146167213480043">Wolf, 2011</xref>). Despite the fact that children outnumber older people 2-to-1, elders enjoy greater governmental spending by a factor of 3 or 4, and 51% of social service expenditures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167213480043">Howard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167213480043">Minkler, 2006</xref>). Combined with concerns over societal burden (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167213480043">McFall &amp; Miller, 1992</xref>), these concerns might exaggerate fears about the passive inconvenience posed by a growing older population.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0146167213480043">
<title>Symbolic, Cultural Assets: Identity</title>
<p>Optimists forecast an enlarged older population to reinvent old age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167213480043">Dychtwald, 1999</xref>)—presumably by acting in ways that are historically youth related. However, social psychology suggests caution: Older people who attempt to cross ingroup boundaries, such as trying to look younger, face backlash from the young (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0146167213480043">Schoemann &amp; Branscombe, 2010</xref>). Younger people are motivated to maintain generational boundaries: Doing so maintains self and group-level esteem, asserts autonomy, and buffers the self from future adversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167213480043">Bytheway, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167213480043">Greenberg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167213480043">Hagestad &amp; Uhlenberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0146167213480043">Snyder &amp; Miene, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0146167213480043">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979</xref>).</p>

<title>Research Overview</title>
<p>Six experiments tested whether these prescriptive stereotypic expectations—punishing violators and rewarding adherers—particularly target elders and garner support from the young.</p>
<p>Studies 1 to 3 presented a brief vignette describing a fictitious person in a Succession, Consumption, or Identity scenario, respectively. Each study’s between-subjects, six-condition design manipulated the character’s age (older, middle-aged, or younger) and behavior (either violating or adhering to a prescription corresponding with the relevant domain). Participants rated targets’ perceived warmth and competence—arguably fundamental dimensions of person perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167213480043">Fiske, Cuddy, &amp; Glick, 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0146167213480043">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Studies 4 to 6 simulated behavioral analogues, with the same six-condition design, repeated once each for Succession, Consumption, or Identity. An apparently live, online target presented himself in ways similar to the vignette targets. Dependent measures added questions regarding participants’ expectations and enthusiasm for the upcoming interaction.</p>
<sec id="section10-0146167213480043">
<title>Analyses and Hypotheses</title>
<p>Two types of analyses examined the combined impact of participant (rater) age and target characteristics (age and behavior) on each dependent variable (DV). The first primarily examined different-aged <italic>raters</italic> within each condition, whereas the second compared different ratings of <italic>targets</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section11-0146167213480043">
<title>Regressions gauging rater differences<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0146167213480043">2</xref></sup></title>
<p>First, simple slopes regressions examined whether rater age significantly moderated the impact of vignette condition on target perceptions (in other words, for each vignette target, whether younger and older raters differed in their trait ratings). For each condition, an interaction term was computed by multiplying a dummy variable (coded as 1 for the condition of interest, with the rest coded as 0) by the centered, continuous variable of participant age. Regressions then tested the significance of each simple slope, effectively testing whether rater age significantly predicted target rating <italic>within</italic> each condition relative to the other five.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0146167213480043">3</xref></sup> Per predictions, we expected younger and older raters to diverge in their older-target perceptions, but to converge for comparable middle-aged and younger ones.</p>

<title>Orthogonal contrast ANOVAs gauging target differences</title>
<p>As a follow-up analysis, ANOVAs examined differences <italic>between</italic> the six target ratings on a young-only subset of participants (at or below the median age, usually about 30).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0146167213480043">4</xref></sup> Weighted, a priori ANOVA contrasts<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0146167213480043">5</xref></sup> expected the greatest polarization between the prescription-violating, older target (−3) and the prescription-adhering older counterpart (+3), moderate polarization between comparable middle-aged targets (−2 for the violator, +2 for the adherer), and little difference between the two younger targets (−1, +1). Given these adherence-violation predictions, we present these means as <italic>z</italic>-scores—thereby showing judgments relative to the mean and emphasizing polarization.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>In each study, participants agreed to complete a “social perceptions and attitudes” survey. In all cases, participants read about an older, middle-aged, or younger target in a vignette (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0146167213480043">Appendix A</xref>), which consisted of neutral background information followed by a manipulation, whereby the character either <italic>violates</italic> or <italic>adheres to</italic> a prescription corresponding with the relevant dimension. For Study 1 (Succession of enviable resources), the protagonist was described as being financially comfortable, but either stingy (“reluctant to lend or share his money”) or generous (“generally willing to lend or share his money”). For Study 2 (Consumption of shared resources), the vignette target had come down with a serious illness requiring a resource-intensive procedure; he then either “stubbornly” decided to go through with the procedure anyway (thereby violating overconsumption) or else understandingly decided it was best to not go through with the procedure (adhering). Finally, Study 3 (symbolic Identity resources) described targets who either acted symbolically young (appreciating current pop artists, such as the Black Eyed Peas) or symbolically old (appreciating “oldies” artists, such as Frank Sinatra).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0146167213480043">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>After reading the vignette, participants rated the vignette character’s capability and warmth on a 5-point scale (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 5 = <italic>extremely</italic>), and provided demographic information.</p>

<p>For the linear regressions, rater age significantly predicted perceived target capability within the stingy older-person condition, β = .18, <italic>t</italic> = 2.65, <italic>p</italic> = .009. Thus, younger people most often disrespected the older, Succession-violator as low in capability; progressively older participants became more forgiving. Conversely, rater age was a marginally significant inverse predictor of target capability within the generous older-person condition, β = −.12, <italic>t</italic> = −1.72, <italic>p</italic> = .09, and a marginally significant inverse predictor within the generous (middle-aged) condition, β = −.13, <italic>t</italic> = −1.88, <italic>p</italic> = .06.

<title>Studies 1 to 3 Summary</title>
<p>Overall, these vignette studies provide strong evidence that age-based prescriptions most substantially exist among younger people and that they most notably target older people, as a function of their violation of or adherence to prescriptions. However, these studies are preliminary in that they gauge bias in a third-person, text-based manner and may not make strong predictions about actual behavior. In other words, raters could have been communicating an abstract belief that they would not enact in person. Thus, the next three studies utilized a more involving environment to examine the impact of prescription-focused expectations.</p>

After viewing an initial online introduction from the other person (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0146167213480043">Appendix B</xref>), participants provided trait ratings (just described) and behavioroid ratings indicating the desirability of the upcoming interaction.</p>
<p>Study 4 (Succession) ostensibly gauged students’ perceptions of local community members and explored the utility of modern technology in interacting with the local community. Achieving both aims involved participants (allegedly) meeting and interacting with a local community member over webcam. The crux of this interaction was a purported trivia task, which participants believed would take place at the end of the session; moreover, a potential US$50 prize motivated participants to take the task seriously. As a first step, participants viewed a prerecorded video introduction of their future acquaintance: a man named Max, resembling prior studies. This scripted introduction—presented in the form of an interview—was performed by a younger, middle-aged, or older actor of comparable appearance except for age. Max’s self-portrayal either adhered to Succession (financially assisting other-generation relatives) or violated it (reluctant to do so).</p>
<p>Study 5 (Consumption) represented a study of “online first impressions,” which ostensibly involved meeting a randomly assigned person in an online chat room. For increased believability, participants customized their own screen name, provided a self-introduction for the other person to read, and experienced pauses indicating that the chat room was “loading.” Resembling prior studies, participants encountered a person with the screen name “Max.” Like Study 2, Max explained his impending resource-intensive medical treatment, and either adhered to or violated Consumption prescriptions. Afterwards, participants rated Max on the noted traits, as well as two key behavioral items indicating the extent to which he was desirable for further interaction.</p>
<p>For Study 6 (Identity), participants agreed to participate in an online “local community study,” taking place in Hamilton, New Jersey, and “working with local businesses to gauge people’s anonymous perceptions of our community members.” This ostensibly involved learning about a person local to the researchers via an email introduction, and having the opportunity to contact him. Tactics similar to Study 5—a customizable login name and “loading” pauses—added realism to the paradigm. Also resembling prior studies, participants read an email from a person named “Max (last name withheld).” Like Study 3, Max portrayed himself as either adhering to or violating Identity in the context of music appreciation.</p>

<title>Study 4 Results</title>
<p>Because Study 4’s undergraduate sample did not feature a wide age range, no age regressions would be meaningful; however, like prior studies, a set of a priori contrasts assessed the predicted effects among the young participants.</p>

<p>The predicted orthogonal contrast was significant, <italic>t</italic>(131) = 2.06, <italic>p</italic> = .04.

<title>Behavioral interaction expectancy</title>
<p>A variable comprising three collapsed items (“How much rapport do you anticipate having with the other person?”; “How useful do you feel your partner will be in the trivia challenge?”; “How well do you think you will be able to work with the other person on the trivia task?” α = .62) gauged participants’ expectations for the anticipated interaction. With this DV, the predicted orthogonal contrast was significant, <italic>t</italic>(131) = 3.32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Resembling the familiar pattern, participants held the lowest expectations for the interaction with stingy, older Max (<italic>M</italic> = −0.38, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.22), and the highest expectations for generous, older Max (<italic>M</italic> = 0.48, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.18; mean difference = 0.86).

<title>Behavioral interaction preference</title>
<p>A two-item variable (“To what extent would you prefer to ignore Max altogether?” and “Would you recommend to others that they ignore Max?”) gauged participants’ interest (or lack thereof) in the potential interaction. This variable was reverse-scored to better match Study 4’s behavioral interaction variable (i.e., so that higher scores signaled greater desire for interaction, much as higher scores in Study 4 reflected greater expectancy for the interaction). From this perspective, younger participants were again more resentful of the prescription-violating target than were older participants: Rater age was a significant predictor of interaction interest within the older, Consumption-violating condition, β = .19, <italic>t</italic> = 2.17, <italic>p</italic> = .03—demonstrating that the younger the rater, the more they wanted to ignore him.

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>Six studies provided a foundation for a prescriptive approach to ageism, implicating the young as primary perpetrators. Results across studies indicated that younger people care disproportionately about whether older people abide by prescriptions. Concerning succession of enviable resources between generations (wealth; Studies 1 and 4), depletion of the shared resource pool (health care assets; Studies 2 and 5), and adoption of symbolic, youth-centric resources (music; Studies 3 and 6), older targets faced the most extreme reactions, compared with other-aged targets who behave similarly.</p>
<p>Five out of the six studies (Study 4’s undergraduate sample being the exception) featured a relatively wide participant-age range; this allowed regressions testing the impact of rater age on prescriptive ageism. Across the board, these experiments found younger raters (as compared with older raters) to view prescription-violating, older people as lower in capability and warmth (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0146167213480043">Table 1</xref>’s first column). This pattern did not occur toward any of the other five targets on either trait dimension, and in 7 of 30 cases, it reversed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0146167213480043">Table 1</xref>’s columns 2-6). Thus, as participants grew progressively older, they became more forgiving of the older target’s prescription-violating behaviors; moreover, younger raters apparently did not care as much about how the middle-aged or younger target behaved.</p>
<p>All six experimental studies featured a substantial number of younger participants, allowing us to test further whether these raters would care the most about an older target’s prescription-concordant behavior. Using an a-priori-contrast approach, the clear majority of tests confirmed the general hypothesis that older targets would garner the greatest rating polarization—that is, the greatest combination of punishment for violation and reward for adherence—from these younger raters.</p>
<p>For judgments of capability, the approval gap between the older adherer and violator was larger than that between comparable middle-aged targets in five out of six cases, and larger than between younger targets five out of six times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0146167213480043">Figure 1</xref>). (The one exception, Study 5, featured an online chat room and may have presented an unexpected contamination; older adults who appear comfortable navigating online chat rooms might already seem surprisingly competent, given the stereotype that older people are not comfortable with modern technologies.)</p>
<p>Judgments of warmth followed suit, with older targets garnering greater polarization than younger targets in all six experimental studies, and greater polarization than middle-aged targets in all but one experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0146167213480043">Figure 2</xref>). (In the one exception, Study 6, the older, pop-music target was above the mean in warmth; this could have been caused by the study’s community-service frame. In this context, young participants might have come to perceive the older target as worthy of pity.) Ultimately, these capability and warmth patterns further demonstrate the young’s apparent preoccupation with older targets’ abiding by ageist prescriptions.</p>
<p>Finally, the last three studies (Studies 4-6) yielded support in the context of an expected interaction. When asked how much they preferred to interact further with targets (Studies 5 and 6), younger participants again were more negative than were older raters toward the older, prescription-violating targets (this pattern was significant for Study 5 and trended for Study 6; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0146167213480043">Table 1</xref>, column 1). Notably, this pattern did not emerge for any of the other five targets. Moreover, contrast analyses on the younger participants only—including Study 4’s young-only sample—found that the polarization in interaction ratings was greatest toward the older target as compared with the middle-aged target in all three cases. This polarization was greater than that toward the younger target in two out of three cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0146167213480043">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section45-0146167213480043">
<title>The Perpetrators: The Young As Most Endorsing of Prescriptive Ageism</title>
<p>As noted, extant ageism research focuses on common, descriptive stereotypes of older people—implicating people of all ages as upholding these beliefs. By contrast, a prescriptive focus finds consistent disparity in endorsement between age groups, with the young emerging as the greatest perpetrators of age-based “shoulds.” This asymmetry in descriptive-versus-prescriptive endorsement parallels findings on other social groups: consensus regarding stereotypic description, but ingroup/outgroup differences concerning the prescription.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section46-0146167213480043">
<title>The Targets: Novel Elder Subtypes and “Hostile Ageism”</title>
<p>A prescriptive ageism approach also presents novel subtypes of its older targets. Like ageism research in general, extant work on elder subtypes has derived primarily from descriptive stereotypes: the kindly “grandfather,” the dignified “elder statesman,” the lonely “senior citizen”—as well as the healthy “young-old” versus the less active “old-old” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167213480043">Brewer, Dull, &amp; Lui, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167213480043">Neugarten, 1974</xref>). By contrast, a prescriptive standpoint presents elder subtypes that derive from notions of where older people allegedly should belong. Adhering to these expectations fosters reward, but at the same time violations can foster backlash, or “hostile ageism,” which the ageism literature has seldom considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167213480043">North &amp; Fiske, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The first subtype derives from the domain of Succession, and forms when older people either do or do not adhere to the notion that they should step aside to help younger generations (Studies 1 and 4). For better or for worse, this prescription applies primarily to older people, who are perhaps viewed as not entitled to enviable resources as much as younger generations. One potential explanation why younger people are Succession’s primary subscribers is that they are the ones who stand to benefit the most from the passing along of resources, as the age sequences progresses, and as young people are the lowest in resources.</p>
<p>The second elder subtype stems from Consumption: notions that older people should not deplete a disproportionate amount of shared resources. In the scenario of a medical dilemma, younger participants were the most motivated to limit elder resource depletion, even with health at stake (Studies 2 and 5). Unfortunately, too often, older people are in fact perceived as burdensome drains on society and families alike (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167213480043">Montgomery, Gonyea, &amp; Hooyman, 1985</xref>). More currently, debates over the best allocation of shared health care or social security resources become especially heated when generational equity issues are made salient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167213480043">North &amp; Fiske, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The final subtype derives from Identity. Identity prescriptions have the potential to affect people of any age group, but this article suggests that older people are particularly likely to face resistance from the young for unwelcome invading of ingroup territory (Studies 3 and 6). More spared from this backlash are the middle-aged, whose age-incongruent ways may be perceived as less threatening. Indeed, researchers suggested that younger people strive to maintain psychological distance from older people in particular, barring them from their own “youth culture” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167213480043">Greenberg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167213480043">Hagestad &amp; Uhlenberg, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>These prescriptive elder subtypes build upon established theory on stereotype content. As noted, default, descriptive perceptions of older people involve warmth but incompetence, or <italic>pity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167213480043">Fiske et al., 2002</xref>). Nevertheless, the prescription-based findings here suggest that other emotions may be at play: When elders do not cede resources, they risk facing low-warmth/low-competence <italic>contempt</italic> or low-warmth/high-competence <italic>envy</italic>. In this sense, as is the case with sexism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167213480043">Glick &amp; Fiske, 1996</xref>), ageism’s typically benevolent nature can transform into a more hostile form when targets get “uppity.” On the other hand, when elder prescription adherence successfully aids younger generations, perceptions of high-warmth/high-competence <italic>pride</italic> may result.</p>

<title>Broader Contributions of a Prescriptive Ageism Approach</title>
<p>Classic social-psychological research shows that outgroup members—possessing less complex representations for perceivers—are particularly likely to garner polarized perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167213480043">Linville &amp; Jones, 1980</xref>). However, the current work suggests that the case of age is more nuanced, with one outgroup (elders) garnering far greater polarization than another outgroup (middle-agers) in the eyes of the young. This consistent pattern not only speaks to age’s inherent complexity (in that different outgroups may be perceived differently) but also suggests that—going beyond a mere cognitive basis—prescriptive ageism considers an intergroup motivational basis for age group stereotyping.</p>
<p>Also significant is the current approach’s relationship with classic theories of resource-driven prejudice, such as Realistic Group Conflict Theory (RGCT; Sherif, Harvey, White, Hood, &amp; Sherif, 1961/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0146167213480043">1988</xref>). From an RGCT standpoint, one might expect the middle-aged to be most targeted by the young, as they have the most to give up and benefit the ingroup. However, as noted, the findings suggest the reverse pattern: Older outgroup members are targeted more often than middle-aged outgroup members. In addition, RGCT does not speak to the idea of rewarding outgroups for adhering to expectations (as the current results suggest), nor would it speak to the current findings’ emphasis on symbolic (Identity) resources. Thus, from this standpoint, too, prescriptive age-based prejudice presents considerable idiosyncrasies.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<sec id="section49-0146167213480043">
<title>Cross-cultural differences</title>
<p>This research centered on ageist attitudes of U.S. participants, limiting the ability to unpack potential cross-cultural differences. Although lay views believe collectivist cultures hold their elders in higher regard (e.g., valuing wisdom), recent evidence suggests some forms of ageism may be pan-cultural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167213480043">Cuddy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167213480043">Cuddy et al., 2009</xref>). A prescriptive ageism approach presents unique opportunities for cross-cultural investigations, focusing on beliefs about intergenerational resource allocation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section50-0146167213480043">
<title>Gender differences</title>
<p>Another limitation is that experimental paradigms used only a male target. The potential moderating effect of target gender is a largely unresolved question, here and in the broader literature: Younger people may view older women more positively than older men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167213480043">Narayan, 2008</xref>), but other work suggests a grimmer situation for older women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167213480043">Nuessel, 1982</xref>). More evidence is needed to make conclusive statements about the nature of any older-target gender effects, especially from a prescriptive standpoint.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section51-0146167213480043">
<title>Elder subtype differences</title>
<p>Potentially, different prescriptions might target different elder subcategories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167213480043">North &amp; Fiske, 2013</xref>). For instance, Succession may most often target the young-old, who are closer to traditional retirement age; meanwhile, Consumption may more frequently target the old-old (some might argue that resources should not be squandered on people who don’t have as much longer to live). Moreover, depending on context, the definition of “old” may be quite young in life span terms—for instance, in professional sports, 40 may signify old age. Future research should more systematically test prescriptive ageism differences between ages and across contexts—including perceptions held by old-old participants, absent from this article’s online samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section52-0146167213480043">
<title>Anti-young ageism</title>
<p>Although here we focus mostly on older people’s plight, prescriptive ageism potentially targets people of all ages. Future research warrants exploring prejudice aimed at the young in particular, as evidenced by enduring comparable forms of discrimination (e.g., patronization). Prescriptively, perceptions of what the young deserve are equally important as what the old deserve, given rapidly shifting age dynamics and a constrained resource pool. Current debates over health care, mandatory retirement, and Social Security all emphasize society’s delicate balance of generational equity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section53-0146167213480043">
<title>Positive prescriptive stereotypes</title>
<p>This article’s prescriptive focus admittedly takes a slightly negative tone, stating that elder violations of prescriptive stereotypes will yield a degree of resentment. However, we acknowledge the possibility of positive prescriptive stereotypes targeting elders, perhaps concerning expectations for them to be happy, content, or wise. Much as consequences of “positive ageism” have been shown to benefit elders (e.g., practical benefits and discounts; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167213480043">North &amp; Fiske, 2012</xref>), future work may similarly unearth beneficial outcomes of age-based expectations.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section54-0146167213480043" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article supports a prescriptive approach to ageism, implicating primarily younger perpetrators and older targets. We do not argue that Succession, Consumption, and Identity compose the only potential prescriptive stereotypes held by the young toward the old (nor do they cover prescriptive stereotypes in the other direction). Nevertheless, going beyond descriptive ageism emphasizes how perceiver age shapes disparate ageist tendencies. This introduces distinct elder subtypes that result from older people’s violation or adherence to prescriptive stereotypes, and introduces novel approaches for future research on the understudied topic of ageism.</p>

<p>Technically, perceived target <italic>capability</italic> was the precise variable gauged in each experiment. However, because prior research shows “competence” and “capable” judgments to correlate highly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167213480043">Cuddy, Fiske, &amp; Glick, 2007</xref>), the two seem virtually interchangeable. Other dependent variables (DVs) varied across studies, but for simplicity, we present the two that appeared consistently and behaved consistently across studies.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-0146167213480043">
<label>2.</label>
<p>We also explored a curvilinear pattern of rater age for each DV, but this pattern was consistently nonsignificant.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0146167213480043">
<label>3.</label>
<p>Because simple slope beta weights represent the relationship between rater age and DV within each condition relative to the other five, they should not be interpreted as the proportion of the variance account for by rater age overall (which is actually much greater within each condition in isolation).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0146167213480043">
<label>4.</label>
<p>In this article, we report findings among the younger half of samples, due to their consistently polarized responses toward older targets. Among older raters, this specific pattern did not arise (polarization was almost nonexistent toward older targets, compared with that toward middle-age and younger targets), nor did a clear overall pattern emerge; thus, we do not report these results.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-0146167213480043">
<label>5.</label>
<p>We used weighted contrasts given specific predictions regarding polarization (punishment for the older, violating target and reward for the older, adhering target). Two-way ANOVAs testing for 3 (target age) × 2 (target behavior) interactions do yield largely similar, significant results; however, because contrast analyses allow for more focused analyses than omnibus ANOVAs followed by post hoc tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0146167213480043">Rosenthal, Rosnow, &amp; Rubin, 2000</xref>), this approach seemed best in guiding our analysis.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-0146167213480043">
<label>6.</label>
<p>Open-ended comments suggested that participants took paradigms seriously and engaged thoughtfully.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-0146167213480043">
<label>7.</label>
<p>In all analyses, we explored whether relevant demographic variables (gender, race) affected target perceptions. However, aside from the age effects reported, no consistent demographic trends emerged.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-0146167213480043">
<label>8.</label>
<p>To further test our predicted linear contrast pattern, as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167213480043">Abelson and Prentice (1997)</xref>, we also tested the significance of contrast residuals. However, a linear pattern emerged as easily the most consistent pattern across studies and DVs, so we report its significance only.</p>
