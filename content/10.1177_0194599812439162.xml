<p>The authors of “The Challenge of Protocols for Reflux Disease: A Review and Development of a Critical Pathway”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812439162">1</xref></sup> are to be congratulated in their attempt to review a variety of different articles concerning both gastroesophageal (GERD) and extraesophageal reflux disease (EER). This is a major undertaking, and we admire their efforts, but we write this letter to bring up certain concerns.</p>
<p>Overall the article seems to approach extraesophageal reflux disease primarily from the GERD model viewpoint. This is not surprising in that the majority of the studies they reviewed were from gastroenterology teams, and only 3 of the articles focused on EER or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) specifically. As otolaryngologists whose areas of interest often embrace reflux, our primary concern was with the emphasis on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) rather than transnasal esophagoscopy (TNE). This is primarily noted in Figure 2, where it states that “if screening barium swallow or TNE is positive for abnormalities, the exam should be followed by formal EGD.” We would state that the literature is quite clear that this is not the case. Abnormalities in the esophagus can often be managed only by the use of TNE, and although in some cases, formal conventional (sedated) esophagoscopy may be warranted, it would be very uncommon for an otolaryngology patient to require EGD. It is also quite well accepted both in the otolaryngology and gastroenterology disciplines that TNE has equal sensitivity and specificity when compared with conventional esophagoscopy, and it is vastly safer, markedly less expensive, and preferred by the majority of patients when they have undergone both techniques of esophagoscopy. In light of this study claiming to be a protocol for a critical pathway, we believe that TNE’s role as an inexpensive and safe screening modality should be paramount.</p>
<p>There are several other concerns, but the majority of these reflect the continued use of the gastroenterology model as a framework for the understanding of <italic>all</italic> reflux disease. The assumption that GERD and LPR are a “continuum with the same underlying pathophysiologic mechanism” is certainly not entirely accepted. Gastroesophageal reflux disease and LPR have different symptomatology, a different response to antireflux therapy, and different patterns of reflux as documented on measurements of esophageal acid clearance (EAC). The routine LPR patient has reflux in the upright position with a normal EAC, whereas in contrast, the classic individual with GERD has supine reflux with a prolonged EAC.</p>
<p>Finally, we think it is important to emphasize that until large prospective studies demonstrate otherwise, individuals with moderate to severe EER require visualization of their esophagus due to the incidence of esophageal pathology, including Barrett’s esophagus, in these patients.</p>
<p>Once again, we think it is important to thank the authors for taking on such a difficult task, and we hope that our comments enlighten our readers and that this manuscript results in further collaborative work between our disciplines.</p>
