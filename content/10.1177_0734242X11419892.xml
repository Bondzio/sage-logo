<p>Drilling for the exploration and extraction of oil requires the use of drilling fluids which are continuously pumped down and returned carrying the rock phase that is extracted from the well. The potential environmental impacts of contaminated fluids from drilling operations have attracted increasing community awareness and scrutiny. This review article highlights current advances in the treatment of drill cuttings and compares the technologies in terms of cost, time and space requirements. Traditionally, a range of non-biological methods have been employed for the disposal of drill cuttings including burial pits, landfills and re-injection, chemical stabilization and solidification and thermal treatments such as incineration and thermal desorption. More recently, bioremediation has been successfully applied as a treatment process for cuttings. This review provides a current comparison of bioremediation technologies and non-biological technologies for the treatment of contaminated drill cuttings providing information on a number of factors that need to be taken into account when choosing the best technology for drilling waste management including the environmental risks associated with disposal of drilling wastes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Drilling for the exploration and extraction of oil and natural gas requires the use of drilling fluids, also known as ‘muds’ for historical reasons (the first fluids consisted mainly of clay mud) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0734242X11419892">Okpokwasili and Nnubia, 1995</xref>). Drilling fluids are continuously pumped down the well through the hollow drill string and return through the well annulus carrying the rock phase that is extracted from the well. The main purpose of the fluids is to supply the drill cuttings transport phase, but they also cool and lubricate the drill bit, stabilize the well bore and control subsurface (down-hole) pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0734242X11419892">Hamed and Belhadri, 2009</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0734242X11419892">Okpokwasili and Nnubia, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0734242X11419892">Sadiq et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0734242X11419892">Schaanning et al., 2008</xref>). The latter of these tasks is important in order to avoid blow-out of the well. Pressure is achieved by controlling fluid density, balancing it with the pressure that is experienced down-hole and by including very heavy minerals such as barites to counteract the pressure in the hole. As the drill bit grinds rocks into drill cuttings, these cuttings become entrapped within the fluid flow and are carried to the surface where the cuttings are separated from the fluids and other contaminants so that the mud can be re-employed in the operation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X11419892">Figure 1</xref>). The fluids however, are continuously modified by the addition of components according to loss of rheological properties down-hole and changes in ambient well conditions. Solids removal is one of the most important aspects of system control, since it has a direct bearing on drilling efficiency and represents an opportunity to reduce overall drilling costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0734242X11419892">Schaanning et al., 2008</xref>). The first step of separation involves circulation of the mixture of fluid and cuttings over vibrating screens (shale shakers). The liquid fluid passes through the screens and is recirculated back to tanks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11419892">Bell et al., 1998</xref>). Drill cuttings are collected and stored in a tank or pit for further treatment or management. Additional mechanical processes such as hydrocycloning, centrifugation and gravitational settling are often used to further remove as many fine solids as possible as these particles tend to interfere with drilling performance. The separated fine solids are combined with the larger drill cuttings removed by the shale shakers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0734242X11419892">US EPA 2000</xref>). Limitations in separation treatment technologies often result in a number of the base fluids, mud constituents and possibly crude oil being ineffectively removed from the cuttings and thus ending up as residuals in the solid waste stream. Consequently, drilling waste discharges comprise of drill cuttings to which drilling fluids, muds and oils are adhered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0734242X11419892">Sadiq et al. 2003</xref>).</p>

<p>Drilling fluids can be broadly categorized into three main groups depending on base liquid (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X11419892">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0734242X11419892">OSPAR 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0734242X11419892">Sadiq et al. 2003</xref>). The composition of drilling fluids can vary widely and may include a plethora of different chemicals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X11419892">Table 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0734242X11419892">Patin 1999</xref>). Synthetic based fluids (SBFs) and oil-based fluids (OBFs) drill a cleaner hole than water-based fluids (WBFs), with less sloughing, and generate a lower volume of drill cuttings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0734242X11419892">Growcock et al., 2002</xref>). Consequently OBFs and SBFs are generally preferred over WBFs in moist applications for their ability to drill a gauge hole, minimizing drilling problems. However, the environmental impact and worker safety issues relating to the use of OBFs based on diesel and mineral oil and the formation of poly-nuclear aromatic hydrocarbons are key disadvantages for their use. SBFs have lower toxicity, faster biodegradability and lower bioaccumulation potential and are recyclable. WBFs are generally discharged to the sea at offshore locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0734242X11419892">US DOE, 2003</xref>).</p>

<p>In early offshore oil and gas development, drilling wastes were discharged from the platforms directly to the ocean; the oceans were perceived to be limitless dumping grounds. During the 1970s and 1980s, however, evidence mounted that oil-based drilling fluids and cuttings could have undesirable effects on local ecology as appreciable changes were seen in the benthos adjacent to many oil and gas platforms in the North Sea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X11419892">Davies et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0734242X11419892">Kingston, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0734242X11419892">Olsgard and Gray, 1995</xref>). Accumulated oil-based cuttings can affect the local ecosystem in three main ways: by directly covering organisms, by presenting direct toxicity to surrounding organisms, and by forming anoxic conditions caused by microbial degradation of the organic components in the waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0734242X11419892">Grant and Briggs, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0734242X11419892">Jorissen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0734242X11419892">Marsh, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Drill cutting piles are generally biologically impoverished, poorly sorted, weakly cohesive oil-rich silts with a variable admixture of clay particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X11419892">Black et al., 2002</xref>). Over the last decade, the potential environmental and health impacts of contaminated fluids and rock cuttings from drilling operations have attracted increasing community awareness and scrutiny. OBFs are toxic due to their composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X11419892">Cranford and Gordon, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11419892">Cranford et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X11419892">Daan et al., 1992</xref>). Results of toxicological studies on used drilling fluids showed that most formulations have 96-h LC<sub>50</sub> (lethal concentration causing the death of 50% of test organisms during a certain exposure time) values ranging between 10<sup>4</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup> µg g<sup>−1</sup> (1–10%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0734242X11419892">Patin, 1999</xref>). Experiments have also shown that after 180 days of discharge of drill cuttings contaminated by oil-based mud, less than 5% were biodegraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0734242X11419892">Østgaard and Jensen, 1985</xref>). As a consequence, during the 1980s there was a shift away from the use of diesel oil in drilling mud and towards ‘non-toxic’ or ‘low toxicity’ mineral oils, basically paraffin oils. No diesel oil-based fluids have been used in the North Sea since 1985 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734242X11419892">GESAMP, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (known as the ‘OSPAR Convention’) is the basis for national laws governing discharges into the North Sea, including offshore drilling wastes. Due to strict regulations on discharge of OPF-contaminated cuttings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0734242X11419892">OSPAR, 2003</xref>), most offshore wells are currently drilled with water-based fluids (WBF). In addition to heavy metal contaminants in the minerals, most WBFs contain approximately 20 different additives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0734242X11419892">Neff, 2005</xref>). Many of these are considered to pose little or no risk (PLONOR) to the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0734242X11419892">OSPAR, 2008</xref>).The US Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 states that: ‘pollution that cannot be prevented should be recycled in an environmentally safe manner whenever feasible, and disposal or release into the environment should be employed only as the last resort’. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates discharges of drilling muds and cuttings to state and federal waters of the US Current National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) allows discharge of WBM and cuttings to federal, but not state, waters if they meet restrictions in the Effluent Limitation Guidelines (ELG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0734242X11419892">OSPAR, 2008</xref>). In the USA, the EPA, the Department of Energy (DOE), the Minerals Management Service (MMS), and numerous companies and industry associations have worked together to finalize new Effluent Limitations Guidelines for SBFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0734242X11419892">US EPA, 2000</xref>). Those rules allow for discharge of SBM cuttings, subject to various restrictions but prohibit the discharge of SBMs themselves. For offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, the guidelines classify the amount of oil in drill cuttings as the retention on cuttings (ROC), defined by mass of oil per mass of cuttings and reported as percentage. For offshore drilling, the ROC of OBF cuttings is set to 0%. For SBFs the discharge regulations require either containment of contaminated cuttings or drying below 6.9% ROC for base fluids that meet the environmental performance criteria for C<sub>16</sub>–C<sub>18</sub> internal olefins, and 9.4% ROC for base fluids that meet the environmental performance criteria of esters. Untreated OBF and SBF drill cuttings fall within the EU list of hazardous waste (CEC, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0734242X11419892">OSPAR, 2001</xref>). Untreated WBF cuttings are generally not categorized as special waste unless they contain oil. However, WBF cuttings cannot be disposed to landfill without undergoing some form of treatment to reduce the high liquid content and salinity. With increasing pressure on landfill space and waste classification codes, coupled with greater emphasis on sustainability, there is an urgent need to identify environmentally sustainable clean-up strategies for drill cuttings management. This review looks at current advances in each of the main technologies available for treating drill cuttings and compares the technologies in terms of cost, time and space requirements.</p>

<title>Non-biological treatment and disposal options</title>
<p>Historically, a wide range of non-biological methods have been employed for the disposal of drilling wastes. These methods are described in the following section.</p>
<sec id="section3-0734242X11419892">
<title>Off-site and on-site burial options</title>
<p>Typically, in offshore operations drilling waste has been either disposed of on-site by discharging to the sea or re-injected to disposal wells. In onshore operations, drill cuttings have been temporarily stored in earthen pits (on-site or off-site) before disposal to the land or subsurface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0734242X11419892">Wojtanowicz, 2008</xref>). Pitburial is the most common onshore disposal technique used for drill cuttings. Generally, the solids are buried in the same pit (the reserve pit) used for collection and temporary storage of the waste fluid and cuttings after the liquid is allowed to evaporate. Pit burial represents a simple and low cost disposal method. The methodology requires no transportation of the drilling waste, thereby reducing both cost and risk of accidental spills during transportation. On-site pits have been classified according to the waste that they hold or their function assummarized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0734242X11419892">Wojtanowicz (2008)</xref>. In the US, pit burial represents a key waste management technique; generally during onshore drilling operations, drilling wastes are sent directly to a waste pit which is used to accumulate, store and, to a large extent, dispose of spent drilling fluids, cuttings and associated drill site wastes generated during drilling and completion operations. Drilling reserve pits are located near the drilling site and are generally open to the atmosphere. Three options for on-site disposal of the liquid phase are disposal to surface waters, land spreading or subsurface injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0734242X11419892">Wojtanowicz, 2008</xref>). On-site pit burial is environmentally unsuitable for wastes that contain high concentrations of oil, salt, biologically available metals and other harmful components that could migrate from the pit and contaminate usable water resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11419892">Cripps, 1998</xref>). The level of toxicity of any drill cutting depends on the composition of the formation rock and the type of drill fluid involved, and despite various treatment techniques, the generally complex blend of both organic and inorganic contaminants, including chlorides has hindered the re-use of treated cuttings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11419892">Al-Ansary and Al-Tabbaa, 2007</xref>; Leonard and Stegemann, 2009). Modern technology of pit closure involves partial removal of waste from the pit, separation of liquids from solids and different treatment of these two phases prior to their final disposal on-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0734242X11419892">Wojtanowicz, 2008</xref>). In some oil field areas, large landfills are operated to dispose of oil field waste from multiple wells. Burial usually results in anaerobic conditions, which limit any further degradation when compared with waste materials that are land-farmed or land-spread, where aerobic conditions predominate. The oldest and cheapest technique for pit closure is backfilling the pit berm on top of the waste and compacting the surface area. At the end of the drilling job, operators pump off the liquid layers for disposal through injection wells and then cover and bury the solids in place (pit burial). Environmental risks of this technique include leaching of concentrated waste components from periodic rainfalls and lack of oxygen for biodegradation of organics and hydrocarbon-contaminated waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11419892">Cripps, 1998</xref>). At present, the method of backfilling meets regulatory approval only if the concentration of contaminants has been found to be below certain levels that render the waste harmless without dilutions (LA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0734242X11419892">Louisiana Administrative Code, 2008</xref>). Otherwise, land treatment techniques should be used for oilfield pit closure. This is a simple, inexpensive process that has been used for decades and is acceptable to most regulatory agencies. Given the low cost of this process, there is little incentive for onshore operators in most locations to explore alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0734242X11419892">Veil and Dusseault, 2003</xref>). As a rehabilitation technique, pits designated for closure are covered in place using native soils, the surface is graded to prevent water accumulation, and the area is revegetated with native species to reduce the potential for erosion and promote full recovery of the area’s ecosystem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0734242X11419892">Veil, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Another common method of disposing of drill cuttings is to send them to landfill. An example is the landfill at a remote site in Libya designed and built by TotalFinaElf to dispose of inert wastes from oil and gas exploration. The landfill has a bottom liner overlaid by a geological barrier to prevent contamination of the soil. A top liner, which is drawn over the waste during non-active periods, is installed permanently after the landfill is closed. Two collection pits collect rainwater and subsequent leachate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0734242X11419892">Morillon et al., 2002</xref>). Water-based drill cuttings are suitable for landfilling as they are semi-solid inert material that is low in hydrocarbons and in salt. The advantages of on-site burial of drilling wastes include the fact that it is based on simple, low-cost technology for uncontaminated solid wastes and that only limited surface area requirements. Concerns over the use of landfilling include the potential for groundwater contamination and the requirements for stabilization and monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734242X11419892">Freeman, 1997</xref>). In terms of disposal of drilling wastes, the estimated costs are AU$12–15 per m<sup>−3</sup> of waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X11419892">Bansal and Sugiarto, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>There are several key factors, listed here, which need to be considered prior to deciding to bury drilling wastes.</p>
<list id="list1-0734242X11419892" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Depth of pit. A burial pit should be located at a distance of at least 1.5 metres above any groundwater. This will greatly reduce the risk of contamination of the groundwater with drilling waste. In addition, the top of the burial pit should be located well below the potential rooting zone of plants either already growing or likely to grow in that area in the future. Generally the rooting zone is around 1.0 metre.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Soil type. This is an important consideration. Soil type varies from clay soils and other impermeable soils to permeable soils such as sandy soils.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Control of runoff and leachate. The use of geo-membranes and clay as pit liners will assist in controlling aqueous fractions, preventing groundwater contamination.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Monitoring. Regular sampling and monitoring will help reduce the potential for environmental damage caused through failure of the pit to control the drilling waste.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Chemical composition. A knowledge of the original chemical composition of the drilling waste is essential in determining the potential risk of pit burial and to determining the optimum pit burial procedure.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reactivity of drilling waste. A knowledge of the reactivity of the drilling waste is also key in the waste management process. Moisture content, dissolved oxygen and metal content are all important parameters to be measured.</p></list-item>

<title>On- and off-site re-injection of cuttings</title>
<p>Tightening regulations and increased environmental controls have forced operators of oil and gas exploration to explore new solutions to overcome disposal problems of drill cuttings. One of the techniques that the industry has developed is to inject drill cuttings as ground up material into a subsurface formation where it is likely to remain for the indefinite future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0734242X11419892">OSPAR, 2001</xref>). Re-injection of drill cuttings is mostly a batch process using slurries of cuttings mixed with waste mud and water before being sent to a holding tank and then injected downhole. In offshore applications drill solids are mixed with seawater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0734242X11419892">Wojtanowicz, 2008</xref>). An example of cuttings re-injection is the pilot process introduced in Shell Expro’s Brent field in 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11419892">Brakel et al., 1997</xref>). The cuttings discharged from shale shakers are fed into a slurrification unit where the initial cuttings slurry is formed by the addition of sea water. This slurry is pumped to the grinding unit. The cuttings are ground to the required specification and then injected into the disposal well.</p>

<title>Solidification and stabilization</title>
<p>There exist a number of non-biological alternatives to bioremediation of the drill cuttings. A range of techniques, involving physical and/or chemical immobilization can be employed to transform the waste into a less hazardous form. Solidification/stabilization as a method of treatment for liquid or semi-liquid wastes can be traced back to the treatment of low-level radioactive waste in the 1950s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0734242X11419892">Mohamed and Antia, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0734242X11419892">Wojtanowicz, 2008</xref>). The US EPA has described them as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Solidification refers to techniques that encapsulate the waste in a monolithic solid of high structural integrity. The encapsulation may be of fine waste particles (micro-encapsulation) or of a large block or container of wastes (macro-encapsulation). Solidification does not necessarily involve a chemical interaction between the wastes and the solidifying reagents, but may mechanically bind the waste into the monolith. Contaminant migration is restricted by vastly decreasing the surface area exposed to leaching and/or by isolating the wastes within an impervious encapsulate.</p>
<p>Stabilization refers to those techniques that reduce the hazard potential of a waste by converting the contaminants into their least soluble, mobile or toxic form. The physical nature and handling characteristics of the waste are not necessarily changed by stabilization.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Frequently, both stabilization and solidification processes are combined, thereby changing both the physical and chemical structure, to ensure that the contaminants will remain in the matrix even if the monolith deteriorates. Cement and pozzolanic-based processes or a combination of cement and pozzolans (e.g. fly ash, lime, kiln dust) are the methods of choice in the solidification/stabilization industry today. Cement-based processes create an alkaline environment suitable to the containment of several toxic metals. The leaching of a pollutant from a cement-based waste depends on whether it remains in solution in the pore system or is immobilized through chemical reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0734242X11419892">Mohamed and Antia, 1998</xref>). A combination of cement, fly ash, lime, and calcium oxide have been used most frequently as solidification/stabilization additives for treating drill cuttings and other types of wet solids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11419892">Chandler et al., 1997</xref>). A field study tested seven types of additives for stabilizing cuttings and assessing the performance of stabilized cuttings as a substrate for growing wetlands plants. These included: medium-ground mica-based material, fine-ground mica, three different commercial mixtures of recycled cellulose fibres, walnut nut plug, and pecan nut plug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0734242X11419892">Hester et al., 2003</xref>). Various other commercial products with proprietary compositions have been marketed. Solidification/stabilization should be adapted for site-specific applications depending on the end-use of the treated material and the chemical characteristics of the waste. Conducting laboratory tests to determine the proper blend of additives to achieve the desired material properties is recommended. Some companies have used stabilization and solidification for the treatment of drilling wastes with the resulting materials being used for road foundations, backfill for earthworks or as building materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0734242X11419892">Morillon et al., 2002</xref>). Two different types of processed drill cuttings, one obtained from physical separation of the drilling fluids from the cuttings, the other from further processing and encapsulation of the cuttings in a silica matrix, have been utilized in experiments to assess the potential of processed drill cuttings in terms of their ability to support wetland vegetation and potential toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0734242X11419892">Shaffer et al., 1998</xref>). Performance of plants grown in the first substrate was comparable to those planted in dredge spoil, a common wetland restoration substrate and topsoil. Performance of plants grown in the encapsulated substrate was greatly reduced compared to all other substrate types under fresh water conditions, but became equivalent under saline conditions. It became apparent that cuttings stabilized in a silica matrix had a pH higher than 11 and thus did not support plant growth as well as un-stabilized cuttings. In these studies, there appeared to be little danger of migration of metals from drill cuttings into interstitial waters or of bioaccumulation of metals from these drill cuttings, with the exception of barium. Concern has been expressed about the long-term stability of the solidification/stabilization processes as they are considered less compatible with organic wastes, because organic compounds may inhibit binder hydration and are generally not chemically bound in binder hydration products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0734242X11419892">Trussell and Spence, 1994</xref>). Physical entrapment in the binder matrix, and sorption onto the surface of binder hydration products are the two key factors for immobilization of organic contaminants (Leonard and Stegemann, 2009). A possible method for improving the effectiveness of solidification/stabilization for organic waste is by using binders that increase sorption of organic compounds, thereby improving their immobilization and preventing their detrimental effects on binder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0734242X11419892">Vipulanandan and Krishnan, 1990</xref>). Leaching compliance testing showed that 20% blast furnace slag–Portland cement and 30% lime–Portland cement binders of the low oil content mix resulted in converting synthetic drill cuttings to a stable non-reactive hazardous waste and reducing oil concentrations to values compliant with the UK acceptance criteria for non-hazardous landfills. Overall, because of the equipment and space requirements for solidification/stabilization, this is not a practical process to use at offshore locations. It can be used at onshore locations for either onshore drilling wastes or offshore wastes that have been hauled back to shore. Current costs for solidification/stabilization range from AU$100–250 per tonne excluding landfill disposal costs (Davies, Envardi Pty Ltd, personal commun.).</p>
<p>Naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) is the term used to describe materials that contain radionuclides that exist in the natural environment. Long-lived radioactive elements of interest include uranium, thorium, potassium, and any of their radioactive decay products, such as radium, radon and lead. These elements have always been present in the Earth’s crust and within the tissues of all living species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0734242X11419892">RHSA, 2005</xref>). Naturally occurring radioactive elements such as uranium and thorium are dissolved in very low concentrations during normal reactions between water and rock or soil and are present in the oil/gas source rocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0734242X11419892">USGS, 1999</xref>). Oil and gas industry operations sometimes cause NORMs to accumulate at elevated concentrations in by-product waste streams, such as production water, sands and oily sludges. Radium precipitates out on equipment surfaces resulting in sludges and hard scales. The scale is typically a mixture of carbonate and sulfate minerals, including barite (barium sulfate) which is known to readily incorporate radium in its structure. The sources of most of the radioactivity are isotopes of uranium-238 (<sup>238</sup>U) and thorium-232 (<sup>232</sup>Th), which are naturally present in the subsurface formations from which both oil and gas are produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0734242X11419892">Veil et al., 1998</xref>). Naturally occurring radioactive material generated by the petroleum industry may be divided into two general categories: waste containing radium and their progeny and waste containing only lead-210 (<sup>210</sup>Pb) and its progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0734242X11419892">Smithet al., 1999</xref>). The latter typically accumulate inside gas-processing equipment from the decay of radon-222 (<sup>222</sup>Rn), whereas of the former, radium-226 (<sup>226</sup>Ra) of the U-238 decay series and radium-228 (<sup>228</sup>Ra) of the Th-232 decay series, are the primary radionuclides of concern. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X11419892">Table 3</xref> shows typical activities for radium levels in various oil and gas production waste. Current waste disposal routes being considered or used for NORM waste management in Australia include the following methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11419892">ARPANSA, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>The worldwide petroleum industry has developed a number of NORM waste disposal options, the application of which depends on the legislative framework of a given country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11419892">APPEA, 2002</xref>). However, it is evident that there is no consistent approach within in relation to the level of radioactivity at which regulation should commence. In Australia, disposal options of NORM wastes range from the ocean-floor dumping of petroleum exploration wastes in the Northern Territory to their deposition in salt caverns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X11419892">Cassels and Waite, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0734242X11419892">Veil et al., 1998</xref>). In an amended licence for the treatment and disposal of waste, NORM-containing oily grit and scale sludges, sourced from oil rigs in Bass Strait, is deposited at the NORM waste disposal facility at Dutson Downs in Gippsland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734242X11419892">EPA Victoria, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0734242X11419892">RHSA, 2005</xref>). The waste is stabilized with lime and cement before being deposited in highly engineered landfill cells with multiple bentonite clay and high-density polyethylene liners and leachate monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0734242X11419892">Gippsland Water, Soil and Organic Recycling Facility, 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-0734242X11419892">
<title>Thermal treatment technologies</title>
<p>Thermal technologies include a range of processes using heat to remove or destroy contaminants by incineration, gasification, desorption, stripping, volatilization, pyrolysis or some combination of these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0734242X11419892">Wood, 2001</xref>). Thermal treatment can be conducted in a fixed or mobile installation and is broadly grouped into two categories: destruction of the contaminant by incineration and removal or recovery of the contaminant by desorption. The use of thermal treatment is effective in degrading the organic contaminants, reducing the overall volume of the waste and in reducing the mobility of metals and salts; however it may be necessary to instigate a post thermal treatment procedure for the metals and salts. Drilling wastes high in hydrocarbon content (around 10–40%) are particularly suited for thermal treatment. Thermal treatment can be used in combination with other treatment technologies either as a pre-disposal step prior to landfilling or land farming or as a final treatment following pre-treatment using bioremediation technologies.</p>
<p>Incineration is a high-temperature process, which directly or indirectly heats the material to temperatures of 820 up to 1600°C and reduces the contaminant to inert residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0734242X11419892">Nemerow, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0734242X11419892">Wood, 2001</xref>). Hazardous waste incinerators have been limited to two types: liquid injection and rotary kiln systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734242X11419892">Freeman, 1981</xref>). In the former, liquid wastes are fed along with support fuel and air for combustion into the incinerator, while the latter consists mainly of rotary or cement kilns, which can handle large volumes of solid and liquid wastes. Incinerators are usually employed to destroy organic wastes which pose high levels of risk to health and the environment. Incineration of oily wastes of exploration and production wastes is generally not necessary, except where located in sensitive environments or other disposal options are not available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0734242X11419892">Owens et al. 1993</xref>). As incineration is a high temperature process, it destroys the soil structure and removes all natural humic components. Residues may contain high heavy metal contents and exhaust gasses may need to be treated to remove particulates and harmful combustion products such as sulfur dioxides, nitrogen oxides or hydrogen chloride. At the higher end of incineration temperature, vitrification of the soil occurs forming a monolithic solid glassy product. Vitrified contaminants are either destroyed or trapped in the glassy product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0734242X11419892">Wood, 2001</xref>). Most incineration of drilling wastes occurs in rotary kilns, a commercially available technology, which is able to incinerate almost any waste. A rotary kiln tumbles the waste to enhance contact with hot burner gases. Capital equipment costs for an incinerator that processes between 3 and 10 tonnes h<sup>−1</sup> ranges from AU$5–7 million. The process can handle wastes with up to 10% hydrocarbons. Minimum costs to process solids with 10% hydrocarbons at the plant are AU$500 tonne<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
<p>Thermal desorption is a physical separation process and is not designed to destroy organics. Waste materials are heated to temperatures in the region of 600°C to volatilize water and organic contaminants, mainly hydrocarbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0734242X11419892">Wood, 2001</xref>). A carrier gas or vacuum system transports volatilized water and organics to a gas treatment system, typically consisting of scrubbers or filters. The bed temperatures and residence times designed into these systems will volatilize selected contaminants but will typically not oxidize them. Two common thermal desorption designs are the <italic>rotary dryer</italic> and <italic>thermal screw</italic>. Rotary dryers are horizontal cylinders that can be indirectly or directly fired. The dryer is normally inclined and rotated. For the thermal screw units, screw conveyors or hollow augers are used to transport the medium through an enclosed trough. Hot oil or steam circulates through the auger to indirectly heat the medium. Rotary dryers typically can treat soils with an organic content of less than 2% while thermal screw units may treat soils with up to 50% organics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0734242X11419892">Noyes, 1998</xref>). All thermal desorption systems require treatment of the off-gas to remove particulates and contaminants. Particulates are removed by conventional particulate removal equipment, such as wet scrubbers or fabric filters. Contaminants, such as volatiles organic carbons are removed through condensation followed by carbon adsorption, or they are destroyed in a secondary combustion chamber or a catalytic oxidizer. A variant of thermal desorption is thermal phase separation, in which gases are condensed and separated to recover heavier hydrocarbons. It is a phase separation process based on indirectly heated thermal desorption. A sealed, fixed-chamber design is used to indirectly heat material to the boiling point of the base fluids, which can vary between 220 and 500°C, volatizing hydrocarbons from the cuttings. The volatized vapours are extracted in the desorption chamber and rapidly cooled and condensed for oil–water separation. Thermal phase separation processing can remove and recover 99% of hydrocarbons from hydrocarbon-based feedstock, with less than 2% solids in the recovered fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0734242X11419892">Khodja et al., 2007</xref>). Thermal desorption can effectively treat soils, sludges and filter cakes and remove volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds. Inorganic compounds, however, are not easily removed with this process and temperatures reached in thermal desorbers generally do not oxidize metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0734242X11419892">Noyes, 1998</xref>). The suitability of thermally treated drilling mud waste for use in landfill liner or cover systems was evaluated using two types of oil-based mud samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11419892">Carignan et al., 2007</xref>). Based on hydraulic conductivity values being less than 10<sup>−8</sup> m s<sup>−1</sup>, an organic carbon content of approximately 2% and toxic characteristic leachate procedure (TCLP) results, the material could potentially be used in composite liner systems together with geotextile membranes or geosynthetic clay liners. Capital equipment costs for a thermal desorption plant that processes between 3 and 10 tonnes h<sup>−1</sup> range from AU$5–8 million. Current contractor operator treatment costs range from AU$400 to $1500 per tonne (Davies, Envardi Pty Ltd, personal commun.). The economics of the process may improve in cases where the thermal desorption process is operated as part of the overall production facility.</p>
<p>Microwave energy is delivered directly to materials through molecular interactions with the electromagnetic field. This is in contrast to conventional thermal processing where energy is transferred to a material through conduction. The internal temperature distribution of a material subjected to conventional heating is limited by its thermal conductivity, whereas microwave heating results in all individual elements of the material being heated individually. Accordingly, microwave heating times of less than 1% of those required using conventional heating methods can be achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0734242X11419892">Meredith, 1998</xref>). Transporting large quantities of drilling waste from offshore platforms to land poses significant safety and operational hazards to oil-field personnel. The major factor which currently prevents successful on-shore treatment processes being used on platforms offshore is space. There is thus is clearly a need for the development of offshore cuttings processing systems. Furthermore, recent legislation in the United Kingdom and the European Union has prevented the discharge of cuttings directly into the sea unless the oil levels are below 1% (w/w) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0734242X11419892">Robinson et al., 2008</xref>). Microwave treatment of OCDC has been identified as one process, which, if able to meet the environmental discharge limits, can be retrofitted to existing production platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0734242X11419892">Robinson et al., 2009</xref>). A pilot study on removal of oil content from oil-contaminated drill cuttings demonstrated that oil-contaminated cuttings can be remediated to below the off-shore discharge threshold of 1% (w/w) using a novel continuous cavity mode and a single cavity batch mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0734242X11419892">Patin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0734242X11419892">Shang et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, the continuous processing achieved could further reduce residual levels to below 0.1% (w/w), which is the classification for non-hazardous waste.</p>

<title>Bioremediation technologies for treating drill cuttings</title>
<p>Bioremediation can be defined as any process that uses organisms (bacteria, plants, fungi) or their enzymes to biologically degrade contaminated soil and waste into non-toxic residues. Bioremediation is a natural process which, although capable of generating some greenhouse gas emissions (e.g. methane from anaerobic processes), mostly involves the environmentally friendly conversion of contaminated matrices into a stable and often re-usable products (Diplock et al., 2009; Gallego et al., 2001). As a biological process, the rate of bioremediation is dependent upon the bioremediation environment, the composition of the organic contaminants to be degraded and the type of treatment utilized. Bioremediation can therefore be a rapid process (requiring weeks for completion) when conditions are favourable or be a relatively slow process, requiring months or years to reach the desired result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0734242X11419892">Reis, 1996</xref>). Environmental factors such as nutrient availability, micro-organisms present in the soil and aerobic conditions all play a role in achieving bioremediation and different strategies are employed when remediation is carried out <italic>in situ</italic> or <italic>ex situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0734242X11419892">OSPAR, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0734242X11419892">Vidali, 2001</xref>). The most commonly used ex situ bioremediation technologies for treating drilling mud and cuttings are described below.</p>
<sec id="section8-0734242X11419892">
<title>Composting and biopile-based remediation</title>
<p>Composting may be defined as the conversion of organic waste into useful organic soil amendments that provide nutrients to crops and enhance the tilth, fertility and productivity of soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11419892">Anon, 1980</xref>). Composting is therefore a form of recycling a material through the process into a new resource. For composting, wastes are mixed with organic bulking agents such as wood chips, straw or some other organic waste material. This results in increased porosity allowing both air and water to penetrate the matrix. Biodegradation of hydrocarbons occurs naturally; however, the rate of biodegradation can be greatly enhanced by manipulating certain environmental parameters, including the addition of nitrogen- and phosphorus-containing fertilizers to achieve optimum carbon: nitrogen and carbon: phosphorus ratios, aeration/tilling, and pH and moisture maintenance. With composting systems, treated waste may be bioremediated within a controlled environment, such as in-vessel systems. Both aeration and moisture addition can be controlled through either windrow turning or the use of forced aeration systems. Generally, a moisture content of between 40 and 60% (w/w) is optimal for microbial activity. During the composting process, intense microbial activity generates considerable heat, often reaching a temperature of 70°C or more. Prolonged high temperatures in composting systems can also lead to charring of the soil matrix, making the end product less useable for soil amendment applications. In closed vessels, control of volatile emissions is carried out by absorption into biofiltration units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X11419892">Crawford, 2006</xref>). Biofiltration involves passing contaminated air through a bed of soil, compost or peat and work well for volatile components of petroleum as well as for odour control. Composting has been examined as a treatment for a variety of contaminants from the oil and gas industry; examples include petroleum sludges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0734242X11419892">McMillen et al., 1993</xref>), petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0734242X11419892">Jørgensen et al., 2000</xref>), oily sludges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0734242X11419892">Ouyang et al., 2005</xref>) and drilling mud-polluted soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0734242X11419892">Rojas-Avelizapa et al., 2007</xref>). A composting biopile trial of soils at a site contaminated with drilling mud showed the effects of amending the biopiles with carbon bulking agents, urea and dipotassium phosphate to adjust the nutrient conditions for optimal microbial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0734242X11419892">Rojas-Avelizapa et al., 2007</xref>). A total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentration of 99 300 ± 23 000 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> was reduced 94% to a concentration of 5500 ± 770 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> over a period of 180 days compared with a 77% reduction to 22 900 ± 7800 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> for biopiles that did not receive any amendment. These results demonstrate the benefits of adjusting the soil conditions to optimize microbial activity.</p>
<p>A field trial involving the composting of soils contaminated with lubricating oil and diesel oil in two separate biopiles showed a reduction of about 70% (2400 to 700 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) and 71% (700 to 200 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) in mineral oil content for the respective soils over a period of approximately 150 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0734242X11419892">Jørgensen et al., 2000</xref>). These final concentrations are well within most health-based investigation levels worldwide. For example the health investigation levels in Australia for &lt;C16–C35 aliphatic alkanes range from 5600 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> for human exposure in residential settings with garden to 28 000 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> for commercial/industrial settings as per the national guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0734242X11419892">NEPC, 1999</xref>). A 56-day composting trial of oily sludges (327.7–371.2 g kg<sup>−1</sup>) resulted in a total petroleum hydrocarbon removal of 45–47% following nutrient and microbial augmentation, compared to a reduction of 13–20% total hydrocarbon for a non-amended indigenous microbial compost consortium only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0734242X11419892">Jørgensen et al., 2000</xref>). Various amendments were also trialled over 365 days using 1 m<sup>3</sup> biopiles in the laboratory and composting oily sludges from an oil refinery wastewater treatment plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0734242X11419892">Kriipsalu et al., 2007</xref>). The reduction of TPH on mass balance in the trials was 62% for amendment with sand (3.71 to 1.41 kg), 51% for amendment with matured oil compost 3.99 to 1.94 kg), 74% using kitchen waste compost (3.49 to 0.91 kg) and 49% for shredded waste wood amendment (5.93 to 3.04 kg). On the basis of this evidence composted wastes that meet health-based criteria have good commercial potential either as soil amendments, soil conditioners or for use in land reclamation and re-vegetation disturbed areas or cover landfills. McMillen and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0734242X11419892">McMillen et al., 2004</xref>) reported costs at greater than US$100 tonne<sup>−1</sup> for treatment of exploration and production wastes using in-vessel composting, bio-slurry systems, soil venting and saturated zone bioremediation technologies. In most jurisdictions, composted wastes that meet health-based criteria can be re-used as soil amendments, soil conditioners or for use in land reclamation and re-vegetation disturbed areas or cover landfills. Although composting represents a cost-effective and practical approach for the management of drill cuttings waste, it should be noted that the time and space requirements can be prohibitive, and drill cuttings wastes with particularly high starting concentrations of hydrocarbons cannot always be sufficiently reduced by composting alone to allow unrestricted reuse of the final composted material.</p>

<title>Land application</title>
<p>The aim of applying drilling waste and contaminated soils to land is to enable the indigenous soil microbial community to break down the waste constituents in a process termed natural attenuation. Land farming and land spreading are two bioremediation techniques where natural attenuation processes are applied. Land farming can be defined as the controlled and repeated application of wastes to the surface of the soil surface, using the naturally occurring soil micro-organisms to mineralize the contaminating hydrocarbons. In addition land farming will result in the dilution and potential attenuation of metals, and the transformation and assimilation of other constituents of drilling wastes. Generally, the practice is limited to the treatment of the top 10–35 cm of soil. The soil may be supplemented with nutrients (fertilizer, compost, manure) to support the microbial catabolism of the added contaminated carbon. Soils can be kept moist by irrigation and aerated by periodic tilling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X11419892">Crawford, 2006</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0734242X11419892">Vidali, 2001</xref>). Land farming can be a relatively low-cost drilling waste management approach. However, if there is a danger that contaminants may leach through the vadose zone towards the groundwater or vaporize to dangerous levels in the atmosphere, then additional controls must be implemented. This may require the installation of liners or barriers in addition to leachate collection systems and vapour containment structures. Land farm areas must therefore be managed carefully to prevent migration of contaminants and cross-contamination of ground water or surface water in the vicinity. After applying the waste, hydrocarbon concentrations are monitored to measure progress and determine the need for enhancing the biodegradation processes. Although nearly all constituents in petroleum products are biodegradable, the more complex the molecular structure of the constituent, the more difficult the biological treatment. Most low molecular-weight (&lt;C9) aliphatic and mono-aromatic constituents are more easily biodegraded than higher molecular weight aliphatic or poly-aromatic organic constituents. This means that repeated applications can lead to accumulation of high molecular weight compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11419892">Callahan et al., 2002</xref>). Bioavailability of the hydrocarbon is another factor that has to be assessed and measures to increase bioavailability may need to be instigated. The use of chemical dispersants may alter the normal behaviour of hydrocarbons by increasing their functional water solubility, resulting in increased bioavailability and altered interactions between dispersant, oil, and biological membranes. Common hydrocarbon dispersants include Corexit (Exxon Chemicals, Houston, TX), which is composed of non-ionic and anionic surfactant along with hydrocarbon solvent (ethylene glycol mono-butyl ether) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0734242X11419892">Wolfe et al., 2001</xref>). It is generally accepted that soil concentrations heavy metals exceeding 2500 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> are considered inhibitory and/or toxic to most micro-organisms. Heavy metals or inorganics are generally not biodegraded but may be immobilized or volatilized. As a rule of thumb, the higher the molecular weight and the more substitutions (especially halo- or nitro groups) on ring structures, the more difficult and slower the degradation will be. The general criteria for constituent concentration and land farming effectiveness are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X11419892">Table 4</xref>. Typically, land farms are uncovered and thus exposed to climatic factors including rainfall, drought and wind. During and following a significant rainfall event, the moisture content of the soils may be temporarily in excess of that required for effective bacterial activity. Conversely, during periods of drought, moisture content may be below the effective range and additional moisture may need to be added. Erosion of land farm soils can occur during windy periods as well as during tilling or ploughing operations. Seasonal changes influence the length of the land farming period, which may last all year in warm regions while it may be ranging from 7 to 9 months in colder climates. Special precautions can be taken, including enclosing the land farm within a greenhouse-type structure or introducing special bacteria (psychrophiles), which are capable of activity at lower temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0734242X11419892">Saterbak et al., 1999</xref>). Clean up requirements for land farm treatment include reductions in TPH concentration greater than 95% and constituent concentration &gt;0.1 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>. Although the threshold limit varies greatly depending on bacteria-specific and constituent-specific features, generally constituent concentrations below 0.1 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> are not achievable by biological treatment alone. In addition, experience has shown that reductions in TPH concentrations greater than 95% can be very difficult to achieve because of the presence of recalcitrant or non-degradable species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0734242X11419892">US EPA, 2004</xref>). A trial study on land farming of oil-based drill cuttings at an average loading of 540 m<sup>3</sup> ha<sup>−1</sup> and TPH concentrations between 20 000 and 73 000 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> gave reduction to approximately 0.13–0.56% of initial TPH concentration over a three year treatment time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11419892">Cole and Mark, 2000</xref>). The cost of treating petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soils has been estimated at US$ 30–60 tonne<sup>−1</sup> by the EPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0734242X11419892">US EPA, 2004</xref>). Two case studies on land farming and sludge treatment of hydrocarbon-affected soil, sand, drilling mud and tank bottoms showed costs for the treatment of metric tonne dropping from US$ 10 to US$ 3.60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0734242X11419892">Line et al., 1996</xref>). In other studies, pre-treating the wastes by composting and activating aerobic biodegradation by regular turning (open windrows) or by forced ventilation (biopiles) was found to reduce the amount of area required for land farming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0734242X11419892">Morillon et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Land spreading</title>
<p>In land spreading, also known as land treatment, the biological processes are similar to those already described above. The main differentiating factor for land spreading is that one single application of the sludge or drilling waste is made to the soil. Land spreading is a technique that aims to achieve degradation of the contaminants through the natural soil microbial community whilst maintaining the subsoil’s physical, chemical and biological functions through limitation of the amount of contaminants penetrating the subsoil. In land spreading drilling waste is spread on across the surface and the soil tilled to a depth of 15–20 cm to allow mixing. Tilling enhances both the rate of biodegradation and volatilization of the hydrocarbon contaminants. An investigation into the soil-dependent bioremediation and ecotoxicity of drilling fluids, including linear alpha and isomerized olefins, mineral oil, isomerized paraffin and diesel oil was carried out using coniferous forest soil, silty clay and a clay loam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0734242X11419892">Visser et al., 2002</xref>). Bioremediation of isomerized olefin, alpha olefin and isomerized tetradecene in forest subsoil resulted in almost complete degradation of these fluids with no associated toxicity after remediation based on short-term plant, earthworm and Microtox™ bioassays. Isomerized paraffin and mineral oil was degraded to less than 50% while the disappearance of diesel to 71% was attributed primarily to the abiotic loss of the large volatile component in this fluid. Based on the toxicity assays, soil following diesel treatment was found to be still extremely toxic, with a complete mortality of earthworms after 7 days exposure. Degradation of linear alpha olefin, one tetradecene, linear paraffin and isomerized paraffin was more rapid in loam soil than in clay soil, indicative of low bioavailability due to sorption of fluids to clay particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11419892">Chaîneau et al., 1996</xref>). Land spreading has both, advantages and disadvantages. Cost and low technology input are an advantage, together with the potential to improve existing soil characteristics. A disadvantage however, is the requirement for large land area. Field-scale experiments on bioremediation of soil heavily contaminated with crude oil and solid <italic>n</italic>-alkane (paraffin) wastes removed from the surface of drilling equipment was undertaken using the successive treatment of contaminated soil using a bioslurry reactor and land farming cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0734242X11419892">Kuyukina et al., 2003</xref>). Laboratory analyses of soil samples indicated contamination levels up to 200 g kg<sup>−1</sup> of total recoverable petroleum hydrocarbons. Average oil composition consisted of 64% aliphatics, 25% aromatics, 8% heterocyclics, and 3% of tars/asphaltenes. Slurry-phase biotreatment of the contaminated soil resulted in an 88% reduction in oil concentration after 2 months. The resulting reactor product, containing approximately 25 000 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> of TPH was loaded into land farming cells and enhanced with different treatments (e.g.: soil tilling, bulking with woodchips, watering and biofertilizer addition). The rates of oil biodegradation were 300 to 600 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>day<sup>−1</sup>. As a result, TPH levels dropped to 1000–1500 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> of TPH after 5 to 7 weeks.</p>

<sec id="section11-0734242X11419892">
<title>Bioreactors</title>
<p>The alternative to land farming/spreading is a biodegradation process in a contained bioreactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0734242X11419892">Ward et al., 2003</xref>). Liquid/solid treatment using a bioreactor is recognized as a technology applicable to the degradation of petroleum-based waste products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0734242X11419892">Stroo, 1989</xref>). Essentially the processes that occur in the bioreactor leading to the aerobic degradation of the contaminating substances are the same as those underlying land spreading and composting, with the only difference being that these reactions all occur within a confined and highly controlled system. This results in an increase in the rate of biodegradation of the contaminants through optimization of the environmental conditions such as temperature, aeration and moisture, factors which are known to affect the rate of biodegradation of hydrocarbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0734242X11419892">Kuhad and Gupta, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0734242X11419892">Van Hamme et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, in a bioreactor, nutrients (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) can be added, leading to biostimulation of the indigenous micro-organisms and subsequently to increased rates of degradation. Air sparging or intensive mechanical mixing of the reactor contents provides oxygen concentrations of at least 2.0 mg L<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11419892">Anon, 1980</xref>). This mechanical mixing results in significant contact between micro-organisms and the waste components being degraded. To accelerate the initial rates of degradation, micro-organisms with a known ability to degrade the contaminants can be added (bioaugmented) to the bioreactor. Most of the nutrient additives used for amending the bioreactors are common agricultural waste products such as chicken manure, food processing wastes, etc. Bioreactor processes for wastewater or contaminated solid material (soil, sediment, sludge) are typically operated as a batch or semi-continuous process. Another variation on reactors designed for treatment of petroleum waste sludges is the slurry-phase biotreatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11419892">Christodoulatos and Koutsospyros, 1998</xref>). Slurry-phase biotreatment has been successfully applied to the decontamination of oily sludges and soils that have contaminant concentrations ranging from 2500 to 250 000 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11419892">Christodoulatos and Koutsospyros, 1998</xref>). Petroleum waste sludges have been treated in a continuous flow multistage slurry bioreactor system that operates at relatively short residence times with minimal loss of volatile constituents using the patented Bio-Slurry Reaction Process (BSRP) tank-based, slurry-phase biotreatment process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X11419892">Castaldi 2003</xref>). The process was demonstrated on a commercial scale where petrochemical waste tar destruction of greater than 80% occurred in continuously fed slurry-phase systems of 10 000 L each, at temperatures above 30°C and a 42 day residence time (US EPA, 1990). Although the use of bioreactors leads to enhanced rates of degradation in comparison with less intensive processes such as land spreading the costs associated with capital, operation and maintenance are also relatively high compared with other forms of biological treatment. Estimated costs for bioreactor treatment of oily cuttings waste are less than US$350 per tonne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0734242X11419892">McMillen et al., 2004</xref>). After the desired treatment level has been reached, and depending on the constituents, liquids may be reused, transported to wastewater treatment facilities, injected or discharged. Solids may be buried, applied to soils, used as fill or treated further to stabilize components such as metals.</p>

<title>Vermiculture</title>
<p>Vermiculture is the use of worms for the decomposition of organic waste, resulting in the formation of end product(s) which, when applied to crops assist or enhance plant growth. The application of vermiculture to the active biodegradation (vermidigestion) of drilling wastes has recently been described. It was demonstrated that worms were capable of facilitating the degradation of hydrocarbon-contaminated drilling waste following land farming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0734242X11419892">Norman et al., 2002</xref>). In the experiments, a blend of cuttings and sawdust containing 41 000 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> (dry weight) hydrocarbon drill cuttings was applied to windrows, generally once per week, with the worms consuming the applied material over a 5 to 7 day period. The authors reported a decrease in hydrocarbon concentration from 4600 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> to below 100 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> in less than 28 days, with less than 200 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> remaining after 10 days. Because vermicast (manure) has important fertilizer properties, the process may provide an alternative drill cutting disposal method. In a second study the complete degradation of the cuttings (originally 5–10 mm in diameter) and no detectable mortality among the worms was demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0734242X11419892">OSPAR, 2001</xref>). There are limited examples of this technology being used but a treatment price of US$70–90 m<sup>3</sup> is probably based on the limited amount of data available. However, these costs may be offset by sales of the resulting worm cast as organic fertilizer and soil conditioner. However, to date few studies on the effects of vermicomposting on petroleum hydrocarbons have been reported, with many of the investigations being descriptive investigations as opposed to mechanistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0734242X11419892">Norman et al., 2002</xref>). A recent study investigated biochemical processes during bioremediation treatment of oil refinery sludge with (a) a mixture of micro-organisms, enzymes and nutrients, (b) compost only and (c) compost with earthworms for 3 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0734242X11419892">Hickman and Reid, 2008</xref>). The results indicated that the reduction in TPH of the oil refinery sludge was greatest in the treatment with earthworms (50.3%) followed by compost only (39.5%), highlighting the usefulness of the co-application of compost and earthworms. The influence of additives and earthworms on TPH degradation was also investigated in a crude oil-polluted soil containing 5000 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> TPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11419892">Ceccanti et al., 2006</xref>). Additives were chosen from the following industrial waste products: (i) coffee grounds; (ii) horticultural waste (grass and wood chips); and (iii) brewery mash. The additives were added to the soil in mass concentrations 1 : 10 and degradation was followed for 28 days. Mash mixed into the soil resulted in a similar TPH decrease (20–34%) as in treatments with earthworms but without additives. Coffee grains or horticultural waste resulted in no significant decreases of TPH concentration. High mortality rates were attributed to lethal TPH concentrations of 5000 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> and higher. However, other studies have demonstrated that lower concentration levels (TPH &lt;4000 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) cause hardly any mortality in earthworms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0734242X11419892">Saterbak et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0734242X11419892">Schaefer and Filser, 2007</xref>). In conclusion, it is possible that the earthworm application may be most suitable for the later stages of the bioremediation of even highly contaminated sites, when TPH concentrations and potential toxicity have been decreased to a reduced toxicity level.</p>

<title>Application for end use of treated cuttings</title>
<p>Most drill cuttings have been historically managed through disposal, although some are treated and beneficially reused. Before the cuttings can be reused, it is necessary to ensure that the hydrocarbon content, moisture content, salinity, and clay content of the cuttings are suitable for the intended use of the material. Some of the recorded applications for the reuse of treated drill cuttings are briefly described below (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X11419892">Dorn and Salanitro, 2000</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section14-0734242X11419892">
<title>Road spreading</title>
<p>One use of cuttings is to stabilize surfaces that are subject to erosion, such as roads or drilling pads. Oily cuttings serve the same function as traditional tar-and-chip road surfacing. Not all regulatory agencies allow road spreading. Where it is permitted, operators must obtain permission from the regulatory agency and the landowner before spreading cuttings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0734242X11419892">
<title>Use as filler</title>
<p>Treated cuttings that have been cleaned through the processes described above can be used as fill material at landfills or as aggregates in concrete or bricks. Other possible construction applications include use in road pavements, bitumen, and asphalt or use in cement manufacture. The economics of this approach is rarely based on the value of the finished product, but rather on the alternative cost for the other disposal options. Properly done, drilling waste can be used as a filler or base material to make other products; however, in most jurisdictions around the world the legal liability will stay with the company who produced the waste initially.</p>

<title>Restoration of wetlands using cuttings</title>
<p>Another new application for drilling waste involves using them as a substrate for restoring coastal wetlands. The US DOE funded several research projects to test the feasibility of treating cuttings and using them to help restore damaged wetlands in Louisiana. The results indicated that properly treated cuttings can support the growth of wetlands vegetation. This promising reuse option is expected to be demonstrated at field scale in the US over the next decade.</p>

<title>Use of cuttings for fuel</title>
<p>Several trials have been conducted in the UK using oily cuttings as a fuel at a power plant. Cuttings were blended in at a low rate with coal, the primary fuel source. The resulting ash was much the same as the ash from burning just the coal. Generating stations should be located near the point where cuttings originate or are landed onshore from offshore operations, to minimize the need to transport cuttings.</p>
