<abstract>
<p>Early Syriac Christianity presents two notable paradigms for understanding liturgy as a means for the ethical formation of the congregation. Ephrem the Syrian (d. 373) in his hymns for the Nativity vigil, and Jacob of Sarug (d. 521) in his verse homilies, each addressed their congregations in ways that utilized ritual participation in the liturgy for ethical and moral cultivation. Ephrem sought to instill his congregation with a biblical and theological understanding of the Nativity that would yield ethical enactment in the world. Jacob worked to use the experience of liturgical participation to mold the Christian’s moral disposition. For both, God’s salvation enabled the healing of the human condition in its various dimensions: physical, social, ecclesial. Liturgy as disciplined ritual activity provided the tools by which their congregations could learn, experience, and enact that healing.</p>

<p>Ancient Christian worship—no differently from that of any era—addressed a variety of purposes and needs. Primary among these was a concern for the formation and cultivation of the faithful believer as an ethical subject. In this essay, I will ask how early Christian leaders went about that task by considering two examples from late antique Syriac Christianity: first, the hymns of St. Ephrem the Syrian (d. 373) composed for the vigil service on the eve of the Nativity feast; and second, the homilies of St. Jacob of Sarug (d. 521) which expound and explain the liturgy for its participants.</p>
<p>Fundamental to my discussion is the notion that the ritual process of liturgy contributed to ethical formation, no less than expository presentation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0953946813484407">2</xref></sup> Hymns and homilies were vehicles for basic Christian instruction. They could present biblical stories and their proper interpretation, explain Christian doctrine and its right understanding, and instruct the faithful on Christian conduct. But their instructive capacity within the setting of liturgy was greater than their rhetorical content. For the context in which hymns and homilies were received—the ritual event of the liturgy itself—contributed substantially to their affective impact. What was sung in the vigil service, or received in liturgical exposition, was enhanced profoundly by the processes of patterned actions, sequenced presentation, sensory engagement, and collective encounter that liturgy included. Holy instruction was reinforced by the bodily disciplines of liturgical participation.</p>
<p>Because Syriac Christianity is generally unfamiliar to most scholars of Christian tradition, it can provide a fresh perspective on familiar themes. Distinctive from its better-known Greek and Latin counterparts, Syriac Christianity nonetheless shared in the broader cosmopolitan culture of the ancient eastern Mediterranean world. Syriac is a dialect of Aramaic, ‘the language Jesus spoke’. It originated as the dialect spoken in the region of Edessa (Sanliurfa), now in southeastern Turkey, during the early Christian period. By the third century <sc>ce</sc>, Syriac had developed into a distinct language spread widely throughout the eastern Mediterranean region, especially among Christians. It was soon a major language of trade routes that ran west into Europe, and east to China; it was the language of Christian missionaries along the Silk Road until the fourteenth century when catastrophic persecutions destroyed most of its Asian churches.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0953946813484407">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>A living language to this day, Syriac is a spoken and liturgical language among Christians of Iraq, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, eastern Turkey, and parts of India, as well as among the growing diaspora communities from those regions now settling in Europe, North America, and Australia. Throughout its history, Syriac has been a minority language spoken and sung by Christians in cultures and states dominated by other languages and religions. Yet it has flourished, above all as a language of poetry and scholarship. Perhaps its greatest achievements can be seen in the luminous brilliance of its liturgical poetry, especially that crafted during late antiquity (third through eighth centuries <sc>ce</sc>). Such was the historical juncture of the two figures here considered, Ephrem the Syrian and Jacob of Sarug.</p>
<sec id="section1-0953946813484407">
<title>Ephrem at the Nativity Vigil: Time and Incarnation</title>
<p>Ephrem the Syrian (c. 307–373) lived and worked in two of the greatest cities of the ancient eastern Mediterranean, Nisibis and Edessa, along the Roman-Persian border.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0953946813484407">4</xref></sup> A poet of prodigious talent, Ephrem served tirelessly as a catechetical teacher, hymnographer, and deacon. Among his works, his collected <italic>Hymns on the Nativity</italic> illustrate especially well Ephrem’s engagement of liturgical participation for purposes of ethical formation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0953946813484407">5</xref></sup> This collection of twenty-eight doctrinal hymns (called <italic>madrashe</italic>, in Syriac) was not composed as an integrated group. Rather, Ephrem wrote them at different times for use in the Nativity vigil.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0953946813484407">6</xref></sup> Two predominant themes of the collection are notable for our discussion: <italic>time</italic> (biblical past and liturgical present) and <italic>incarnation</italic> (God become human).</p>
<p>Both the feast and the vigil in its honor were relatively recent additions to the Christian calendar during Ephrem’s lifetime.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0953946813484407">7</xref></sup> These hymns help us understand what such developments entailed. From their content, we may reconstruct the vigil as a night time service lit by candels,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0953946813484407">8</xref></sup> with hymns sung by male and female choirs<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0953946813484407">9</xref></sup> and antiphonal responses offered by the congregation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0953946813484407">10</xref></sup> There were biblical readings and perhaps their explication, and people attended while fasting. The full social strata of the civic community might be present. The service was of long duration, and Ephrem himself (like his congregation) sometimes found it wearying.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0953946813484407">11</xref></sup> How, then, did Ephrem engage these ritual elements for the work of Christian ethical formation?</p>
<p>Ephrem’s hymns in general are deeply and richly biblical. In the fourth century, such a characteristic carried specific weight. In an era when few people (if any) could have owned a Bible, liturgy provided biblical education and knowledge. Biblical stories were depicted in church decoration, recounted in hymns, recited in prayers, and expounded in sermons. Ephrem’s Nativity hymns referenced biblical stories that his congregation would have heard throughout the ecclesiastical year, and probably those passages read in expectation of the Nativity feast itself. His references defined the Bible as a delineated sacred history, in which the Old Testament moved inexorably towards the birth of Christ.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best example is Ephrem’s Nativity Hymn 1. Here Ephrem began, ‘My Lord, this day [of your birth] gladdened kings, priests, and prophets,/for on it were fulfilled and realized all their words’ (1:1); the congregation sang their refrain: ‘Glory to You, Son of our Creator!’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0953946813484407">12</xref></sup> What follows is a dazzling tour of biblical history: from Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel, and Seth; through the early histories of Noah, Enoch, Abraham, and Isaac; the sagas of Moses, Aaron, Joshua, David, and Solomon; the prophecies of Elijah, Isaiah, Micah, Balaam, and Zechariah. Interwoven are the names of the holy but scandalous foremothers from the genealogy of Matt. 1:1-16: Tamar the daughter-in-law of Judah, Rahab the prostitute, Ruth the Moabite, and, repeatedly, the Virgin Mary. The cascade of names is overwhelming. Did the congregation recognize them all as they repeated their refrain through the first sixty verses of the hymn, those in which these figures are named and recalled? Did they know their stories? Perhaps Ephrem hoped so, if the congregation had indeed been attentive throughout the ecclesiastical year and in the weeks leading up to the feast itself.</p>
<p>More important, however, was the statement that referencing these many names made. For Ephrem here gathers up the fullness of biblical history, Old and New Testament. In the fourth-century Christian east, this meant asserting that the biblical canon must necessarily contain these texts. Such a view was not necessarily to be expected in Ephrem’s context. Diverse Christian groups advocated different canons. Some rejected the Old Testament altogether; others included different gospels or other writings that tended (in Ephrem’s eyes) to devalue the significance of Christ’s humanity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0953946813484407">13</xref></sup> Furthermore, Ephrem lived amid sizeable and flourishing Jewish communities. These claimed the Hebrew Bible as their own, and the same prophecies as foretelling a different messianic history. The ‘slandering’ of the Virgin Mary to which Ephrem refers in a number of the Nativity hymns may well have been criticisms by Jews, who rejected Christian accounts of her miraculous conception of Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0953946813484407">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The assertion of a biblical history that spanned from creation, through the whole of the Old Testament, to the birth, ministry, death, and resurrection of Christ, as in Ephrem’s Nativity Hymn 1, was a dramatic claim of divine dispensation. Here was defined the whole of sacred history, as a means for knowing one’s orthodox Christian identity. Moreover, it was history portrayed as God’s intended salvation drama: its scope was huge, but also specific and canonical. In the midst of the hymn, Ephrem paused to emphasise the enormity of this view: ‘Who will bring me to the end of enumerating the just men who/anticipated the Son, whose numbers cannot be encompassed by our weak mouth?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0953946813484407">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>As Ephrem sang repeatedly throughout his Nativity hymns, this sacred history continued; it culminated directly in the very service in which the congregation now stood at the Nativity vigil. Biblical past and liturgical present interwove, as the singer voiced his verses, each punctuated with the congregation’s sung refrain. In Nativity Hymn 1, Ephrem turns suddenly at verse 61 away from his biblical survey to focus on the vigil service itself. ‘Today’, he sings, on this day of awaiting the Nativity, the angels rejoice to see creation awakened from its slumbering state. For, ‘who will go to sleep on this night on which all creation is awake?/… Let us keep vigil’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0953946813484407">16</xref></sup> By this turn of focus, Ephrem locates his congregation exactly where they are: in the midst of their city at night, in the midst of a society that continues around them, among those who seem heedless of all that has come to pass in the biblical history just recounted, as well as oblivious to what will soon take place.</p>
<p>While the faithful keep fasting vigil, Ephrem sings, the rest of the world carry on in their habits: the greedy work at extorting interest, the thief at stealing, the glutton at excess; the merchant keeps vigil to plan profits, the rich to gain more wealth, the worrier to tend his anxieties. For these, Satan teaches a vigil that strengthens the vices: a vigil of unchastity, jealousy, anger. Instead, Ephrem exhorts, the faithful must keep their vigil of the Nativity with righteous discernment:
<disp-quote>
<p>as bright ones on this bright night;</p>
<p>for even if its color is black, still it is splendid in its power.</p>
<p>One who splendidly watches and prays in the darkness</p>
<p>is wrapped in hidden brilliance in the midst of this visible darkness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0953946813484407">17</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Yet Ephrem will not allow complacency. The vigil service could be observed with faithful devotion, or only in appearance as such. One could be wakeful due to other motivations. Lust, jealousy, and anger were vices that could fuel vigils empty of worth; prolonged prayers might convey nothing but wearisome complaints (HNat 1:76-80). The faithful believer, the discerning Christian, will enjoy the ‘sweet sleep’ of a clean conscience when the task is ended, because of having kept vigil ‘righteously’ (HNat 1:81). And how, indeed, would the righteous vigil be known?
<disp-quote>
<p>Serene is the night on which shines forth the Serene One who came to give us serenity.</p>
<p>Do not allow anything that might disturb it to enter upon our watch.</p>
<p>Let the path of the ear be cleared; let the sight of the eye be chastened;</p>
<p>Let the contemplation of the heart be sanctified; let the speech of the mouth be purified.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0953946813484407">18</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Serene in the power of peaceful heart, of clarified senses, of purified action, the believer will bring forth the fruits of this Nativity vigil: love, alms for the poor, reconciliation, forgiveness, kindness—actions that render concrete and collective the moment of divine incarnation. Just as Mary brought forth her son into the poverty of human hardship, the very life we live, so now will the believer bring forth those same saving actions amidst the hardships of the world, in the daily life beyond the church walls (HNat 1:84-85).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>On this day on which the Lord of all came among servants,</p>
<p>Let the lords also bow down to their servants lovingly.</p>
<p>On this day when the Rich One was made poor for our sake,</p>
<p>Let the rich man also make the poor man a sharer at his table.</p>
<p>On this day a gift came out to us without our asking for it;</p>
<p>Let us then give alms to those who cry out and beg from us.</p>
<p>This Lord of natures today was transformed contrary to His nature;</p>
<p>It is not too difficult for us also to overthrow our evil will.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0953946813484407">19</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By this conclusion, Ephrem exhorts his congregation that this is their work: to continue the biblical salvation drama in their own time and place. They must render the moment of Christ’s birth an entry into a particular human history in which they themselves participate, just as they have participated in the vigil service by keeping watch and singing their refrains during the hymns. Through the rich tapestry of sacred history offered in Nativity Hymn 1, the congregation has recalled the biblical past in song. But their vigil is enacted in a real world. In Ephrem’s Nativity Hymn 1, the culminating message of the Nativity event is a clarion call to ethical work within that world.</p>
<p>Ephrem thus presents God’s action of the incarnation as the paradigm by which the congregation must understand what Christ has done for humankind, and what humankind must do in response. In Nativity Hymn 3, Ephrem takes that same divine action of human birth and considers its ontological location within the human body. He begins with a series of images that present Christ’s birth as historical yet universal: a divine response to human need recognized in vividly physical terms.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Blessed be the Child Who today delights Bethlehem.</p>
<p>Blessed be the Newborn Who today made humanity young again.</p>
<p>Blessed be the Fruit Who bowed himself down for our hunger.</p>
<p>Blessed be the Gracious One Who suddenly enriched</p>
<p>all of our poverty and filled our need.</p>
<p>Blessed be He Whose mercy inclined Him to heal our sickness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0953946813484407">20</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ephrem here and elsewhere instructs that the incarnation rendered God perceptible to human senses: in Christ incarnate, God could be seen, heard, touched. ‘By His grace through [His] humanity/a nature never before fathomed is [now] perceived’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0953946813484407">21</xref></sup> Further, the incarnation not only transformed Christ’s divinity into humanity, but also transformed humanity itself. For humanity became a fitting place for God to be: ‘Blessed is He Who made our body a Tabernacle for His Hiddenness./Blessed is He Who with our tongue interpreted his secrets’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0953946813484407">22</xref></sup> Suddenly, it would seem, the human body was exalted: worthy of divine habitation, and also worthy to perceive the divine through its own sensory awareness. The implications to such an understanding are enormous. The human body had been the means by which humankind knew its separation from God. The body was mortal, weak, needy, and limited; it was everything God was not. Now, in the incarnation, God became all that we are. The body itself became the direct connection between humanity and God. This, sang Ephrem with images long dear to Syriac Christians, was nothing less than the healing of our humanity by our true Physician, whose Son is our Medicine of Life (HNat 3:16-22).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0953946813484407">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>As Ephrem presents it, the incarnation happened not only in Mary’s miraculously conceived child, but also universally throughout humankind. For human nature changed when Christ became incarnate. Despite the mundane, even revolting aspects of human bodiliness, humanity’s physicality was rendered radiantly glorious in the person of Christ.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Even Your sweat, for one who is worthy,</p>
<p>Is a baptism, and the dust of Your garments,</p>
<p>For one who is infirm, is a great fount</p>
<p>Of all aids, and even Your spittle,</p>
<p>If it reach the face, would enlighten the eyes.</p>
<p>If upon a stone You should rest Your head,</p>
<p>They would divide and tear it apart, and if You slept</p>
<p>Upon a dunghill, it would become a church</p>
<p>for prayers, and if again, You broke</p>
<p>ordinary bread, for us it would be the medicine of life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0953946813484407">24</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mortality in all its suffering was healed: first by divine incarnation, then by resurrection. So, too, Ephrem describes, was the social human body changed and healed. For the incarnation took place amid the utter deprivation of poverty: to a poor, unwed virgin, betrothed to a struggling carpenter, in an insignificant backwater town, in the bare dirt of a cave.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0953946813484407">25</xref></sup> Christ became a ‘son of poor people’, who empowered the weak and powerless when he ‘bent down [from his height] and shone forth from the poor’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0953946813484407">26</xref></sup> By this scandal, the humblest of human society were granted their dignity: the lowest of laborers, the roughest of workmen, the ugly, the maligned, the scorned. Unjust social order was healed by divine favor.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>… It is as if Your love</p>
<p>hungers for human beings.</p>
<p>You distinguished not Your parents</p>
<p>From strangers, nor the one who bore You</p>
<p>From maidservants, nor the one who nursed You</p>
<p>From harlots. Is this Your boldness</p>
<p>Or Your love, All-Merciful One?</p>
<p>What moves You to bestow Yourself</p>
<p>Upon each who has seen You—upon the rich</p>
<p>And upon the poor? …</p>
<p>From where did it come to You</p>
<p>So to hunger for human beings?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0953946813484407">27</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Christ’s entry among the poor is a theme consistently highlighted in the group of Nativity hymns that Ephrem himself may have gathered into a collection (Hymns 5 through 20). He called these ‘lullabies’, and for the most part had cast this group as lullabies sung by Mary to her newborn Son. Imagining her words, Ephrem presents Mary singing both within her biblical world and within the liturgical moment of the congregation, who sang their refrains to her verses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0953946813484407">28</xref></sup> For to whom were Mary’s words addressed, if not to those present at the vigil? Whom did she summon, with verses such as this:
<disp-quote>
<p>Whoever has a body, let him come to be</p>
<p>a brother to my Beloved [Christ]. Whoever has a daughter</p>
<p>or kinswoman, let her come to be</p>
<p>the bride of my Honorable One. And whoever has a slave,</p>
<p>let him release him to come to serve his Lord.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0953946813484407">29</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such words referenced the work of the faithful laity in their own community, along with those consecrated for special devotion, and the recognition that ecclesiastical service overturned the customs of social order, even by gender or class.</p>
<p>According to these hymns, whatever Christ encountered—his human body, an earthly place, the lives of the downtrodden—he transformed into something new. In turn, every body that encountered Christ was changed. As Ephrem sang the stories in song, these encounters were direct, physical, personal. No body could remain unaffected by this experience: they became healed and whole. They became renewed:
<disp-quote>
<p>Ears even heard Him, eyes saw Him,</p>
<p>Hands even touched Him, the mouth ate Him.</p>
<p>Limbs and senses gave thanks to</p>
<p>The One Who came and revived all that is corporeal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0953946813484407">30</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hence Ephrem calls for the church congregation as a whole to be a place, and indeed a body, of healing. In Nativity Hymn 1, as noted above, he presents the festal vigil as a practice that by its very performance promises to transform the civic community from its mundane condition of hardship and suffering into a place of virtue, justice, and peace.</p>
<p>Proper celebration of the liturgical feast of the Nativity, then, included ethical activity to transform the civic order. The faithful practice of each Christian—trained and prepared in the Nativity vigil—contributed to the body of the whole: a congregation (the body of Christ) enacting liturgy throughout its whole body, the streets of the city. The civic body would be healed of its injustice and oppression. But the church body, too, required healing. Hence there must be further fruits from the vigil of this feast. The ecclesial body, also, must know its transformative encounter with Christ, through the healing of heresy and discord.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The Magi, too, sought Him, and when they found Him in the crib,</p>
<p>Worship instead of investigation they offered Him in silence.</p>
<p>Instead of empty controversies, they gave Him offerings.</p>
<p>You, too, seek the first-born, and if you find Him on high,</p>
<p>Instead of confused searchings, open your treasures before Him and offer Him your deeds.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0953946813484407">31</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the hymns he composed for the Nativity vigil, Ephrem wove together corporate liturgical piety, individual devotional practice, biblical exegesis, and social ethics. The results, to his mind, would be a harmonious, right-thinking (‘orthodox’) Church: a new creation, and a fitting body to receive the Lord’s coming. All this would happen because the healed body, individual and collective, would become a healing body. The human person would imitate her Maker and be born anew.</p>

<title>Jacob in the Liturgy: Listening and Voicing</title>
<p>Jacob of Sarug (d. 521) was an itinerant priest and bishop who served during the late fifth and early sixth centuries in the Syriac speaking churches at the eastern edges of the Roman Empire.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0953946813484407">32</xref></sup> An accomplished poet-preacher, he combined those vocations with lyrical grace. His sermons (a genre called <italic>mimre</italic> in Syriac) were verse homilies composed in metered couplets, usually 12 + 12, which he intoned or chanted in delivery. Both poetic form and melodic performance were integral to Jacob’s craft as a homilist.</p>
<p>Jacob’s verses offered occasional exhortations about and reflections upon the bodily experience of being present in the liturgy. He was particularly concerned with the <italic>sound</italic> of liturgy: both what one heard sounding forth from others (from clergy, choirs, and congregation), and what one sounded forth oneself (in prayer, in recitation, in song). He showed high attunement to sound as a sensory experience of primary import for moral formation and condition. In his <italic>mimre</italic>, he distinguished different types of liturgical sounds, at times setting these in vivid contrast to the sounds of other social settings in the late antique civic context. He contrasted the commotion of civic life with the ‘sweet sounds’ of liturgy, each with consequence for one’s moral disposition. In these occasional reflections, Jacob instructed his congregations that liturgical sound required two kinds of work on their part: the work of listening and the work of voicing praise.</p>
<p>Ephrem’s tool of instruction was the melodic beauty of his hymns, rich with cascades of imagery, inscribing the words of truth into the body of his congregation as they joined in the refrains and then turned outward to the city’s needs. Jacob’s tool was the homily, a genre by nature more expository and direct than hymns, even when cast poetically. But homilies were not a free-standing encounter of speaker (even a poet) and audience. Instead, they were poetic exchanges embedded in the midst of liturgy.</p>
<p>A homily could be preached in different kinds of liturgical services: in a Eucharistic liturgy, during a vigil service, at a memorial service, a saint’s feast, or any gathering of the church body. But in any of these settings, it was nested within a ritual structure. Processions, prayers, incense offerings, scripture readings, litanies, hymns, prostrations: such ritual actions preceded the homily and also followed its delivery. Choreographed movement, sequenced exchanges, and patterned gestures constructed a ritual edifice that surrounded the homily, encasing it as a piece within a whole. Its authority drew from all these elements, even as they indelibly marked its content. Yet liturgy was a collaborative performance. Each participant had a crucial role to play. Bishop, clergy, deacons, choir, laity: all were necessary to the whole.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0953946813484407">33</xref></sup> In his homilies Jacob gave attention to this interactive (if not exactly dialogic) aspect of preaching.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0953946813484407">34</xref></sup> He was particularly concerned to engage the congregation in their task of receiving his word. Now and again, he attended further to how that task intersected them within the liturgical process as a whole.</p>
<p>In Jacob’s understanding, the experience of the verse homily provided a certain model for liturgical participation in broader terms. As preacher, he himself must offer up words worthy of the sacred teaching his task was to impart. In turn, the congregation must actively receive his preaching and then respond, bringing his words to fulfillment. Listening must not be a passive activity. In his homily on the Tower of Babel, Jacob exhorted the faithful:
<disp-quote>
<p>Therefore, prepare to listen sincerely, O discerning ones,</p>
<p>to this <italic>mimra</italic>, which is full of every profit for the one who gives heed to it.</p>
<p>Both the speaker and the listeners are co-workers;</p>
<p>the word of the one who speaks and of the one who gives heed is the same.</p>
<p>From the speaker and the listeners, one eulogy goes up</p>
<p>to the One who fashioned for us a mouth and ears in his wisdom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0953946813484407">35</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus listening required attention, discernment, and a conjoining of purpose to that of the homilist, so that both preaching and listening should become one and the same act of offering thanksgiving to God: ‘both the speaker and the listener are co-workers…[from whom] one eulogy goes up’. Indeed, in Jacob’s view, the congregation’s task of listening was a sacred one, not only worthy of divine assistance but even requiring it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0953946813484407">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Jacob often addressed his listeners directly, peppering his homilies with exhortations that they should be attentive: ‘Look, O discerning ones’ (<italic>poroushe</italic>), or ‘Note, discerning ones’, or ‘Understand, O discerning ones’. He calls on them to share both his wonder and his awe at the marvelous workings of divine dispensation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0953946813484407">37</xref></sup> He rouses them up when their attention flags.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0953946813484407">38</xref></sup> He scolds those who misbehave.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0953946813484407">39</xref></sup> He prays, ‘[O Lord], silence our improper, tumultuous talking,/so that Your word alone resounds in our assemblies’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0953946813484407">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Writing at the turn of the sixth century, in a now dominantly Christian civic culture, Jacob worried about complacency in the Christian populace.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0953946813484407">41</xref></sup> He recognized that poor or inattentive preaching could be a contributing factor: ‘The mouth [O Lord] should speak Your praise out of the fullness of the heart/It should not proclaim Your word to listeners out of habit’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0953946813484407">42</xref></sup> But the congregation’s (occasional? frequent?) restlessness vexed him. In his long homily on St. Ephrem the Syrian, he wrestled for their attention: ‘Rebellious children, do not grow weary with lengthy accounts;/… Be students of learning without growing bored; /with sincere hearing which does not find fault with straightforward accounts’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0953946813484407">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Jacob’s view, the congregation had a holy purpose, a sacred vocation, requiring their active participation throughout the liturgy, and not only during his sermon.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0953946813484407">44</xref></sup> In his homily ‘On the Partaking of the Holy Mysteries’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0953946813484407">45</xref></sup> he walked his listeners through the entire service, identifying and naming their role at each point. The first part of the service, the Liturgy of the Word, was comprised of multiple scripture readings, interspersed with Psalms and doctrinal hymns (<italic>madrashe</italic>), culminating in the verse homily. To each component, Jacob intoned, the believer must ‘be patient and listen’, ‘pay heed’, ‘turn your ear and receive’, ‘learn and believe’, ‘listen and pay heed’ (ll. 129-42/pp. 18-20). The reason one must pay such strict attention, he instructs, is that listening affects the soul’s disposition. ‘The human soul is open to influence;/the more she [the soul] reflects on something, the more she absorbs to become similar (to that thing)’ (ll. 155-56/p. 22).</p>
<p>This is precisely why the sounds or singing or performances of the city outside the liturgy pose such a danger, Jacob warns. The ‘lamenting voice of wailing women’, the ‘singing and playing of the actors [in the theater]’, ‘bad news’, or ‘good reports’: all that one hears penetrates the soul’s disposition, and cause it to respond in kind—with weeping, laughter, fear, or happy mood. One is pulled in every direction, fragmented (ll. 163-64/p. 22). Here, then, is the importance of listening in the liturgy: ‘Now when [the soul] hears the voice of the service of God’s house,/she is moved spiritually with the love of God’ (ll. 165-66/p. 22). Listening in liturgy united the self that the sounds of the world outside literally pulled to pieces.</p>
<p>In Jacob’s view, listening required open awareness to the various dimensions of liturgical sound. Not only should one listen to the words, but also to the ‘tunes’ and ‘melodies’: the music itself worked upon the soul, penetrating beyond cognitive recognition to the inner quality of disposition. He stresses here the accruing force of beauty as well as sequence and repetition: ‘[the Soul] takes delight in the holy hymns…the more she hears these hymns that are sung for her,/the more she becomes pure, modest, and full of hope and discernment’ (ll. 171-76/p. 22).</p>
<p>Among the most important liturgical sounds Jacob stressed was the singing of the women’s choirs, a practice distinctive to late antique Syriac churches, and a living tradition to this day.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0953946813484407">46</xref></sup> From the fourth century, these choirs were a prominent feature of Syriac daily offices and liturgies in civic churches. From the early fifth century they were canonically regulated in both Roman and Persian territory. That is, where Greek or Latin liturgies might have occasionally included choirs of nuns for special services (Easter, or important funerals), women’s choirs—consecrated but not monastic—were an integral part of every Syriac civic service. Moreover, their designated liturgical role, according to canonical mandate, was to sing the <italic>madrashe</italic>, the doctrinal hymns, of the church: theirs was a teaching ministry of doctrinal authority, teaching orthodox truth through sacred song.</p>
<p>In his homily on St. Ephrem the Syrian, Jacob discussed the women’s choirs at length, for in Syriac tradition it was Ephrem himself who had founded the choirs during the fourth century specifically to sing his <italic>madrashe</italic> and provide right teaching to the congregations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0953946813484407">47</xref></sup> According to Jacob of Sarug and others in Syriac literature, the challenge for the church in Ephrem’s time had been the danger of popular and seductive heretical hymns. Ephrem’s solution was to combat falsehood with truth, and he chose women’s voices to do so.</p>
<p>In his homily on Ephrem, Jacob of Sarug drew repeated attention to the sound of the women’s singing as an instrument of holy instruction. He names the choirs <italic>malphanyatha</italic> (v. 42)—(female) teachers of sacred doctrine—who sing the <italic>madrashe</italic> ‘with a joyful sound’ (v. 59/p. 39). Indeed, he intones, St. Ephrem himself had admonished the women’s choirs ‘to make their chants instructive melodies’ (v. 114/p. 53). Their ‘soft tones’ were a victorious weapon in the battle against heresy (v. 152/p. 65). ‘Behold’, Jacob marveled, ‘the gatherings of the glorious (church) resound with the melodies [of the women’s choirs]’ (v. 41/p. 35).</p>
<p>But Jacob emphasised further the sound of the women’s choirs as a mark of salvation. These choirs had been controversial in Ephrem’s own time and they were apparently still so in Jacob’s; for as everyone knew, scripture forbid women to speak in church (1 Cor. 14:34).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0953946813484407">48</xref></sup> Here, according to Jacob, was precisely Ephrem’s prophetic brilliance in choosing women to be the voice of truth: the women’s choirs signified ‘an entirely new world;/for yonder in the kingdom [of Heaven], men and women are equal’ (v. 43/p. 35). And what better way to demonstrate the efficacy of the sacraments? Jacob continued: in one and the same font were men and women baptized; from one and the same bread, from one and the same cup did they receive communion. ‘A single salvation’ belonged to men and women alike (v. 107/p. 51). Should they not, then, sing God’s praise as equals? It was Eve who had silenced women’s voice; now Mary had brought them to voice once again. With this logic, Jacob (in Ephrem’s voice) urged the women:
<disp-quote>
<p>Until now, your gender was brought low because of Eve;</p>
<p>but from now on, it is restored by Mary to sing Alleluia!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Uncover your faces to sing praise without shame</p>
<p>to [Christ] the One who granted you freedom of speech by his birth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0953946813484407">49</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hence Jacob instructed his congregations: women’s choirs were the constant reminder that divine dispensation was come to fulfillment, that salvation was indeed upon them. Time and again in his homilies, Jacob cites the sounds of the women’s choirs. In the homily ‘On the Partaking of the Mysteries’, he urges his congregation to ‘Pay heed to the hymns (sung) by the virgins with glorious voices,/that the wisdom of the Most High has given to the congregations’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0953946813484407">50</xref></sup> These (truthful) hymns and these glorious voices were God’s own gift to the faithful community.</p>
<p>Still, the work of the laity did not stop with listening, however intentional and discerning their listening might be. In Jacob’s poetic explication ‘On the Partaking of the Mysteries’, the fruits of the first part of the liturgy—the Liturgy of the Word with its chanted scripture readings, Psalms, hymns, and intoned verse homily—were borne out in the second part, the Eucharistic liturgy proper. He portrayed it accordingly. On Jacob’s telling, the congregation’s role was immediately heightened as the process of the mysteries—the Eucharistic sequence—began. As Jacob instructed: together the congregation sounded forth their prayers, their confessions, their praise. Together with the priest they petitioned the Lord to send his Son and cause the Holy Spirit to enter the bread and wine. Together they prayed the Lord’s Prayer; together they sang the Sanctus. Together they prayed for forgiveness; together they received communion. Again, he emphasises the progressive force of the ritual pressing upon its participants, as the sequence of actions moved towards culmination amidst the layered sounds of words and music.</p>
<p>The accumulating might of the ritual affected not only the believer, Jacob insisted, but also Satan himself. For it was Satan who nudged the congregation to restlessness, who prompted the complacent to leave early or to come late.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0953946813484407">51</xref></sup> ‘Satan is annoyed by these holy hymns’, Jacob assured his flock (l. 244/p. 30)—the ‘truthful songs’ sung daily by the ‘chaste congregation’ (l. 214/p. 28).</p>
<p>Repeatedly Jacob stresses that one must be present at the liturgy, be attentive, and, above all, be heard to call out in song, in prayer, and in supplication. He exhorts time and again: stand, listen, hear, attend, receive, sing, cry out. The sound of truth must be strong and clear. Jacob exhorted the congregation not only to listen quietly, but further to sing and supplicate boldly and loudly. He prayed to do the same himself, ‘[O Lord], May my mouth sing to you sincere praise with a loud voice’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0953946813484407">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Jacob’s verses, both the civic and liturgical domains were locations of orchestrated collective interaction: locations of collective performance. Both involved sustained dialogic exchange, often of crafted vocal genres.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0953946813484407">53</xref></sup> In his stress on volume, Jacob points to the diverse competitions intrinsic to late antique civic life. Faithful believers competed with heretics, religions with one another; monasteries competed with cities, households with shrines. Truth competed with falsehood. As Jacob had observed about Ephrem, music was a primary tool in these battles. One must do more than sing truth; one must out-sing falsehood.</p>
<p>For example, Jacob like other bishops of his time fulminated against the theater.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0953946813484407">54</xref></sup> But his real worry about it seems to have been the attraction of its music. He fretted to his congregation about ‘responses (or chorus, chants) which are not true; troublesome and confused sounds; melodies which attract children; ordered and cherished songs; skilful chants, lying canticles… Your ear is captivated by song’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0953946813484407">55</xref></sup> The music of the theater told its stories in melodies and verses that lingered in the mind, hummed by children and adults alike. The dangers of the wrong music were real.</p>
<p>To the destructive power of theatrical music and songs, Jacob contrasted the enlightening power of liturgical music. But he emphasised more than musical content, and more than catchy melodies.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The sound of Your praise [O Lord] thunders awesomely among the congregations,</p>
<p>and through it the impudent song of idolatry was silenced.</p>
<p>From Your hymns, Your sermons, and Your teachings</p>
<p>the entire inhabited world shouted out and thundered to sing praise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0953946813484407">56</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Jacob, the (loud) singing of sacred song—the singing of praise and thanksgiving—was the perfect realization of worship. In his homily on praise for morning and evening, he instructed that Nature itself works with ordered splendor like unto a liturgy. Nature hence instructs the faithful about God’s glory and incites the singing of praise by its wonders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0953946813484407">57</xref></sup> Yet, Jacob admonished elsewhere, the natural world offers its praise merely by virtue of its functioning. Of all creation, he insisted, humankind alone can sing praise of God by its own free will.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0953946813484407">58</xref></sup> Thus he summons the congregation’s voice: ‘Be awakened O Church, with your beautiful chants/and offer to the Son gifts of praise’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0953946813484407">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>Singing the glory of God was, after all, the ceaseless and eternal occupation of the heavenly hosts in their splendid array (Isaiah 6). It was hence the action that brought the created order into iconic harmony with the divine realm: conjoining the earthly and the heavenly, the ‘celestials and terrestrials’. In his festal homilies, Jacob exulted in celebrating the entire choir of existence, its song presenting an auditory icon of salvific glory, ordered and harmonious. In his homily on Palm Sunday (the Sunday of Hosannas), for example, praise is sung to God together by: human tongues and the natural world in its muteness, the whole of nature, the heavens and the earth; church congregations, with their young people, their elderly, their bishops, priests, and laity; church assemblies everywhere; fiery seraphim, glorious cherubim, and all the thousands of heavenly beings. ‘All are giving thanks to you/…you are blessed by all, to you praise from all tongues.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0953946813484407">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>For Jacob (who has many such descriptions of liturgical celebration), there was no more perfect offering of worship than that of the church in song. As he emphasised again and again, in that conjoined song every voice mattered, for every voice had a part. Liturgy in its ordered ranks and sequences, its designated tasks and functions, consisted of nothing more—and nothing less—than the collective voice of the faithful proclaiming God’s truth. Here, for Jacob, was perfect liturgy:
<disp-quote>
<p>And voices upon voices crowd around [Christ] from every side,</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The voices of the nations who clap their hands to give praise,</p>
<p>and the voice of handmaids grouped in choirs to make a joyful noise.</p>
<p>The voice of churches who sing praise with their harps,</p>
<p>and the voice of monasteries who make a joyful noise to him with their alleluias.</p>
<p>The voice of priests who consecrate him with the gentle waving of their hands,</p>
<p>and the voice of saints who bless him in every place.</p>
<p>The voice of men who sing praise with their tongues,</p>
<p>The voice of women who exalt him with their <italic>madrashe</italic>.</p>
<p>The voice of children who repeat before him […]</p>
<p>The voice of teachers who set their knowledge in array before him.</p>
<p>For praise of the Father, the Son wakens all creation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0953946813484407">61</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Jacob, liturgy, properly served, worked through its sounds: the active hearing and voicing of scripture, prayers, instruction, and praise; in songs heard and songs sung. Amid such ordered and disciplined voices, humanity could be healed. Herein lay the ethical ramifications of his understanding of liturgy. For if the holy sounds of liturgy served to mold the moral disposition of the faithful believer, as Jacob exhorted, then the church in its collectively sounding glory stood as the model for the world in its rightful, ethically ordered, salvifically healed condition. Jacob’s stress on the significance of women’s singing in the liturgy presented the paradigm for such an understanding. Hence he exhorted,
<disp-quote>
<p>The church in the world is like a teacher to a human being,</p>
<p>teaching, educating, and treating the wounds of all who come to her.</p>
<p>From her teaching, the soul becomes illuminated through repentance,</p>
<p>so that she may overcome the darkness of death when it meets her.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0953946813484407">62</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Ephrem the Syrian, participation in the liturgical office of the Nativity vigil immersed the congregation into a sacred history continuing from the arc of creation to their own present moment. Acclaiming biblical truth, persisting in watchful prayer through the long night, the congregation emerged into the feast day prepared to bring the human body to a healed and holy condition. The Nativity vigil provided the paradigm for ethical enactment of the feast’s theological content. The incarnation of God’s own Son into human time and place was inscribed in the body of the faithful Christian who brought it to fulfillment in the life of the city, beyond the church’s doors.</p>
<p>For Jacob of Sarug, an analogous paradigm was at work. Participation in and experience of the liturgy each week brought the congregation into its healed and holy state: a community (ethically) ordered in its seried ranks, disciplined and serene, offering glorious witness to God in harmony with the whole of creation. Receptive listening, fervent voicing, faithful stillness and collective thanksgiving molded a Christian moral disposition, individual and collective. The believing community sounded forth a performance that proclaimed God’s salvific work enacted within their own midst, in them, through them, and by them. Such witness wrought the world itself into a new creation.</p>

<p>This theme is stressed throughout Ephrem’s <italic>Hymns on the Nativity</italic>, but see especially hymns 13, 18 and 19. The detail that the birth took place in a cave shows that Ephrem drew on the popular early Christian narrative, <italic>The Protevangelion of James</italic>. Orthodox Christians to this day continue the tradition of the cave as the place of the nativity, using it in iconography as well as hymns.</p>
