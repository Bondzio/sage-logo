<sec id="sec17-1754045313484139"><title>Objective</title>
<p>To understand the physical and emotional impact of postmenopausal vaginal discomfort on relationships between women and their male partners.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-1754045313484139"><title>Study design</title>
<p>In a quantitative, Internet-based survey, 8200 individuals from the UK, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, France, Italy, US and Canada (postmenopausal, married/cohabiting women, aged 55–65 years, who had experienced vaginal discomfort, and male partners of such women) completed a structured questionnaire.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-1754045313484139"><title>Main outcome measures</title>
<p>Results for respondents from the UK (500 men, 500 women), expressed as percentages of women/men describing particular answers, are reported.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-1754045313484139" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Avoiding physical intimacy because of vaginal discomfort was reported by 69% of women and 76% of male partners, mainly due to concern about sex being painful (women 63%; men 61%); 18% of women considered vaginal discomfort had created emotional distance between them and their partners. Local estrogen treatment was used by 21% of women, among whom 58% subsequently reported less painful sex. Following such treatment, 33% of women and 30% of male partners reported an improved sex life, while 33% of women and 34% of male partners described becoming emotionally closer. Although 73% of women did not consider enough information about vaginal discomfort to be available, 60% would consult a physician to obtain this.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-1754045313484139" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Although vaginal discomfort has a substantial impact on postmenopausal women and their partners, improvements in sexual and emotional relationships can follow use of local estrogen therapy. Not all women may be aware of therapeutic options; healthcare providers can improve outcomes by more openly communicating and initiating discussion with patients.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1754045313484139" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Decreased estrogen levels in postmenopausal women prompt the development of urogenital changes and can result in vaginal atrophy (VA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754045313484139">1</xref></sup> reported symptoms of which include vaginal dryness, soreness, itching and burning, as well as pain when touching the vagina or during intercourse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754045313484139">2</xref></sup> Such pain may preclude women from desiring, initiating, or responding to sexual activity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754045313484139">3</xref></sup> and vulvovaginal atrophy has been found to be significantly associated with female sexual dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754045313484139">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>VA is reported in up to 50% of postmenopausal women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754045313484139">4</xref></sup> but may be under-recognized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754045313484139">5</xref></sup> It is unlikely to resolve without treatment, but effective therapy is available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754045313484139">6</xref></sup> This should be started early, before irrevocable changes have occurred, and continued, to maintain therapeutic benefit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754045313484139">4</xref></sup> However, only around 25% of women seek medical advice relating to the condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1754045313484139">7</xref></sup> and, in addition to being under-recognized, VA is thus likely to be under-treated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754045313484139">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The recently reported Vaginal Health: Insights, Views &amp; Attitudes (VIVA) study, evaluating data from a survey involving 3520 respondents, showed postmenopausal women to have a poor understanding of VA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754045313484139">2</xref></sup> Many were unaware of its chronic nature and delayed consulting healthcare professionals (HCPs) about their symptoms. Therefore, proactive discussions between women and HCPs are required to increase women’s knowledge and awareness of treatment options.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754045313484139">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Increased understanding of the impact of VA may encourage HCPs to discuss the condition with patients in a more routine manner. Accordingly, the CLarifying vaginal atrophy’s impact On SEx and Relationships (CLOSER) survey has been performed as a follow-up to the VIVA study. Obtaining information from postmenopausal women and male partners, the CLOSER survey aims to understand the physical and emotional impact of vaginal discomfort on relationships. The study was conducted in nine countries in Europe and North America; this article considers the results for respondents from the UK.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1754045313484139" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>The CLOSER survey was carried out between 13 December 2011 and 7 February 2012, by the independent market research organization StrategyOne (London, UK). Pre-recruited panels of individuals who had elected to participate in such surveys were used to obtain representative samples of women and men. There was no financial incentive.</p>
<p>To be eligible for involvement, women were required to be aged 55–65 years (inclusive), be married/cohabiting, to have ceased menstruating for ≥12 months and to have experienced vaginal discomfort (defined as dryness, itching, burning or soreness in the vagina, bleeding during intercourse, pain during urination or pain in the vagina in connection with touching and/or intercourse). Participating men were partners of women meeting the above criteria (not necessarily partners of the women involved in the survey, although women did ask their partners to participate). Individuals were recruited from the UK, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, France, Italy, the US and Canada.</p>
<p>This was a quantitative, Internet-based survey, based on self-reported data, whereby respondents completed a structured questionnaire. Questions covered several areas (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1754045313484139">Table 1</xref>): discussing vaginal discomfort; the impact of the menopause and vaginal discomfort and treatment of vaginal discomfort (including sources of information and advice).

<p>Data from 8200 respondents (weighted sample: 4100 women and 4100 men [500 of each in the UK, France, Italy, the US and Canada; 400 of each in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland]) were summarized descriptively.

<p>Results from the 500 women and 500 men comprising the UK respondents are described in this paper. The samples were weighted (cell weighting applied) to achieve equal representation. The overall margin of error was 1.52% in 95 out of 100 cases (total male and female samples). The sample size was selected to provide suitably representative data and to permit statistical analysis. Key differences between the UK results and those from other countries are highlighted if the UK data were significantly different at the 95% confidence interval from data obtained in five or more other countries.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1754045313484139"><title>Discussing vaginal discomfort</title>
<p>Of the women surveyed in the UK, 70% told their partners when they first developed vaginal discomfort; among the 30% not discussing this, the main reasons were believing the condition to be a natural part of growing older (52%) and embarrassment (28%).</p>
<p>Around two-thirds of men wanted their partner to talk about her experiences of vaginal discomfort (67%) and felt comfortable with such discussions (65%). However, almost one-third of the women surveyed (31%), and over one-quarter of the men (28%), avoided raising the subject, believing such conversations to ruin moments of intimacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1754045313484139"><title>Impact of the menopause and vaginal discomfort</title>
<p>Over one-third of women (35%) reported the personal impact of menopause symptoms to be worse than expected, while 43% and 27%, respectively, described worse-than-expected impacts on physical and emotional relationships with their partners. From the male perspective, 38% and 24% believed the impact of their partner’s menopause to have been worse than expected on physical and emotional relationships, respectively.</p>
<p>Vaginal dryness was the most commonly experienced symptom during and after menopause (reported by 84% of women). Hot flushes and night sweats were reported by 80% and 72%, respectively. Women had a range of concerns relating to vaginal discomfort, regarding both their general self-esteem and aspects of their sex lives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1754045313484139">Figure 1</xref>), with 30% feeling depressed thinking about the latter.
<fig id="fig1-1754045313484139" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Women’s feelings about vaginal discomfort. Note: Respondents could select more than one response if applicable.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1754045313484139-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>These attitudes were reflected in physical relationships. Over two-thirds of women (69%) and more than three-quarters of men (76%) considered that vaginal discomfort resulted in avoidance of physical intimacy. Among women who avoided being intimate, the main reasons were concerns that sex would be painful (63%), sex being painful (55%) and loss of libido (51%). These were also the main reasons men considered their partners avoided intimacy (cited by 61%, 57% and 48%, respectively). Almost one-third of women (30%) and men (29%) believed vaginal discomfort to have ‘caused a big problem’ for their sex lives. Sexual satisfaction can be compromised and many respondents reported ceasing, curtailing or being less inclined towards sexual activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1754045313484139">Figure 2</xref>). Decreased personal sexual satisfaction and less inclination for sexual activity because of vaginal discomfort were reported by significantly higher proportions of women than men (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Other data showed that 22% of both women and men considered vaginal discomfort to have aggravated male sexual health issues.
<fig id="fig2-1754045313484139" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Impact of vaginal discomfort. Note: Respondents could select more than one response if applicable.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1754045313484139-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Almost one-fifth of women (18%) considered that vaginal discomfort had created emotional distance between them and their partners (a sentiment with which 12% of men agreed). Seventeen per cent of women believed their partners did not understand the changes they were experiencing, causing the women to feel isolated from their partners. Fourteen per cent of men reported failing to understand what was happening to their partners’ bodies, thereby feeling isolated themselves.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1754045313484139"><title>Treatment of vaginal discomfort</title>
<p>Respondents selected treatment they may have used for vaginal discomfort from a list: lubricating gels and creams; vaginal hormone creams; vaginal hormone suppositories; systemic hormone therapy (oral tablets and patches); vaginal hormone tablets; mineral/vitamin supplements; vaginal hormone ring; others. Lubricating gels and creams were most commonly used (68%). Similar proportions of women (21%) reported using systemic hormone therapy and local estrogen treatments. As the survey evaluated self-reported data and the questions were not open-ended, information relating to dosage was not retrieved.</p>
<p>Following local estrogen therapy, 40% of women agreed with the statement ‘I feel happy that my body is working again’. Sexual benefits are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1754045313484139">Figure 3</xref>: less painful sex was described most often; other respondents reported more satisfying or more frequent sex or an improved sex life. Emotional benefits could also accrue: one-third of women (33%) who used local estrogen therapy became closer to their partners and felt less isolated. Becoming emotionally closer after their partners received such treatment was described by 34% of men.
<fig id="fig3-1754045313484139" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Sexual benefits reported following local estrogen therapy for the treatment of vaginal discomfort.

</fig></p>
<p>Almost three-quarters of women (73%) considered that not enough information was available about vaginal discomfort. To obtain more knowledge, 60% of women were likely to consult their physician; 52% would use women’s health websites.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1754045313484139"><title>Significant differences between the UK and other countries</title>
<p>Compared with women from other countries, vaginal discomfort appeared to particularly impact the self-esteem of women in the UK. Many were affected by age-related issues (57% feeling old vs. 41% overall; 55% feeling that they had lost their youth vs. 41% overall). They were also most likely to have lost confidence in themselves as sexual partners (41% vs. 27% overall), no longer feel sexually attractive (37% vs. 27% overall) or feel depressed about their sex lives (30% vs. 22% overall).</p>
<p>Higher proportions of both women (43% vs. 30% overall) and men (38% vs. 30% overall) in the UK reported physical relationships having been impacted more than expected by the menopause. As a consequence of vaginal discomfort, women from the UK were most likely to have sex less frequently (67% vs. 58% overall), find sex less satisfying (61% vs. 49% overall) or be less inclined to have sex with their partners (53% vs. 35% overall). In addition, local estrogen treatments were less likely to be used by women in the UK (21% vs. 41% overall).</p>

<p>Our study provides insight into the extent to which vaginal discomfort can have negative physical and emotional impacts on postmenopausal women and their partners. Issues relating to women’s general self-esteem were apparent, as were more specific worries concerning the sex lives of the women affected by the condition. The majority of respondents considered that VA resulted in avoidance of physical intimacy and reported a range of sexual issues; however, emotional distance between partners was reported by 18% of women and 15% of men. These effects were reported by the women participating in the survey and by male partners.</p>
<p>Although there was agreement between female and male respondents as to the beneficial effects of local estrogen therapy, women considered that too little information was readily available regarding treatment options. However, the majority of women would have considered consulting their physician to find out more. Urogenital and sexual pain disorders are frequently overlooked in clinical practice,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1754045313484139">8</xref></sup> and our data should thus encourage HCPs to routinely initiate conversations relating to VA with postmenopausal women, thereby facilitating appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Given the impact of the menopause and vaginal discomfort on survey respondents from the UK, where women were less likely to use local estrogen therapy than their counterparts in other surveyed countries, such conversations could prove particularly beneficial. Indeed, providing important information to perimenopausal women in the UK might improve awareness of conditions that occur after menopause and the availability of treatment. A previous online survey in the UK, conducted via a dedicated menopause website, highlighted that many women with vaginal symptoms had not spoken about these to HCPs and were therefore untreated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1754045313484139">9</xref></sup> Open questions in this survey provided a number of reasons for this: not knowing that vaginal dryness could be treated, that effective therapy was available or that symptoms could be treated by means other than lubricants; concerns about the safety and side effects of treatment, including the risk of heart disease associated with hormone therapy; embarrassment, not wanting to trouble HCPs or not considering that any action would be taken; believing that symptoms would correct themselves, were a routine consequence of ageing or resulted from candidiasis; not realizing that symptoms were caused by dryness; unawareness of menopause.</p>
<p>Both the strengths and weaknesses of the CLOSER survey should be considered. To our knowledge, this is the first research study to explore not only women’s attitudes and feelings while coping with VA but also how this condition impacts on male partners and on relationships. Involving male partners added an additional perspective to the data obtained from the women, generally corroborating the information they provided. Another of the strengths of the study was the large sample size (of both women and men). Individuals were able to complete a questionnaire, which included potentially embarrassing questions, without direct interviewer contact and anonymously. The same questions were asked across different nations in Europe and North America, which will enable international comparisons. Nevertheless, we are aware of limitations to this cross-cultural study. This was an online survey and the data thus obtained were subject to the constraints of such studies, in that respondents were necessarily restricted to individuals with Internet access (although, within these constraints attempts were made to recruit representative samples of women and men). While the survey was carried out to evaluate the impact of VA on intimacy, symptoms of vaginal discomfort were self-reported, and for women who had undergone treatment, no information on dosage or therapy duration was retrieved.</p>
<p>Country-specific differences in women’s attitudes to VA and their awareness of available treatment options have been reported elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754045313484139">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1754045313484139">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1754045313484139"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1754045313484139"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1754045313484139"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1754045313484139">14</xref></sup> It has previously been considered that country-specific approaches may be required to improve the uptake of treatment for VA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1754045313484139">10</xref></sup> However, regardless of the country in which they live, providing women with the opportunity to discuss sexual problems is a fundamental element of healthcare.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1754045313484139">15</xref></sup> It has been recognized for many years that implementing appropriate steps during midlife years will help to develop a solid foundation to enable sexual activity and satisfaction to continue through the menopause, extending into postmenopausal and elderly life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1754045313484139">16</xref></sup> Early recognition of postmenopausal women distressed by sexual dysfunction is an important aspect of effective therapeutic management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1754045313484139">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cultural influences also impact on female sexual function,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1754045313484139">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1754045313484139">18</xref></sup> and results from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) in the US have demonstrated the complexity of factors influencing sexual satisfaction and activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1754045313484139">19</xref></sup> WHI data showed that the majority of women who were sexually dissatisfied would have preferred more sexual activity, and the presence of VA correlated with sexual inactivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1754045313484139">19</xref></sup> This is in line with a previous study in which less VA, as evaluated by gynaecologists using an index assessing six genital dimensions, was apparent in sexually active women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1754045313484139">20</xref></sup> Other data, from the National Health and Social Life Survey in the US (sampling 1749 individuals aged 18–59 years), showed sexual dysfunction to be more prevalent among women (43%) than among men (31%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1754045313484139">17</xref></sup> In our survey, higher proportions of women than men reported less inclination for sexual activity and decreased personal sexual satisfaction because of vaginal discomfort. This is perhaps unsurprising given that women are directly affected by VA. However, vaginal discomfort is an issue of which men can be very aware: more than three-quarters of men believed the condition resulted in avoidance of physical intimacy.</p>
<p>While the development of VA is prompted by reduced levels of estrogen,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754045313484139">1</xref></sup> estrogen deficiency also affects other aspects of sexual function; vaginal blood flow can be reduced and a woman’s capacity for arousal and orgasm may decrease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1754045313484139">21</xref></sup> Estrogen treatment is a logical therapeutic option in this situation, and evidence suggests that local estrogen therapy can improve both quality of life and sexual function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1754045313484139">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1754045313484139">22</xref></sup> Hormone therapy reduces autonomic and sensory vaginal innervation density, and this may contribute to relieving vaginal discomfort.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1754045313484139">23</xref></sup> Topical therapy produces more dramatic reductions in innervation than systemic therapy, and this may help to explain greater improvements reported with topical compared to systemic therapy<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1754045313484139">23</xref></sup> Thus, although systemic estrogen therapy can treat VA, in the absence of any requirement to manage other menopausal symptoms, local treatment is preferable – it may be more effective for vaginal problems and avoids most systemic adverse events,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754045313484139">4</xref></sup> with minimal if any risk.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study highlighted the impact that vaginal discomfort may have on postmenopausal women and their partners and demonstrated improvements in sexual and emotional relationships following local estrogen therapy. However, not all women may be aware of available therapeutic options and, in the light of this, HCPs may improve a range of outcomes relating to VA by engaging in more open communication about this condition with their patients.</p>
