<body>
<p>Family-Centered Practice (FCP) is a general framework that prioritizes family strengths, perspectives, and input to guide successful change and treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731512453344">Allen &amp; Petr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512453344">Craft-Rosenberg, Kelley, &amp; Schnoll, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049731512453344">Madsen (2006)</xref> notes that the FCP framework can be especially informative in direct practice with families who may not benefit from traditional approaches. Although specific definitions of FCP vary in the literature, common core principles across studies typically include and emphasize the following: strengths-based, culturally informed, family-driven, empowerment-focused, collaborative partnerships and interdisciplinary teamwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731512453344">Allen &amp; Petr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512453344">Craft-Rosenberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731512453344">Lietz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049731512453344">Madsen, 2006</xref>). In addition, FCP principles have been used to guide practice with families in a number of different types of service delivery including childhood disability services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049731512453344">Trute &amp; Hiebert-Murphy, 2007</xref>), direct clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049731512453344">Madsen, 2006</xref>), and child welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731512453344">Lietz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731512453344">Lietz &amp; Rounds, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731512453344">Sandau-Beckler, Salcido, Beckler, Mannes, &amp; Beck, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The main objective of this study is to explore factors that impact FCP, through the influence they may have on individual attitudes and beliefs of child welfare workers. Specifically, perceptions of FCP were explored among child welfare workers who are expected to use FCP principles in their direct practice with children and families. FCP is expected to result in improved outcomes in the area of safety, stability, and well-being for the children and families. Based on the dearth of research studies examining perceptions of the impact of FCP principles among child welfare workers, this study specifically aimed to examine child welfare workers’ perceptions of the <italic>impact</italic> of FCP on (1) their professional work environment (including the impact of FCP on child welfare workers’ time, resources, opportunities, peer and manager support, as well as feedback and coaching received from supervisors) and (2) their ability to engage children, families, and youth in the decision-making and therapeutic processes. Focus groups were conducted among child welfare workers across seven different regions within one state to assess and document caseworker’s experiences with FCP implementation and to understand staff and program challenges and needed resources.</p>

<title>FCP Framework</title>
<p>In the child welfare system, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731512453344">Landsman (2001)</xref> indicated that FCP began as an in-home treatment model of the 1970s. The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 and the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 helped inform this model by stressing the importance of strengthening families in order to prevent child removal from their biological homes and also reduce the duration of removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731512453344">Allen &amp; Petr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731512453344">Nelson, Landsman, &amp; Deutelbaum, 1990</xref>). Since this time, one of the models that has developed out of the FCP framework is family group decision making (FGDM). This model, based on New Zealand’s family group conference process, incorporates the family’s ability to develop a plan for the child, which typically involves keeping the child within the family system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731512453344">Allen &amp; Petr, 1998</xref>). This model not only encompasses principles of FCP but brings together parents and other extended family members into the decision-making process related to child placement and safety (Grimm &amp; Cardenas, 2000). Further, FCP within the child welfare system is a culturally responsive process that incorporates perspectives from immediate and extended family members, community service providers, and others who know and care about the safety and needs of the child and family (Grimm &amp; Cardenas, 2000).</p>

<sec id="section2-1049731512453344">
<title>Theory of FCP</title>
<p>The theory behind FCP is not well articulated within the research literature. When a theory is referenced for FCP, the ecological theory is the most common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049731512453344">Pecora, Whittaker, Maluccio, &amp; Barth, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731512453344">Sabatino, 2001</xref>). Sabatino cites the importance of “parents and community on child development” (2001, p. 242). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049731512453344">Pecora, Whittaker, Maluccio, and Barth (2000)</xref> developed a comprehensive framework for FCP which includes both theories and practice approaches within child welfare work. The framework includes the following four perspectives: (1) ecological, (2) competence, (3) permanency planning, and (4) developmental. All of these perspectives impact FCP for child welfare work. The ecological perspective suggests that child welfare workers need to take into account environmental, family, and individual factors in order to meet the needs of clients. The competence perspective, commonly called the strength-based approach, focuses on clients’ capacities and strengths to guide worker–client interactions. Permanency planning is viewed as more of an orientation than a theory; it focuses on addressing child permanency by securing a stable residence. This ensures children are not adrift in the foster care system. Finally, the developmental perspective, as the name implies, takes into account the developmental stage as well as the life cycle of an individual client.</p>

<title>Review of Studies Examining Impact of FCP</title>
<p>Although not a focus of this study, it is worth reviewing current evidence in the literature related to effectiveness of FCP on child and family outcomes. In February 2012 and May 2012, a thorough literature review was conducted. The following databases were searched: PsychInfo, Pubmed, and Social Work Abstracts. Further, the following Boolean search terms were used: (FCP or FGDM) AND (child welfare OR outcomes). A total of 59 articles were retrieved and reviewed by title and abstract. Of the 59 articles, only 5 were related specifically to FCP and child welfare and were subsequently reviewed. In addition, the United States Department of Health and Human Services: Administration for Children and Families website was searched for technical reports related to child welfare and FCP, which yielded one article. In addition to the five articles, a number of articles were reviewed, which explored the impact of aspects of the principles or framework of FCP.</p>
<p>The literature that explored the aspects of FCP revealed that FGDM or team decision making (both models based on FCP) was associated with a healthier functioning family unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049731512453344">Pennell &amp; Burford, 2000</xref>), an increase in the likelihood of kinship placement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049731512453344">Pennell, Edwards, &amp; Burford, 2010</xref>), and reduction in the likelihood of entering care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731512453344">Crea, Crampton, Abramson-Madden, &amp; Usher, 2008</xref>). In addition, research has demonstrated that kinship care is associated with an increase in contact with parents and siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731512453344">Christenson &amp; McMurty, 2007</xref>) and a reduction in access to services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049731512453344">Cuddeback, 2004</xref>). As noted, FCP is a guiding framework that entails core constructs that as a whole are thought to be effective. Thus, it is important to review the literature which examines the impact of FCP on children and families as a framework to guide the implementation of specific principles and practices on children and families.</p>
<p>Since the development of this model within the child welfare system, there have been a number of states that have adapted FCP to guide practice. In addition, a number of studies have examined the impact of child welfare services on child maltreatment outcomes and overall family functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731512453344">Chaffin, Bonner, &amp; Hill, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731512453344">Drisko, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731512453344">Hess, McGowan, &amp; Botsko, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731512453344">Kauffman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049731512453344">Lietz, 2009</xref>). However, there have been few studies that have examined the impact of FCP on child outcomes and family functioning in the child welfare system (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731512453344">Hess et al., 2000</xref>; Unrau, Wells, &amp; Hartnett, 2004). Unrau, Wells, and Hartnett (2004) found that FCP afforded greater ability for the child welfare workers to meet the individual needs of the families, facilitated a better team-oriented communication, and allowed for greater involvement from the foster family compared to the group who received usual care. In addition, results revealed greater stability in placement with the FCP group over 15 months (Unrau et al., 2004). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731512453344">Landsman and Boel-Studt (2011)</xref> conducted the only known study that utilized an experimental design to examine the effectiveness of FCP. They found that FCP resulted in greater family involvement and an increased likelihood of reunification or kinship placement compared to the treatment as usual group. Research that explores the impact of FCP on children, families, and child welfare workers is crucial for the child welfare literature, as it can directly and indirectly increase knowledge related to the outcomes of children and families involved with the child welfare system.</p>

<title>Role of Organizations and Workers in Implementation of FCP</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049731512453344">Saundau-Beckler and colleagues (2002)</xref> discuss the need for change in the child welfare system and ways to implement FCP principles through incremental stages including a call for agency and large system changes throughout all stages (i.e., prereferral, engagement, assessment, planning, development, and implementation) and levels (i.e. child welfare worker, supervisory, agency, and larger systems changes) of practice.</p>
<p>This call for action is critical in stating the need for FCP principles to guide practice throughout the child welfare system. In order to ensure effective implementation, however, the next step must involve evaluation of the impact of the model throughout the different levels of practice. Although not specific to child welfare, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512453344">Craft-Rosenberg, Kelley, and Schnoll (2006)</xref> conducted a study that examined the perceptions of FCP among practitioners who work with children. Results from a questionnaire administered to a small number of conference attendees (<italic>n</italic> = 76) indicated that 80% of workers felt they adhered to FCP principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512453344">Craft-Rosenberg et al., 2006</xref>). However, somewhat paradoxically, focus group results revealed that some of the core components of a FCP framework were areas of weakness or remained barriers in practice. Interdisciplinary teamwork and cultural competence were noted as “educational needs” among conference attendees. Respondents revealed that difficult families, diversity among families (which workers were not prepared to work with effectively due to lack of cultural knowledge), professional environmental “turf” concerns, dissatisfaction within the environmental hierarchy, lack of coordination of services, and other professionals who were unaware of the guiding principles of FCP served as obstacles to adhering to FCP. Conversely, these data demonstrated that mutual trust between families and professionals provided an atmosphere which was conducive to the adherence of FCP principles. Similarly, a technical report of a project evaluation of a FCP training among frontline workers revealed that the trainees were highly satisfied with the content of FCP and the atmosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512453344">Salem State College, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Workers’ Perceptions of FCP</title>
<p>In a review of the literature specifically related to child welfare, only one study briefly described child welfare workers’ perceptions of the impact of FCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731512453344">Lietz &amp; Rounds, 2009</xref>). In the study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731512453344">Lietz and Rounds (2009)</xref> describe the idea that supervision can be a parallel process which can contribute to the effective implementation of FCP principles. In other words, if administrators and supervisors adopt FCP principles and use them to guide their practice, then these same principles should be adopted by the child welfare workers. Lietz and Rounds  assert that the leadership within the organization (through supervision) influences how a new program is implemented into daily practice. Moreover, supervision can often be a critical connection between new conceptual and theoretical material and direct clinical practice. The parallel process refers to what is happening in supervision and what is actually occurring in practice. It assumes that welfare workers may, in fact, learn more about a model of practice through how supervisors work with them rather from guidance related to their specific clinical work. Although a promising process, the only data to support this notion was a brief description of positive training evaluations related to the perceptions of child welfare workers. From the family perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731512453344">Lietz (2011)</xref> found inconsistent results in her qualitative study of family perceptions of the adherence of FCP principles. The data indicated that almost half of the families noted nonadherence to FCP principles among child welfare workers.</p>
<p>The lack of evidence in the literature on FCP and child and family outcomes highlights the need for caution in the belief of the effectiveness of the framework. This, in turn, may have implications for the appropriate and consistent implementation among child welfare workers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049731512453344">
<title>Implementation of FCP</title>
<p>The state’s model of FCP is based on fundamental strategies and principles that are expected to result in the increase of positive outcomes for children who are a part of the child welfare system. As such, the degree of its implementation is unknown; it is the required framework and is expected to be adhered to by all workers. Outcomes emphasize first and foremost the child’s safety, then stability and overall well-being. The specific FCP principles and values are as follows: (1) build upon family strengths and expertise, (2) respect cultural sensitivity, (3) collaborate with communities, (4) manage using data-driven practices, (5) involve the family in the decision-making process through family involvement meetings (FIMS), (6) build community partnerships, (7) recruitment and retention of kinship and community-based resource homes, (8) local department self-evaluation, (9) enhanced policy and practice development, and that (10) <italic>Place Matters for Children</italic> (related to potential positive impact of placement with family, siblings, kinship family).</p>
<p>FCP was implemented in the state in July 2009. The initiative had an emphasis on regional level and individual jurisdiction implementation efforts. Two of the core components of the evaluation included: (1) assessing the process of implementing FCP and (2) examining whether there were changes in practice related to FCP’s fundamental values and principles. Part of the evaluation of the FCP initiative was informed by focus groups with staff and families as follow-up data.</p>
<p>During the first year of implementation, 1,735 child welfare staff, representing approximately 95% of the state’s child welfare workforce, participated in a 2-day training on FCP. After completing the training, 94% of participating child welfare workers indicated reported they felt prepared to implement the core elements of FCP and had a better understanding of the core principles of FCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731512453344">DePanfilis, Hayward, &amp; Melz, 2010</xref>). Implementation technical assistance was provided for each local jurisdiction. During this time, each local jurisdiction was asked to complete an FCP progress form to assess the extent they were already integrating FCP core values and strategies into their practice. Data from the progress report were then presented to each jurisdiction, which then used this information to develop a strategic plan for the implementation of FCP and to submit that plan to the state within 30 days. In addition, the state made serious efforts to engage providers and stakeholders in the FCP implementation process. For example, eight provider training sessions were held across the state with a number of foster care provider staff trained. Further, an online survey was administered to child welfare staff at each local jurisdiction to examine staff perceptions of their jurisdiction’s organizational climate, their perceptions of their agency’s FCP efforts, and their personal attitudes toward FCP. Finally, a number of focus groups were conducted to explore more in-depth attitudes and beliefs of child welfare workers perceptions of FCP in the state. The purpose of this study is to explore perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs of the FCP among child welfare workers who are expected to use FCP principles in their work with children and families. In addition, this study aims to examine perceptions of resources and supports related to the implementation of FCP among child welfare workers.</p>

<sec id="section8-1049731512453344">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Nine focus groups were conducted between the fall of 2010 and spring of 2011 with a total of 64 social workers participating. The study, which was approved by a university’s Institutional Review Board, utilized a random sampling strategy, by selecting names of potential participants among the names of workers from the state’s automated child welfare information system. The caseworkers had to be employed by the state and working within the area of child welfare. All randomly selected participants were then invited via e-mail or a phone call to participate in the focus group. The first 10 respondents to the invitation were the participants for the focus group in that region. If more than 10 people replied to the invitation, they were placed on a waiting list in case of cancellations. Most of the case workers who declined to participate did so for scheduling reasons. Some people never responded to the invitation and it is not known why these people declined to participate. Although the selection of the participants was random, no data were collected on demographics such as race and gender. Participants received a meal but no other incentives for their participation.</p>
<p>Focus group participants represented a diverse pool of child welfare workers in terms of age, geographic region, years of service, and area of service such as child protective services, in-home family services, foster care, adoption, and resource services. Each focus group had an average of 7 people attending with a range of 5 people in one region to 10 people in another. The average age of participants was 41 (range 24–64) with an average 10 years of child welfare services (range 1–27). The majority of participants worked in foster care (<italic>n</italic> = 29) while 13 worked in in-home services, 10 in child protective services, 2 in adoption, and then the remainder in other areas (e.g., kinship care) or a combination of services areas (e.g., foster care and adoption). The local county with the greatest representation was the major metropolitan city in the state with 12 participants in the focus groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049731512453344">
<title>Study Procedures</title>
<p>One focus group was conducted in each region with the exception of the major metropolitan city in the state and an additional region where two focus groups were completed because of an error in taping and subsequent loss of partial data. There were a total of four focus group moderators who had previous training or experience in facilitating group groups. The lead moderator developed the focus group guide and conducted the initial focus groups. All other facilitators served as a note taker for at least one focus group before facilitating a group. There was a moderator and note taker at each focus group. A semistructured interview guide was provided to the focus group moderators prior to the interviews. The interview guide consisted of questions related to the implementation of FCP and their perception of using the principles in direct practice (e.g., how does FCP impact child welfare workers’ personal capacity, work climate, and supports; how do child welfare workers engage families, extended kin, and youth in relation to FCP; and how do child welfare workers experience FCP training).</p>
<p>All focus groups were audiotaped and subsequently transcribed using NVivo 9, a qualitative data analysis program. The transcripts were analyzed by two members of the research team using qualitative methods of coding, categorization, and meaning interpretation to analyze the focus data using a template approach (Crabtree &amp; Miller, 1999 as cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731512453344">Padgett, 2008</xref>). The template approach to qualitative analysis allows for the identification of domains or themes relative to prescribed areas of inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049731512453344">Padgett, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Analysis was conducted by one of the authors (L. M.) where all transcribed focus groups were reviewed and themes that emerged were indicated. There were over 80 themes that emerged from the first analysis. Examples of themes from the first analysis were lack of understanding how FCP was different from previous practice, increased demand for paperwork and data entry with FCP, and expectations of kinship support. These themes were then collapsed into larger groups based on a common content. In addition, similar or redundant themes were categorized together. The themes were then collapsed again into larger categories. In order to increase reliability of the study, another author reviewed both the general themes and the overall categories. No major discrepancies were noted. The themes were determined by the domains that emerged in the analysis.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049731512453344">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The themes that emerged were very closely related to the interview guide questions. Specifically, five themes related to the implementation of FCP were identified: lack of resources; high expectations; FCP and efficiency; supervisor support; and need for peer support.</p>
<sec id="section11-1049731512453344">
<title>Workers’ Definition of FCP Practice</title>
<p>Focus group participants were asked about their general impressions and feelings about FCP. The following two themes emerged: (1) FCP is not different from previous direct practice and basic social work principles; (2) FCP empowers and emphasizes the family as a whole. Many participants stated that they did not feel that FCP was any different than what they had learned in school or had been doing in direct practice. Some participants indicated that they felt FCP helped them actually document and guide the process but overall revealed that the work was the same.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I can probably say that we’ve been doing Family Centered Practice, or some form of it, for quite some time. I believe that the philosophy of Family Centered Practice is to meet the family where they’re at, work within the family strengths, build on the family strengths, and try to find resources for the family so that they can stay together. That’s always been the goal of social services. . .. I think we’ve always worked on that. Now I guess it’s just been given a name per say.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Several participants reported that FCP is, in fact, different than previous direct practice in terms of the approach of addressing the needs of the family as a whole, rather than the individual child. In addition, participants stated that empowering the family as a whole is an essential part of FCP.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s bringing to the forefront what it really means … to engage families. It’s not child centered anymore. It’s more family centered.</p>

<title>Experience of FCP Training</title>
<p>Participants of the focus groups were asked to give feedback on their perceptions of the FCP training and discuss any information or skills learned during the training related to FCP. Furthermore, participants in the focus groups were asked about their thoughts related to needed follow-up FCP training. The following three subthemes emerged from the analysis of the participant’s discussion regarding the training: (1) FCP training did not address individual and diverse needs of the family, (2) the training built on a foundation that child welfare workers already had, and (3) the need for follow-up training on evidence-based tools for direct practice within the FCP model.</p>
<p>Respondents stated that the FCP training approach was based on a standard that may not be applicable to all families.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Everyone is an individual. Families are different . . . It’s easier said than done when you’re working a case you know. You can’t always expect to apply everything to the all the families and think that you’re going to get some happy ending.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Similar to thoughts about FCP in general, participants indicated that the training was a reminder of skills and tools already used through their education.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>A lot of that training was a good refresher, good base, to get us kind of back on track . . . how social work and foster care should be working.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Fewer participants had suggestions for follow-up training for FCP. However, participants felt that emphasizing evidence-based skills and tools proven within the social work field would be helpful.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>…what’s more important with Family Centered Practice, are the things you that should never stray away from, that you should always do this. Because this has been effective. . . When we do it right, we have great success.</p>
</disp-quote>

<sec id="section13-1049731512453344">
<title>Time, Resources, and Opportunities</title>
<p>Participants were asked about their perceptions of the <italic>impact</italic> of FCP on their professional work environment (including the impact of FCP on child welfare workers’ time, resources, opportunities, peer and manager support, as well as feedback and coaching received from supervisors). Three overarching themes emerged from the analysis: (1) lack of resources; (2) high expectations preventing quality work; and (3) the perception that the requirements of FCP prevent efficiency.</p>
<p>Responses across all regions indicated a lack of resources, including financial, staffing, and transportation to implement the various facets of FCP effectively. Many respondents indicated that this lack of resources directly influences child welfare workers’ ability to effectively do their job. In addition, lack of time and high expectations of the child welfare worker emerged as related to the quality of direct child welfare practice, that workers felt is often sacrificed.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We never have enough funding, and . . . transportation is always an issue, and those kinds of community resources are always going to be a problem here. They are always going to be a barrier to Family Centered Practice. We can do all the FIMs in the world, but if the bus driver isn’t there to agree that he’s going to stop when it’s snowing, then you know then there’s still an issue.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Similarly, respondents stated that the standards of FCP and the limited resources to carry them out prohibit efficient work due to perceived overlapping requirements.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I just don’t think it’s efficient. I understand the premise behind everything that we’re supposed to do. Some things we do, kind of overlap. They give you things multiple times . . .  why am I doing this? It’s not efficient at all.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The increased expectation of the child welfare workers to expand their practice including the development of FIMS was a common point of discussion. Participants expressed concern that the additional expectations caused them to feel overwhelmed and impacted the quality of FCP practice.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>By the time you decide that you’re going to have a FIM, and then you turn around and you’ve got to get all the parties together, and you send out your e-mails, and you get your referral done, and get a facilitator. And then by the time you get your date and your time, and set it up, and the room up, and then you have your FIM, you might have five or six disruptions; you have may have to have five or six FIMs within a two week period or less, and so it’s very time consuming.</p>

<sec id="section14-1049731512453344">
<title>Support From Supervisors and Coworkers</title>
<p>Focus group participants were asked to discuss their perceptions of their work climate in relation to FCP. Specifically, participants were asked to discuss peer and manager support and how this may be a strength or barrier to FCP. Two work climate themes emerged: (1) supervisory support which impacted implementation of FCP; and (2) reliance on peer support as enabling effective implementation of FCP. Participants articulate that there is a conflict between the expectations of the state and the expectations of the worker. Some of these quotes show the continued disconnect between state and worker’s expectations around data entry. While other quotes suggest the state is committed to examining whether there is an overall system improvement; but workers are focused on the family in front of them.</p>
<p>Respondents indicated that their supervisor is very supportive. However, they also reported that the amount of support from the supervisor does not necessarily impact effective implementation of FCP because of other barriers such as the lack of resources.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve never had any instance where my supervisor hadn’t been supportive of something . . .  But then again it’s reality of being able to truly implement Family Centered Practice with the limited resources, the limited staff. We can’t do it the way it’s intended to be done even though my supervisor may come up with suggestions . . .</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Several focus group participants stated that in contrast to supervisor support, many gained a great deal of support, especially in relation to FCP, among peer relationships.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>There’s a lot of experience to draw from . . . each other. If there was a lot of turnover, and it was just people that only maybe (had) one, two, three years of experience.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Participants were probed regarding feedback and coaching in relation to FCP. Overall, the data indicated that there is a general sense among child welfare workers that feedback is both inconsistent and often emphasizes concerns about performance rather than positive feedback.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>You look at the numbers and you look at what the goal is, whether it’s the right (one). If you haven’t met that number, you’ve got to push to make that number whether it’s good practice or not.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Participants felt that the push to implement FCP and the focus on complying with the guidelines was causing them to sacrifice quality practice with the families.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Data’s important . . . the push is so incredibly strong that it doesn’t matter what the day to day stuff is; what is happening. It’s all about well what does your numbers say . . .  It’s about numbers. It’s not about families and it’s hard as a social worker to work in an agency that’s solely about numbers.</p>

<sec id="section15-1049731512453344">
<title>Engaging Families</title>
<p>Participants were asked to discuss their experience with engaging families in relation to FCP. Specifically, child welfare workers were asked to indicate how they engage families from the first encounter throughout assessment, planning, and the intervening process. The following four themes emerged related to engaging families: (1) difficulty due to resistance, (2) difficulty due to sense of entitlement, (3) ease with the use of respect and information, and (4) barriers with extended family and kinship family.</p>
<p>Participants frequently stated that engaging families was a constant struggle. The resistance that occurs in their work related to how the workers are perceived by the community also emerged. The data suggest that focus group members do not feel that FCP has increased their ability to engage families.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>These people barely want you in their lives. Let alone want their doctors to have their input on the service plan, their counselors to have an impact on the service plan . . .</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is challenging for families and workers to deal with the duality of the relationship, being both the supports for families to improve and the agency that has the authority and mandate to remove children, causes a level of distrust that permeates many interactions. In addition to resistance from the family based on the social workers’ court mandated role, participants revealed that a barrier to engaging families was what they perceived as a sense of entitlement from the families they work with. Participants felt that families expected the worker to be able to “fix” the family through the provision of services and resources with little desire to engage in the process themselves. The data suggests that the FCP framework does not address this effectively, and therefore has not changed this perceived sense of entitlement among families.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The entitlement thing where your family thinks, “Ok well, what are you going to do for all of us?” It’s one of the negative things that turn a lot of social workers off.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The expectation that workers are going to “fix” the issues that have led to a family’s involvement with child welfare is a challenging one. Workers have to find a way through the FCP model to engage with families around the shared responsibilities necessary to effect lasting change. Participants discussed how they were able to effectively engage families by including them in the process and building a healthy rapport.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I think just being respectful to them and being honest with them, but letting them know, “This is what we need to do to get to where we need to be at. You need to work with me on this. If you choose not to, this could be the consequence.” And let them know up front this is what we’re trying to prevent. I think it makes a big difference, and they’re more willing to work with you.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Honesty and understanding help set the stage for a good process. In order for the FCP process to work, the family has to be engaged and understand their role. Additionally, extended family and community supports have to be engaged in a similar manner. A number of participants specifically discussed difficulties in engaging fictive and extended family. Namely, the data revealed that the inability to provide financial assistance for their continued involvement was a barrier in engagement.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I think the problem is when you’re using a fictive kin, someone that’s not blood related, but they’ve known the child for years. You can’t give them anything. Well they can get food stamps, but most of the time that’s nothing. They’re basically getting nothing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The FCP process relies on individuals being committed to the positive outcomes for a child and family. This can be a long-term commitment and with other life issues potentially weighing on social supports it is a challenge to keep them involved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1049731512453344">
<title>Engaging Youth</title>
<p>Participants were asked to discuss their experience with engaging youth in relation to FCP. Specifically participants were asked to discuss their experiences with engaging youth in case planning. The following three themes emerged related to the engagement of youth domain: (1) understanding where the child is in a psychosocial manner and allowing the child’s voice to emerge in treatment, (2) entitlement as a barrier, and (3) lack of accountability as a barrier.</p>
<p>Participants stated that there is a need to empower youth to participate in the process. Adults use their own experience to filter information and however well intentioned they may be, the result is that the youth’s actual needs might remain unfulfilled. Empowering the youth and learning what the needs of the individual child are enable engagement.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Giving them (children) that voice but not taking away the parents’ authority. I would like to see more involvement, and more concern, and more advocacy for the children to speak. Not so much that we have to speak for them. Because we’re making assumptions, sometimes, with them.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Respondents also stated that preexisting misunderstanding of the purpose of child welfare that often comes across to the workers as perceived entitlement was a barrier to engagement. More specifically, many revealed that negative beliefs learned from the parents influenced the child’s sense of entitlement.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I think that was the biggest hurdles to engaging children. . . is what they have been told by their families and by their parents about what they should get because they’re in foster care.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In addition, participants revealed that a lack of follow through or accountability by the youth was a barrier in engagement.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>When engaging the older youth, accountability. I’m learning with most of my older teens, they’ll say, “Well I’m looking for a job.” And I’ll say, “Well I’ll send you information on a career fair.” (They respond) “Well what am I supposed to do with that.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Participants state there is a particular challenge in engaging older youth in connection to their developmental stage. This challenge could be used as an opportunity to use the FCP core principle of empowerment in order to engage older youth to meet their needs.</p>

<title>Discussion and Applications to Practice</title>
<p>Focus group participant responses and their general impressions and feelings about FCP provide a means to examine the pathway to implementation in the state. The FCP framework prioritizes family strengths, perspectives, and input to guide successful change and treatment, this framework diverges from traditional practice by placing a premium on the process of engagement to facilitate positive outcomes. The main objective of this study was to explore worker attitudes and beliefs related to the implementation of FCP principles in their direct practice with children and families. The focus groups used in this study were conducted from 3 months to 1 year after initial implementation of the FCP framework in the region. Overall, participant discussions show dissatisfaction with the process of change and a concern about the new administrative requirements of the FCP framework.</p>
<p>Prior research suggested that the effectiveness of the implementation of the FCP framework is tied to supervisor adherence to FCP principles in their interaction with workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731512453344">Lietz &amp; Rounds, 2009</xref>). In contrast, participants in this study felt that they received adequate support from their supervisors, but that this did not translate into effective implementation of the framework. This suggests a difference between a supervisor being supportive in general and being supportive while modeling the FCP principles. No discussion of supervisory modeling of effective FCP practices occurred during the focus groups. It is possible that this lack of modeling is what has caused participants to feel that the support they receive does not translate into implementation.</p>
<p>Participants did feel that they were able to receive peer support around the FCP framework, even if it was not present in their interactions with supervisors. Drawing on the broader experiences of colleagues provided workers with the ability to better implement the FCP framework in their caseloads. This use of effective peer communication is similar to the increase in team-oriented communication found by Unrau et al. (2004). The importance of peer communication in implementation cannot be overstated. Although there is a danger that peer communication might not be directed at improving implementation, but rather to undermining it as was discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512453344">Craft-Rosenberg et al. (2006)</xref>. This is particularly important with regard to the participant’s discussion around the emphasis on compliance related (often negative) feedback. Dissatisfaction within the existing hierarchy discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512453344">Craft-Rosenberg et al. (2006)</xref> will be exacerbated if the bulk of feedback workers receive is negative or compliance driven rather than showing the overall positive impacts in the state.</p>
<p>One of the positive impacts desired is increased family and youth participation in planning and implementation of the plans. Participants felt that there was a challenge engaging families and youth due to the strained relationship that exists between workers and families who are required to work with the system. In agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512453344">Craft-Rosenberg et al. (2006)</xref>, participants stated that it was a challenge working with difficult families and youth (e.g., families who did not want to interact with workers or had expectations that services would be provided without the need for their engagement in the process). Engaging youth and families is a central component of the FCP framework and a professed desire of the participants, it is imperative that workers be able to effectively interact with families and youth in their caseload and that the families and youth understand their important role in the process. Participants did not discuss the issue of parent and youth training or education as it relates to the FCP framework. It would seem that there is a need to ensure that families and youth understand and accept their role in the FCP framework and unless the state develops a model of interacting with families that does not require a court order this will have to be accomplished through some sort of family and youth training provided by the workers.</p>
<p>Overall, the workers involved in the implementation of FCP have experienced a number of challenges. Workers’ overwhelming desire is to work directly with youth and families and the initial view of FCP is that direct practice is often subjugated to administrative and scheduling issues and that the ability to interact with families is made more challenging due to preconceived notions based on the historical understanding of how the worker–family relationship should function. Workers responses in these focus groups suggest that they are interested in the process (want to engage and work with families), but they do not see the benefits that might be afforded to them or the families they work with through the FCP model. It is imperative that the data showing whether the FCP process leads to better outcomes for families and youth or increased client satisfaction be shared with workers. Without a fuller understanding of the potential benefits of FCP, it appears that workers are having difficulty moving beyond the focus on the additional requirements and effort needed for FCP implementation.</p>
<sec id="section18-1049731512453344">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Although the current study has a number of strengths, there are limitations that should be noted. Namely, the qualitative analysis presented here is based on nine focus groups and 64 individuals throughout one Eastern State. In addition, focus groups were conducted shortly after the implementation of FCP. Thus, the degree of change in workers’ attitudes and the perceptions of the program were limited. Furthermore, although the sample was randomly selected, the demographics collected were limited. Age, years of experience, type of worker, and site were noted but gender and race were not. As such, we are unable to indicate whether the workers who chose to participate were representative to the larger population of child welfare workers. Also, the main analysis was conducted by one author and themes were reviewed subsequently by another author to spot check for consistency. However, because an interrater reliability statistic was not calculated, the reliability of the classification scheme is unknown. Although principles of FCP are expected to be followed by all child welfare workers in the state, it is unknown the degree of its consistent application which may impact the perceptions of the model. In addition, the lack of understanding of the effectiveness of FCP among child welfare workers should be further explored as it relates to consistent adherence in implementation. Finally, the variance between those who participated and those who declined was not measured, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Future research should explore changes that occur over a longer period of time in order to evaluate the impact of FCP on child welfare workers perceptions and organizational support, as well as the improvement of child and family well-being.</p>
