<abstract>
<p><italic>Pneumocystis jiroveci</italic> pneumonia (PCP) is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening infection in immunocompromised patients with low blood T cells. Rituximab, a chimeric human/murine monoclonal antibody against the B cell-specific antigen CD20, has been increasingly used and appears to be effective in the treatment of autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). PCP has been reported in some patients with autoimmune diseases or lymphoma subjected to rituximab treatment, but has not yet been reported in SLE patients. We report PCP in two patients with SLE after rituximab treatment. Fever and respiratory symptoms associated with diffuse pulmonary infiltrates developed within weeks after rituximab therapy. One patient died of respiratory failure. Another patient recovered uneventfully after treatment with clindamycin and primaquine.</p>

<p>A 20-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with sudden onset of fever and chills on 31 January 2010. The patient was diagnosed with SLE at another hospital in May 2009. She presented with arthritis of metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints of the left hand, abnormal increase of serum antinuclear antibody (ANA) and anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, and proteinuria. She had been treated with prednisolone of varying daily dose and hydroxychloroquine. On 11 November 2009, she was admitted to our hospital because of progressive dyspnea, bilateral pleural effusions and leg edema suggestive of a flare of SLE as evidenced by pleuritis and renal involvement. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 57 mg/dL and creatinine was 3.98 mg/dL on the first hospital day. Pulse methylprednisolone therapy with 1000 mg for 3 days was initiated for worsening renal function (BUN, 125 mg/dL, and creatinine, 3.27 mg/dL) on 19 November 2009. One week after pulse therapy, rituximab 500 mg was administered intravenously for one day. Maintenance therapy with methylprednisolone 32 mg orally per day was given after discharge on 26 November 2009. Because of clinical improvement, a second dose of rituximab 500 mg was given on 15 December 2009. One month after the second dose of rituximab, the data of peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulation were as follows: CD20 cells, 0%; absolute CD4 cell count, 192/µL. The anti-dsDNA antibody was 57 IU/mL (normal, &lt; 30 IU/mL; borderline, 30–75 IU/mL; positive, &gt; 75 IU/mL), C3 complement was 55.5 mg/dL (normal, 79–152 mg/dL), and C4 complement was 14.7 mg/dL (normal, 16–38 mg/dL). At 6 weeks after the second dose of rituximab, the patient visited our emergency department (ED), with a sudden onset of fever and chills. On physical examination at ED, the patient appeared acutely ill and in mild respiratory distress. Her temperature was 38.3°C; respiratory rate, 21 breaths/min; blood pressure, 146/97 mmHg; and heart rate, 93 beats/min. Other significant physical findings were coarse crackles heard bilaterally. Results of complete blood count were as follows: white blood cells (WBC) count, 6,400/µL with 86% neutrophils and 7% lymphocytes; hemoglobin (Hb), 9.1 g/dL; and platelet (PLT) count, 182,000/µL. Urine routine examination revealed slight pyuria, hematuria and proteinuria. Results of blood biochemistries were as follows: creatinine, 7.38 mg/dL; BUN, 121 mg/dL; serum sodium, 138 mmol/L; potassium, 4.2 mmol/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 922 international units (IU)/L; C-reactive protein (CRP), 1.49 mg/dL; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 115 mm/h; C3 complement, 56.7 mg/dL; C4 complement 17.9 mg/dL. A chest radiograph showed mild alveolar infiltrates in both lungs. The patient was admitted and treated for urinary tract infection with cefuroxime. Because of persistent fever, and suspicion of healthcare-associated pneumonia the antibiotics were changed to flomoxef, azithromycin, caspofungin and cefpirome. Diagnostic workup for fever of unknown causes including microbiological studies of blood, urine and stool, blood cytomegalovirus (CMV) real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and HIV antibody were done, and yielded negative results. Nine days after admission, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest was performed, and diffuse ground glass opacities (GGO) with interstitial thickening were found in both lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203312436855">Figure 1</xref>). The results of pulmonary function testing were as follows: forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), 1.44 liters (54% of the normal predicted value); forced vital capacity (FVC), 1.49 liters (49% of the normal predicted value); FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC, 97%; diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco), 2.6 mL/min/mmHg (10% of the predicted value). Her pulse oxygen saturation level (SPO<sub>2</sub>) was 85% on room air, and supplemental oxygen therapy with 3 L/min through a nasal cannula was required to maintain SPO<sub>2</sub> above 95% on the 9th hospitalized day. Because of persistent fever and progressive worsening of oxygenation despite 10-day treatment of broad spectrum antibiotics, diagnostic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed on the 11th hospitalized day. Routine cytological smears of BAL fluid (BALF) showed foamy masses highly suggestive of <italic>Pneumocystis jiroveci,</italic> which was confirmed by methenamine silver stain. No other pathogenic microorganisms were yielded from cultures of BALF. The patient was treated with primaquine and clindamycin. Marked improvement of clinical features and resolution of lung lesions were found, and the patient was discharged in a stable condition. The patient is still alive at the time of manuscript preparation.

<p>A 39-year-old woman was diagnosed with SLE in 2001 with the manifestations of proteinuria, oral ulcer, malar rash, leucopenia, and was positive for anti-dsDNA antibody. The patient had been treated since 2004 with oral methylprednisolone at the usual dose of 12–16 mg daily, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil for controlling SLE with nephritis. In November 2010, the patient was worried about her Cushingoid appearance (moon face and buffalo hump) and presented with progressive leg edema for 3 weeks. Two weeks before rituximab treatment, the results of blood immunological studies and biochemistries were as follows: anti-dsDNA antibody, 45 IU/mL; C3 complement, 72.0 mg/dL; C4 complement, 29.2 mg/dL; ESR, 41 mm/h, and CRP, 0.243 mg/dL. No fever, chills, respiratory symptoms, abdominal pain, or arthralgia were noted. Therapy with rituximab 500 mg intravenously was initiated after admission on 1 December 2010 for renal flare. High fever and chills developed two days later. The results of laboratory tests were as follows: WBC count, 5200/µL; Hb, 10.8 g/dL; PLT, 161,000/µL; and CRP, 1.20 mg/dL. Empiric antibiotic treatment with cefuroxime was administered but fever was persistent. Blood culture yielded <italic>Salmonella</italic> group D. The antibiotic was changed to ceftriaxone, and fever subsided gradually. However, recurrence of fever associated with dyspnea and dry cough developed 17 days after rituximab therapy. The results of follow-up laboratory tests were as follows: WBC, 10,200/µL (87.4% neutrophils, 9.8% lymphocytes); Hb, 10.5 g/dL; PLT, 255,000/µL; CRP, 3.25 mg/dL; ESR, 109 mm/h; C3 complement, 60.9 mg/dL; C4 complement, 29.8 mg/dL; anti-dsDNA antibody, 14 IU/mL. A chest radiograph showed bilateral diffuse alveolar and interstitial pulmonary infiltrates. Fever persisted despite the addition of teicoplanin. Serological and microbiological studies for CMV, mycoplasma, legionella and chlamydia infections were not significant. Rapid tests for influenza A and B were negative, and the test for HIV was negative. HRCT scans of the chest showed GGO mixed with airspace consolidation and interstitial lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203312436855">Figure 2</xref>). The patient progressed into acute respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, and was transferred to the intensive care unit. The results of arterial blood gas analysis obtained after endotracheal intubation at FiO<sub>2</sub> 100% were as follows: pH, 7.436; PaCO<sub>2</sub>, 28.6 mmHg; PaO<sub>2</sub>, 62.7 mmHg. The anti-microbiologic agents including levofloxacin, ganciclovir, fluconazole, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) were given in addition to methylprednisolone. Diagnostic BAL was performed on 6 January 2011. The cytological smears of BALF demonstrated <italic>Pneumocystis jiroveci</italic>. Bacteria, fungus, mycobacterium, and virus cultures of BALF yielded no growth. Pancytopenia and neutropenia developed, and TMP-SMX was shifted to clindamycin and primaquine in addition to imipenem because of disease progression. Unfortunately, the patient died of multi-organ failure caused by sepsis 14 days after the diagnosis of PCP.

<p>Rituximab is a chimeric B cell targeted antibody, specifically against surface antigen CD20. It has been exclusively licensed to treat lymphoma. However, the off-label use of rituximab in the treatment of autoimmune diseases has been increasing recently.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312436855">2</xref></sup> For SLE, the indications of off-label use of rituximab included refractory or relapsing condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312436855">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312436855">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is important to host CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity against <italic>Pneumocystis jiroveci</italic>. However, several lines of evidence reveal that B cells may play a role in the development of PCP. B cell-deficient transgenic mice were found to be more susceptible to murine PCP and had higher mortality once infected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312436855">10</xref></sup> Lund et al. reported that B cells were required for later expansion and generation of memory CD4 T cells in response to <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> infection in mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312436855">11</xref></sup> A previous study indicated that approximately 6% of T cells expressed CD20, and rituximab could deplete these T cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312436855">12</xref></sup> In our first patient, the peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations were as follows: CD20 cells, 0%; absolute CD4 cell count, 192/µL, four weeks after rituximab therapy. These findings in patient 1 support the suggestion that T cell counts and function may be suppressed by rituximab. Some opportunistic infectious diseases previously found exclusively in patients with impaired T cell function might occur in other patients after rituximab treatment, including CMV infection in lymphoma patients after rituximab therapy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203312436855">13</xref></sup> and a higher rate of PCP in patients with lymphoma treated with combined rituximab and chemotherapy, CHOP-14.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312436855">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Risk factors for PCP in SLE patients include higher steroid dose, higher disease activity, renal involvement, lower lymphocyte count and lower CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell count in peripheral blood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312436855">5</xref></sup> PCP occurs uncommonly in patients with SLE,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203312436855">14</xref></sup> but may be potentially fatal. Ramos-Casals et al<italic>.</italic> reported off-label use of rituximab in 196 patients with systemic autoimmune diseases including 107 patients with SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312436855">2</xref></sup> Of these 107 SLE patients, only 3 developed opportunistic infections including tuberculosis, systemic CMV infection, and aspergillosis (one patient each).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312436855">2</xref></sup> Catapano et al. reported rituximab therapy in 31 consecutive patients with SLE, and pulmonary infections were found in 9 patients without specifying the causative pathogens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312436855">3</xref></sup> Turner-Stokes et al. described 76 patients with SLE subjected to repeated rituximab therapy, and no patients developed PCP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203312436855">15</xref></sup> To our knowledge, rituximab seems to be efficacious in the treatment of refractory or relapsing SLE, and PCP has not been reported as a significant complication in such patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312436855">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312436855">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203312436855">15</xref></sup> Accordingly, PCP will be not considered to be a complication related to rituximab therapy in SLE patients. The time period from the presence of pulmonary lesions to performing diagnostic BAL was delayed – 11 days in patient 1 and 18 days in patient 2. Furthermore, PCP is also rarely reported in patients with autoimmune diseases after rituximab therapy. Teichmann et al. reported fatal PCP following rituximab administration in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate and low-dose prednisolone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312436855">7</xref></sup> Hugle et al. described a patient with Wegener’s granulomatosis who developed PCP 6 months after treatment with rituximab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312436855">8</xref></sup> Taken together, PCP may occur sporadically in patients with autoimmune disease after rituximab treatment. However, the relation between PCP and rituximab treatment remains unclear. It is plausible that the development of PCP in patients with SLE or other autoimmune diseases after rituximab treatment may be attributed to worsening of underlying disease and/or poorer clinical conditions, enhanced immunosuppression by rituximab, or both. Further studies with larger populations are needed to verify these issues.</p>
<p>In summary, our report highlights that PCP may develop in SLE patients subjected to rituximab therapy. Since rituximab proves effective in the treatment of SLE patients with refractory or relapsing conditions, the increasing use of rituximab in such patients can be expected. Accordingly, PCP may be found more commonly in SLE patients subjected to rituximab treatment. To avoid a delayed diagnosis of PCP in patients with SLE subjected to rituximab treatment, the physicians should be alert, with high index of suspicion in particular in those whose pulmonary lesions shown on chest radiograms and/or HRCT are compatible with PCP and show poor response to empiric antibiotics.</p></sec>
