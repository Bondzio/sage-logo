<p>Tamar Diana Wilson’s exploration of women’s roles and participation in migration networks provides readers with a thorough review of the literature, a discussion of key analytical concepts, and rich ethnographic data stemming from the life history of one woman, Doña Consuelo (a pseudonym). The book provides compelling evidence of the complex and oftentimes pivotal role that women play in the creation, composition, perpetuation, expansion, and support of migrant networks.</p>
<p>The first portion of the book (Chapters 1–3) presents the social, political, historical, and economic realities that are key to framing Mexican migration patterns. Chapter 1 opens with an overview of the history of women’s work in Mexico in formal and informal sectors as well as unremunerated labor in their households. The overview reveals that women’s work cannot be extricated from the national and international economies, but despite this women have been largely excluded from social and legal rights and their work is stigmatized and undervalued. Wilson discusses patriarchy, the cult of the Virgin Mary, and machismo as social and religious institutions that impact gender roles and relationships and are key for understanding women’s participation in migration networks. Chapter 2 highlights the history of Mexican migration to the United States since the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, including major economic and political events and policies impacting both the “push” and the “pull” of migration. Here Wilson traces women’s early and increasing integration into the immigrant labor force along the border and in the United States. Chapter 3 presents concepts critical for understanding the patterns of migration identified through the ethnographic data presented in the book—how migrant networks form and function and the importance of social capital in those networks. This chapter includes a discussion of the current academic literature on transnationalism and on gender and migration.</p>
<p>The second portion of the book (Chapters 4–11) presents the ethnographic data collected by Wilson in 20-plus years of field research. Colonia Popular, a squatter settlement in the Mexican desert border town of Mexicali, is discussed in Chapter 4, where Wilson stresses the importance of women’s networks for the various migration patterns that she has documented through interviews with primarily women immigrants to the settlement. Chapters 5 and 6 bring the level of analysis down to the individual and household/family level by presenting Doña Consuelo’s story, an intimate firsthand account of the role that family, economy, and romantic relationships have played in her geographic movement in the course of her life. Her migration history—at times a story of escape or movement by force—reveals her tremendous resilience as she seeks out opportunity and stability for herself and her children. Chapter 6 concentrates on her work history and her role in establishing a home and community among migrants in squatter settlements—a unique contribution to the literature. Chapter 7 describes the evolution of the migrant network by tracing the international migration experience of one of her daughters, Anamaría. The evolution of the network of her daughter and son-in-law is discussed in Chapter 8 and contrasted with the network of another daughter, Irma, and her husband in Chapters 9 and 10. The two cases illustrate the different shapes and the strengths and weaknesses of migrant networks depending on economic position, place of origin and arrival, the relationship between members (coworkers, kin, or ritual kin), position in the life cycle, and the use of social capital. Chapter 11 explores the differences between rural and urban migration networks and the role of women in the development and expansion of migrant networks.</p>
<p>Chapter 12 summarizes the economic, political, social, and familial processes that have facilitated the evolution and expansion of migrant networks and draws nine general conclusions from the research. It ends with a discussion of the anti-immigrant policies impacting Doña Consuelo’s family’s ability to maintain ties in a transnational context.</p>
<p>Wilson’s special attention to women’s roles in migration networks helps close a gap in the literature on the subject as well as contributing to migration theory. Her book gives the reader a glimpse of the diversity and complexity of migrant networks based upon the experience of one family. Doña Consuelo’s strength in the face of adversity leaves a lasting impression, and her story is a unique contribution to our understanding of migrant networks.</p>
