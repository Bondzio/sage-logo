<abstract>
<p>We present a theory of comparative political institutions based on the concept of consensus democracy and social choice theory. Unlike Lijphart, we argue that “consensus democracy” is not a special form of democracy characterized by mutual vetoes, but rather the simplest form of democracy, which we refer to as PR-majority rule. We construct a typology of political institutions based on differences with this simple model. Contra Tsebelis’s veto players approach, our theory predicts that PR-majority rule should be the most flexible form of democracy. We test this with data on overall patterns of government spending and on welfare state reform.</p>

<body>
<p>We propose a theory of comparative political institutions based on social choice theory. This yields a typology quite similar to that in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012463883">Lijphart’s (1999)</xref> <italic>Patterns of Democracy</italic>, but with very different theoretical underpinnings. Lijphart’s approach has had considerable predictive power with phenomena such as income inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012463883">Birchfield &amp; Crepaz, 1998</xref>), participation, female representation, and environmental policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012463883">Lijphart, 1999</xref>). Furthermore, domestic institutions are increasingly being used as independent variables in work on international relations. However, Lijphart’s typology is undertheorized, and the theoretical assumptions lead to some erroneous conclusions. Other approaches built of similar premises, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0010414012463883">Tsebelis’s (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010414012463883">2002)</xref> veto player approach, are also theoretically and empirically problematic. We show that this has significant consequences for patterns of government spending and public policy issues such as the reform of welfare states.</p>
<p>Like Lijphart, we start with the concept of consensus democracy. However, we stand Lijphart’s theoretical understanding of this on its head. For Lijphart, consensus democracy is a special kind of democracy to be distinguished from majority rule democracy, characterized by agreement and mutual accommodation. For us, on the other hand, the “consensus democracies” (generally the small the countries of Europe) are the simplest and purest examples of majority rule democracy. Indeed, they might be referred to simply as “PR-majority rule” democracies, having proportional representation at the electoral stage and simple majority rule without checks and balances at the parliamentary stage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0010414012463883">1</xref></sup> We use this as a basis of comparison with other systems with additional features such as checks and balances or nonproportional elections that treat voters in a more complex manner.</p>
<p>Following the analysis of institutions in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0010414012463883">McGann (2006)</xref>, we can produce a typology of democracies simpler than those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010414012463883">Lijphart (1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012463883">1999</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010414012463883">Tsebelis (2002)</xref>. These typologies depend not just on political institutions but also on political outcomes (effective number of parties, one-party majority governments, and empirical electoral disproportionality in the case of Lijphart; number of parties with access to veto points in the case of Tsebelis). This means that theories about the kind of outcomes institutions produce are rolled into the typology of democratic institutions. We pursue the simpler and more transparent strategy of measuring types of democracy strictly in terms of their institutional features and then presenting hypotheses about what kind of outcomes these institutions produce.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a typology for comparative work, our theory of political institutions produces empirical predictions. If, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012463883">Lijphart (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010414012463883">Tsebelis (2002)</xref>, consensus democracies are characterized by the requirement of consensus and the existence of vetoes, we would expect policy in these countries to be extremely stable, if not deadlocked. We, however, argue that consensus democracies, as examples of simple PR-majority rule democracy, should be extremely flexible and adaptable in terms of policy. We test this empirically in regard to patterns of government expenditure from 1968 to 2000. Furthermore, we argue that the PR-majority rule democracies are precisely the countries that have not only been able to build large welfare states but also been able to reduce their size. The ability to reduce welfare state spending is a particularly hard test of the flexibility of a democracy, as an established welfare state produces concentrated, entrenched interests that can easily become veto players (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0010414012463883">Pierson, 1994</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-0010414012463883">
<title>Theory of Comparative Political Institutions</title>
<p>Before proposing a simpler, institutional classification of political institutions, let us consider the existing theory of consensus democracy and veto players. The work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414012463883">Lijphart (1968</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0010414012463883">1977)</xref> was seminal in that it challenged the Anglocentric conception of democracy as alternation in power between parties. This might have been an accurate description of the politics of the Anglo-Saxon democracies, and even Fifth Republic France and Germany. However, it did not fit the small countries of Europe as described by Lijphart and others, which were clearly stable but did not involve regular alternations of power. Lijphart theorized that these countries represented a different form of democracy that he referred to as “consociational,” characterized by negotiation and power sharing.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010414012463883">Lijphart’s (1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012463883">1999)</xref> later work develops this into a general typology that contrasts <italic>majoritarian democracies</italic> (characterized by winner-take-all elections, single-party government, and a lack of checks and balances) with <italic>consensus democracies</italic> (typified by proportional elections, coalition government, and checks on executive power such as bicameralism, federalism, and judicial review). Although this distinction is theorized as being one-dimensional, Lijphart’s empirical work reveals a two-dimensional pattern. The first dimension Lijphart calls the executives–parties dimension and is mainly loaded on by proportional elections, number of parties, multiparty government, cabinet length, and interest group corporatism. The second dimension, the federal–unitary dimension, is loaded on by bicameralism, federalism, judicial review, constitutional rigidity, and central bank independence.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012463883">Birchfield and Crepaz (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414012463883">Crepaz (2001)</xref> develop a theory to account for this two-dimensional pattern, building on an insight in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012463883">Lijphart’s (1999</xref>, pp. 4-5) work. They distinguish between <italic>cooperative veto points</italic> (measured by electoral proportionality and number of parties), where different parties share power within a single institution, and <italic>competitive veto points</italic> (strong bicameralism, federalism), where separate institutions can block action. They theorize that it is competitive veto points that allow the obstruction of redistributive policies, a finding compatible with the finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0010414012463883">Huber, Ragin, and Stephens (1993)</xref>. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414012463883">Gerring, Thacker, and Moreno (2005)</xref> develop the concept of <italic>centripetal democracy</italic> (centralized authority plus inclusion) to describe parliamentary countries that combine PR with a lack of checks and balances.</p>
<p>A related approach to the study of political institutions is veto players theory. This can be traced back to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414012463883">Immergut (1992)</xref>, but it is the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0010414012463883">Tsebelis (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010414012463883">2002)</xref> that has been most influential. Tsebelis’s veto players theory argues that more veto players (and more ideological diversity among them) makes it harder to change policy and thus increases stability. The number of veto players amounts to the number of parties that have access to a veto point—that is, the number of parties that control or are in the governing coalition controlling any veto point. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0010414012463883">Tsebelis and Chang (2004)</xref> use a spatial measure based on the ideological range of the veto players, using various empirical measures of the policy preferences of the parties. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010414012463883">Henisz (2000)</xref> calculates a measure of the political constraints on the executive branch that is theoretically similar to that of Tsebelis, except that the formula is more complex and relies on the assumption that the preferences of the parties in the ruling coalition are random. Tsebelis’s conception of veto players has been extremely influential and has provided the theoretical framework for several large, multicollaborator studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0010414012463883">Döring, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414012463883">Immergut, Anderson, &amp; Schulze, 2007</xref>). However, there are significant theoretical problems—most notably the assumption that coalition partners in multiparty governments are veto players (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012463883">Birchfield &amp; Crepaz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010414012463883">Strom, 2000</xref>)—which we return to later in this article.</p>

<sec id="section2-0010414012463883">
<title>A Simpler Institutional Theory</title>
<p>Instead of measuring types of democracy by the kind of outcome they produce (such as number of parties), we rely strictly on institutional features. Representative democracies consist of two sets of institutions. First, there is an electoral system that translates votes into allocations of seats in the legislature, which may be purely proportional at one pole, and completely winner-take-all at the other. Second, there is a parliamentary decision-making process whereby the legislators (and other officials, elected or otherwise) arrive at government policy. This can be classified in terms of whether it is simply majority rule, or whether it is to a greater or lesser degree supermajoritarian. This gives us a two-dimensional classification of democratic institutions, somewhat similar to the simple PR versus plurality, parliamentary versus presidential classifications used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0010414012463883">Persson and Tabellini (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010414012463883">Colomer (2001)</xref>.</p>
<p>Of course, any such typology is a (necessary) simplification. Electoral systems vary on many dimensions. However, the effects of many of these dimensions are similar, so it makes sense to talk about proportionality as a single dimension. As has been apparent since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0010414012463883">Rae (1967)</xref>, the larger the district magnitude, the more proportional the result. The threshold below which no representation is given also reduces proportionality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010414012463883">Taagepera and Shugart (1989)</xref> combine the effects of district magnitude and thresholds into a single concept of “effective district magnitude.” We use this as our measure of the proportionality of electoral systems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0010414012463883">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>We reduce all law-making institutions to a single dimension of supermajoritarianism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010414012463883">Condorcet (1787/1986)</xref> argued that bicameralism produces results similar to a supermajoritarian legislature. If two chambers are required to agree to pass a law, then it takes more than a simple majority in either of them to secure passage, especially if the two chambers are elected in different ways.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0010414012463883">3</xref></sup> This principle can be extended to other forms of divided power, such as presidentialism, federalism, and judicial review.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0010414012463883">4</xref></sup> For example, if a system is presidential and the president has a legislative veto, then the president is essentially an additional chamber of the legislature. Thus, we have a simple majority rule parliamentary system on one extreme and a highly supermajoritarian system with multiple checks and balances on the other. This is operationalized using the measure from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0010414012463883">McGann (2006)</xref>, which is simply an additive index of constitutional and legislative characteristics that allow for a minority veto or gridlock, such as bicameralism, federalism, presidentialism, filibuster, judicial review, and referenda.</p>
<p>The concept of supermajoritarianism is preferable to that of “veto players” for a number of reasons. First, it relies strictly on institutions and not on the political outcomes they produce. Second, it is more flexible. A measure of supermajoritarianism can capture situations where a minority coalition is able to block change, even if none of its members are by themselves veto players. Finally, the theory of veto players that underlies the measures of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010414012463883">Tsebelis (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010414012463883">Henisz (2000)</xref> is theoretically flawed. A veto player—in plain English as well as in social choice theory—is an agent that can single-handedly block change, and thus belongs to <italic>every possible</italic> winning coalition. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010414012463883">Tsebelis (2002)</xref>, however, a veto player is anyone in the governing coalition, that is, anyone who <italic>happens to be in the actual</italic> winning coalition that forms. It is, however, simply untrue that being in the governing coalition allows an agent to unilaterally block action. If a coalition member tries to obstruct action, the other coalition members can find a new partner, something that happens quite frequently in multiparty governments. Furthermore, in many countries (and particularly the “consensus democracies”) the government’s program is negotiated in the period after elections, but before a new government is formed. At this stage, the government has not yet been formed, so it is impossible that being in government can make a party a veto player.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414012463883">Figure 1</xref> plots the various countries in terms of their scores on electoral system proportionality and supermajoritarianism. We divide the countries first into those with winner-take-all electoral systems (effective district magnitude less than two) and systems that are broadly proportional (effective district magnitude greater than two). Second, we divide the countries between those with simple majority rule and those with several supermajoritarian features (we draw the dividing line somewhat arbitrarily at a score of 4). This gives us four categories—“PR-majority rule,” “supermajority power-sharing” (PR with supermajoritarian checks and balances), “supermajority winner-take-all,” and “Westminster” (simple majority rule legislature with winner-take-all elections).</p>

</fig>
<p>It is notable that most of the countries that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012463883">Lijphart (1999)</xref> considers consensus democracies (Austria, pre-1994 Belgium, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden) are in the bottom-right, PR-majority rule quadrant, as are Ireland and Israel. These countries have PR, but not many checks and balances that allow for a minority veto. The “supermajority power-sharing” countries (Germany, Switzerland, pre-1994 Italy, post-1994 Belgium) combine PR with such checks. The “Westminster” model (winner-take-all elections with a relatively unchecked majority rule parliament) describes the United Kingdom, pre-1996 New Zealand and to some degree Canada, France, post-1994 Italy, and post-1994 Japan. (Pre-1994 Japan is really a special case because of its system of single nontransferable vote.) Finally, there is the “supermajority winner-take-all” pattern, which combines winner-take-all elections with multiple checks and balances. The United States is the clearest example of this, with Australia and possibly Canada being the other candidates because of their high degree of federalism.</p>
<p>We have suggested that our two dimensions of political institutions correspond closely to those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012463883">Lijphart (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012463883">Birchfield and Crepaz (1998)</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414012463883">Table 1</xref> tests this. As expected, our measure of electoral system proportionality (effective district magnitude) correlates well with Lijphart’s executives-parties dimension and Birchfield and Crepaz’s collective veto points. Similarly, our measure of supermajoritarianism correlates with Lijphart’s federal-unitary dimension, Birchfield and Crepaz’s competitive veto points, and Huber et al.’s constitutional index.</p>

<p>Given that the concept of “veto players” conflates the two dimensions, we would expect measures of veto players to correlate with both electoral system proportionality and supermajoritarianism. This is what we observe. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010414012463883">Tsebelis’s (2002</xref>, p. 182) two measures of the number of veto points (a qualitative assessment of the number of veto players, and an average of the number of veto players 1981–1991) correlate with both sets of measures, but more strongly with the measures of the electoral system than with the measures of supermajoritarianism. The results for the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010414012463883">Henisz (2000)</xref> measures are particularly curious. The Henisz POLCON III index correlates with proportionality, but not with supermajoritarianism. However, the POLCON V index (which also takes into account federal veto points and judicial review) correlates with supermajoritarianism, but not with proportionality. Thus, they appear to measure completely different things, even though they are both presented as measures of political constraints on executives.</p>

<title>Predictions From Theory</title>
<p>Having established measures of types of democracy, we turn now to what kind of outcomes we would expect these institutions to produce. We start with PR-majority rule as this is the simplest form of representative democracy, and thus can be used as a basis for comparison with other forms. Proportional elections translate votes into seats in a straightforward, linear way and generally ensure that there are multiple parties, none of which has an absolute majority. Policy outcomes, therefore, result from a process of simple majority rule bargaining between the various parties.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it has long been recognized that majority rule bargaining does not give us a prediction of a single determinate outcome when more than one issue is decided at the same time. Rather, we get a prediction of cycling majorities, where for any policy platform we propose, we can find another platform that a majority will prefer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414012463883">Black, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010414012463883">McKelvey, 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010414012463883">1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0010414012463883">Plott, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0010414012463883">Schofield, 1978</xref>). This result is often presented in highly technical form, but the underlying intuition is simple—there are multiple, overlapping winning coalitions. If there are three parties, Party 1 can form a governing coalition with Party 2, Party 2 can govern with Party 3, or Party 3 can govern with Party 1. This makes predicting the outcome of majority rule far from obvious.</p>
<p>Fortunately, majority rule bargaining typically produces an outcome in a relatively small, central area. It used to be believed that the social choice cycling results meant that the outcome of majority rule bargaining was chaotic and that anything could happen (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414012463883">Riker, 1982</xref>). Current social choice theory, however, would predict that the outcome of majority rule bargaining would be in the “uncovered set” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010414012463883">Miller, 1980</xref>) or a localized variant, the “heart” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0010414012463883">Schofield, 1996</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0010414012463883">5</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010414012463883">Miller (1980)</xref> shows that in a realistic decision-making process, we would not expect an outcome outside the uncovered set. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010414012463883">Bianco, Lynch, Miller, and Sened (2006)</xref> show that in majority rule bargaining experiments that the uncovered set is a good predictor of outcomes. Although mapping the uncovered set is computationally very difficult, both theoretical and applied work suggests that it will be a small, central set (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010414012463883">Bianco, Jeliazkov, &amp; Sened, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0010414012463883">McKelvey, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0010414012463883">Schofield, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010414012463883">Schofield &amp; Sened, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>It is notable that the position of the uncovered set—and thus the majority rule outcome—depends on the preferences of all the parties, and not just the parties in the winning coalition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0010414012463883">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, even if Parties A, B, and C form the winning coalition, we would still expect the outcome to be in the shaded area, not in the triangle ABC. Parties A, B, and C cannot ignore the interests of D and E, because Parties D and E could split the winning coalition by offering one of its members very favorable terms to join an alternative winning coalition. This result is quite different from that of theories based purely on the positions of the parties in the winning coalition, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010414012463883">Tsebelis’s (2002)</xref> veto player theory. For Tsebelis, the Parties A, B, and C in the winning coalition are veto players, and parties outside the winning coalition can be ignored. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414012463883">Bianco, Holloway, Lynch, Miller, and Sened (2008)</xref> find that in experiments the uncovered set is a far better predictor of outcomes than the positions of the parties in the winning coalition. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0010414012463883">Strom’s (1990)</xref> finding that in many small European democracies (particularly those in Scandinavia) the power differential between the parties in government and those not in government is small.</p>

</fig>
<p>It is probably this inclusiveness that has led to many of the PR-majority rule democracies of Western Europe having a consensual style of politics. We would expect majority-rule bargaining to often produce outcomes that are consensual in the sense that all or most participants find them broadly acceptable. Of course, a consensus resulting from majority rule bargaining will appear superficially similar to a consensus resulting from mutual vetoes or constitutional requirement, in that everyone agrees to the final outcome. However, the counterfactual underlying the consensus—what would have happened if agreement had not been reached—is different, and we would expect this to lead to very different outcomes. In the case of a consensus through mutual vetoes, if agreement had not been reached, the status quo would have been maintained. As a result those who like the status quo had a very strong bargaining position, and we would expect extreme stability or immobility. However, if we have consensus through majority rule bargaining, the status quo is not privileged at all, and we would expect outcomes to be responsive to changes in public opinion.</p>
<p>Indeed we would expect PR-majority rule systems to be more likely to produce consensual outcomes than other systems. Because no party can hope to win a majority, it is necessary for any party seeking power to enter into negotiations with others. In a supermajoritarian system it is possible for the side that favors the status quo to win with less than 50%. In such circumstance, obstructionism may be a viable strategy. With winner-take-all elections, it is possible to get a “manufactured” majority with less than 50% of the votes. This increases the incentive for populist, plebiscitarian appeals. Such strategies, however, will be ill advised where it is always necessary to make coalitions—if a party behaves unreasonably or intransigently, it is possible to make a coalition around it. It may be that the “consensual” nature of consensus democracy (i.e., the tendency to seek broad agreement) is not a result of the requirement that consensus is reached, but rather the natural result of majority rule bargaining.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the PR-majority rule democracies we expect to see relatively stable patterns of government policy. Social choice theory does not predict a determinate outcome, but the uncovered set is likely to be relatively small and centrally located. However, the location of the uncovered set depends on the location of all the parties (including those not in government at the time). Thus, as public opinion and support for the parties shift, so should the uncovered set, and thus the majority rule outcome. As there are very few checks and balances, the PR-majority rule democracies should be very adaptable and responsive to changes in public opinion.</p>
<p>Having considered PR-majority rule, we can turn to how other institutions, such as supermajoritarian parliamentary rules and winner-take-all elections, compare to this. Supermajoritarian parliamentary rules will tend to produce more stability or even gridlock, for the obvious reason that it is harder to overturn the established status quo. When there are shifts in public opinion, supermajoritarian systems are likely to be less responsive to them, as a minority may still be large enough to block any move away from the status quo.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether we should expect winner-take-all elections to produce more or less responsiveness and instability than PR elections. If there are no checks and balances, as with the Westminster system, then winner-take-all elections mean that only a plurality of the popular vote is usually needed to win government. We would expect these alternations to produce a great deal of policy change. However, a plurality of the popular vote at the next election can lead to a new government that reverses the policy change. It is possible that these alternating pluralities offset each other, producing a series of oscillations that leave us essentially where we started, a kind of “stochastic veto” effect. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414012463883">Crepaz (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010414012463883">Castles and Mitchell (1993)</xref> make this kind of argument with regard to the expansion of the welfare state, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414012463883">Kitschelt (2001)</xref> applies it to retrenchment.</p>
<p>If we have supermajoritarian checks and balances, the effects of winner-take-all elections are also uncertain. However, there is a powerful mechanism tending to reduce flexibility. Winner-take-all elections make it far easier for a single party to gain complete control of a branch of government. If this branch of government is required for policy change, then the party is a veto player (in the correct sense of the word, an agent that can unilaterally block change). If there are multiple branches of government and these are won by different parties, we have multiple veto players and the possibility of gridlock. This is especially likely to happen if elections to different branches are held at different times.</p>
<p>We can summarize our hypotheses about the stability of government policy under different forms of political institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0010414012463883">6</xref></sup> First, we would expect PR-majority rule democracy to produce relatively stable patterns of policy but to be very flexible and responsive to changes in public opinion. Second, we would expect supermajoritarian systems to be more stable and to exhibit less change in government policy over time. We would expect systems with winner-take-all elections and no supermajoritarian checks to display a great deal of mobility as governments alternate, but are uncertain about long-run patterns. We would expect winner-take-all supermajoritarian systems to be extremely immobile.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0010414012463883">
<title>Empirical Effects of Political Institutions</title>
<p>We can test these predictions about the stability and mobility of policy using data on government spending. We have data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on aggregate government spending from 1968 to 2000. We also have International Monetary Fund (IMF) data that disaggregate government spending into 10 categories for 1972–2000.</p>
<p>Ideally we would test our hypotheses by looking at how changes in government expenditure track changes in public demand for expenditure. Unfortunately, we do not have a suitable cross-national measure of public opinion. A few studies have attempted to measure the responsiveness of different systems to public opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414012463883">MacDonald &amp; Budge, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0010414012463883">Powell, 2000</xref>). These studies produce results consistent with our hypotheses, in that they find that PR systems track public opinion more accurately than winner-take-all electoral systems. However, the measures of public opinion they use are extremely indirect (left–right self-placement from survey data in Powell; the declared position of the median party in parliament in MacDonald &amp; Budge). Exceptions are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414012463883">Stimson (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414012463883">Bartle, Dellepiane-Avellaneda, and Stimson (2011)</xref>, who produce a direct measure of public opinion on government spending for the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively. Fortunately, our theory does produce testable implication in terms of the variability of public expenditure in various systems, which is far easier to measure than responsiveness. If our hypotheses are correct, PR-majority rule systems should be compatible with high levels of variability in public spending. High variability, however, is inconsistent with veto players theory (or the understanding of consensus democracy in terms of mutual vetoes), which predicts that these countries should exhibit very immobile patterns of public expenditure. Similarly, our theory predicts low variability in countries with supermajoritarian constitutional features. We should bear in mind, however, that when we observe low variability in government expenditure, this could result from low political demand for change as well as from the effect of blocking effects of political institutions.</p>
<p>A simple first measure of stability is variation in total government spending as a percentage of GDP, taken from OECD historical statistics for 1968–2000. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414012463883">Table 2</xref> summarizes this. As is well known, average expenditure for the PR-majority rule countries is higher than for the other forms. Both the standard deviation of government expenditure and the standard deviation of the annual variation are higher for the PR-majority rule countries than for the other forms of government. Neither of these measures, however, really captures the kind of flexibility we are interested in. A high standard deviation could simply reflect a consistent upward trend in spending, whereas the standard deviation of annual change reflects the variation in short-term year-on-year movements.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>As a measure of the ability to make large long-term changes we look at the degree the size of the state increased during the years of expansion (in all our cases the early part of the period covered), and the degree to which it has been possible to reduce government expenditure after peak expenditure was attained. As expected, the PR-majority rule countries increased the size of the government expenditure more than the other forms of democracy. However, they also reduced spending from the peak more than other systems. The supermajoritarian systems (whether proportional or winner-take-all) did not reduce spending much (although in the case of supermajoritarian winner-take-all systems the peak level of spending was comparatively low). In the Westminster systems there was also considerable growth and retrenchment. The average retrenchment of Westminster systems was lower than that of PR-majority rule systems, but the number of cases was small and the PR-majority rule average was inflated by very large retrenchments in Israel and Ireland. Nevertheless, we can say the PR-majority rule democracies appear at least as flexible as the Westminster democracies, if not more so.</p>
<p>We can illustrate these patterns with the example of four countries in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0010414012463883">Figure 3</xref>. The Netherlands, a PR-majority rule democracy, increased public spending extremely quickly in the 1970s. However, in the 1980s it halted the rise and reduced spending somewhat. In the 1990s there were drastic cuts in the state’s share of the economy. This experience is similar (though more pronounced) to that of many of the PR-majority rule democracies. In the United Kingdom, the Westminster system produces regular alternations of government. As we would expect, there is considerable fluctuation in total government spending, and this cycles up and down repeatedly. Indeed, if we were to consider the period after 2001, public spending would move upward again quite sharply. The two supermajoritarian systems show far more stability. In the United States total public expenditure stays relatively constant as a proportion of GDP. In the case of Germany, there is a sharp rise in the early 1970s, but after this expenditure is quite stable.</p>

</fig>
<p>Considering total government expenditure ignores changes within the government budget. It is possible for total expenditure to be the same in two different years, but the allocation of spending to various programs to be quite different. We can examine this variation by considering government spending as a vector, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0010414012463883">Tsebelis and Chang (2004)</xref>. The IMF Government Finance Statistics Yearbook gives central government spending broken down into 10 functional categories (general, public order, defense, education, health, social, housing, cultural, economic, and other). Using these data, we can calculate the total difference between government spending patterns in any two years. The difference between the spending patterns in any two years is simply the sum of the differences in each category, that is, Difference (Year 1, Year 2) = Σ |x<sub>i1</sub> – x<sub>i2</sub>|, where x<sub>i1</sub> is the spending on category i in year 1.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0010414012463883">7</xref></sup> Unlike Tsebelis and Chang, we normalize the vectors by GDP, not by total government spending. Changes in the total amount of government spending (i.e., a transfer of income from individuals to the state) interest us every bit as much as the reallocation of spending within the government budget.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010414012463883">Table 3</xref> gives our results using the government spending vector data. There are some gaps in the coverage of the data, and the data are likely to be noisy, in that some variation will be the result of arbitrary reclassifications of which category spending falls into. Nevertheless some patterns emerge. In terms of the average annual change in the vector of government expenditure, all types of democracy produce on average similar results, except for the supermajoritarian winner-take-all systems, which produce far less variation. This, of course, captures only year-on-year fluctuations. We also consider the difference between the pattern of spending at the beginning of the period and the pattern in the year of greater aggregate expenditure. This gives a measure of change in the period of government expansion. As a measure of change during retrenchment, we take the difference between the vector in the year of maximum spending and the vector in the year with the lowest spending subsequent to it.</p>

<p>Year of minimum expenditure after the year of maximum expenditure.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>The results for these long-term differences are consistent with our expectations and the results for total government expenditure. All types of democracy yield large differences in the patterns of spending from the beginning to the end of the expansion period, with the exception of the supermajoritarian winner-take-all countries, where the differences are considerably lower. In terms of the variation in the retrenchment period, this is substantial in both types of democracy without supermajoritarian checks and balances (PR-majority rule and Westminster), but far smaller in the both supermajoritarian systems. The average difference is greater for the PR-majority rule systems than for the Westminster systems, but this is partly the result of an extremely high value for Belgium (which probably results from the reclassification of health insurance expenditure in the 1980s).</p>
<p>Thus, our results are consistent with our hypotheses. However, a word of caution is necessary. We are dealing with a small number of cases, and many of these cases share a number of significant traits. For example, the PR-majority rule democracies are all small countries with very open economies. Most of them have corporatist interest group arrangements and strong left parties. Only Israel and New Zealand are outside the European Union.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0010414012463883">8</xref></sup> The PR-majority rule countries have a constitutional form that should facilitate flexibility, in that there are no veto players who can block a majority. However, they also have a number of other characteristics that mean that demand for flexibility is likely to be high, such as being small, open economies. Indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414012463883">Cusack, Iversen, and Soskice (2007)</xref> argue, some of these features, such as corporatist industrial relations, could even have influenced the choice of PR as an electoral system. Therefore, we cannot make a causal argument that PR-majority rule systems inevitably lead to flexibility. However, we can certainly reject the contrary argument that PR and multiparty government is incompatible with rapid policy change. That is, we can reject an understanding of consensus democracy that emphasizes veto players and institutions that <italic>require</italic> (as opposed to encouraging) consensus. Lijphart’s consensus democracies are in fact the most adaptable group in terms of government spending, which is what we would expect from their (PR-majority rule) constitutional form.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0010414012463883">
<title>Political Institutions and Welfare State Retrenchment</title>
<p>In addition to considering the changes in the overall patterns of spending, we can consider the degree to which different political institutions allow flexibility in particular policy areas. There is a considerable literature on the effect of PR and constitutional checks on the expansion of welfare states. We would expect the existence of constitutional checks and veto points to limit the growth of welfare state programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414012463883">Crepaz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0010414012463883">Huber et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010414012463883">Huber &amp; Stephens, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414012463883">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414012463883">Immergut, 1992</xref>). It has also been argued that PR leads to greater welfare state growth, resulting from lower targeted expenditures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0010414012463883">Persson &amp; Tabellini, 1999</xref>), the ability to commit to long-term institution building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414012463883">Crepaz, 2001</xref>), the interaction between PR and certain training or skills regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010414012463883">Iversen, 2005</xref>), or the superior performance of left parties under PR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0010414012463883">Iversen &amp; Soskice, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>However, in addition to being more open to the expansion of welfare states than supermajoritarian system, we would also expect PR-majority rule democracies to be more able to reduce welfare state spending. And indeed many of the PR-majority rule democracies have substantially reformed their welfare states in recent years, although these welfare states remain large by international standards.</p>
<p>It should be noted that we are not here trying to explain differences in patterns of welfare state reform, a task that would clearly be beyond the scope of this article. This would depend on numerous other factors, including the degree of commodification in the welfare state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414012463883">Esping-Andersen, 1990</xref>), the degree to which the welfare state is funded in a pay-as-you-go manner, the openness of the economy, and the age profile of the welfare state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010414012463883">Lynch, 2006</xref>), among others. We simply demonstrate that the PR-majority rule democracies are at least as flexible as countries with other constitutional forms, in that they can build very large welfare states, but also reduce spending on them rapidly.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0010414012463883">Table 4</xref> gives various quantitative measures of welfare state reform. First, there is expenditure on social security as a percentage of GDP, taken from OECD historical statistics. The table gives the highest value each country obtained prior to 2004 and the difference between expenditure in 2004 and the highest previous expenditure. Of course, the total reduction in welfare state spending could be the result of either welfare state retrenchment (reducing benefit levels and eligibility) or policies that reduce demand for benefits, such as labor force activation programs. Therefore, the table also provides two measures of retrenchment from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414012463883">Allan and Scruggs (2004)</xref>, who calculate the effective wage replacement rates for workers on unemployment and sickness insurance.</p>

<p>We would expect the PR-majority rule democracies to build large welfare states, but also to be able to cut back spending. This is what we observe.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0010414012463883">9</xref></sup> The peak social security spending for the PR-majority rule democracies tends to be higher than for the other countries. However, the reduction in expenditure from this peak is also considerably higher on average (–5.7%) than that for the other constitutional forms. Reductions in replacement rates for unemployment insurance and sick pay are also considerable. Although there is considerable variation among countries, it is clearly possible for PR-majority rule democracies to reform welfare states quite rapidly in a quantitative sense. We would expect countries with supermajoritarian constitutions to reform welfare states more slowly, as it is easier for established clienteles to block changes. This is exactly what we see. Reductions in both aggregate spending and replacement rates are on average lower in both the supermajoritarian proportional and supermajoritarian winner-take-all countries.</p>
<p>With the Westminster system, things are somewhat more complicated. We know that these countries have more limited welfare states than the PR-majority rule democracies, but would expect them to be quite flexible to retrenchment, as there are few supermajoritarian checks and balances. When we look at overall social security expenditure, we see that peak social security expenditure is lower than in the PR-majority rule democracies, but the reduction of spending from the peak is also somewhat lower (although greater than in the supermajoritarian countries). However, when we consider reductions in unemployment and sick pay replacement rates, these are on average slightly larger than those in the PR-majority rule democracies. It is thus clear that some Westminster systems, such as the New Zealand and the United Kingdom, have retrenched significantly. Indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414012463883">Huber and Stephens (2001)</xref> point out, up to 1995 these two countries were the main examples of substantial retrenchment. Although retrenchment in Westminster systems and PR-majority rule systems may have been similar in quantitative terms, there are significant qualitative differences. Retrenchment in New Zealand and the United Kingdom was earlier, more ideologically driven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414012463883">Huber &amp; Stephens, 2001</xref>), and more focused on programs targeted toward working-age people (unemployment and sickness benefits).</p>
<p>It is interesting to compare these results with the patterns we observe with pension reform. We do not have a suitable quantitative measure of pension reform. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414012463883">Immergut et al. (2007)</xref> produce a comparative qualitative analysis of pension reform across Europe. Of course, the degree of reform is in part a function of the level of fiscal crisis facing the pension system. In particular, mature universal earnings-related pensions financed using the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) principle are particular problematic when faced with aging and declining populations. In general countries without such systems (such as Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Ireland, and the United Kingdom) have had to reform less drastically than countries with them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0010414012463883">10</xref></sup> However, among the countries with universal, earnings-related PAYG systems, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414012463883">Immergut et al. (2007</xref>, p. 28) argue that by any measure reform has been greatest in Italy and Sweden. Both these countries fit the PR-majority rule pattern in the period when the reforms took place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0010414012463883">11</xref></sup> In the case of the supermajoritarian systems (such as Germany) and the systems with single-party governments (United Kingdom, France, Greece, Spain), change was quite incremental.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0010414012463883">12</xref></sup> Austria is notable as one consensus democracy with a large PAYG earnings-related pension where reform was very limited. In general, then, the pattern observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414012463883">Immergut et al. (2007)</xref> conforms to our previous findings—PR-majority rule democracies are at least as able to reform as other systems, in spite of the fact that they have more “veto players” in the Tsebelis sense.</p>
<p>When we consider qualitative accounts of welfare state retrenchment in the PR-majority-rule democracy, these are consistent with our theoretical expectations. That is to say, multiparty government facilitates reform, rather than allowing it to be vetoed. The largest reforms tend to result from broad, negotiated coalitions. Furthermore, these coalitions often include the main socialist or labor party, a party that is nearly always in favor of a strong welfare state. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414012463883">Green-Pederson (2002)</xref> finds that the sharpest cuts in the Netherlands and Denmark happened in the 1990s, after social democrats had joined the governing coalition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414012463883">Anderson and Immergut (2007)</xref> show that the Swedish Social Democrats took part in the negotiations that led to the 1998 pension reform even when they were in opposition from 1991 to 1994 (indeed they were overrepresented on the relevant parliamentary committee). When they were returned to power in 1994, they faced strong pressure from the unions and their membership to veto the agreed pension reform, but refused to do so. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414012463883">Ferrera and Jessoula (2007)</xref> find that successful pension reform in Italy generally happened under broad coalition governments, including technocratic governments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414012463883">Bonoli (2001)</xref> finds that inclusive practices such as corporatism can overcome veto players in countries such as Switzerland. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010414012463883">Myles and Pierson (2001</xref>, p. 306) argue that substantial single-party reforms are very rare, as broad coalitions offer more potential for blame avoidance.</p>
<p>The pattern of welfare state retrenchment while social democratic parties are in government poses an important question: If, as some have argued, consensus democracies are characterized by mutual vetoes, why did social democratic parties not use these vetoes to protect the welfare state? The answer we have given is that most of these democracies are actually simple majority rule systems, and under majority rule there are (contra Tsebelis) no veto players, unless one party has a majority. If a social democratic party in government had tried to veto welfare state reform, reform would have been implemented by a nonsocial democratic coalition. Social democratic parties would rather have a welfare state reform in which they have a voice than a welfare state reform imposed on them by other parties, some of whom may be in favor of far deeper and more fundamental cuts. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414012463883">Anderson and Immergut (2007</xref>, pp. 387-388) argue that the Social Democratic participation in pension reform in Sweden can be explained only by the fact that they realized that they could no longer expect to be a hegemonic party, and thus could influence policy only if they were a credible negotiating partner. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010414012463883">Pierson (2001</xref>, p. 453) argues that this style of reform is most likely where unions and the parties of the left are moderately strong—strong enough to be at the bargaining table, but not so strong that other actors will not “go it alone” if they try to act as veto players.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Far from being a special kind of democracy, consensus democracy should rather be considered as the most basic or simple form of democracy—that is to say, PR-majority rule democracy. Normatively, it is also the most egalitarian form of democracy in a procedural sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0010414012463883">McGann, 2006</xref>). Lijphart’s characterization of the PR-majority rule democracies of Europe as “consensus democracies” may well be accurate in terms of <italic>outcomes</italic>—politics may indeed be inclusive and pragmatic and produce “kinder, gentler democracies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012463883">Lijphart, 1999</xref>, p. 275). However, these consensual outcomes are a result of <italic>institutions</italic> that allow unchecked majority rule bargaining, not any constitutional requirement that consensus be reached.</p>
<p>We can construct a typology of political constitutions based on our concept of consensus democracy as PR-majority rule. Constitutions can vary on two dimensions: whether the electoral system is proportional or not and whether there is a simple majority rule parliament or a system with supermajoritarian checks and balances. Our typology (and the measures that go with it) correlates strongly with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012463883">Lijphart (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012463883">Birchfield and Crepaz (1998)</xref>. Thus, we would expect the existing empirical results on the effect of consensus democracy on variables such as income equality, environmental policy, and participation to also apply to our variables. For example, if Lijphart’s and Birchfield and Crepaz first dimension really captures just proportionality, then we would expect proportional systems to have lower income inequality, stricter environmental laws, and so on. The advantage of our typology is that it is simpler in that it is based strictly on institutional differences (such as the electoral system) and not on political outcomes (such as the number of parties).</p>
<p>We would be particularly skeptical about the use of measures derived from veto players theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010414012463883">Henisz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010414012463883">Tsebelis, 2002</xref>). These measures conflate the effects of electoral proportionality (and thus multiparty government) on one hand and supermajoritarianism on the other. These two factors often work in opposite directions. Furthermore, the theory implicit in the veto players measures is untenable. It is assumed that every member of the governing coalition is a veto player, which is simply not the case. This leads to the mistaken conclusion that multiparty governments are likely to be gridlocked, which we have shown is not true empirically.</p>
<p>Our theory gives us definite predictions about patterns of government policy. We would expect the PR-majority rule democracies to be very adaptable, as PR-majority rule is the simplest form of democracy. We would expect them, as majority rule democracies, to be relatively stable in terms of patterns of government expenditure, but to be extremely flexible when there are changes in public opinion. We would expect supermajoritarian systems, on the other hand, to show far less variability because it is far easier for minorities to veto changes in outcomes they like. We would expect winner-take-all electoral systems to lead to considerable volatility as governments alternate. These are indeed the patterns we find when we consider data on patterns of government spending and welfare state reform.</p>

<p>This is calculated as follows: First, we calculate the actual district magnitude, taking the average number of representatives elected from each district, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010414012463883">Taagepera and Shugart (1989)</xref>. If there is a second tier that compensates for disproportionality, we take its magnitude. Second, if there is a threshold below which no seats are awarded, we convert this into an equivalent district magnitude using the formula M = 50% / T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010414012463883">Taagepera &amp; Shugart, 1989</xref>, p. 135), where M is the equivalent magnitude and T is the legal threshold. The effective district magnitude is then the lower of the actual district magnitude and the equivalent calculated from the threshold. For mixed-member systems, if the system is noncompensatory, we simply take the average magnitude of all districts, including both the single-member and PR districts. If the system is compensatory we take the PR districts to be decisive.</p>

<p>Technically, a policy platform is defined as “covered” if there is another platform that both beats it by majority rule and beats everything that the first platform beats.</p>

<p>It is notable that our hypotheses are framed in terms of variation and stability of long periods, and not in terms of what will happen at a particular time. If we had voter preference data for every country year and for all the relevant issue dimensions, we could predict when we would expect policy change to happen. This is especially the case with the PR-majority rule countries, where we have a solution concept (the uncovered set) that is precisely developed and experimentally verified. Of course, we do not have these data. However, we can still derive testable implications of our theory. For example, if our conception of consensus democracy as majority rule bargaining is correct, we would expect the PR-majority rule democracies to exhibit considerable variation in policy over time. However, if the rival theories (veto players, consensus democracy as mutual vetoes) were true, we would expect extreme stability in policy compared to other forms of democracy.</p>

<p>We differ from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0010414012463883">Tsebelis and Chang (2004)</xref> here in that we use the city-block metric, instead of Euclidean distance (Difference (Year 1, Year 2) = Σ (x<sub>i1</sub> – x<sub>i2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>). The city block metric is simpler, and we can see no theoretical reason to weight large differences more than a collection of small differences.</p>

<p>Israel, apart from showing that the flexibility of PR-majority rule democracy is not an exclusively Northern European phenomenon, is a particularly interesting case in qualitative terms. In the 1980s it suffered from hyperinflation. This led to major economic reform, with government expenditure as a proportion of GDP falling 30% between 1980 and 2000. The main economic reforms took place under a supposedly weak grand coalition government (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012463883">Bruno, 1993</xref>).</p>

<p>The two exceptions are Austria and Norway. Unlike the other PR-majority rule democracies, these did not face high unemployment in the 1980s and were not forced to substantially reduce the size of their welfare states.</p>

<p>Italy is a borderline case in the period in question, in that it has a mixed electoral system. However, this system did produce multiparty governments, so the logic of coalition government without supermajoritarian checks applies.</p>

<p>Greece and Spain have electoral systems that are proportional, but because of low district magnitude, the system gives a large bonus to the largest party and often produces single-party governments. In this respect, they are quite similar to Westminster systems.</p>
