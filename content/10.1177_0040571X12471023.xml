<abstract>
<p>This article is an extended review of six recent short non-theological works from the School of Life, a London-based practical philosophy initiative. The article distils from the works their dominant themes with a view to assessing what Christian theology might learn about necessary theological emphases today. Four themes are discerned – body, inner life, concern for others, action. It is suggested that through these emphases the works indicate the importance of working on contemporary formulations of doctrines of incarnation, Spirit, kingdom of God and salvation which connect with the themes identified.</p>

<body>
<p>I confess to being envious of the writer of <italic>Religion for Atheists</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040571X12471023">1</xref></sup> This is less because Alain de Botton has written many very popular books, and probably made quite a bit of money from his trade (and at his best he writes really well) but more because <italic>Religion for Atheists</italic> is a book that I, along with many other theological writers, might have been better qualified to write. Admittedly, unlike de Botton’s book, mine would not have been ‘A non-believer’s guide to the uses of religion.’ But in being positive about religion’s benefits, it would have been able to offer a similar challenge to atheists, while drawing attention to many things about faith and religious practice that de Botton leaves unsaid.</p>
<p>As it is, <italic>Religion for Atheists</italic> is a kind of background paper for a contemporary initiative in what has been called ‘practical philosophy’. Recognizing the sheer range of ways in which the practical wisdom and insight of religious traditions can inform contemporary living, de Botton takes up the baton from Auguste Comte in trying to fashion a ‘Religion of Humanity’. He acknowledges that positive emotions and moral endeavours need institutional shape to have much effect. Because ‘good ideas will not be able to flourish if they are always left inside books’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040571X12471023">2</xref></sup> he realizes the need for some kind of structure (events, a website, and, yes, even some more books) to promote this new form of secular religion.</p>
<p>This being so, de Botton joined forces with a number of other ‘cultural thinkers’, philosophers, broadcasters and a psychotherapist to set up the School of Life, a London-based initiative to get people thinking practically about their behaviour and values. The School’s self-description refers to its being ‘dedicated to exploring life’s big questions’. Its leading participants ‘don’t have all the answers’, but they do want to direct us ‘towards a variety of useful ideas – from philosophy to literature, psychology to the visual arts – that are guaranteed to stimulate, provoke, nourish and console’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040571X12471023">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this article I review the first six short books to have appeared from the School of Life. My purpose is neither to work through them noting simply where they do or do not happen to agree with Christian theology, nor simply to log the perhaps surprisingly large number of religious references they do contain. Rather, I wish to reflect theologically – both appreciatively and critically – on their emphases and approach, with a view to discerning what can be learned for contemporary Christian thought and practice.</p>
<p>First, I shall summarize the content and highlight some main emphases of the six books.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040571X12471023">4</xref></sup> John Armstrong’s <italic>How to Worry Less about Money</italic> begins by making a clear distinction between money worries and money troubles. Armstrong accepts that his task is not to provide a ‘get rich quick’ recipe. His purpose is to encourage readers to refocus their inner life on what really matters. In this way, money and the desire to acquire it takes its place within a chosen, specific approach to life, where flourishing is seen to be more significant than happiness, where the ‘virtues’ are pursued, where our desires are appropriately trained and ‘higher needs’ are met.</p>
<p>Tom Chatfield’s <italic>How to Thrive in the Digital Age</italic> is in many ways an extended essay on contemporary understandings of the self. In exploring the ubiquity of faster, smaller and more complex forms of communication technology, Chatfield examines how ‘wired living’ affects our understanding of embodiment and our relations with other people. We are challenged to ask whether constant connectedness has so dissipated the sense of an independent self that we need to work at its restoration. Do we need to switch off in order to have a chance of grasping who we are? Throughout the book there is also a strong thread of concern about the quality of what is made available to technology users. What is it worth paying attention to? An appropriately strong sense of self will thus come from sifting media and culture, taking control of what confronts us and resisting being continually connected.</p>
<p>Alain de Botton’s <italic>How to Think More about Sex</italic> has three chapters on ‘the pleasures of sex’ and five on its ‘problems’. This is a sad imbalance, though probably a fair reflection of what de Botton recognizes he needs to deal with in order to address his chosen topic. In being positive about the erotic and realistic in his attention to sexual practice, de Botton is engagingly direct. He dips into the psychology of attraction in exploring why anyone ‘turns us on’. Intriguingly, de Botton’s interest in religion surfaces in his chapter on pornography, recognizing in a refreshingly positive way the manner in which religions at their best can regulate life and constrain misplaced priorities.</p>
<p>John-Paul Flintoff’s <italic>How to Change the World</italic> offers a refreshing take on what it might mean to ‘live for others’. He trawls the wisdom of many ways of thinking, believing and behaving – including religious traditions – in exploring what the desire to be ‘part of something bigger’ amounts to. Accepting that the scale of the idealism he is examining could be seen as rather distant from everyday life, he, very helpfully, spends considerable time enabling the reader to build up from his or her current practice to the kinds of practices which might contribute to major social and political change.</p>
<p>Roman Krznaric is described as an ‘author and cultural thinker’. To these roles can now be added ‘Greenbelt contributor’, owing to his appearance at Cheltenham in 2012 which led to his <italic>How to Find Fulfilling Work</italic> becoming one of the ten best-selling books at the festival that year. Like Armstrong’s book on money, Krznaric’s text could not possibly be a ‘how to’ book in finding a job. Instead, he invites his readers to rethink their approach to human activity, offering ways of understanding how work creates meaning. He does not dodge questions of money, although to those currently engaged in the desperate quest for any kind of income-generating employment his book might not quite hit the mark. Unsurprisingly, the concept of ‘vocation’ appears. Krznaric thinks we need to grow a vocation rather than discover it.</p>
<p>Finally in the series of six books, Philippa Perry’s <italic>How to Stay Sane</italic> provides a fourfold strategy for living an emotionally healthy life, through self-observation, relating well to others, understanding and dealing appropriately with stress and being clear about our own narrative and the stories we live within. In exploring these four themes she emphasizes that self-observation is about knowing yourself, not being self-absorbed. In the chapter on relationships, in which Martin Buber receives prominent mention, we are advised to take regular checks on how we relate to those around us, communicating openly in order to maintain an ‘I–You’, as opposed to an ‘I–I’ or an I–It’ relationship. The short chapter on stress reminds us that not all stress is bad. Indeed we need some good stress, for positive stimulation keeps our brain active and healthy. After the exploration of the importance of stories, both in shaping us and enabling us to fashion our own personal narratives, the book concludes with over twenty pages of practical exercises.</p>
<p>What is to be made of these six books? They are certainly ‘self-help’ books in the sense that they are meant to be practical works which readers can read for enjoyment but will only get the best and most from by doing something with, in their own lives. In this respect, Flintoff’s and Perry’s come off best. Though all six books contain a ‘Homework’ section, usually a selection of further reading or references to websites to consult, Perry’s exercises and Flintoff’s Appendix – a list of ‘198 Ways to Act’, by peace activist Gene Sharp – are particularly direct and focused. Otherwise, it would be possible to say of some of the books, ‘well, that made me think’, and leave it at that.</p>
<p>The works are appropriately contemporary in that they address current questions, and provide telling examples, real-life stories of people (people like the likely readers) who have faced issues and life-choices. In this respect, like the best philosophy (and the best sermons) the true-to-life illustrations bring the ideas and insights to life and enable readers to connect with the discussion. The books are also well produced: small format, well designed, slickly presented, their text broken up into short sections with headings, charts, pictures and well-positioned white space. All in all, though sometimes the writing seems rushed, they are a pleasure to read. They could each be consumed in a single sitting, if a reader so chose. Even if not intended as ‘that kind of book’, they could be enjoyed in a similar way to a long, thought-provoking, informative journalistic essay.</p>
<p>So far, so good. But who are they for and what might some of the drawbacks of the series be? First, there’s the question of cost. Is anyone who is not already materially comfortable going to pay £7.99 a time for each of six small books? Probably no-one will anyway. In the days of cut-throat publishing, few will pay the full price for any, let alone for all. And they’ll be passed on, and passed round, which is perhaps as intended. They are ‘tracts for our times’. But the issue is less the cost itself than the kind of world that such expensive tracts are located within. These are self-help books largely for well-educated, economically comfortable people. They are, admittedly, for people like me – which is why I wanted to read them – though this immediately raises the question whether they are also for many of the people I meet Sunday by Sunday in church (I attend a city centre church with a very diverse congregation). And here the answer is that they are not. As a collection, they assume too much: that as a reader I have time to create the space for inner reflection or a major rethink (I may not, because I have to fill too much time in low-paid employment or with demanding domestic responsibilities of a kind not reflected here). They assume that I am fully plugged into the latest developments in digital technology. But I may or may not be, depending on my income level, or whether I even want to choose to participate in this frenzied form of life. They assume that I shall feel comfortable flitting from religion to religion, or from one philosophical influence to another without feeling any concern about how or why that should be either easy or possible. They often assume I might want to make hard-and-fast distinctions between high art and popular culture, that I might be okay with wide forms of sexual experimentation and that I have sufficiently secure a base (emotional, financial, material) to be able to make major life-choices.</p>
<p>Of course, part of the point of the books – rightly – is to encourage readers to see that they (we!) often have more chance for choice and for redirecting our lives than we acknowledge. But it remains true that owing to circumstances, whether or not in part chosen, some have more choices than others. Even so, these are books from and for a particular culture with which some churches will be familiar, be comfortable and inhabit. But it is not the culture of all (how could it be?) and does not pretend to be. Yet I wonder whether there is not a ‘hidden normativity’ here which is implying that this is the way it is best to be human in the West today.</p>
<p>Related to this is the broader question of what kind of community or communities the School of Life comes out of and/or is intended to create. The ‘movement’, if we may call it that, is clearly accepting its responsibility to institutionalize its insights. It is part educational establishment and part church. It has a ‘Faculty’ currently comprising 68 members.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040571X12471023">5</xref></sup> It offers events, including classes, special events and ‘Sunday sermons’ which are described as ‘strictly secular events which explore the values we should live by today’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040571X12471023">6</xref></sup> It is clear, though, that there is some ambiguity about how the movement is handling religion. Is ‘strictly secular’ meant to exclude religion altogether? If so, then why do so many of the writers find it helpful to refer to, and draw informatively and positively on, religious traditions in the six-book series? Perhaps, as a movement, it fits into the contemporary ‘spiritual but not religious’ camp. At the time of writing, one of the Faculty, former priest and now ‘author, teacher and journalist’ Mark Vernon, who has written a number of good books on God-related topics, is due to offer a special event on ‘Spirituality without God?’ Payment for such events, though, is from £15 to £20 a time. It is not free worship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040571X12471023">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Community, institution, structure are not, then, being ignored here. It is accepted that though we make choices as individuals we all need groups to relate to, to discover, explore, perhaps even ‘make’ or ‘construct’ the beliefs and values by which we live. We may not simply want to join up with people who agree with us (for we may not yet know whom to agree with), but we shall at least need enough similar-minded and like-cultured people with whom we can get on well enough to help us make some sensible decisions.</p>
<p>In religious perspective, of course, this may all seem rather too ideas-based. Or rather, in spite of the recognition of the importance of groups and institutions, the School of Life movement may be too preoccupied with ideas (as opposed to emotions and beliefs). Despite the fact that religion in the West – even if true mostly of Christianity in particular – has appeared rather too ideas-based itself, it is clear that it has functioned as much, if not more so, through its emotional pull and its capacity to be carried as a belief system by daily and weekly routines (religion is habit-forming) and by drama and spectacle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040571X12471023">8</xref></sup> Like many secular movements, the School of Life may be making the point that as soon as (post-Enlightenment) ideas are properly brought to the table, and religion is analysed carefully, we see how little it has functioned according to reason. A healthy dose of rationality now puts religion in its appropriate place, and we can get on with the business of deciding to live more sensibly, picking and choosing from religion what we want. We are back with de Botton’s <italic>Religion for Atheists</italic>. The practice of religion, despite its faults, suggests that things are not so simple. Ideas are not enough, for people of all classes, backgrounds, persuasions and intellects.</p>
<p>The School of Life will need to work hard in looking critically at whom it appeals to, whom it can realistically appeal to, and thus of the extent to which it can do anything like the job that religions continue to do. The culture-boundedness and socio-cultural limitations which affect all human groups naturally apply to the School of Life too. How will it avoid becoming a London-based philosophy club? How will it do justice to the fact that human beings (as the book series recognizes at so many points) are not just rational animals and do their meaning-making in relation to a great variety of human practices and forms of culture?</p>
<p>There are, then, two real surprises from this first batch of books. First, there is no real attempt to distil the ‘hidden normativity’ to which I referred earlier. Perhaps this is inevitable with respect to a collection of texts from a diverse range of authors, published in postmodern times. But there is more philosophical coherence and consistency than the authors might like to admit, born of the similar cultures out of, and for, which the authors write. I accept that it might not be the best use of time to produce a ‘School of Life Creed’. But there is something approaching it at work.</p>
<p>Second, I was surprised at how relatively little guidance there is on how to read culture and the arts. Chatfield comes closest to addressing the question, though more in order to stress the necessity of evaluating on what it is worth spending time. Given that popular culture (including sport) and the arts are the most prominent means through which people discover or construct meaning today, I would have expected more. (Where is the music?) Perhaps these volumes are yet to come. But it will be necessary to demonstrate how any philosophical construction occurs, and any ethical direction is found, in contemporary culture, and to show how it can be worked with in a variety of social and cultural contexts.</p>
<p>What theological conclusions or insights might be drawn from this practical philosophical experiment thus far? Using Ian Markham’s helpful term,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040571X12471023">9</xref></sup> theological responses to such a venture constitute an exercise in ‘overhearing’, creative eavesdropping on a bold and honest attempt to explore what a full, healthy human life might be like in the contemporary world. While not deriving from an explicitly theological source, the writers considered are not in fact – despite de Botton’s atheism and the avowed secularity – consistently hostile to religion. Perry notes Christian prayer as a form of the ‘focused attention’ she recognizes as essential to self-observation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040571X12471023">10</xref></sup> Flintoff appeals to an Authorized Version-speaking Jesus in reflecting on the appropriateness of humility in charitable-giving.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040571X12471023">11</xref></sup> Richard Holloway is acknowledged as a good guide to ethical thinking<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040571X12471023">12</xref></sup> and Karen Armstrong’s insights on compassion are praised.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040571X12471023">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Distillation of references to religion, or Christianity in particular, will not, though, deliver a closet or implied working theology. I suggest, nevertheless, that the overhearing creates a framework within which theological construction can recognize that its work now needs to be done. Vaughan S. Roberts and I have published a study of popular music, from which we distil the themes of body, connectedness, ritual and transcendence as major features of the practice of listening. From this we are able to move on to examine incarnation, ecclesiology and sacramentality as the discussion topics in need of exploration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040571X12471023">14</xref></sup> Is a similar exercise possible here? Can certain dominant themes be discerned in the concern of the School of Life authors which invite theological exploration, while not <italic>implying</italic> a theology in themselves, nor – in apologetic fashion – leading theological interpreters to conclude what theology <italic>must</italic> be like, or can <italic>only</italic> be like, in the present? I believe they can. Four features are clear and, not surprisingly, overlap in part with what is found from contemporary preoccupation with popular music.</p>
<p>First, ‘body’ is a dominant theme. It is obviously present in de Botton’s study of sex and is a concern throughout Armstrong’s explorations of money. For how many (or how few) possessions do we need to meet our bodily needs and enjoy life? But concerns about meeting the body’s pleasures surface in Chatfield’s exploration of digital technology: the damage which can be done to the body through the ease of gratification. Perhaps, in fact, as a second theme, the attention being paid throughout these studies to the inner life (dare we say the ‘spirit’?) indicates a recognition that body-consciousness, sorely needed as a corrective to much Christian history and influence (despite the doctrine of Incarnation), can go too far. In these days of ‘spirituality rather than religion’ we are perhaps seeing, from among the popular philosophers writing here, a clear call for the need to attend to whole human selves: bodies, yes, but spirits too.</p>
<p>Third, there is a concern for the ‘other.’ This happens in two ways: through recognition of how, while working on and with our individuality (Perry, Chatfield) and vocation (Krznaric), we are, of course, shaped by others; and through our making a difference to the world around us (Flintoff) – for others’ sake. There is certainly no clear sense of (metaphysical) ‘Otherness’ here. I am not saying that ‘what they really mean’ is that a concern for the other masks a theology of the Other. This would be to misrepresent. A theological take on what is being said here would need to add much more. But these works at least bear witness to a reluctance to succumb to individualism while wanting to reassert an appropriate individuality. Justice has to be done to what lies beyond the individual. Too much social networking can crush both the individual and the inner life. But acknowledging this must not, it is clear, lead to the triumph of the postmodern individualist. Forms of appropriate communal life do have to be found.</p>
<p>Fourth, there is a motif of action running through all of these works. We are encouraged to be active, to do something, be it for ourselves or for others. We are not to sit still. If it were not misplaced to read this too quickly in a theological key I might almost be tempted to say that we are being encouraged to save ourselves. We <italic>do</italic> have to act, and it is important what we decide to do. This is admirable. But this is where, I think, a significant gap becomes evident in the School of Life’s approach. If the encouragement to act, and be busy, however worthwhile, well-meaning and other-centred our actions may be, is not tempered by a greater acknowledgement than is present across these books of human frailty and frequent inability to choose what is good, then problems remain. Like many self-help books, the ‘go-getting’ element is strong. The writers are too thoughtful to suggest that living the good life (in the Aristotelian sense) really is easy. But they are prone to imply that activity, choice, opportunity are sometimes more ready at hand than is often the case. The sub-text of salvation which is here, though, must not be played down.</p>
<p>If it is true that the body, the inner life, concern for others and action are dominant themes in these works, then at the very least an agenda is set for contemporary Christian theology. In the context of such discussion, incarnation, Spirit/spirituality, the kingdom of God and soteriology all suggest themselves as important theological topics to be taken up. Unlike Tillich, I would not want to say that these topics offer ‘answers’ to the questions being posed by this slice of London culture. They are more the domains of enquiry into human thought and behaviour which are needed, for which theological input can usefully be provided. For Christians, it is essential input and will richly inform how these four contemporary themes are to be wrestled with. For others, Christian theology often has to fight to be heard in the cacophony of voices. But if Christian wisdom has a contribution to make – as it surely has – then it is worth speaking up, and the conversation is worth having. And, as a living discipline, Christian theology can express gratitude to Armstrong, Chatfield, de Botton, Flintoff, Krznaric and Perry for starting off the conversation about how to live today, and for posing the question what kind of <italic>School of Life</italic> might help us.</p>
