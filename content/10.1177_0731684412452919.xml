<abstract>
<p>Carbon nanotube reinforced, syntactic foams are processed and evaluated for compressive and dynamic mechanical properties. Vertically aligned nanotubes were first grown on the microballoons surface and added into the epoxy system. The weight percent of the nanotubes were varied from 0% to 0.8%. The properties of carbon nanotube reinforced syntactic foams are compared with neat syntactic foams that did not contain nanotubes. Results show improvement in compressive modulus and damping coefficient values by 35%–41% and 10%–104%, respectively. Compressive strength, elastic modulus and glass transition temperature remained largely unchanged for most compositions.</p>

<p>Syntactic foams are light weight particulate composite materials with hollow microparticle fillers that are bounded by a polymer matrix. Tailorability, strength-to-weight advantage and non-corrosive nature of these foams have increased their usage as core materials in sandwich composites for structural components in boats, ships and aircrafts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412452919">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412452919">2</xref></sup> Failure of syntactic foams mostly occurs through matrix rupture when they are used as core materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412452919">2</xref></sup> Short fiber reinforcement and toughening techniques in syntactic foams have been recently reported. For example, glass and aramid fiber bearing syntactic foams has been shown to exhibit higher compressive strength and modulus than their fiber free counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412452919">3</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412452919">5</xref></sup> Furthermore, the addition of short glass fibers significantly increased the flexural strength and modulus of syntactic foams.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412452919">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684412452919">7</xref></sup> The incorporation of carbon fibers in syntactic foams was also found to considerably increase the ultimate tensile strength and modulus of the foams.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684412452919">8</xref></sup> However, variations in the results are reported due to the non-uniformity of the fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684412452919">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684412452919">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412452919">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Characterization of dynamic mechanical properties of syntactic foams provides useful information for the development and quality control of aerospace and marine structural members that are often exposed to dynamic loading and vibration. However, research on dynamic mechanical behavior of fiber reinforced syntactic foams in the literature has been scant. Capela et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412452919">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684412452919">11</xref></sup> used dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) to study the viscous properties of glass fiber reinforced syntactic foams. It was found that storage modulus increased with glass fiber reinforcement content. However, the fiber reinforcement reduced the glass transition temperature of the syntactic foams. Wouterson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684412452919">8</xref></sup> and Ferreira et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684412452919">11</xref></sup> also used DMA to determine the effect of short carbon fiber content and length on the storage modulus, glass transition temperature and damping coefficient of syntactic foams. Important increment in the storage modulus and a significant reduction in the maximum damping coefficient were obtained with the short carbon fiber content. However, the variation of the short fiber content and length did not affect the glass transition temperature adversely.</p>
<p>Most studies on fiber reinforced syntactic foams, however, mainly focused on glass, aramid and carbon fibers. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), because of their small size and good mechanical properties, could be the best reinforcing fillers for syntactic foams if they disperse uniformly in polymeric composites. Researchers have explored several methods of dispersing CNTs in polymeric matrixes including optimum physical blending and chemical functionalization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684412452919">12</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684412452919">14</xref></sup> However, the results from these attempts have not produced significant improvements. In addition, most current mass-produced CNTs are physically agglomerated and difficult to separate them. Several reports have also revealed that the CNTs dispersion techniques implemented so far damage the nanostructures and therefore negatively affect their properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684412452919">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684412452919">15</xref></sup> The current study presents an innovative processing technique to incorporate CNTs in syntactic foams. In this process, vertically aligned CNT arrays were first grown on the surface of few microballoons using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The CNT array deposited microballoons (CNT-D-MBs) are then dispersed into plain microballoons (P-MBs) and added into epoxy to fabricate the syntactic foams. The mechanical properties of the fabricated syntactic foams are then evaluated using compressive test and DMA.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec4-0731684412452919"><title>Seed layer preparation</title>
<p>Cobalt (Co) seed layer was prepared on the surface of S22 glass microballoons using electroless deposition (ELD) technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412452919">16</xref></sup> The microballoons used for this experiment were obtained from 3M Corporation, USA. In a typical experiment, 5 g of microballoons were cleaned using acetone (Macron Chemicals, USA), isopropyl alcohol (Macron Chemicals, USA) and ethanol (Pharmco-AAPER and Commercial Alcohols, USA) and dispersed in 350 mL of ethanol. A vacuum assisted filtering scheme was used to separate the microballoons from each of the solvents. Surface functionalization was performed by adding approximately 0.7 mL of 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) (Alfa Aesar Chemicals, USA) into microballoon/ethanol suspension. The mixture was then stirred vigorously for 2 h at room temperature. The functionalized microballoons were transferred into 350 mL of ethanol containing 0.07 g of PdCl<sub>2</sub> (Strem Chemicals, Inc., USA). The solution was then stirred and allowed to react for 2 h at ambient conditions in order to adsorb Pd(II) species onto the APTMS functionalized microballoons. The activated microballoons were later cleaned repeatedly with ethanol and distilled water. These were added into 210 mL of deionized water for mixing with the ELD bath.</p>
<p>The electroless bath was prepared by dissolving CoCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O (2.1 g) (Acros Organics, USA), NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O (0.697 g) (Alfa Aesar, Inc.), Na<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O (3.5 g) (Mallinckrodt Chemicals, Inc.) and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (3.48 g) (Alfa Aesar, Inc.) into 70 mL of distilled water. The pH of this solution was adjusted to approximately 8.30 by adding sufficient amount of NH<sub>3</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O (BDH Aristar, USA) at room temperature. The electroless bath was then added into the aqueous microballoon dispersion. The solution was stirred vigorously and allowed to remain at 90°C for about 15 min. After washing with distilled water and ethanol, the Co coated microballoons were separated and dried at room temperature.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0731684412452919"><title>Growth of CNTs</title>
<p>The CVD reactor used to grow CNT arrays consists of two different heating zones as described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412452919">17</xref></sup> The temperatures of the first and the second heating zones were maintained at 850°C and 600°C, respectively. Approximately 0.04 g of Co coated microballoons was spread on an area of 50 cm<sup>2</sup> silicon wafer. Two such wafers containing Co coated microballoons were kept in the second heating zone of the furnace. Then, the CVD reactor was heated while maintaining an inert atmosphere by flowing 80 sccm of argon (Ar). Prior to CNT growth, the Co coated microballoon were pretreated using NH<sub>3</sub> gas with a flow rate of 100 sccm for 5 min. The growth was achieved by introducing a mixture of 10 sccm C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2,</sub> 75 sccm Ar through a flask containing distilled water at room temperature and 50 sccm H<sub>2</sub> for 40 min.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0731684412452919"><title>Fabrication of syntactic foams</title>
<p>The matrix used for fabrication of the syntactic foams was bisphenol A diglycidyl (D.E.R. 332) epoxy resin. Triethylenetetraamine (D.E.H. 24) was used as a hardener. Both the epoxy and the hardener were obtained from DOW Chemical Company. The epoxy resin has very high viscosity (around 4000 cps) at room temperature. In order to lessen the difficulty of mixing the constituents at such high viscosity and reduce air entrapment, C<sub>12</sub>–C<sub>14</sub> aliphaticglycidylether diluents (CVC Specialty Chemicals) was added in 5% by volume. In order to fabricate syntactic foams, the CNT-D-MBs were first combined with P-MBs to form homogeneous CNT-D-MBs/P-MBs mixture. Four different CNT-D-MBs/P-MBs mixtures were prepared to fabricate syntactic foams with different CNT content. Once the CNT-D-MBs/P-MBs mixture was dispersed in the resin, the constituents were stirred for about 20 min. The slurry then casted in molds prepared from Dow corning 3120 RTV silicon rubber. The specimen dimensions for compression and DMA tests were 25.5 × 25.5 × 12.5 mm and 40 × 12.5 × 1.5 mm, respectively. Neat syntactic foam samples that did not contain CNT were also fabricated for comparison. The volume fraction of the microballoon in all composites was maintained at 35%. The samples were cured for 24 h at room temperature and post-cured at 100°C for 3 h. The material compositions and densities for all types of syntactic foams are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412452919">Table 1</xref>. The density of CNT was considered as 1.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup> according to Kim et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684412452919">18</xref></sup> for porosity calculation.

<p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (FEI Quanta 3D FEG Dual Beam FIB/SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Kratos AXIS 165 XPS/SAM) were used to analyze the cobalt coating. The CNT growth and the CNT-D-MBs/P-MBs mixtures were also characterized using SEM. Microtomed thin sections from CNT containing syntactic foams were observed using transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEOL 100CX TEM) to investigate the CNT dispersion.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0731684412452919"><title>Mechanical testing</title>
<p>Compression and dynamic mechanical tests were conducted on five samples from each set of fabricated specimens. The compression test was carried out according to ASTM D695-91 using QTEST 150 universal testing equipment at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. The samples were compressed until about 60% of their initial height. In order to determine the dynamic mechanical properties of the foams, dynamic temperature step tests were performed using Rheometric Solids Analyser (RSA III) (Rheometric Scientific, Inc., USA.). The samples were heated from 25°C to 200°C at a strain of 0.4%. The tests were performed in tension mode and with a gap length of 25 mm. The samples were subjected to an oscillatory strain at a frequency of 1 Hz.</p></sec></sec>

<p>Silica surface has a strong affinity towards moisture and hence contain -OH groups sticking out of it. Therefore, organo-functional silanes, such as APTMS, can be adsorbed strongly on these surface hydroxyls via strong bonds of Si-O-Si and forms homogeneous ultrathin SAMs (-Si-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>-NH<sub>2</sub>) on the surface with terminated amine groups outward. On the other hand, Pd(II) has been reported to chemically bind to ligands containing nitrogen, phosphorous and sulfur donor atoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684412452919">19</xref></sup> Therefore, the amine groups obtained after the functionalization process are important surface modifiers, which later used to covalently bind palladium Pd(II) on the surface of glass microballoons during the activation processes. When the Pd activated glass microballoons were transferred to the electroless Co deposition bath, the Pd(II) species reduced to Pd by the H<sub>2</sub>PŌ<sub>2</sub> in the bath and the coating initiates. XPS analysis was carried out to detect the presence of Co on the microballoons after the ELD process. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412452919">Figure 1(a)</xref> exhibits the XPS spectra of Co 2p. The existence of Co 2p<sub>3/2</sub> and Co 2p<sub>1/2</sub> at 778.1eV and 793.1eV indicate the presence of Co<sup>2+</sup> species in the oxide state. SEM image of Co coated microballoon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412452919">Figure 1(b)</xref> depicts fine dispersion of nanocrystaline Co particles on the surface of the microballoon. The figure shows that the treatment of APTMS functionalized microballoons with a Pd(II)-based activation solution results in the deposition of Co particles in the size range from 30 to 110 nm.

<p>The Co particles were used to grow vertically aligned CNT arrays on the microballoons surface. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412452919">Figure 2(a)</xref>, CNT arrays are grown on the surface of all microballoons. They are oriented perpendicular to the microballoon surface. Smaller size microballoons have a flower like structure with few mats of CNT arrays. The CNTs in each arrays is in good alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412452919">Figure 2(b)</xref>). The CNTs in the arrays have uniform diameters of 35 nm and length of about 20 µm. It is clear that the quantity of the CNT arrays is proportional to the surface area of the substrate. Due to their spherical shape, microballoons provide high surface area to deposit more CNT arrays than a flat surface. Therefore, the weight of CNTs required to reinforce the whole syntactic foams can be deposited on only few microballoons. This is very important in reducing the cost for large scale composite processing.

<p>The CNT-D-MBs and P-MBs were mixed by vigorously shaking them in a closed container before they were added into the epoxy. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412452919">Figure 3(a)</xref> to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412452919">d</xref>) show different CNT-D-MBs/P-MBs mixtures prepared to fabricate syntactic foam samples containing CNTs. CNT-D-MBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412452919">Figure 3(e)</xref>) and P-MBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412452919">Figure 3(f)</xref>) are also depicted for comparison. Even though each mixes contain very few CNT-D-MBs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412452919">Table 1</xref>), they exhibit significant color difference as compared to the P-MBs. This is due to the homogeneous distribution of CNT-D-MBs in the plain ones. Moreover, SEM investigation of the CNT-D-MBs/P-MBs mixtures revealed the presence of CNTs on P-MBs, blurring their white color. A typical SEM observation of the presence of CNTs on P-MBs is portrayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412452919">Figure 4(a)</xref>. CNT-D-MBs are also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412452919">Figure 4(b)</xref> after they are combined with the P-MBs. In some of CNT-D-MBs, a portion of CNTs is detached leaving an empty space on the radial CNT array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412452919">Figure 4(b)</xref>). Nevertheless, the CNT arrays have remained intact on most CNT-D-MBs.

<p>The CNT-D-MBs/P-MBs mixtures were then added into epoxy system and stirred using a rigid plastic rod to fabricate CNT reinforced syntactic foams (CNT-syntactic foams). It was apparent that some of the CNTs seen on the P-MBs could easily be transferred into the matrix during the stirring process. For the case of CNT-D-MBs, the alignment is believed to facilitate the separation of individual CNTs from the array as they come in contact with the epoxy. This is assumed to take place as a result of shear forces developed during the stirring process, as the resin may not wet individual CNTs in the array due to the dense growth. TEM analysis was performed in order to validate this assumption. The TEM revealed that all the fabricated syntactic foams had regions with dense CNT distribution in the matrix as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412452919">Figure 5(a)</xref> to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412452919">d</xref>). There was no significant variation in the density of distribution in these areas. It was observed that the CNTs got detached from the microballoons and moved around without forming aggregates. Therefore, growing the CNTs on the microballoons is a promising method to avoid CNT cluster formation. However, it is worth to point out that the presence of the dense CNT regions in the matrix also indicated the inefficiency of the stirring process that resulted in an uneven distribution of CNTs after they got detached from the microballoons.

<sec id="sec11-0731684412452919"><title>Test results</title>
<p>All of the syntactic foam samples were tested to study their compressive and dynamic mechanical properties. The compression test results for CNT-syntactic foam samples were compared with that of neat syntactic foam. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412452919">Figure 6(a)</xref> shows representative compressive stress-strain curves for the syntactic foams. All foams demonstrate a linear-elastic behavior at the beginning. Yield stress occurs at the end of the linear region and the stress becomes nearly constant with increasing strain. This plateau region is due to the crushing of microballoons. The stress increases again at the end of the plateau region indicating consolidation. A major outcome of these tests is that all CNT-syntactic foams have higher modulus as compared to the neat syntactic foam. However, variation of CNT loading does not affect the modulus significantly. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412452919">Figure 6(b)</xref> presents comparison of the average values of compressive modulus and yield strength of different syntactic foam samples obtained from five tests. The error bars in the figure represent one standard deviation on either side of the mean. The compressive modulus for SF-0.2, SF-0.4, SF-0.6 and SF-0.8 has increased by 35.8%, 36.4%, 38.8% and 41.1%, respectively, compared to the neat syntactic foams. This can be explained by the matrix toughening effect of the CNTs in syntactic foams with higher matrix content. It is worth to mention again that the volume fraction of the matrix is 0.65. CNT addition, however, did not alter the compressive strength of the foams considerably. This is attributable to the crushing of microballoons that leads to the failure of the composite at about only 8%–10% of strain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684412452919">20</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684412452919">22</xref></sup>

<p>The representative storage modulus curves of the composites are plotted against temperature in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412452919">Figure 7(a)</xref>. Storage modulus is a measure of the ability of a material to absorb energy elastically. The storage modulus plots of the CNT-syntactic foams and neat syntactic foams presented in the figure shows a similar trend. Initially, the storage modulus decreases gradually with an increase in temperature, followed by a sharp drop. A comparison of the average storage modulus (E’) of five tests at 25°C for all samples is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412452919">Figure 7(b)</xref>. The excellent repeatability of the test is represented by the error bars, which signify the narrow standard deviation from the mean. As shown in the figure, the storage modulus of CNT-syntactic foams is slightly higher as compared to the neat foams. The enhancement in storage modulus is the highest (9.5%) for SF-0.4 syntactic foams. An increase in the weight fraction of CNTs beyond 0.4 tends to decrease the storage modulus as noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412452919">Figure 7(b)</xref>. This is due to the non-homogeneous dispersion of the additional CNTs that facilitated easier molecular polymer chain movements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684412452919">23</xref></sup> This could be improved by optimized blending technique. Another reason could be due to the void content in the samples. This can be observed from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412452919">Table 1</xref>. High CNT loading leads to higher porosity, which also contributes to the decrease in the storage modulus.

<p>Typical damping coefficient (Tan δ) curves of the neat and CNT-syntactic foams are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412452919">Figure 8(a)</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412452919">Figure 8(b)</xref> compares average values of Tan δ at room temperature and the glass transition temperatures (T<sub>g</sub>) of the different syntactic foam specimen. Error bars shown in the figure are based on standard deviation of five tests. A relatively large increase in Tan δ was observed for all CNT-syntactic foams as compared to the neat foams. In particular, the overall increase for SF-0.8 syntactic foam is 104%. However, addition of CNTs did not affect the glass transition temperature considerably. Only a 3°C shift in T<sub>g</sub> as compared to the neat syntactic foam was observed for samples with 0.4 wt.% and higher CNT loading. Previous works have also showed that the presence of carbon nanofillers has not significantly affected the curing chemistry of the composite system and hence has not altered the T<sub>g</sub> considerably.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684412452919">24</xref></sup>

<p>The effect of CNTs on the compressive and dynamic mechanical properties of syntactic foams is experimentally characterized. Vertically aligned CNTs were first grown on the surface of few microballoons and mixed with plain microballoons. The mixture is then added into the matrix to fabricate syntactic foam samples with varying CNT content, 0 to 0.8 wt.%. TEM observations of the samples indicate the method used to incorporate the CNTs is promising under optimized blending technique. The results show that the compressive modulus and damping coefficient are enhanced by the presence of nanotubes. The strength, however, is not changed noticeably due to the influence of microballoon crushing. The storage modulus and the glass transition temperature are only marginally affected.</p></sec>
