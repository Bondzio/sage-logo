<body>
<p>The Baby-Friendly Initiative, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the World Health Organization all recommend that all new mothers be taught to hand express, even when no problems are anticipated. Why is it that hand expression, a no-cost, no-risk technique, has been so underused, even in mothers who, for clinical reasons, need to begin expression on day 1? Why is the seemingly preferred expression technique on a maternity unit a hospital-grade pump?</p>
<p>In many medical arenas, there has been a drift away from bedside, hands-on assessment and care toward reliance on technological devices. When an expensive pump is wheeled into the room, a new mother would assume this is the state-of-the-art technology. Often, the most available maternity care provider is inexperienced and uncomfortable teaching techniques that involve touching the breast. Odd, since the same staff member may feel perfectly comfortable with obstetrical examination.</p>
<p>Breast pumps have been essential in numerous circumstances, especially those that involve maternal-infant separation. But when expression is medically indicated in the first several postpartum days, are we over-reliant on breast pumps? Is there an advantage to teaching hand expression rather than, or in addition to, providing an electrical pump?</p>
<p>Since the advent of electrical pumps, research on the mechanics of milk removal (primarily supported by the pump industry) has downplayed the contribution of the letdown reflex and the “milking action” or pressure of the infant’s mouth and upgraded the importance of suction, even describing the pump as mimicking the human infant during breastfeeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412444930">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>It would be easy to dismiss the antiquated findings of a 1933 study in which researchers compared the volume and fat content of milk expressed manually (“digital” extraction) to pump-expressed milk in 51 term mothers. “The volumes after extraction by pump are considerably smaller than those taken by hand,” reported the researchers from the London School of Medicine for Women. Recognizing that fat increases with emptying, they demonstrated “the larger the element of suction in the act of extraction, the smaller the ultimate rise in the fat percentage.” “It would appear that pressure [vs suction] is the important factor in the production of a high percentage of fat,” the researchers conclude.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334412444930">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Certainly pump technology has improved dramatically since then, but are these findings still relevant? Several recent studies suggest that reliance on pump suction alone may actually compromise breastfeeding outcomes, future milk production potential, as well as the caloric value of milk. The first 2 studies examine head-to-head the use of hand expression versus hospital-grade electric pumps in the first several postpartum days. Sixty-eight mothers of term newborns 12-36 hours old who were poorly latching or sucking were randomly assigned to either pump or hand expresssion. At 2 months, 96% of the hand-expression group versus 73% of pumping group was breastfeeding (<italic>P</italic> = .02).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412444930">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the second prospective, sequential crossover study, mothers separated from their infants in the first 48 hours were taught to alternate hand expression with state-of-the-art hospital pumps, expressing every 3 hours. Manual expression yielded significantly more milk at each session. The median yield per woman per session was 2 mL by manual and 0.6 mL by pump expression (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334412444930">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>My own research and experience support these conclusions. On the first postpartum day, 67 mothers of VLBW infants were taught both hand expression and how to use the hospital pump. We found that the influence of hand expression in the first 3 days was independent of pumping frequency and affected production up to week 8. Mothers who hand expressed frequently (&gt; 5 times/d) in the first 3 postpartum days had the highest volumes and expressed 780 mL/d by week 2 and 955 mL/d by week 8.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334412444930">5</xref></sup> Additionally, once mature milk increased, mothers were taught how to use “hands-on pumping” (pumping while using breast massage, compression, stripping and, if needed, hand expression). By doing so, the fat content of their milk (62.5 g/L) was near double the reported norms (25–45 g/L), and the caloric value of their milk averaged 892.7 kcal/L (26.4 kcal/oz).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334412444930">6</xref></sup> Suction alone may be less effective in removing viscous colostrum and fat-rich milk (harkening back to the 1933 conclusions). Reliance solely on pump suction might compromise both production and composition.</p>
<p>Consistent with these findings, the most recent Cochrane review concludes, “The most suitable method for milk expression may depend on the time since birth, purpose of expression and the individual mother and infant. Low cost interventions including early initiation [of expression] when not feeding at the breast, relaxation, hand expression and lower cost pumps may be as effective, or more effective, than large electric pumps for some outcomes.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334412444930">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Personally, I would suggest there are other “soft,” unquantifiable benefits of teaching “hands-on” techniques. The healing effect of touch has long been recognized as an integral and powerful component in the clinician-patient relationship. For some mothers, teaching them to use their hands for breast care may give them needed “permission,” comfort, and encouragement to vigilantly monitor for areas of fullness or soreness. Although breast pumps are a critical tool in lactation management for many mothers, I would favor more selectivity in recommending pumps and consistently offering instruction on the value of combining pumping with manual techniques (hand expression of colostrum and hands-on pumping of mature milk). There are step-by-step instructional videos available on the Stanford Web site demonstrating these techniques (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://newborns.stanford.edu/Breastfeeding/HandExpression.html">http://newborns.stanford.edu/Breastfeeding/HandExpression.html</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://newborns.stanford.edu/Breastfeeding/MaxProduction.html">http://newborns.stanford.edu/Breastfeeding/MaxProduction.html</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Breastfeeding management may be an arena of care we should protect from the drift toward over-reliance on mechanical interventions. Ultimately, IBCLCs are in the best position to match pumps to mothers and to assess the effectiveness of pumping techniques in various clinical scenarios, ideally in controlled studies.</p>
