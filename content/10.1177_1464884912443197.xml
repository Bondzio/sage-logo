<abstract>
<p>While television criticism is very popular with readers of newspapers, it has attracted little academic interest, whether as a form of journalistic practice or as part of a critical-public discourse on television. One of the most influential articles on television criticism was published by Mike Poole in 1984, in which he lambasted much of the existing television criticism for approaching television from within a literary-based paradigm, one which he thought was unsuitable for such a medium. Since this article was published, apart from a few articles and chapters, there has been little further attempt to analyse television criticism in the British press in any depth. In this article I argue that, at a time of dramatic changes occurring in the newspapers and television industries, there is a need to develop a better understanding of the form and role of television criticism.</p>

<title>Introduction: Television criticism at a time of change</title>
<p>The TV critic has, for many years, provided some of the most popular columns for newspapers and magazines. While some reflect critically on the television industry, most, in a similar way to other media-based critics, provide reviews, writing about the programme after its screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912443197">Ellis, 2008</xref>: 244–245). However, as television has changed as more channels have come on stream, this reviewing function of critics is being replaced or supplemented by one offering more previews. Such previews help locate and signal to the reader what programmes are on and worth watching rather than reflecting on a programme that has been shown. The nature of the TV critic is therefore being redefined as the media environment goes through a dramatic metamorphosis. Indeed, some have suggested that the media-based critic is disappearing and being replaced by the public publishing their own views online. I argue in this article that, at this moment of change, it is a good time to reflect on the changing role of the critic, to re-evaluate the existing academic work in the field and to refocus our attention on this particular form of popular journalism that has been such an important draw for all newspapers.</p>
<p>The number of scholarly articles and books published on television criticism runs into thousands. It would seem that television is an extremely active area of study and research. However, if one focuses on work written specifically about applied or public-criticism (Connors cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884912443197">Himmelstein, 1981</xref>: 21–22), coverage about television appearing in the media, there is very little. Indeed, it could be argued that over the last 30 years only a handful of important scholarly articles and books have appeared which engage solely with such an activity. One of the most notable is by Mike Poole, published in 1984, which criticises the form of applied criticism that had, until then, developed in the British press. Poole’s article has since become a much-cited article by those few scholars focusing on media-based forms of television criticism. Indeed, with the lack of any later in-depth work on applied criticism one might think that this article offers the last word on the topic. Few, it would seem, have been interested in interrogating Poole’s claims or views further or in developing the study of British television criticism at any length. While revisited by Poole in a short <italic>Guardian</italic> article in 1994, this work has not been updated for over three decades, a period when the broadcasting and newspaper industries, and the media coverage of television, have changed immeasurably.</p>
<p>Therefore, at a time of huge change in the media when some, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884912443197">Ronan McDonald (2007)</xref>, have wondered if the role of the media-based critic is in decline, I present an argument for a re-evaluation of the role and work of the TV critic. I begin by exploring and critiquing the seminal work of Mike Poole, identifying some of the key concerns and issues he and others writing at the same time, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884912443197">Colin McArthur (1980)</xref>, made in relation to television criticism appearing in the press. Whilst his work must be accepted as a product of its time, one which engages with the then current debates and views of the cultural elites and academics to television and the role of the media critic, it does help to set out some of the important questions that still need to be raised and explored to allow a re-evaluation to occur. I follow this critique by looking at how the two related industries, television and the press, entered a period of dramatic change from the 1980s leading to the development of new forms of press coverage. As Poole agues, television criticism is a historically variable discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912443197">1984</xref>: 42), it changes and develops over time, and this needs to be taken account of if we are to understand the form and role it has and is taking. I then move on to explore some of the limited academic work that has appeared over the last couple of decades since Poole’s original article. As I show, some of this work builds on Poole’s initial work, helping to extend his original line of enquiry, though almost all the authors fail to adequately analyse or engage with such coverage in any depth. To help provide something of an antidote to this I then turn to explore some examples of the kind of television criticism that has appeared in the British press since the 1970s, illustrating why a more in-depth analysis is required to understand this important form of popular journalism. I end by looking at how, with the rise of the web, the position and role of the media critic is being threatened or, perhaps, complemented by the rise of new types of public critic. The aim of this short article is not to present a coherent approach to studying television criticism but to argue the need for a greater understanding of this form of newspaper-based writing and to start to suggest some possible approaches.</p>

<title>Reviewing Poole</title>
<p>One of the first notable attempts to assess the work of British television criticism occurred in 1984 when the British Film Institute (BFI) organised two lunchtime discussions at the National Film Theatre (NFT) under the banner ‘Television Criticism: Who Needs It?’. At each of these sessions a paper was presented, one of which was published prior to the debate and the other afterwards in different issues of <italic>Screen</italic>. The paper by Mike Poole, ‘The cult of the generalist: British television criticism, 1936–83’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912443197">1984</xref>: 41–61), which explored the role and work of television critics working for the British press, has now become one of the few regularly cited articles in reference to applied criticism. The other paper, by John Caughie, called ‘The function of television criticism’, was published in an altered form after the event, where it was retitled: ‘Television criticism: “A discourse in search of an object”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884912443197">1984</xref>: 109–121). The main focus of this article related to the perceived failings of academic critics in relation to the study of television. For Poole, the discussions raised in the two articles were linked, as one of the reasons why an appropriate form of public or applied criticism had not developed in the press was the lack of a suitable supporting academic approach to television (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884912443197">1994</xref>: 12).</p>
<p>In his article, Poole argued that media-based television criticism had failed to develop into a suitable form as it fell under the sway of a number of interests. Indeed, he saw it in terms of a discursive site where a number of discourses intersect, including those of television, journalism and a powerful literary or critical tradition which, in many ways, over-determined the form it took (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912443197">1984</xref>: 49). He argued that the TV critic is employed by the newspaper and is, therefore, a specialised journalist with a primary role to provide engaging copy for the reader, with only a secondary role to deliver a critical insight into television. But, at the same time, the media critic is also in a close relationship with the television industry. Such an industry seeks to use the critic to speak for them, in what Poole calls ‘promotional ventriloquy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912443197">1984</xref>: 49–52): it tries to use critics to promote their programmes, to write about television in a way that suits them. This they do by selecting which programmes critics get access to at previews, restricting access to their staff and using their promotional material to try to shape what is written (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912443197">1984</xref>: 49–52). As Poole argued, the critic is under a double institutional hegemony of the print and electronic media. The problems of developing an appropriate approach were not helped as many early TV critics, seeking both critical and journalistic acceptance, looked towards existing forms of reviewing art, music, literature and theatre which focused on the text in an often impressionistic way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884912443197">Rixon, 2011</xref>: 77–78). Because of this, in Poole’s eyes, television criticism developed as a form of criticism that was, very much, unsure of what it was writing about, how and for whom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912443197">1984</xref>: 47).</p>
<p>One of the main problems for Poole is that a critical support community, which developed in relation to theatre and literature criticism, did not emerge alongside television. Developing this argument, he looks at how critical interest in film and media developed in the secondary and tertiary education sectors. He argues that film studies, which pre-dated media and television studies, should have taken on an early role of supporting applied television critics. However, instead of providing this support it became caught up in its own struggle to define itself and developed an approach and language which were not, in the end, easily transferable to a journalistic form of television criticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912443197">1984</xref>: 47). He also notes that much of the focus of film studies at this time was on the text and questions of meaning and ideology, rather than on materialistic concerns, which should be at the heart of a well-equipped form of television criticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912443197">1984</xref>: 47). Such film theory ‘was simply not equipped to deal with the specificity of British television’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912443197">1984</xref>: 48). The limited academic work on television that had appeared around this time had been dominated by more institutional, audience and production-based studies (such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884912443197">Morely and Brunsdon’s 1978</xref> work on <italic>Nationwide</italic>), often fixated on questions of ideology and political values, rather than focusing more on television in terms of programmes, schedules and as an industry. For Poole, the critical support required for the proper development of applied television criticism was not forthcoming and there was little useful contact between the two different types of critics, those in education and those working for the media. For these reasons, in his eyes, an inadequate form of applied television criticism appeared in the British press. In many ways his article must be viewed as a call to arms, to encourage both TV critics and academics to engage in a debate to allow a more appropriate form of television criticism to appear.</p>

<title>All change: Television criticism as a variable discourse</title>
<p>While television and the press have always been in a state of change, it would seem that since the early 1980s they have been experiencing a period of intense and dramatic development. For many, the days of the old duopoly, of ITV and the BBC which had been joined by the launch of C4 in 1982, were now numbered. Satellite and cable were on the horizon and, within a decade, the number of channels available had increased substantially. For some this signalled the start of an era of abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884912443197">O’Malley, 2003</xref>: 59–62). Equally, the press was going through a period of upheaval as, literally and metaphorically, newspapers, in wake of the Wapping dispute, left the old Fleet Street behind and relocated their headquarters whilst implementing a range of radical working practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884912443197">Williams, 2010</xref>: 213–217). With such developments in both the press and broadcasting, the form of television coverage began to change – in terms of the amount and also in terms of the form.</p>
<p>As newspapers entered a period of intense competition they began to change the way they covered television. From the 1980s there was a shift of television reviews from the arts pages to the leisure sections in the more quality papers – symptomatic for Poole of the longstanding derogatory view of television held by the cultural elites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912443197">1984</xref>: 41). Newspapers also sought to exploit the popularity of their television coverage by employing non-specialists and columnists as television critics, driven by a wish to create entertaining copy to attract readers rather than to support the development of a more critical approach to television, an argument Poole develops further in his short 1994 <italic>Guardian</italic> article. Part of this development led to many reviewers writing in a more subjective form, focusing as much on themselves as the object of the column, which is not unique to television criticism. As Julian Petley comments, newspapers have for some time replaced hard-hitting news with often trivial scribbling about the day in the life of the columnist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884912443197">1997</xref>: 254).</p>
<p>While newspapers began to change their coverage of television, broadcasters too began to develop a new relationship with the press. For the first couple of decades broadcasters had been fairly happy with the limited amount of television coverage which appeared in the newspapers, and mostly advertised their programmes by trailers on their own channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912443197">Ellis, 2008</xref>: 247). However, from the end of the 1970s, as the broadcasting environment became more competitive, producers and broadcasters began to use the newly developed VHS technology to provide preview tapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912443197">2008</xref>: 247–249). Broadcasters from this time became more active in trying to shape the marketing and framing of their programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912443197">2008</xref>: 249–250). Newspapers, keen to exploit their role as providers of important information about what was on began to use these tapes to provide more previews. Previews, it might be argued, were becoming more relevant to readers in the new multichannel environment. Indeed, for Poole, ‘[t]elevision criticism of the future will be more likely in form to resemble a film review than a match report’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912443197">1984</xref>: 42). Alongside such developments, publications like <italic>Time Out</italic> fought to have access to full weekly television listings information. By the early 1990s, with the weakening of the BBC and ITV’s hold on such information, many newspapers began to offer weekly television guides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912443197">Ellis, 2008</xref>: 247–249). The role of critics, as supposedly offering an independent review of television’s output, was under increased pressure as their role as important marketing tools for broadcasters and popular attractions for newspapers became more central to both industries. In many ways the relationship between the two industries could be viewed as symbiotic, with both needing the other in varying ways, and with the TV critic playing a pivotal role.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1464884912443197">
<title>New work on television criticism</title>
<p>Over time, as the disciplines of journalism and television studies developed, so more sophisticated and nuanced ways of approaching the study of these popular mediums developed, including some work appearing on the study of TV criticism. In this section I explore some of the work that has appeared since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912443197">Poole’s 1984</xref> article, work that has presented different ways of conceptualising the role of television critics and which has started to historicise the development of television criticism in relation to the press and broadcasting industries. While many of these new critical approaches to television criticism have developed the debate beyond Poole’s original polemic, they too have their own shortcomings, weaknesses and limitations, which will need to be rectified if we are to be able to fully re-evaluate television criticism and the role of television critics.</p>
<p>John Fiske, writing in <italic>Television Culture</italic>, has argued that critics are part of a struggle over the narrative image of media artefacts, which can include television. This he conceptualises in terms of an axis where critics lie at one end and the marketing departments of broadcasters and producers lie at the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884912443197">1994</xref>: 118–119). Fiske’s axis, in a similar way to Poole’s view of critics under the sway of powerful industrial and cultural discourses, provides an analytical view of the role of critics and their criticism in the way the public understand, make sense of and value television and its programmes. Such a view suggests that a discursive struggle occurs over how programmes, or media products, are received and understood – a struggle over the media image. In such interactions the critics, with their regular media reviews and columns, play an important role in what is written in the public arena about television. Fiske’s work, however, while signalling the existence of the television critics and highlighting their role in shaping the narrative image of a programme, fails to focus on the critics in their own right, tending to conflate them with other actors and contextual forces. In this way Fiske views the critic as one of many actors involved in this struggle over meaning and provides little focused analysis on their specific role. Also, less is said in such work about the form taken, the style of criticism and questions of value and quality that underlie the work of journalists and critics.</p>
<p>Phil Wickham has also included a section in his book, <italic>Understanding Television Texts</italic>, on the role of television critics and criticism. In a similar way to Fiske, he explores the critical-public discourse that exists around television and its outputs. Arguing that, ‘we don’t just evaluate texts in a vacuum.… [w]e are surrounded by other people’s opinions that may challenge or endorse our own feelings about a programme’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884912443197">2007</xref>: 81). Wickham identifies the critic as playing an important role in how the public understands television, helping to frame the programmes and the nature of television for the viewer, but, in a similar way to Fiske, he presents little in-depth analysis of the work of the critics. The writings and reflections of critics are seen as important to our perception of television rather than as a form of journalism worthy in itself of analysis.</p>
<p>Other work has appeared which has taken a more historical approach to the development of television criticism. However, these have been few in number and often lacking in detail, in many ways taking on the idea of Poole’s that television criticism is an historically variable discourse, one that changes over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912443197">1984</xref>: 42). Such work includes a recent short chapter by John Ellis, which focuses on the way television criticism has changed over time and the complex relationship it has to developments in the press and broadcast media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912443197">2008</xref>: 174–182). For example, he explores the attempts of <italic>Time Out</italic> to provide weekly schedules against the resistance of the broadcasters who, traditionally, owned the copyright for such information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912443197">2008</xref>: 247–249); and notes how, as more channels came on stream, television coverage moved increasingly from reviews to previews, leading to a change in how the television industry markets their programmes and schedules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912443197">2008</xref>: 249–251). However, as with other work cited above, there is little space to really develop his argument or to explore examples in much depth. Ellis ends up by reducing the 80 or so years of history of British television criticism to eight pages with little in-depth analysis of the actual work by the critics.</p>
<p>Outside of these moments of limited critical engagement with applied television criticism, academics working in the area of television have often used such reviews more or less unproblematically as an indicator of the public opinion or critical reception of programmes at a particular moment in time. For example, many articles and books exploring the development and reception of programmes, series and television genres use the work of media critics to provide some historical contextualisation, which, for Thumim, helps to ‘reveal much about the assumptions of the time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884912443197">2004</xref>: 2). Asa Briggs uses examples of television critic’s columns to gauge the public feeling in the 1950s and 1960s about increasing numbers of American programmes appearing on Independent Television (ITV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884912443197">1995</xref>: 13). Or, in a more contemporary example, Janet McCabe refers to programme reviews as she explores the way <italic>ER</italic> was received at the time of its initial screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912443197">2005</xref>: 207). As McCabe comments, ‘… reviewers still expressed concerns that new viewers would find its frenetic pace and dense plotting an unnerving experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912443197">2005</xref>: 2–7). Such works use television reviews to understand the reception of a programme or series rather than exploring, critically, the role and work of critics. There seems to be some acceptance of the critic working as part of a wider critical-public debate about television, as Wickham argues, but with little interest in exploring this further or analysing the work of critics as a cultural form in its own right.</p>
<p>From this overview it is obvious that little in-depth work on the area has been published; what has developed has mostly been at the conceptual level with only a limited analysis of the work of critics – one exception to this being the recently published book <italic>TV Critics and Popular Culture</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884912443197">Rixon, 2011</xref>). This work explores historically the development of television criticism in British newspapers, analysing its underlying values, style and form and how these relate to developments in the press and broadcasting industries. A possible reason for this limited critical interest in critics and television criticism is that, for many working in television studies, critics are specialised journalists, and while the object of their reviews and critiques is television they nevertheless work for the press. In view of this, some might argue that such writing and criticism is a form of journalistic practice and should therefore be studied as a form of journalism. For example, John Ellis’s recent chapter on television critics was published in a book which focused on analysing print journalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912443197">2008</xref>: 174–182). However, the problem here is that television critics are not ‘straightforward’ journalists. While they might share some practices with the profession, and write for the public, they are also critics, using particular critical frameworks to write about and evaluate television. In their turn, those working in journalism have tended to mostly ignore this form of writing, viewing it as a discourse relating more to television than journalism, and therefore being of more interest to those working in media, cultural or television studies. Another reason why media academics have been less than interested in a detailed study of television critics could relate to such critics’ populist evaluative approach which does not sit well with the more critical objective stance of scholarly work. Where television criticism is written about, it is often treated as part of a wider secondary text, and any detailed analysis is limited as it becomes conflated with many other actors and voices at work in this environment. In this way, one might ask, what critical insight does a newspaper-based critic provide that helps in our understanding of television? Or, does their work not tell us more about the state of journalism or the marketing abilities of broadcasters?</p>

<title>Television criticism: A form worthy of study</title>
<p>Poole in his 1984 article was not only critical of the overly textual focus of the television critics but was wary of the dominant style. Indeed, for Poole, the nadir of television criticism was signalled with the appearance of critics like Clive James in the 1970s, whose witty form of criticism soon came to dominate. Those writing in this way used a humorous form of reviewing. These critics were, for Poole, critics of the ‘gut’, writing about what they liked in a non-critical way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912443197">1984</xref>: 57). This form of reviewing might have been amusing, but did not offer the basis of a serious form of criticism. As Poole comments, ‘… television criticism significantly assumes its highest profile and, apparently, its greatest popularity when enacting its own indirection in the pure display of a Clive James or the wilful eccentricity of a Nancy Banks-Smith’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912443197">1984</xref>: 47).</p>
<p>While Poole abhorred Clive James’s witty reviews, it was nevertheless a form of writing which engaged with the readership and would often provide a different image or view of the programme to emerge than that provided by the broadcasters. This can be seen with his coverage of <italic>Dallas</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>It is even possible that Miss Ellie shot him, since she has been showing increasing signs of madness, singing her dialogue instead of saying it. Don’t be surprised if the sheriff turns up with a wornt for her arrest. There could be a tornt of wornts. (1983: 92)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It would be very hard, after reading reviews like this, to see <italic>Dallas</italic> as a straightforward serious soap drama. Instead, it appears as being at times ludicrous, with comical characters and dialogue. This, thanks to James, becomes the focus of attention and enjoyment. His work provides another way for the public to understand and enjoy television. It helps open up the pleasure of the text for the viewer and therefore could offer an escape from the dominant meanings and values found within most television (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884912443197">Rixon, 2011</xref>: 147–148).</p>
<p>One could thus argue that the use of humour has long been part of the tool box of critics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884912443197">Plass, 1988</xref>: 20). It allows a more emotional way of engaging with readers, of deconstructing texts, of highlighting inconsistencies, of opening text up to new readings and pleasures. Because a critic might use humour is not to say that they cannot also make a critical point. Perhaps, it could be argued that Poole and others dismiss, too easily, this style of criticism without trying to understand the way it helps a reader come to critically value, judge and understand television, and how it helps provide a frame of meaning for the viewer. One could argue that there is a need to understand and analyse the work of these popular critics, rather than simply reducing them to a form of pointless frivolity offering no real insights. As John Naughton argued, ‘even a cursory inspection of James’s collected <italic>Observer</italic> pieces reveals an acute, sympathetic and perceptive critic as well as a very funny writer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884912443197">1994</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>In a similar way, Alan Coren wrote in a witty style often using television as a means of social or political comment. This, again, was a traditional approach used by other culture critics to talk about one thing while looking at something else:<disp-quote>
<p>All year, it transpired, the good citizens of Bridgwater chuck themselves into carnival preparations with a gusto, a dedication, an inventiveness, a community spirit, and a competitiveness which, turned to some more prosaic end, would have this country back on its industrial feet before you could say Len Murray. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884912443197">Coren, 1975</xref>: 9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this example, Coren focuses more on what is happening in this British town or British society, than on specifically critiquing the way the programme comes to televise this. This form of criticism was also criticised by Poole who saw such critics ‘using some hapless piece of programming as the springboard for an elaborate display of their own overegged wit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884912443197">1994</xref>: 12). However, television and the way it is experienced is embedded within our social, cultural, political and economic existence and, therefore, the critic can and should use it to reflect upon this within their work. They should not be restricted to just writing about what happens on the screen but must also raise questions of how this relates to the wider world.</p>
<p>By the 1980s a form of critic as viewer had come to dominate; in such a style reviewers would often write more about themselves than the programme they were purportedly reviewing. In many ways, as noted earlier, this fitted with the way many columnists who dominated the pages of the newspapers would write. It was a form of self-reflective commentary, as shown by this example by Courtauld:<disp-quote>
<p>[s]o the final run of Frasier began this week, for those who could stay up that late … Given that so many of Frasier’s viewers are – like me – thirtysomethings with kids, this was an idiotic way to treat an old and loyal friend. Counting Frasier together with its parent, Cheers, then the exploits of the baldy shrink have been on Channel 4 throughout most of its existence. Dr Crane would doubtless diagnose something to do with an unhappy childhood or a favourite cuddly bunny among the channel’s schedulers. I diagnose stupidity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884912443197">2004</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this we seem to find out something about the critic’s family life along with his views of the programme; we find out he is a thirty-something with children and has watched <italic>Cheers</italic> in the past. However, this is not to dismiss this approach. It does help the reader empathise, to understand where the critic is coming from, and to understand the way television is embedded within our everyday lives.</p>
<p>Later on other critics have appeared, such as Charlie Brooker and Jim Shelley, who, while being more fan-like in their approach to television, also exhibit a deep understanding of the way the medium works, often asking new and difficult questions. Often they would do this through a surreal-comic form, what has been called a ‘carnivalesque’ approach, where their work turns accepted approaches and understandings of television on their head, to present new and different ways of thinking about television (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884912443197">Rixon, 2011</xref>: 185–190). For example, Charlie Brooker on 30 March 2002 reviewed the American series <italic>24</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>Anyway, back to the insanely addictive <italic>24</italic> … For some reason, the Noble Senator seems to think he’ll be able to function on the most important day of his political career without enjoying a moment’s shut-eye the night before. Didn’t he see <italic>Touch the Truck</italic>? Assassination will be the least of his worries once sleep deprivation kicks in and he starts swatting invisible demons in the middle of a pre-election press conference. (reprinted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884912443197">Brooker, 2005</xref>: 162)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While this is a programme that he enjoys watching, he can still be critical of it. The way he writes has an ironic edge to it. He is not just criticising the programme in the way other more impressionistic critics would, highlighting the aims of the author or the acting abilities of the actors, but, instead, he helps the reader or viewer to focus on the inconsistencies, to find a new way to understand the programme – a new way to gain pleasure from watching and reading about the programme. In a way, the criticism is not just about the programmes but also about television, and the way it operates.</p>
<p>Also, contrary to what Poole seemed to fear, not all critics are generalists or celebrity columnists; not all have come to use humour or a subjective style as a way of reviewing television and its output. Over time some critics have shown themselves to be very knowledgeable about television, its programmes, its history and wider context of operation, and have developed a serious approach to writing about this medium. For example, the critic Mark Lawson, who works for the <italic>Guardian</italic> and the BBC, writes and comments about television in a knowledgeable and what could be viewed as serious way. Indeed, one could argue that he often critically reviews television in a similar way to how he approaches other art forms.</p>
<p>Another critic, Pete Clark, also tends to write about television in a serious way. For example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884912443197">2002</xref> he wrote a piece on <italic>The Sopranos</italic> in which he noted the ‘deceptive precision of the writing, which frequently appears to freewheel when, in fact, the gears are being engaged with consummate skill’. He highlights how, ‘[n]othing in this script is wasted … [where the] verbal efficiency is matched by a mastery of tone …’. This is a programme in which, ‘[t]hought and intelligence is packed into every shot’. Such critics present a view of television that uses a similar language and values to other forms of criticism, such as those associated with literature and theatre. Behind such a discourse is an attempt to argue that some programmes can be viewed as offering quality forms of television, those are worthy of study and analysis.</p>
<p>As I have shown here, television criticism has over time developed a number of different styles and ways of writing about television, utilising a mixture of journalist approaches, cultural criticism and more popular forms of engagement in the media. In this way television critics have come to create different ways of reviewing or previewing television that keeps them relevant to the modern reader and therefore useful to the needs of the newspapers and television industries. Many of these critics have been important draws, producing copy that readers seek out. Some critics have even crossed over to become television celebrities in their own right; for example, Clive James and Charlie Brooker. This is a form of popular journalism and critical comment that deserves more study: it plays an important role in how newspapers are repositioning themselves at this time of change; it is a form with which the television industry engages as it seeks to shape and frame the reception of its programmes; and it is an important means by which we, the public, know of and reflect on television.</p>

<title>The death of the critic?</title>
<p>However, even as I write about the need to understand and analyse the role and work of television critics, others have started to suggest that the media-based TV critic is a dying breed. Indeed, some American newspapers have started to lay off their TV critics, seeing them as superfluous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884912443197">Rayner, 2008</xref>: 4). The web, for some, has now become a competitor to the traditional media, which in turn are now seeking strategies to both compete with and to make use of this new communication form. While television critics writing for the press offer, in many ways, a one-way discourse, the web provides a virtual space for a more interactive form of public discussion about television (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884912443197">Rixon, 2011</xref>: 215–217, 225–227). It is no longer a question of whether or not critics in their reviews are able to develop a serious critical or contextual approach to television, but how the multitude of different writers and different critical spaces taken together, acting as part of a meta critical discourse, are able to create a useful way of reflecting and engaging with this medium. This is a space in which media-based critics, the public and academic critics can engage equally.</p>
<p>Such developments include websites often run by particular web critics or fans, which attract many readers and, by dint of this, help writers associated with these spaces to become seen as public critics – those anointed by popularity rather than by an editor for those media critics. For example, some time ago Charlie Brooker made his name with the website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tvgohome.com">www.tvgohome.com</ext-link> where he presented a satirical view of the television listings magazines, after which he was picked up by the <italic>Guardian</italic> to become one of their TV critics. Also, on the web, spaces can be found where the public can take on a more ‘prosumer-like’ role, creating and publishing their own reviews, becoming de facto public critics; sites such as tvtome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tvtome.com">www.tvtome.com</ext-link>), thefutoncritic (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thefutoncritic.com">www.thefutoncritic.com</ext-link>) and tvfrog (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tvfrog.com">www.tvfrog.com</ext-link>). Alongside these public sites broadcasters and producers also now have their own web presence. Taken together, these websites have increased by a thousand-fold the amount of coverage of television and have even created new ways for the public to reflect on television and its output. All sorts of information is available, including the synopsis of television series and programmes, behind the scenes gossip, pictures, clips, reviews and previews. Many of these websites and related communities now cross national boundaries, making less clear cut the linkages that newspapers helped underwrite, between television, related critical debates and the national public.</p>
<p>If a more useful critical approach to television criticism is to develop it should not only take account of professional media critics writing for newspapers, but must also be widened to include those members of the public who write for this new communication medium, the web. It must also begin to take account of the pleasure which readers receive from consuming and, for some, producing such work, rather than just focusing on what the review tells us about the public discourse about television and the critic’s view and values in relation in television. The reader is not just consuming a review to learn about a programme, but also gains pleasure from consuming and creating this form of writing. Perhaps, using some of the more recent audience work, including that on fandom and popular journalism, a more nuanced approach can be developed that takes account of what pleasure people gain from engaging with public debates about television.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As I have argued in this article, there has been little academic research and published work on the media-based television critic. One important exception has been the influential article by Mike Poole. This appeared in the early 1980s, helping to raise questions about the role and direction being taken by applied television criticism in the British press at the time. Poole’s work managed in a small way to put this form of criticism on the map as an area of interest and concern. Poole criticised most of the coverage of the press-based critics, seeing their work as lacking a serious critical edge, of treating television as something else, and of failing to develop an adequate approach which could observe television critically as a complex mass medium. Poole argued the need to develop a form of ‘serious’ criticism, one that took account of the unique nature of television; a form that would approach television objectively, without relying on emotive or subjective forms of evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884912443197">1984</xref>).</p>
<p>However, since Poole’s article, others have begun to explore such applied television criticism both historically and critically; writers such as Fiske, Ellis and Wickham have started to provide a better understanding of the role television critics play in how we, as a society, value and engage with television and its programmes. However, while these writers provide some insight into television criticism, this is often limited in scope and depth. They mostly conflate television critics with other actors that operate at the secondary level, hindering a deeper and more focused understanding of television criticism as a form of popular journalism.</p>
<p>At the very moment when more academics than ever before seem to be working in the area of television, publishing books and articles about different ‘must-see’ British and American programmes, often using critics’ reviews to contextualise their research, there is a need for more research on the critics and their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884912443197">Rixon, 2011</xref>: 231–238). Indeed, the need to explore and analyse the nature of journalistic criticism is becoming more acute as the scope and form of press coverage of television increases and changes.</p>
<p>With the ability of critics to articulate their views in the media on a daily basis, it must be recognised that they often take on a high profile role in the public discourses that operate around television as an institution, a popular cultural form and as part of our lived culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884912443197">Williams, 2001</xref>). It is this role that academics writing about television need to be more aware of. There is a need to understand more clearly the relationship of the applied critic to the industry they work for, the one they write about, and the wider social-cultural environment within which they work. But there is also a need to understand the nature of their criticism, its style, form and underlying values, and how it is consumed by the reading public. There is a need to study television criticism as a form in its own right, as a form of popular journalism, and not one just there to tell us more about television.</p>
