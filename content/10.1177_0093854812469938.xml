<p>I am thrilled to be elected as the new editor of <italic>Criminal Justice and Behavior</italic> and want to thank the members of the executive board of the International Association for Correctional and Forensic Psychology for their enthusiastic support. It will be a tremendous task for me to fill the role of the editors who came before me, especially Curt R. Bartol, whose tenure with the journal was nearly 17 years. Dr. Bartol worked diligently to ensure that manuscripts of only the highest rigor were published. His decisions greatly enhanced the reputation and impact of the journal; <italic>CJB</italic> is now widely regarded as the most well-respected criminal justice outlet for scholarship related to correctional and forensic psychology.</p>
<p>It is an honor to be entrusted with continuing the legacy built by my predecessors, and I will work my hardest to do so. I want to thank Curt Bartol and his assistants, Gina Cook, Dinamarie Allen, Jeffrey Sandler, and Anne Bartol, for creating a smooth transition. I also sincerely thank Brent Snook, the outgoing book review editor, for his dedication to the journal, which is reflected in his generosity to assist whenever necessary.</p>
<p>I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to serve the various stakeholders of the journal. These include the authors who continuously view <italic>CJB</italic> as a top tier journal for their research, the reviewers who spend significant amounts of time providing articulate and informative comments, and an audience who expects to learn innovative strategies to increase public safety and improve the lives of victims and offenders alike.</p>
<p>Because <italic>CJB</italic> is among the top journals in criminology and criminal justice, my primary goal is to continue the path of success that has been built thus far. I am pursuing a similar diversity of articles that address the intersection between psychology and criminal justice and that contribute to more effective public policies for reducing crime. Furthermore, <italic>CJB</italic> is a highly attractive venue for many authors due to its timely and impartial review procedure. I will continue to maintain a fair and expedited review process, providing substantive feedback on all manuscripts, even on those that need to be submitted elsewhere for publication. Sustaining the strong aspects of the journal that have already been established is a priority.</p>
<p>Additionally, I am interested in enhancing certain areas of the journal, particularly the editorial board. I would like to increase its diversity by including more women and minority scholars, as well as expand board membership to professionals beyond North America. Indeed, changes will be made to the editorial board by excusing some members, while adding others. I also envision using the expertise of the board to a larger extent. Although there is certainly an obligation for board members to review manuscripts four to six times a year and to guest edit special issues, I anticipate also delegating some responsibility for (1) identifying new scholars to expand the list of reviewers and (2) highlighting the visibility of the journal to researchers from their home institutions and subfields.</p>
<p>Honestly, there is no other journal that I would consider taking on as editor. <italic>CJB</italic> represents much more than an academic journal to me. It substantially contributed to my professional development well before I first published in it, as I was managing editor between 2000 and 2002. It is truly a privilege to be part of its legacy once again.</p>
