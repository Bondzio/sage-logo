<abstract>
<p>Epilepsy is a condition where pathology, diverse manifestations and attached social understandings contribute to an emotional experience unlike many other chronic conditions. The emotional dimension to epilepsy has been little considered in existing research.</p>
<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To explore the emotional experience of young people with epilepsy.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A qualitative study involving in-depth interviews with 37 young people diagnosed with epilepsy.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Fear emerged as the key emotion and this largely related to the experience, or anticipated experience, of seizure activity. Three key features of fear and epilepsy emerged through the analysis; harm, temporality and action. The fear experienced was not only external, relating to immediate injury, but also internal in terms of potential damage to the brain. The embodied nature of epilepsy can, therefore, present a threat to conceptions of the self. Underlying this internal dimension of fear is an understanding of the brain as central to the sense of self.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The experience of epilepsy does not only involve fear of physical harm but also fear of a loss of self. We conclude that there are broader (alternative) readings of the experience of epilepsy that are often overlooked.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1742395312449666" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Emotions are interwoven into the experience of epilepsy in a way that is peculiar to this chronic condition, yet there exists little research focusing on the emotional dimensions of epilepsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395312449666">1</xref></sup> Prevailing orthodoxy is that it is the psychosocial rather than clinical problems that are more burdensome for people with epilepsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742395312449666">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742395312449666">3</xref></sup> Indeed, following Scambler and Hopkin’s classic study exploring the stigmatising dimensions to the experience of epilepsy, much social science research has explored the condition within a stigma framework.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742395312449666">4</xref></sup> This work has offered considerable insights into the social aspects of living with epilepsy but this emphasis can reduce the engagement with the physiological experience. In this paper, we analyse the narratives from in-depth interviews with 37 young people with epilepsy, focusing on the emotional dimensions of their accounts. The emotion of fear emerged as the key category, particularly in relation to the experience, or anticipated experience, of seizures. We dissect the complexity of fear in the young people’s accounts examining in detail three key features of fear and epilepsy; harm, temporality and action. This analysis illustrates how the involvement of the brain in seizure activity can lead to deep fears about the fragility of the self.</p>
<sec id="sec2-1742395312449666"><title>Epilepsy</title>
<p>Epilepsy occurs in an estimated 0.8% of the world’s population and is the most common acquired chronic neurological condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742395312449666">5</xref></sup> Seizure types are divided into generalised and focal (partial) seizures. Focal seizures start in one part of the brain, while generalised seizures involve epileptic activity in both hemispheres of the brain. Generalised seizures include tonic clonic seizures which involve the loss of consciousness, muscle jerking and sometimes loss of bladder control. Other types of generalised seizure include absence and myoclonic seizures. All generalised seizures involve a loss of consciousness, lasting anything from a few seconds in absence seizures to several minutes in extended tonic clonic seizures. Focal seizures, divided into simple partial and complex partial seizures, can have varied symptoms including involuntary movements, feeling frightened, sick, feelings of deja vu and difficulty speaking. A warning aura, experienced by some people in advance of a seizure, is also a type of a focal seizure. Focal seizures can develop into generalised seizures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1742395312449666"><title>Epilepsy and emotions</title>
<p>Emotions are socially mediated and, to some extent, constructed. What we feel, and how we interpret those feelings, is an outcome of complex interactions between physical, social, cultural and psychological relations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742395312449666">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742395312449666">7</xref></sup> In this paper, the focus is on the emotion of fear and how that is experienced by young people in relation to epilepsy. For some theorists, fear is held to be a persistent and defining condition of contemporary life;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742395312449666">8</xref></sup> an outcome of late modernity that has been associated with the rise of the risk society.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742395312449666">9</xref></sup> Others stress that fear is not attached to one object but is articulated and experienced through interactional layers involving environment, cultures, social structures, bodies and the social subject.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395312449666">10</xref></sup> An important feature of fear is that it has a temporal dimension. It is not, therefore, a threatening agent as such, that should be avoided, but a more general expectation of something negative happening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742395312449666">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The increasing number of people living with chronic illness may contribute to this contemporary condition of fearfulness, as uncertainty is a common feature of chronic illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742395312449666">12</xref></sup> Emotional dimensions to chronic illness have been explored in various studies, many with a focus on fear. Anger, fear and sadness have been identified as a triad of central negative emotions constituting affective distress in chronic pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742395312449666">13</xref></sup> People can experience fear on receiving a diagnosis of chronic illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395312449666">14</xref></sup> For example, Bury in his now classic discussion of biographical disruption describes some people being beset with fear and anxiety after a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742395312449666">15</xref></sup> Other studies have described how fear can be experienced by partners and other family members. A study of partners of people diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis found 21% of the sample described experiencing fear and anxiety when thinking about their partners’ future health and the implications for their relationship.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742395312449666">16</xref></sup> Some people diagnosed with chronic illness may fear rejection from a partner, or fear a devaluation of the self by others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742395312449666">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Evidence further suggests that people undertake emotion work in preparation of anticipated fearful events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742395312449666">18</xref></sup> Craib, writing about the fear he experienced when diagnosed with terminal cancer, states that “I suspect that we are engaged in a lifelong struggle of greater or lesser intensity to avoid experiencing it [fear].”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742395312449666">19</xref></sup> This avoidance becomes harder for those who experience ill health. Discussions of fear in chronic illness literature further include fear of movement for people with chronic pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742395312449666">20</xref></sup> and the central role of fear in some anxiety disorders such as agoraphobia or social anxiety.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742395312449666">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Anxiety and panic fear has also been investigated in some depth in relation to asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742395312449666">22</xref></sup> Oncel et al.’s phenomenological study found that “suffering from continuous worry and fear” was one of the key themes emerging through their analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742395312449666">23</xref></sup> They conclude that asthma patients need psychosocial support because of the lack of certain treatment for asthma and the inevitability of asthma attacks. Asthma is of particular interest here because of the similarities between the experiences of the two conditions. Both epilepsy and asthma can be episodic, unpredictable, life threatening, sometimes managed by medication and diagnosed at a young age. The experience of fear in asthma has been researched in-depth because of an apparent link between panic fear and the exacerbation of shortness of breath or over-use of medication,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742395312449666">24</xref></sup> but it remains unclear if there is a causal link between panic fear and asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742395312449666">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The importance of paying attention to the role of emotions in the experiences and well-being of people with epilepsy has been raised (as well as a lack of focus on the experiences of older adolescents and young people).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1742395312449666">26</xref></sup> The experience of epilepsy differs, in some ways, from many other chronic conditions. The physiological experience of epilepsy is itself emotional. Heightened emotions can be experienced before, during and after seizures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742395312449666">27</xref></sup> and epilepsy has been described as “an emotionally straining experience.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742395312449666">28</xref></sup> In our analysis, we set out to explore emotion in the narratives of young people with epilepsy and we turn now to the methods.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1742395312449666" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>A diverse sample of young people, aged between 16 and 28, were recruited from across the UK using a range of recruitment approaches, including contacting epilepsy support groups and organisations, internet forums, schools and colleges, GPs, neurologists and specialist nurses. Young people who expressed an interest in taking part were sent an information leaflet and letter outlining the purpose of the study. Each potential participant was contacted by the interviewer (UR, a social scientist unconnected with their care) in advance, to explain the process and to respond to any questions. Interviews were conducted in participants’ homes or in meeting rooms, depending on individual preference. On the day of the interview, the format of the interview was carefully explained again, any questions were answered and written consent obtained. The majority of interviews were one-to-one interviews with the sole participant, but in a handful of cases a parent or a key worker was present, sometimes contributing to the interview. The interviews lasted between 35 min and 3.5 h and a two-tiered interviewing approach was used. First, participants were asked a broad, open question: “Can you tell me about your experiences?” This question elicited uninterrupted narratives that lasted between a few min to 40 min. In the second part of the interview, the participant was probed about some of the issues raised in their initial narrative and also asked questions based on a semi-structured interview guide (in the majority of interviews such two-tier interviewing was applied. In a small number of interviews with particularly shy or anxious participants, as well as with participants with learning disabilities, a more structured interview guide was used as a more appropriate and participant-preferred option) devised through a literature review and suggestions from the project advisory panel. The interviews were audio recorded for verbatim transcription. The study had Multi Centre Ethics Committee approval from Anglia and Oxford NHS committees and informed consent was gained at the beginning of each interview.</p>
<p>The data were coded by both authors, with some help from AE, a research assistant. Nvivo8 was used as an organisational tool and the coding process began by reading and re-reading the transcripts, identifying the different types of emotions participants’ wove into their accounts. Anger, confidence, embarrassment, happiness, frustration and sadness featured in the accounts and the ways in which these emotions were integrated within participants’ accounts were further coded. Coding was an iterative process; as new codes were added, earlier transcripts were re-read for relevant extracts. As the codes were organised into categories, it became apparent that fear was a core category; fear was not only the most commonly talked about emotion within the narratives but was also attached to rich and intense accounts. The data relating to fear were further analysed using a mapping technique in which the data extracts were represented as a type of mind map, enabling us to explore links, relationships and connections between the data in a more conceptual stage of analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742395312449666">29</xref></sup> Emerging findings were discussed at length, with deviant cases revisited, and examined, until the best fit between the data and theoretical conceptualisations was achieved. Further analyses and extracts from the interviews are published on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.youthhealthtalk.org/Young_people_with_epilepsy/">http://www.youthhealthtalk.org/Young_people_with_epilepsy/</ext-link></p>

<sec id="sec5-1742395312449666" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 37 participants, 31 discussed fear, often without prompting, in varying levels of detail. Of the six who did not discuss fear, two lived in a residential college and had some degree of learning disabilities, one participant was also diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, two had different types of epilepsy that had been controlled by medication for several months or longer and one person said she had no recollection of her seizures. Our analysis here focuses on the sub-sample of 31 participants who described experiencing fear.

<p>When a participant raised fear in the first, narrative section of the interview, this was often explored further through semi-structured questions. Seizures were the focal point of most people’s fear. This fear was complex and related to different aspects of the seizure process. The overriding factor was fear attached to the anticipation of having a seizure. In addition, fear related to the experience of the seizure itself, uncertainty about when and where it may happen, potential harm and the emotional and physical after-effects of the seizure. A few participants talked about the fear they were aware other people experienced when they had a seizure or fear related to the epilepsy diagnosis. The level of fear associated with seizures depended on the type of epilepsy people had, and their seizure activity. Three key themes relating to fear emerged through the analysis; harm, temporality and action.</p>
<sec id="sec6-1742395312449666"><title>Fear and harm</title>
<p>In many accounts, fear was construed as an embodied experience. Some people talked about possible physical harm to the body in an immediate sense. Their seizure activity put them at risk of physical harm. Some also feared fatality through sudden death through epilepsy (SUDEP) or status epilepticus (a generalised convulsion lasting 30 min or longer or repeated tonic clonic convulsions occurring over a 30-min period)<italic>.</italic><disp-quote>
<p>I: And, how do you feel about having seizures? Sort of generally how does it make you feel?</p>
<p>R: It scares me, because I think something might go wrong. Like I might hit my head or something. Or I might, I don't know, choke or something, like in the wrong way. But I've always got someone with me when I've had one, so I've been okay. Well I've had one in the bath before, when I was on my own, but I have to leave the lock undone, just in case, and luckily my boyfriend heard me he knew something was wrong he come in and got me, so that was okay [laughs].(Jenny, 20)</p>
<p>But oh I’ve also got, I also go into status (epilepticus) a lot, so that’s not a good thing to be doing, you know, I would go into seizures and I would need to go into hospital to be brought out of them, [um], and quite often I wouldn’t be able to maintain my own airway, so that’s all a bit scary too. (Meg, 26)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This fear partly relates to a loss of control over the body and the potential for physical harm to the body. It also relates to a more internal fear, a fear of potential harm to the brain which we return to in the following section. Earlier, we discussed the similarities between the experience of epilepsy and asthma and this dual layer of fear, which reflects an anticipation of harm, differs from the experience of asthma, where (internal) fear relates to dyspnea, a shortness of breath (which can have serious consequences). We would anticipate a dual layer of fear through the experience of tonic clonic seizures, which generally involve a loss of consciousness and strong convulsions, but the embodiment of fear, the internal fear, also relates in more abstract ways to other types of seizure activity.<disp-quote>
<p>It was, they [myoclonic seizures] were just both scary. I’m, it feels like I can’t breathe, [um] my lips turn to blue, and I I sweat you know quite a lot and [um], yes so those are the two main things I can remember at the moment, but I’m, since then, I’ve had all the [um] partial seizures where my [um] arm shoots up and eye wanders and I feel very shaky for a couple of minutes, sometimes it rumbles or sometimes it’s just quick like that sort of thing. (Pete, 24)</p>
<p>I suddenly felt that I didn’t have a clue where I was, but I knew that I knew where I was, but I felt like I [um], couldn’t control my limbs, I felt like sort of my body almost became, almost became a dead weight, and I [um], it felt like my insides sort of turned literally upside down, and this feeling like I was just going to die, and this sort of weird, this is the bit that’s really hard to explain because I don’t really remember afterwards, […] and I sort of get [um], kind of a vision almost, kind of, almost hallucinates, and [um] the, the things I see are always really terrifying. And I feel very afraid and like I want someone to help me, and [um], just this really sinister feeling, and then, very suddenly my sort of insides turn the right way up again and I feel like I’m coming out of it. (Mary, 19)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>These descriptions of different seizure types (myoclonic and complex partial [myoclonic seizures involve muscle jerks and complex partial seizure involves a loss of consciousness and is often preceded by an aura.]) provide vivid, tangible and physical descriptions of types of seizures and the fear woven into them. There is an embodied fear integral to the experience of some seizures; fear of not being able to breathe and fear of unusual and intense sensations that can accompany seizure activity. The experience of fear can almost be a part of a seizure rather than a feeling about it. Hallucinations and images can be terrifying but form an abstract fear rather than a fear of physical harm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1742395312449666"><title>Threat to sense of self</title>
<p>A poignant feature in making sense of fear and harm in these accounts relates to the involvement of the brain in epilepsy. Concern about the brain is connected to both seizure activity itself and the medication used to try to control seizures. Participants balanced the use of anti-convulsive medication and potential neurological damage caused by uncontrolled seizures, in making treatment decisions, and we return in the following section.</p>
<p>What makes this fear imminent and powerful is the symbolic notion of the centrality of the brain to conceptualisations of the self. This contrasts to fears in asthma which relate to the respiratory system. While breathing is an essential function for maintaining life, it does not have the same connotations of selfhood and identity as the (seizuring) brain, as the following extract illustrates.<disp-quote>
<p>R: Also and also one of the big fears that I had when I was having these big fits is what if I have some, is it one fit, cos these fits are usually dangerous in the sense that they’re dangerous to you, your brain can’t take it so, ‘cos your brain can only take so much. And I was worried that one day I would wake up and I wouldn’t be able to walk or, I would, or I might not wake up or, wake up as a you know.</p>
<p>Mother: Cabbage.</p>
<p>R: A vegetable basically. And I wasn’t, wasn’t afraid of dying really, I was afraid of that because I always thought if I have a seizure and I die I don’t know about it, that’s it, but if I’m in a wheelchair or I don’t want my life ruined by it. (Johnny, 20)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This was not an uncommon way for the young people to conceptualise their potential futures in the light of uncontrolled seizures. The brain is elevated to a higher status organ and the perceived risks attached to brain injury are considered to be substantial. As the above extract illustrates, some people may be more fearful of a transformed self, than of dying.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1742395312449666"><title>Fear and temporality</title>
<p>A temporal dimension ordered people’s fearfulness around seizures, particularly for those who did not have a predictable seizure pattern or a set of trigger factors that they could avoid. Some people talked about living in constant fear of having a seizure and were unable to navigate their lives around seizures; there were no coordinates to work with and the fear remained constant.</p>
<p>For those people with a regular seizure pattern, their anticipation of seizure was more heightened at certain times. They could identify typical seizure patterns and described their seizure activity as cyclical. This had implications for people’s actions and, in some cases, led to limiting behaviours or more intense management strategies around the anticipated timings of seizures.<disp-quote>
<p>But I mean I’m twenty-two now, it’s been pretty much the same, since I was fourteen, fifteen, but it’s been, it went from, on average to, every two weeks to every week and it can be anything from [em], half an hour, where I’ve woken up after one and gone into another, only happened twice though. From, if you like that, six days to two weeks [em] so after a week if I go for another week or two without the seizure I kind of develop more and more paranoia, depression, all that sort of thing that goes with it as to ‘come on, you know, just have the fit so I can get back to normal lifestyle’. (Jono 22)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The anticipation of seizures led to the ordering of everyday life around the expected event. Recognition of seizure patterns could, in itself, create heightened emotions and paranoia, especially when the anticipated seizure was delayed. A further temporal dimension to the fear for some people was the changing sensations experienced during the experience of the seizure. The process is dynamic and fear can be experienced at different points of the seizure.<disp-quote>
<p>Actually you sort of go through a range of emotions. I don’t think it lasts for any longer than maybe 30 seconds itself, as well, but at first you sort of feel very frightened and you think, ‘Oh, what is happening?’ because it’s all visual. And then you sort of feel slightly calm and a bit surreal and then you almost think, well ok I’m accepting it now, I know what is going to happen. […] (Valerie, 20)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Valerie’s description captures the dynamic nature of even a very brief seizure and the way in which changing emotions are intertwined with embodied sensory experiences.</p>
<p>Several accounts described changes in the seizure type over time. As discussed earlier, the experience of fear was intertwined with the type of epilepsy with which the person was diagnosed. People also made a distinction, or created hierarchies, between types of epilepsy and their fear potential, depending on the perceived risk attached to seizure type. For some, a change in seizure type was interpreted as a negative progression creating a new source of fear to be negotiated. Participants who had a change in seizure type had to simultaneously negotiate their fear of the implications of their changing epilepsy status, as well as come to terms with the emotions attached to unfamiliar and unpredictable seizure type.<disp-quote>
<p>R: So these are big difference in the types of seizure that can happen. [um] It was a big step for me, mild seizure to a tonic clonic. It’s not as if, it’s not as I had a different seizure at each stage, it’s been a quick jump from a small seizure to a very big seizure.[…]</p>
<p>I: And how did you feel about those big jumps to different types of seizures?</p>
<p>R: Well it was, it was another shock to my system. I thought is it something serious that has happened to the brain. And it has, has it caused more damage? Has me epilepsy got worse? Is it just right temporal lobe or is it more serious epilepsy? (Mark, 18)</p></disp-quote></p>

<sec id="sec9-1742395312449666"><title>Fear and action</title>
<p>The final dimension to fear was that of action; the ways in which people responded to their seizures and the impact of that action on their levels of fearfulness. Actions could either ameliorate or sometimes increase fearfulness. For example, some participants identified triggers that caused seizures and they tried to avoid these triggers where possible, although for some seizure triggers, such as stress, this was not always possible. Other participants decided on surgery or medication to reduce their seizures, and the related fearfulness. Hannah, in the following extract, returns to concerns around the brain as she explains why she felt compelled to take action to reduce her seizure activity.<disp-quote>
<p>I suppose I was most fearful at the time, I think something that was, was, had been dropped in my ear, rightly or wrongly, and that very much concerned me at the time, was the fact that with every seizure that is had, [um], it [um] something is diminished, destroyed, in the brain, as in progressive, progressive fault, harm to the brain. Which is to some extent true I suppose, but, that’s, that’s what brought me to realise and that’s the only winning point that took me over to the other side, you [um], I know it was, if I didn’t get this under control I really wondered where it would leave me, [um], in a few years’ time. I don’t want to say, ‘vegetable state’. But the brain is such a delicate thing. (Hannah, 22)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For some, fear was a stimulus to seeking control, but the process of treatment decision making itself involved an element of fear which could either be increased or diminished over time, depending on the outcome of the intervention. Fears could increase during medication change-overs or when participants were faced with contemplating the potential risks of surgery. Mary, aged 28, recounted how she felt in the time leading up to her brain surgery: “I was frightened. I was anxious, I was worried. I’d had all the, all the… but then I was excited as well. I was looking forward to it as well. You know, thinking, ‘Oh God if, I’m finally not going to have this blooming rotten illness anymore.’” Her response captures the complexity of emotions in chronic illness, as she describes experiencing both fear but also excitement in anticipation of her epilepsy being potentially cured.</p>
<p>Fear of harm through seizures motivated some participants to think about their home as a “safe space” and to prepare it to be safe. For example, Amanda had arranged cushions around her bed to protect her in the event of a seizure at night. It is in the context of avoiding seizure activity in public that we can see how aspects of fear and stigma inter-relate:<disp-quote>
<p>I suppose thankfully most of my seizures happened at home so I was in a safe environment but I was really scared that, you know, I’d be, somewhere in a street on my own and I’d be ill ‘cos we didn’t know what was wrong, so I wasn’t gonna be able to explain it to anyone or anything like that. (Amanda, 17)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The actions of others can feed into the experience of fear. For example, some features of medical advances can create a deeper fear by demonstrating to people the embodied features of their seizure activity. Within the diagnostic process in epilepsy, several tests and diagnostic measures such as MRI and CT scans, telemetry and eye witness accounts are devised to make the disease process and manifestations detectable, visible and measurable. This was a dimension outside of the daily experience of epilepsy which proved a source of fear for some participants.<disp-quote>
<p>Yeah, when I went to the epilepsy clinic, that made me ten times more aware and ten times more scared as well, ‘cos unless they brought prospects of operations in and like risks of that, and which scared me a lot, and I found more about [er] sort of side effects of tablets, which made me more [er] paranoid about the side effects which brought the side effects on more. Which was annoying, I wish they’d never shown me some of the stuff that they showed me, yeah. And also I’d never seen myself have a fit before had I, and they showed me a video of myself having a fit, and that upset me quite a bit. And I hadn’t hadn’t like cried in years, but when I saw that I was really crying. Yeah. (Johnny, 20)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Fear of the bodily experience and sensation of the seizure could also be legitimised, or created, by others present. One participant recounted how her brother gave her an in-depth description of how the seizure manifested from the outside, and this made her feel more fearful of the process. For some people, not knowing how their seizure activity was experienced by others present was preferable to becoming more aware of the bodily manifestation of a seizure.</p>

<p>Our analysis demonstrates how fear interacts with the anticipation, and is interwoven into the bodily, psychological and social experiences, of seizure activity. Fear is more than a worry of having a seizure, or a concern of disclosure and other people’s negative reactions to this. It is an emotion that is actively negotiated and made sense of in the short- and long-term trajectories of people’s lives. Tudor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742395312449666">30</xref></sup> drawing on Barbalet,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1742395312449666">31</xref></sup> highlights how fear has a larger time horizon than the here and now. Epilepsy is an example of this, as people manage and negotiate their fears over and across time. For some, seizures become less fearful and initial fears, of serious harm or fatality, reduce over time. Others experience growing fears as their seizures remain unpredictable, or their seizure type changes. Depending on the type of epilepsy, fear of seizures can be linked to fear of physical harm, of unusual and uncontrollable sensations, and a threat to conceptions of the self and identity.</p>
<p>While it is argued that fearfulness is a condition of the 21st century, we suggest that people with epilepsy have a fearfulness that is specific, rather than generalised. For people with epilepsy, the source of fear is not as much social, but embodied. Whilst most people may struggle to avoid experiencing fear throughout their lives, as Craib described earlier, people with uncontrolled seizures cannot avoid fear; they have to live with it. This is in common with people with asthma which is also a potentially life-threatening condition. While fear in this context may have some social dimensions, it is also, importantly, fear that people have with and of themselves. For people with asthma, fear relates to the capacity to breath and breathlessness. For people with epilepsy, neurology and the potential for harm to the brain is a dominant feature of the condition. The symbolic interpretation of the brain as a kind of super-ordinate bodily organ was central to many people’s accounts. The involvement of the brain in seizure activity was described as scary and something that reached to the very core of people.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to our analysis. The data were collected for a broader purpose; to explore the information, support and health needs of young people living with epilepsy. The emotional dimension to people’s experiences emerged during the process of interviewing and was not the specific focus of the study. Further work could explore in more depth the range of emotions experienced by people with epilepsy and examine how and why different emotions are experienced during the illness journey.</p>
<p>The experience of fear can motivate people to act in particular ways or to develop strategies, such as avoiding specific behaviours, places and times, to manage the possibility of having a seizure. The consequences of this fearfulness can be considerable. This is where our analysis inter-relates with existing social science research, much of which has discussed the experience of epilepsy as a stigmatised condition, inherently problematic for those living with it but also for others around.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742395312449666">32</xref></sup> This commonly used framework within epilepsy research leaves the complexity of the experience of fearfulness largely overlooked.</p>
<p>Our focus on the emotional experiences of young people with epilepsy has highlighted how the anticipation and ramifications of different types of seizures vary considerably. This is something that is not acknowledged in social science research on epilepsy. Jacoby<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742395312449666">33</xref></sup> refers to a tendency for stereotypical representations of epilepsy as generalised, chronic and incapacitating, as having resonance for lay audiences. We have demonstrated here that using a different framework of analysis, a framework focusing on emotions, offers fresh insights and understandings of the experience of epilepsy. In particular, our study illustrates how different seizure types have different emotional ramifications and that the involvement of the brain in seizures can lead to deep fears about the fragility of the self.</p>
