<p>Above his door, and later on his own tombstone, Carl Jung had a Delphic oracle inscribed: <italic>Vocatus atque non vocatus Deus aderit</italic>: “Bidden or not, God is present.” That Jung was by no means a believer merely underscores the perduring social reality and kaleidoscopic breadth of transcendent claims in an increasingly immanent world. Bidden or not, and indeed true or not, religion is present, and it endures, despite compelling sociological and philosophical predictions to the contrary. The stubborn resilience—and surprising growth—of religion well after its prophesied demise has rightly caused scholars of all fields to reconsider the dialectic of the religious and secular. That religion continues to have a presence and role—both in domination and liberation—in political and social spheres is obvious, but what kind of presence is it, and should it have? In the administered society of our advanced capitalistic world, can religion be anything more than private nostalgia for glimpses of transcendence?</p>
<p><italic>Der Geist geistloser Zustände: Religionskritik und Gesellschaftstheorie</italic> (2012), or <italic>The Soul of Soulless Conditions: The Critique of Religion and Social Theory</italic>, edited by Maxi Berger et al., offers 13 essays arising from a 2010 conference in Hamburg. The German-language essays are divided into three rubrics: “The cultural function of religion,” “Theoretical-historical aspects of religion,” and “The political function of religion.” The collection’s title, “The soul of soulless conditions” is a quote from Marx’s <italic>Introduction to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right</italic>, which is engaged and explicated throughout the volume. There, the young Marx speaks of religion as “the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, because it is the soul of soulless conditions,” going on to characterize religion as a social narcotic. Perhaps the challenge in engaging such critiques in light of the resurgence of religious expression requires not only addressing “soulless conditions,” but also understanding the repression of social and religious complicity in perduring conditions of human existence—oppression arising from heartless and soulless structures.</p>
<p>For Marx, and for the group of contributors to this volume, the critique of religion remains rooted in the foundation of all critique, namely, social alienation. One cannot understand religion without grasping the social conditions within which religion exists. Acknowledging the complicity of religion in such conditions is crucial, yet culture and market economies equally perpetuate such conditions. Religion is, famously for Marx and his interlocutors, a type of false consciousness arising from the human need for transcendence and concomitant beliefs are based on human projection. More recent theorists have acknowledged that although religion can be a source of oppression and alienation, it is necessary to simultaneously recognize that religion can also be a potential and potent avenue of individual and social liberation in response to enduring “soulless conditions.” Some critiques of religion, including those from recent “new atheists,” are myopic in their lack of attention to the social conditions and function of religion as a nexus of social responses to enduring human “soulless conditions.”</p>
<sec id="sec1-2050303213476113"><title>Structure and content</title>
<p>Heiko Vollmann’s introductory essay substantively engages Marx and argues that cultural and religious alienation are concomitant conditions of modernity. “Objectively, religion in its traditional form can no longer claim truth in light of scientific investigation, philosophical challenges to the existence of God and Marxist philosophical critique” (Vollmann, 2012: 40). In response to the philosophical critique, Protestantism “assigned faith its own field, beyond reason, in the hope thereby to save [faith]” (Vollmann, 2012: 40). Other attempts to secure a separate sphere of influence for religion are almost always self-serving and politically motivated. Vollmann rhetorically questions whether what remains can be thought of as religion, or perhaps, he implies, it is better conceived as “(anti-)imperialist ideology since it arises within and feeds upon the materialist world order” (Vollmann, 2012: 41). Individuals, having been reduced “to the mere function of carriers of value … need to break out from consummate heteronomy” (Vollmann, 2012: 41). One is left with the choice of heteronomous flight of fantastical excess into the magical, or a challenging path toward autonomy. Despite the precision of Vollmann’s analysis of complex material throughout the essay, his conclusion and style seem unnecessarily opaque.</p>
<p>Robert Menasse’s essay, “Land acquisition and redemption: Capitalism as religion,” is written in an almost poetic style. Capitalism has effectively become the new religion, he suggests. The shift to instrumentalized market systems as a manifestation of the new religion can be seen symbolically in three “moments” of territorial acquisition: the land reclamation beyond the reach of the Bishop of Utrecht in the Netherlands, the quest <italic>against God and without religion</italic> in Auschwitz, and finally market forces <italic>as both God and religion</italic> in Nagasaki (Menasse, 2012: 51). He provocatively implies, without sufficient elaboration, that capitalism is an <italic>ersatz</italic> religion insofar as the “divinely willed world and … the human-made world … are identical” (Menasse, 2012: 52).</p>
<p>Introducing the second section of the book, dealing with theoretical aspects of the critique of religion, Tobias Reichart engages several pre-Socratic and Sophist critiques of religion as rationalization. He discusses the ancient practice of anthropomorphizing deities and the facile attribution of natural phenomena with the “work of the gods.” Such explanations leave religion as a form of “deception” (Reichart, 2012: 62 ff.), easily manipulated by those in power, against the masses. Reichart’s final section explores Plato’s critique of religion as well as his critique of pre-Socratic atheism.</p>
<p>In “Which spirit ends the soulless conditions?,” author Günther Mensching engages the theological critique of the mundane in the Middle Ages and traces a connection to early critiques of political economy. Although atheistic thought was not a significant factor in this period, opposition to centralized power in the Church was very much present. Thus, the “spirit which ends [or completes] soulless conditions arises from humanity” (Mensching, 2012: 81), even though humanity is best understood as a product of soulless conditions. Unfortunately Mensching does not pursue analysis substantially beyond a historical account of secularization here.</p>
<p>Through the lens of Hegel’s <italic>Phenomenology of Spirit</italic> and as a barometer of Hegel’s critique of Enlightenment philosophy, Dieter Hüning suggests that the foundational error of Hegel’s philosophy of religion lies in its “<italic>thoroughgoing identification of knowledge and recognition</italic>” (Hüning, 2012: 100; emphasis in original). Hegel’s critique of Enlightenment, in Hüning’s (2012: 101) careful analysis, entails less a critique of religion than a philosophical <italic>Aufhebung</italic> of religion “in order to ensure … meaning-making and reconciliation.” Religion and enlightenment may have distinct forms, but their contents are virtually identical.</p>
<p>In his insightful essay, “Religion and state and society: Concerning an overlooked element of modern state-debates,” Michael Städtler (2012: 103) identifies a key social element of the early modern movement arising from the “wars of religion” to be “so interlinking the political with the religious that people [understood] political requirements as religious obligations.” People who lived in such societies—and their descendents—often could not reconcile their own purposes and goals with those (increasingly economic) of secular society. After engaging in incisive analyses of Böckenförde, Habermas, and Ratzinger concerning the connection and diremption of the religious and the political, Städtler examines Hegel’s analysis of state and society, arguing that much more needs to be done in advancing an adequate social theory.</p>
<p>Moshe Zuckermann’s first essay in the volume, “Ongoing religious critique,” engages Hegel, Heine, and the Frankfurt School’s critique of religion. Radical critiques of religion have “as their goal the enervation of religious power, or else its total abolishment.” Such radical critiques, exemplified by the early Marx, are “not content with … epistemological doubts, but are rooted in the atheistic premise that God is a cultural product of humanity and belief arises from human need …” (Zuckermann, 2012: 121). Although the essay offers a valuable summary, it does not go significantly beyond description.</p>
<p>Engaging the religion and science debates, Christine Zunke’s (2012: 129) essay, “The meaning of life,” explores two types of “soulless conditions,” namely “positivistic Darwinism and pseudo-Christian inspired creationism,” also known as “intelligent design.” In her concluding section, Zunke urges biologists to reflect on the concept of life and the discipline’s strength as a “life science.” “Only a biology that would have such an awareness of its subject matter—and itself—could actually oppose the theories of intelligent design with something more serious than a dinosaur bone” (Zunke, 2012: 142). Her challenge is articulated well for a degree of epistemic humility on both sides, but Zunke risks equating impatient scientific positivism with arational faith positions.</p>
<p>Beginning the third section of the book, dealing with the political function of religion, Leo Šešerko’s essay on religion and the recent war(s) in Yugoslavia [“Religion and the Yugoslavian succession wars”] challenges the common conception that religion was the (primary) source of ethnic strife and bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Rather, nationalistic and ethnic claims to power were manipulated by Miloševic and others within cultural constructs of monotheism, much as had been done in Northern Ireland. The essay, along with Puzic’s, which follows it, does a nice job of nuancing a complex nexus of issues often simplistically reduced to religion as a primary factor.</p>
<p>Maik Puzic continues the theme of ethnic and religious conflict in the former Yugoslavia with his essay concerning the specific “Example of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the squandered opportunity to establish a professing Islam in Europe.” He reflects on the question of identity from the perspective of faith tradition and historical-national tradition. Despite the missed political window in the 1990s, Puzic offers a compelling argument that Bosnian Islam has developed as an organic part of Europe’s history and cultural milieu.</p>
<p>In his second essay in the collection, “The elect – a people without borders,” Zuckermann examines the relationship between Jews and the state of Israel. He helpfully differentiates between a “Jewish state” and Israel as a “state for all its citizens.” After exploring the tension between Orthodox Jews and secular Israelis, Zuckermann identifies a two-fold tension in the religio-political foundations of the country. He rhetorically asks what remains essential to “Jewish-Israeli existence … if religion is discounted as ritual ‘tradition’ and above all as a cultural institution of faith in the God of the Jews?” (Zuckermann, 2012: 188). According to Zuckerman’s provocative thought experiment, Hitler is the remaining ideological basis of the Zionistic state of Israel.</p>
<p>Completing the volume are two essays concerning Islam. The question driving Khalil Toama’s (2012: 191) provocative essay “Is Islam the solution?” is whether it is appropriate to speak of “an Islam” given the profound distinctions between the Taliban and the Turkish Justice and Development Party (AKP), for example. Rightly noting, “there are many Islams” (Toama, 2012: 200), Toama insightfully and hopefully argues for a social and political model propagated initially by Islamic thinkers in exile, whereby future Islamic societies are: “Islamist, liberal, democratic, open and the armed forces [serve] as guarantor for constitution and democracy” (Toama, 2012: 201).</p>
<p>Finally, Dehqan Zehma’s concluding essay is a discussion with Aramech Dustdar, a marginalized German-educated Iranian, concerning “Critique of religion in Persian-speaking perspective.” Claiming that religious consciousness is “symptomatic of an unjust world” (Zehma, 2012: 215), it is not entirely clear whether Dustdar’s (and Zehma’s) ideal would be a new privatization or a reconceptualization of religion as a social force. Zehma nevertheless ends the collection on a note of hope for social, cultural, and religious transformation in Iran and beyond.</p>

<p>To conclude, a return to Carl Jung elucidates the ways Marx’s “soulless conditions” unify the essays in this collection. For Jung, religion—bidden or not—was not so much a narcotic as a salve. Jung’s concern was not with the truth content of religion, but rather with the reality of religion’s effects on individual and societies. Marx may concur with this claim to an extent; immediately preceding the central quote from Marx around which the collection is organized, Marx writes: “Religious suffering is … an expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2050303213476113">Marx, 1977</xref>: 64). Each of the authors is deeply concerned with the social effects of religion in particular, and collectively suggest that one means of addressing ongoing “soulless conditions,” contra the “new atheists,” is to acknowledge and examine the social manifestations and effects of religions—positive and negative—rather than focus primarily on their truth or falsehood.</p>
<p>The essays in the collection do this with varying degrees of success; some essays offer careful review, but cover little new territory. Others offer distinctive and new lenses through which social scientists and scholars of religion may further dialogue in and between these fields. The collection perhaps advances the conversation with original insight less than one might hope, but it clearly offers an important set of analyses for ongoing discussion about transformative practices and their limits.</p>
