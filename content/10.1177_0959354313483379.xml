<p>Jan Haaken has achieved a remarkable degree of synthesis in <italic>Hard Knocks</italic>, her impressive account of domestic violence and the methodology of feminist storytelling developments. Her ability to draw together different styles of scholarly engagement is a marker of both quality and sophistication. Rather than allying herself with one theoretical language, with a single “tool-box” of analysis, Haaken combines and overlays a series of (often disparate) intellectual traditions: social psychology, empirical feminist research, techniques of literary criticism, and psychoanalytic critique are blended in a genuinely critical manner.</p>
<p>Haaken’s style is immediate and readable. The book brings together fieldwork conducted over eight years and expresses in a very elegant manner the current status of the field in the psychology of domestic violence. Although evincing a thorough appreciation of the history of feminist interventions in the discipline, <italic>Hard Knocks</italic> is not afraid to break new ground. Committed political work requires the asking of difficult questions of both one’s self and of accepted mores. This aspect of Haaken’s work is particularly commendable: her willingness to ask such self-critical questions even when they run counter to dogmas in the field. Each of the book’s chapters begins with a myth about domestic violence and a counter-myth (as in the second chapter: “<italic>Myth</italic>: It takes two to tango. <italic>Counter-myth</italic>: Men initiate ninety-five percent of incidents of couple violence,” p. 46). This is a nice way of destabilizing what she refers to as the “myth–fact rhetoric” that is sometimes used in social activism. As she puts it: “Trumping myths with ‘factual claims’ is part of the bourgeois universalizing tendency – the hubris of speaking as if from nowhere” (p. 4). Furthermore: “Put psychoanalytically, facts may operate as an obsessive defense against ambiguity” (p. 4).</p>
<p>There is a second effective structuring device Haaken utilizes in the book. She identifies a series of “border tensions” in the feminist antiviolence movement, tensions which are not easily resolved, and which bring with them a series of ambivalences. They are as follows: the prospect of feminist alliances with the state, the issue of what is gained and lost by a delimited focus on <italic>domestic</italic> violence as opposed to the consideration of broader structural factors, the fact of diverse narrative strands within a movement, and the destructive capacities of women themselves. This approach is befitting of a text which demonstrates so cultivated a psychoanalytic sensibility of the function of narrative. Rather than be satisfied with the idealizations and romanticizations which so often crop up in the field (romanticization of female-only spaces, idealizations of abused women, for example), Haaken’s text points us in the direction of the ambivalences and complexities which are par for the course in the type of progressive storytelling that she pursues. To be attuned to the role of storytelling in political work—a crucial means of “working through” for social activism—is to be aware of the myriad narrative defences popular discourse mobilizes in response to domestic abuse. As she warns in the chapter devoted to popular culture and stories of abuse:
<disp-quote>
<p>[W]omen in the anti-violence movement must continue to generate narratives that foreground the sheer pervasiveness. But if these are the modal stories that circulate, relying as they often do on the stock script of virtuous (white) maidens and smarmy villains, too many plots and subplots are left behind. (p. 101)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Activists must thus “be equipped to read the subtexts of dominant modes of storytelling” (p. 2).</p>
<p>While aware of critiques of psychoanalysis from within the field—the idea that unconscious motivation is too often emphasized over and above an appreciation of the political causes of domestic violence—Haaken nonetheless shows a keen appreciation of the critical value of a psychoanalytic sensibility. Early on in the text, she notes how any force for social change “inevitably becomes a fantasy object for the broader culture—a repository for diffuse anxieties, fears and longings” (p. 2). Psychoanalysis proves useful also in highlighting the voyeurism that sometimes accompanies feminist displays of suffering, and in investigating the various functions of idealization:
<disp-quote>
<p>Early on in a movement, idealization of the group and its capacities emerges as a dominant motif in storytelling as a means of casting of collective injuries of the past. The base aspects of oneself . . . the internalized experiences of dirtiness or dangerousness are projected back onto the oppressor. The badness is transferred to an external source – the oppressor – in reversing the dynamics of power that allows the powerful to deposit (project) unwanted parts of him/herself onto the oppressed. (p. 79)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Of course, idealization may take regressive forms, the role for example of the good as opposed to bad man in “determining the maiden’s fate,” the role of “the masculine protector [and] . . . his capacity to vanquish the villain” (pp. 79–80). Hence the need—a dominant theme throughout the book—to attend to the subversive elements of storytelling that can upset such hegemonic scripts and provide a vital set of resources for the future. The historical trajectory that Haaken maps in view of domestic violence against women—stories of captivity, stories of deliverance, and stories of struggle and reparation—is a case in point. These genres “may be enlisted to claim the cultural legacy of the battered women’s movement while interrupting the voyeurism and enchantments that accompany its passage into popular culture” (p. 170).</p>
<p>There are many commendable facets to Jan Haaken’s important, provocative, and memorable book, not the least of which concerns her feminist attention to “less than readily articulated [forms of] cruelty,” to the idea of a “suffering that has no name” (p. 68). Likewise crucial is her conceptualization of splits occurring within political movements, schisms which—be it via transference of feelings from one sphere to another, or due to “surplus emotional loadings”—replicate the struggle against oppression within the movement itself. What however stuck most strongly with me was Haaken’s lifelong dedication to storytelling as political praxis—something the book brings to life with incredible vigour and colour—and the fact of Haaken’s own storytelling ability, which is itself an incisive vehicle of transformation.</p>
