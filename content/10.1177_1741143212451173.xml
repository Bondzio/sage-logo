<abstract>
<p>The literature on educational leadership and management has referred to culture since at least the 1970s. Despite the concept’s mention in over one-third of articles written in this journal, there has been little in-depth engagement with how leaders might influence it and the ethical issues involved. The article argues that leadership must engage with culture as a key mediator of power within organizations. Four levels of cultural activity are suggested: the cultural context created by global phenomena; the cultures of local communities; the organizational culture; and the sub- and counter-cultures within the organization. The article considers a bifurcation in the skills assumed necessary to respond to, on one hand, multi- or intra-culture and, on the other, organizational culture. The article suggests that the degree of perceived difference from norms dictates leaders' orientation to and engagement with culture, with cultural competence generally promoted only in relation to multicultural issues. It concludes that leaders are currently ill-served by encouragement to focus on aligning the organization’s members to a single, strong culture and that the persistent surface engagement with culture may perpetuate inequalities. The need to move leaders to engage more deeply with the power and complexity of culture is indicated.</p>

<title>Grappling with Culture</title>
<p>Educational leadership has engaged with the nature and significance of organizational culture since at least the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143212451173">Brookover et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1741143212451173">Sarason, 1971</xref>). Since that time, the concept has retained a tenacious hold in the literature, despite frequent attacks on its inadequate conceptualization and doubtful practical application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741143212451173">Lumby and Foskett, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1741143212451173">Schoen and Teddlie, 2008</xref>). Though culture may be castigated by some as an outmoded concept, its enduring appeal is evident in the persistence of its use and in the frequent reference to culture in texts concerned with leading education.</p>
<p>In the face of the existing extensive literature it is certainly challenging to review the concept’s use over 40 years and to take thinking forward. An initial question, then, is why we should consider culture and what might be said about it that develops our understanding? The standpoint in this article is that the concept demands attention, if only because its persistence suggests a <italic>prima facie</italic> case that it performs some necessary function. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1741143212451173">Schein (2011</xref>: xi) asserts: ‘I doubt that there is a manager or scholar alive that does not take the concepts of climate and culture seriously.’ A further imperative to consider culture is the premise that it is deeply implicated in the different and unequal experience of learners and consequently strongly related to a goal of educational leadership, contributing to social justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143212451173">Bates, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The article briefly reviews the lenses through which culture has been studied and its history in educational leadership. It considers how it has been conceptualized and its place in practice. It discusses a number of arenas in which culture operates in educational organizations. It places the study of culture in a larger field which includes multi- and inter-culture issues as well as organizational culture, and considers the implications of the different perspectives. Finally, the article considers the relationship of culture to social justice and presents an argument for why leaders need to engage deeply with culture.</p>
<p>The intention here is not to offer prescriptions for managing culture but to begin to dismantle what appears unproblematic in much educational leadership literature; in Foucault’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143212451173">2000a</xref>: 235) terms, to leave people so that they do not know what to do, rather than knowing what to do, ‘so that the acts, gestures, discourses that up until then had seemed to go without saying become problematic, difficult, dangerous’. The critique in this article is intended to disturb the current relationship between leaders and culture, and to leave them not with a recipe for action, but with a deeper understanding and remodelled agenda of what they need to consider in reflecting on their own way forward with social justice at the heart.</p>

<title>Placing the Study of Culture in Context</title>
<p>It is possible to explore culture’s academic evolution and practical application through a number of frameworks: disciplinary, chronological, ideological and methodological. There is not space here to do more than indicate the complex mosaic of culture’s scholastic history. A number of disciplines offer distinct approaches. For example, anthropology has attempted to identify and scientifically depict the culture of individual societies. Cultural studies position the power tussles of socio-economic class, gender and ethnicity in changing everyday culture. Psychology engages with the neuro-epistemological bases of perception and the embeddedness of culturally determined patterns of thought and behaviour. Such a brief description can do no more than hint at the richness of these and other disciplines. The relevance here is that the fields of management and educational leadership have borrowed from a range of disciplines, though often in ways that have mirrored in faint form the conceptual and methodological rigour of the parent discipline.</p>
<p>Some have attempted an analysis of the use of the term to map how understanding has evolved. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1741143212451173">Schoen and Teddlie (2008</xref>) chart scholars’ engagement from the 18th century onwards. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143212451173">Martin et al. (2004</xref>) attempt to trace the more recent configurations of culture from the latter half of the 20th century, while simultaneously arguing that the history of the concept is so contentious and confused that unravelling clear chronological paths and transition points is almost impossible. They present an account of intellectual divergence from the 1970s, distinguishing the tangled history of three perspectives; first an integrationist perspective, in which organizational culture is viewed as a management tool created by leaders to support the achievement of organizational goals. They contrast this with the emergence of a differentiation perspective, the stance of those who view organizations as replete with multiple cultures that change largely because of environmental pressures rather than management intention. Finally, they perceive the advent of a fragmentation perspective, where the many cultures in an organization are perceived as constantly shifting, contested, transitory and confusing.</p>
<p>An ideological debate has unfolded over time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143212451173">Bates (2006</xref>) suggests an ideological history from a critical perspective, seeing the advent of corporate culture ushering in mechanisms intended to give managers dominance. He suggests that culture is not the shared meanings stressed in many definitions, but ‘a complex mosaic of negotiation (and sometimes rebellion), constantly shaped by the exercise of various forms of power’ (2006:160).</p>
<p>Study of culture also reflects methodological divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143212451173">Martin et al. 2004</xref>). Divides exist between quantitative researchers, who use statistical analysis of questionnaire responses to register and influence culture or climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143212451173">Bustamante, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143212451173">Phillips and Wagner, 2003</xref>), and qualitative researchers, who see the necessity for substantial, rich data to make progress in understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741143212451173">Hagelund, 2007</xref>). Within each division are further sub-groups; for example, within the qualitative camp ethnographers believe that participant observation over time is axiomatic to understanding culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1741143212451173">Vogt, 2002</xref>). Whatever methods are adopted, there is persistent dissatisfaction with results and a sense that the culture(s) of an organization continue to elude capture by research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143212451173">Prosser, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143212451173">Archer (2005</xref>: 17) identifies the problem as the absence of a ‘ready fund of analytical units for differentiating components of the cultural realm that corresponds to those delineating parts of the structural domain (roles, organizations, institutions, systems). Instead … cultures are still “grasped” as a whole’. The way forward, she suggests, is to achieve better analytical tools.</p>
<p>Some have attempted to offer analytical frameworks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741143212451173">Hofstede (1984</xref>) distinguishes deep culture, the usually tacit and unconscious shared values of many organization members, and shallow culture, the visible signals of culture or the practice of members. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741143212451173">Bates (1987</xref>) contrasts the dominant culture, viewed across the organization from a horizontal perspective, with sub-cultures and counter-cultures perceived as going down vertically deep into the organization. In relation to schools, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143212451173">Prosser (1999</xref>: 7) offers a typology of ‘wider culture’ (the national and international context), ‘generic culture’ (of educators as a profession) ‘unique culture’ (the distinctive culture of a school) and ‘perceived culture’ (the culture as viewed internally and by those judging the school from outside). None of these frameworks have been widely used in relation to education.</p>
<p>A final characteristic of the study of culture is its propensity to attract metaphors both to communicate the nature of culture as a concept and to characterize individual instances; for example, culture is computer bits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741143212451173">Erickson, 1987</xref>), ‘compass’, ‘social glue’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143212451173">Clayton et al., 2008</xref>: 35), or ‘pixels in the picture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741143212451173">Lumby and Foskett, 2011</xref>: 452). An individual school culture is described as ‘the shopping mall school’ (Powell et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143212451173">1985</xref>) or, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1741143212451173">Stoll and Fink’s (1996)</xref> typology of five types of school culture: moving, cruising, strolling, struggling or sinking. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741143212451173">Lumby and Foskett (2011</xref>) note that the metaphoric language used may both reflect and encourage imprecision in thinking, where the illusion is given that the complex nature of an educational organization can be adequately captured by a word or phrase.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1741143212451173">
<title>What Are We Talking About?</title>
<p>Despite its widespread usage, part of the difficulty in the study of culture is that we cannot agree what we are talking about. Even the language shifts, with culture, climate and ethos argued to be different by some and used interchangeably by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1741143212451173">Schoen and Teddlie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1741143212451173">Van Houtte, 2005</xref>). Definition of culture is notoriously difficult. Some have adopted the strategy of listing elements:<disp-quote>
<p>an organized set of thoughts, beliefs, and norms for interaction and communication; it is about how people treat each other, how they value one another, how school staff work together and get along together in a professional and personal sense, it is the consensus about what is important. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741143212451173">Sailes, 2008</xref>: 74–75)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Others adopt an all-inclusive generality, ‘the peculiar and distinctive way of life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1741143212451173">Sparkes, 1991</xref>: 5) and, most famously, Bolman and Deal’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143212451173">1991</xref>: 252) ‘the way we do things around here’. What most definitions hold in common is reference to a discernible pattern in human behaviour and its physical setting.</p>
<p>Few of the attempts at definition or establishing analytic units have attracted widespread adherence. Consequently, it is tempting to turn away from the exhausting profusion of literature in the ‘culture wars’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1741143212451173">Martin, 2002</xref>: 6). Some have suggested abandoning the concept’s use entirely, in favour of other theoretical frameworks for studying the differences in belief and action which characterize groups and organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1741143212451173">Van Oord, 2008</xref>). However, if culture can be conceived as the net effect of visible and invisible rules that shape the choice options for thought and action, it remains a powerful sculptor of educational organizations, of what is easy, difficult or virtually impossible to achieve. Consequently leaders, whether they will or not, work with culture; even ignoring culture is a cultural choice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1741143212451173">Schein (2011</xref>) advocates that leaders set aside attempts at definition and instead focus on working with culture, understanding it and influencing it, adopting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143212451173">Archer’s (2005)</xref> position that culture shapes the organization’s performance and that each leader can influence culture to some degree.</p>

<title>Culture and Educational Leadership</title>
<p>Links have been made between education and organizational culture from as early as the 1930s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1741143212451173">Waller, 1932</xref>). By 1987, Erickson could already offer an overview of thinking on school culture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143212451173">Prosser (1999</xref>) suggests that research in the 1960s and 1970s was dominated by quantitative studies of climate related to school effectiveness, but that this metamorphosed from the 1980s onwards into school culture research that employed a wider range of methods. The British Educational Index evidences a very wide use of the concept from the 1970s, with an exponential rise in its use since then, from 42 articles in the 70s to 829 in the first decade of the 21st century. The flow shows no sign of abating. Culture is indicated as a distinct phenomenon invested in a range of units; in socio-economic classes, such as the white, working class, in education sectors, the culture of higher or further education, in an organization, the school culture, in a location within the organization, a classroom culture, in professional groups – for example, particular subject teachers – or even in approaches to teaching and learning, the culture of a subject’s curriculum A range of adjectives is used to describe culture, some with positive or pejorative connotations: a learning culture, a professional development culture, an entrepreneurial culture, an audit culture or an examination culture.</p>
<p>It was not until the 1980s that organizational culture appeared as a central focus in <italic>Educational Management Leadership &amp; Administration </italic>(<italic>EMAL</italic>) articles, rather than as a rather general concept referred to in passing. Even then, it was in relation to ‘Asian culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741143212451173">Dimmock, 1998</xref>: 363), that is, within the ‘multi-cultural’ area rather than as organizational culture itself. A handful of articles followed in the new millennium concerned with the culture of professionalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741143212451173">Quicke, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1741143212451173">Timperley and Robinson, 2000</xref>), of teaching and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741143212451173">Busher and Barker, 2003</xref>), of phase of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143212451173">Bell and Kent, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143212451173">Lumby, 2003</xref>) or mode of leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1741143212451173">Woods, 2007</xref>). This small number of articles focused on culture contrasts sharply with the hundreds during the same period that referred to culture in passing, as synonymous with context, as in the school culture; or sometimes as a goal, changing the culture.Within <italic>EMAL </italic>from the journal’s inception in 1972 to this 40th anniversary issue in 2012, the word culture appears at least once in over 500 articles, 39 per cent of all the journal’s articles. Its ubiquity does not necessarily indicate depth of engagement; rather, the opposite.</p>
<p>The conviction that culture and the performance of an organization are linked is strong. The origins of this may lie in part with 1980s and 1990s corporate evangelists, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1741143212451173">Peters and Waterman (1982</xref>) or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741143212451173">Kotter and Heskett (1992</xref>), whose espousal of culture as a performance enhancing tool has been taken up enthusiastically in education. Spillane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741143212451173">2005</xref>) notes the widespread adherence to the notion of a charismatic leader who can transform culture and thereby a school’s fortunes. Recent commentators have suggested that the evidence linking culture and performance is tenuous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143212451173">Clayton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143212451173">Martin et al., 2004</xref>). Such assertions have not dented the attachment of many educators and researchers to culture as key to an organization’s performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143212451173">Harris, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1741143212451173">Woods et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-1741143212451173">
<title>Culture, Praxis and Power</title>
<p>The nature of literature on culture in <italic>EMAL </italic>and elsewhere may reflect in some sense the practice of many educational leaders. The articles in <italic>EMAL </italic>with ‘culture’ in the text fall into two categories; the minority that focus on defining and discerning organizational culture in some depth, and the large majority that refer to culture in indistinct terms, synonymous with organizational context or with a general approach to a particular area of activity. The most prevalent orientation to culture is reference to a single organizational culture, presenting it as a loose, undefined context, referred to rather as cultural wallpaper or background culture ‘muzak’. There are many references to changing culture (Busher, 2005; Lance, 2010), but infrequent deep engagement with how this might be understood and the ethical implications of doing so.</p>
<p>The integrationist ideological perspective is strongly evident and deeply embedded in normative prescriptions for educational leadership. For example, the UK National College for School Leadership (NCSL) has offered a range of publications where a recommended process is the production of a clear vision as precursor to a strong culture, as in a case study ‘A strong leadership culture emanating from a clear vision’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143212451173">NCSL, n.d.</xref>). Strong culture is taken to be desirable. The integrationist perspective assumes that organizations can unite behind a single culture that is benign and supports the interests of learners (Gold et al., 2003). It is doubtful if this is a credible position in the light of much evidence that schools and colleges do not work equally well for all learners (Carter and Osler, 2000; Martina, 2006). The dominant culture is likely to be working in each school or college in favour of some and disadvantaging others. In other words, culture is implicated in the modulation of power.</p>
<p>The dimensions of power are multiple and contested (Haugaard, 2002). Nevertheless, there is some agreement that power is enacted not just by overt coercion or the exercise of mandated authority. Power is also exerted covertly through the structures, processes and agency that shape what can be thought, what can be discussed and what can be disputed or resisted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143212451173">Lukes (2002</xref>: 43) suggests that covert power channels people’s thought so that ‘they accept their role in the existing order of things, either because they can see or imagine no alternative to it, or because they see it as natural and unchangeable’.</p>
<p>The effect of organizational culture matches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143212451173">Lukes’ (2002)</xref> description of covert power. It makes ways of thinking and acting seem natural and unchangeable (Lakomski, 2001). Without obvious coercion, nevertheless it shapes possibilities. It is not possible to transgress cultural boundaries without risking serious penalties (Freidenberg, 2009; Gilligan, 1988). Viewed as an embedded shaping of human activity, culture matches exactly what Bachrach and Baratz (2002) call the ‘mobilization of bias in the community’, privileging the values and interests of one group over others by means that may not be overtly or consciously intended to dominate. Culture is one structure for the negotiation of power exercised through mundane everyday activity (Willis, 2008). It is one of the ‘dividing practices’ sought by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741143212451173">Foucault (2000b</xref>: 326) that cannot be escaped. An individual or organization may determine to step outside an existing culture or to change it, but it remains the defining point of reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143212451173">Bishop et al., 2006</xref>; Spicer and Böhm, 2007). Culture is a fundamental shaping and disciplinary force on which organizations depend. Culture and the divisions it embodies are therefore a necessary focus of leaders and a particularly potent medium for those who aim to support social justice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1741143212451173">
<title>Cultural Arenas</title>
<p>Such underlying issues of power are more frequently implicit than explicit in plans to influence culture. Rather, educational leaders generally focus on action in the arenas in which culture exerts pressure and is subject to pressure:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>the cultural context created by global phenomena external to the organization, but which may nevertheless exert powerful internal pressures;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the cultures of local communities impacting on how learners and their families engage with the organization and with learning;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the organizational culture, comprising the ways in which one school or college differs from another down the road;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the sub- and counter-cultures of staff and learner groups within the organization that may be aligned to or in opposition to the organizational culture.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Each level offers choices for leaders to position themselves and to engage more consciously in the negotiation of culture and power.</p>
<sec id="section7-1741143212451173">
<title>The Global Context: Pressure on Culture</title>
<p>The good and ill resulting from globalization, or even whether such a thing exists, is deeply contested. Nevertheless, there are widespread expressions of concern that transformed technologies and communication have in turn transformed economic and political relations and, of particular relevance, shifted the contract between the state and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143212451173">Apple, 2000</xref>). The new relationship cascades down through schools and colleges, reflected in cultures that strongly influence what is perceived as possible.</p>
<p>Leadership practice is arguably formed by such cultural shifts. For example, there is evidence of strong forces shaping leaders’ choices and actions in relation to a competitive orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741143212451173">Ball, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741143212451173">Davies et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741143212451173">Gibson and Asthana, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1741143212451173">Yates, 1999</xref>), and relationships with staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741143212451173">Blackmore, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741143212451173">Jeffrey, 2002</xref>) and learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741143212451173">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143212451173">Locker and Cropley, 2004</xref>). The degree of acceptance and or resistance is the focus of numerous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143212451173">Hill, 1998</xref>). Educational leaders act as buffers between cultural pressures reflecting global pressures and the organizational culture. Many would claim that in developing their organization’s culture they are not reflecting global trends but a personal and deeply held vocation. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that leaders in education are immune (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1741143212451173">Wallace et al., 2011</xref>). The evidence suggests wide-scale and similar cultural change across schools, colleges and universities in many parts of the world. In order to assess the degree to which they and their organization's culture have been pervious to global cultural pressures, education leaders might search for evidence within their organization that reflects the prevalent global valorization of competition, efficiency and standardization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741143212451173">Luke and Luke, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Local Communities and Culture</title>
<p>The second arena of culture relevant to educational leaders is that of local communities. There is some agreement that the external cultures of local communities influence, in many cases decisively, the progress of learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1741143212451173">Lee, 2008</xref>). Educators’ judgements about the nature and worth of external cultures are habitually filtered through a viewpoint shaped by the professional acculturation of teaching. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741143212451173">Erickson (1987</xref>) outlines a range of professional assumptions about, for example, whether ability is innate and relatively fixed, and the necessity for schools to intervene strongly to compensate for family deficits in developing language and reading. Educational leaders may feel intuitively that these are correct assumptions, though Erickson points out that they are both contested and culturally specific. Assumptions about goals may also be culturally influenced. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1741143212451173">Quiroz et al. (1999</xref>) highlight a Latino parent's negative response to a teacher's report of ‘outstanding' work. Standing out is viewed negatively within collectivist cultures. External cultures therefore impact directly on students’ attitudes and practice and are also refracted and impact through the assumptions and value judgements embedded in how educators view external cultures.</p>
<p>To change outcomes for many learners, not only internal but external cultures or the relationship between the two may need to change. The debate then moves to how educational leaders can exert influence on community cultures or shape their internal culture to reduce friction between the two. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1741143212451173">Pérez Carreón et al. (2005</xref>) document the cultural tensions between immigrant parents and their children’s school in the USA. The authors conclude that a meaningful relationship based on trust is needed, with at least one social actor in the school in order for there to be genuine communication and interaction between cultures. Writing on Native American learners in the USA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143212451173">Kincheloe and Staley (1985</xref>) find students for whom the experience of school is so alien there is no conflict of culture, because there is no perceived connection between school and home. Disconnection relates to educational failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741143212451173">Bates, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1741143212451173">Willis, 1977</xref>). Other students hold the two as distinct options, moving between them, adapting to each. A third category of student is those who experience home and school as culturally aligned and find no disjunction. The values embedded in the dominant organizational culture and in the curriculum are arguably aligned more strongly with the culture of the middle or upper socio-economic class of the majority of policymakers and teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741143212451173">Araújo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143212451173">Lumby, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1741143212451173">Whyte (1960</xref>: 362) 50 years ago asserted that the majority of parents ‘do not wish the great cycle of which they are part reversed, but intensified’. They do not wish to change or step beyond their own culture, but for themselves and their children to be as successful as possible within its boundaries. Attempts to enroll learners in a culture that is alien to them therefore presents deep moral issues; making success dependent on conforming to the dominant culture even more so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1741143212451173">Whyte, 1960</xref>). Is the aim of leaders then to assimilate learners into the dominant culture of the school so there is no mismatch, or to import the values of external cultures into the school, or to find some accommodating middle way? Explicit choices among these strategies are rare. Leaders’ engagement with the culture of local families and communities remains arguably, in most cases, superficial. Community representatives are invited to participate as governors, join the parent teacher association, or to give presentations at school/college meetings or events. Parents are rhetorically feted as important partners although research evidence suggests that they are generally held at arm’s length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1741143212451173">Walker and MacLure, 2005</xref>) and some are seen more as ‘intractable problems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143212451173">Moles, 1993</xref>: 21). There are no easy prescriptions for how to relate internal and external cultures, but developing staff’s cultural competency to question the socialized assumptions of the teaching profession and to develop trustful dialogue with external community members may be productive.</p>

<sec id="section9-1741143212451173">
<title>The Organizational Culture</title>
<p>Statements of vision or mission are cultural markers, public testimony to the educational equivalent of a corporate culture. Their typical content commits to develop the potential of all students and may be part of a general culture of hyperactive promotion of positive and optimistic attitudes presented to the public gaze in a performative environment. The normative position for managing the publicly projected organizational culture is set out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741143212451173">Sailes (2008</xref>: 75):<disp-quote>
<p>A culturally competent school effectively responds to the needs of its students representing various cultures by honoring, respecting, valuing and preserving the dignity of cultural differences and similarities between individual differences in theory and in practice where teaching and learning are made relevant and meaningful for all students.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>She (2008: 76) goes on to point out that evidence suggests this ideal is not achieved and that students in cultural out-groups ‘are often plagued by problems such as the achievement gap, overrepresentation in special education, suspension and expulsion rates and high drop-outs’. Culture may be at least a part of the explanation for the gulf between intention and outcome. Assertions of inclusiveness in the publicly presented culture misrepresent the culturally divisive nature of educational organizations.</p>
<p>Assumptions about thinking and learning, curricula, teaching and assessment are culturally shaped (Hilberg and Tharp, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741143212451173">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143212451173">Merriam, 2008</xref>). Periodic reviews of curricula rarely result in radical change as the latter is confined to what is culturally valued by the dominant group. For example, vocational education, however defined, is more culturally valued in some countries and by those from some cultural backgrounds than others. Its place in the curriculum reflects its local cultural value. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741143212451173">Sailes (2008</xref>: 76) suggests that the platform for much teaching is ethnocentric and middle class, but that this is concealed behind a belief that ‘good teaching is transcendent’, rather than shaped by the culture of the dominant group. Even though demonstrably ineffective for many out-groups, the accepted technical processes of ‘good’ teaching and assessment remain the gold standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1741143212451173">Sparkes, 1991</xref>). By a cultural sleight of hand this mechanism of cultural dominance may be supported by out-groups as much as the in-group. The response to children’s resistance to curricula and learning that they experience as in tension with their cultural background is often reactive disciplinary measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1741143212451173">Slee, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1741143212451173">Thompson and Bell, 2005</xref>) that take little account of the perspective of learners but instead bolster the culturally shaped experience of schooling. Students themselves often accept this analysis and believe that the problem is primarily their behaviour rather than also the school’s practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143212451173">Lumby, 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1741143212451173">
<title>Sub- and Counter-cultures</title>
<p>People create cultures that underlie the quasi-corporate culture by forming groups around the multiple identities of staff and learners; for example, relating to subject specialism, length of tenure of role or geographic location of one’s home. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1741143212451173">West (1999</xref>) points out, such groups are usually led by an individual who establishes cultural norms of attitude or behaviour or even territory. Resistance to whatever action a head teacher or teacher requests may be an auto reflex embedded in the group cultural norms.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143212451173">Becher’s (1988)</xref> metaphor of a theatre stage may capture how sub-cultures function. There is the public performance of culture projected from the stage to all in the auditorium. Backstage, there may be less open manipulations, hidden from the wider public view; finally, there is under-stage activity buried deep, even from the view of the main actors. On the open stage are the symbols and rituals of the corporate culture; the physical signs of uniform, how space is used, to whom it is allocated, the tenor of meetings of staff and students, the way community members are expected to address one another, and the vision/mission statement. Backstage are other less openly communicated cultural strategies, for example, controlling entry. Which students and staff are recruited is a powerful shaper of culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1741143212451173">Van Houtte, 2005</xref>). Under-stage is a melee of counter-cultures, where students and staff resist and subvert the cultural boundaries of the organization by tactics such as aberrant dress and hairstyles, acts of disruption, or humour directed against management or teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1741143212451173">Prasad and Prasad, 2000</xref>). Myriad intentional and post hoc constructed acts of resistance reflect the power interplay of students and staff as they attempt to strengthen or dismantle cultural restrictions.</p>
<p>Each group serves the psychological needs of its members by providing protection and self-affirmation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143212451173">Schein, 1965</xref>). A primary concern is status within the group and in relation to other groups, achieved by demonstrated conformance to whatever the norms of their own group may be. Adolescent gangs in school are cultural groups that, denied the status of academic attainment, construct other criteria, such as toughness or risk taking. It is beyond the scope of the article to explore further the culture of learners’ gangs or those of professionals. It is, however, evident that whatever the purported rationale for such groups, at the heart is a desire to be safe from psychological or physical attack and to be valued and rewarded. Leaders who wish to encourage sub-culture groups to move in a particular direction will need to consider how far the direction suggested actually respects the group's cultural choices or the contrary. Communicating ‘care’ in a way that implies disrespect or disagreement with the cultural choices of a learner is a weak counter to the power of his or her group culture.</p>
<p>Adopting a differentiation perspective and engaging with sub-cultures and community cultures is arguably more challenging for education leaders than dealing with a single organizational culture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143212451173">Bryson (2008</xref>) suggests a methodology to achieve a fuller picture of the multiple and developing cultures of an organization. She uses Williams’ (1980) analysis of dominant, emerging and residual cultures. Emerging cultures are those in formation, perhaps triggered by new staff or new circumstances; residual cultures are those that linger from an earlier time, perhaps before the current principal arrived or in earlier funding regimes. Both emergent and residual cultures may present alternatives to the dominant culture or be actively in opposition to it. She suggests using a wide range of data from many people internal and external to the organization to identify the residual and emerging cultures from multiple perspectives in order to better understand culture as a dynamic and contested phenomenon and not a static, unitary reality.</p>

<title>Leaders Competence to Influence Culture</title>
<p>How then can leaders respond to the phenomenon of culture? In reviewing educational management and leadership literature over 40 years, several perspectives are apparent in relation to managing culture and the competence necessary to do so. The skills to influence organizational culture do not figure largely. Far more evident are the skills necessary to respond to ‘multi’ cultural issues, related to the notion of increased diversity and particularly ethnic diversity in learners and educators (Grobler, 2006; Henze et al., 2001; Shah, 2006). There is also interest arising from notions of internationalization, particularly in higher education, leading to interest in ‘inter’ cultural issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1741143212451173">Trahar, 2011</xref>). Implicit in these distinctions are judgements about engaging with ‘culture’. On the one hand, multi-cultural and inter-cultural perspectives are widely perceived to demand cultural competence of a particular kind to accommodate the cultures deemed most distant from the norm, those of visibly different ethnic minority students (Lumby with Coleman, 2007). On the other hand, are integrationist perspectives on organizational culture, where similar cultural competence is not indicated as a requirement. Rather, what is demanded is skill in creating a single culture to which all are intended to subscribe as a means of raising performance in the school, college or university (Bolden et al., 2009; Sun-Keung Pang, 2006). Consequently, cultural competence in educational leadership is much more often interpreted as related to ethnicity issues and not to the much wider range of cultural issues in schools, colleges and universities, where the provenance of cultures may be traced to multiple sources including socio-economic class, home location, family occupations and gender.</p>
<p>There are, of course, potentially many ways of interpreting the reasons for this bifurcation in attitude. One perspective might argue that the cultures of ethnic minorities are indeed different enough from the majority culture to demand the development of skills to read the multi-cultures to ensure that minority students and staff are not excluded by the majority culture (Lopez, 2003; Mackay and Etienne, 2006). Simultaneous maintenance of a strong organizational culture is also beneficial, because this embeds values and attitudes supportive of learning and good citizenship and so of advantage to all. A more critical interpretation would view the motivation and aims quite differently. On both sides of the bifurcation, cultures of those perceived as other are subject to control, not by overt aggression but by subtle cultural power plays that attempt to enrol the other in the core values and life view of the dominant group (Bourdieu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143212451173">1993</xref>). The greater attention paid to understanding minority ethnic cultures perceived as having a greater degree of difference, and the concessions made in some changed practice, may be proportionate to the perceived degree of threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741143212451173">Milliken and Martins, 1996</xref>). Cultural competence is a distinct requirement relative to the degree of perceived difference from the dominant group. The cultures of those of different socio-economic class, or affiliation to a different lifestyle but who are nevertheless not so visibly different, provoke less anxiety, leading to the deployment of only the strategy of encouragement to join the culture of the dominant (Gudykunst, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741143212451173">1995</xref>; Gurin and Nagda, 2006). Cultural adjustment is not necessary in the face of a perceived lesser threat. Competence in reading the different cultures is therefore not seen as necessary. Seen in this light from a critical perspective, the exhortation to educational leaders to create ‘strong’ culture takes on a quite different resonance to that intended in many education leadership texts.</p>
<p>From a normative perspective, the manipulation of culture in education has been of limited success in many countries as it has largely not achieved the aspiration of greater social movement and equity (OECD, 2010). The UK's record is particularly poor among developed countries. From a critical perspective, the culture strategies of education have been successful in achieving what was intended (Lumby, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143212451173">2012</xref>). They have helped to retain or intensify existing power structures through establishing norms and deviation, and encouraging the deviant individual or group to see the dominant culture as superior, even though it may be resisted (Spicer and Böhm, 2007). The dominance and values of one group are perceived as ‘natural and unchangeable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143212451173">Lukes, 2002</xref>: 43) and resistance is unprofitable. The culture of a group that resists may paradoxically support members psychologically and simultaneously hold them in tension with the dominant culture, thereby confirming the strength of the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1741143212451173">Willis, 1977</xref>). Attempts to challenge inequality-producing norms risk reinforcing them through acknowledging them, engaging with them and giving them attention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1741143212451173">
<title>So, Where To?</title>
<p>Given that there is doubtful agreement on what culture is, limited tools to research it, but a conviction of its link to inequity, how can the field look to progress? We have known for decades that the dominant culture of educational organizations excludes many (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1741143212451173">Willis, 1977</xref>). Looking back over 40 years of references to culture in <italic>EMAL</italic>, a persistent turning away from this uncomfortable knowledge is evident in many articles’ casualness in referring to culture. Education leaders consciously want to create the most positive environment they can for the largest number of learners. Those who present prescriptions for how to achieve this through creating and sustaining a ‘strong’ culture are misleading. They are encouraging education leaders to join the ranks of those who for 40 years have skated the surface of culture. Others who suggest that culture is not a useful concept, that it is too vague, too difficult, that it is beyond influence, achieve the same effect; to discourage leaders from thinking deeply about culture.</p>
<p>The position suggested in this article is different, assuming that, while organizational cultures cannot be controlled, they can be influenced to some degree and that deciding on the direction of influence is a key moral challenge for leaders. In doing so leaders may need to accept both conceptual and methodological limitations as a product of the problem. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143212451173">Lukes (2002</xref>) believes that there are certain concepts that will be inevitably and continuously disputed. Culture may be such a concept, yet we may need to set aside the frustrations and engage, because culture has generally sat in our peripheral vision since the initiation of this journal. Educational leaders are aware of it, but we have neither the tools to see it completely and straight on, nor the critical perspective that may be necessary to engage deeply. Nevertheless, the juggernaut that is only partially seen at the edge of our vision remains a juggernaut with considerable potential constructive or destructive power. Superficial engagement with culture is, in effect, a decision to perpetuate the status quo with all its inherent inequalities.</p>
<p>A dilemma confronts educators striving to influence culture for greater equity; the deeper and more critical the analysis, the more paralysing the results appear to be. Consequently, devising an agenda for progress is testing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143212451173">Bryson (2008</xref>: 746) points out that integrationist approaches to culture, though patently flawed by over-simplification, offer a practical agenda to leaders, and this may be one root of their popularity for proponents and recipients. By contrast, she argues, differentiation and fragmentation perspectives may offer a fuller explanation, but little in the way of ‘tools for action’. Being encouraged to think rather than being offered prescriptions for action may be received as unsatisfactory. Foucault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143212451173">2000a</xref>: 236) was subject to similar criticism of his complex critiques that some claimed led only to paralysis. He argued that critique ‘doesn't have to be a premise of a deduction that concludes, “this, then, is what needs to be done.” It should be an instrument for those who fight, those who resist and refuse what is’. He argued for the legitimacy of firstly changing one's own thinking, and then using such thinking to work through the conflicts in daily life.</p>
<p>In line with this stance and with an interactionist understanding of the relentless persistent negotiation of culture and community (Fernback, 2007), this article does not offer a formula for creating a strong culture or for re-culturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143212451173">Dimmock and Walker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143212451173">Hargreaves, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1741143212451173">Schein, 1997</xref>). It has used a review of culture in the field for the last 40 years to suggest that integrationist perspectives embedded in normative encouragement to action are likely to perpetuate the kind of inequities that currently exist in much education. Rather than focusing on changing others, the goal is changing oneself, and understanding more fully one's own culture and its relationship with the alternative and oppositional cultures that exist in each organization. If it is not possible to capture in full the rich, diverse and often conflicting melee of cultures evolving over time in an organization, some progress may be achieved in understanding and engaging with the richness. Currently, knowledge and understanding derived from research are not valued unless there is impact, suggesting a separation between the two, one distinct from the other. The contrary belief is that knowledge and understanding are change in themselves. Greater understanding of culture may be the most sustainable tool to enable leaders to make persistent adjustments more authentically to relate to the cultures in their organization.</p>
