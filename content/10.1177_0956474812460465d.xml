<p>Long ago, in a monochrome Britain, Bush House offered a flavour of the multicultural nation we were to become.</p>
<p>Home to the BBC World Service, the grand 1920s building in the heart of London nurtured multiple languages and ethnicities for more than 70 years. A “benign tower of Babel” was how BBC Director General Mark Thompson described the building in the last bulletin broadcast from Bush House in July.</p>
<p>It was an apt description of the labyrinthine corridors and cluttered offices. Passing an open door, you might hear a guttural burst of Arabic, while in the canteen, you could catch the quick-fire patter of Vietnamese or Burmese, or the sing-song tones of the Chinese. Then, popping into the ladies loo you might hear a lively conversation in Russian going back and forth between cubicles. And how many offices have helpful signs for “foot-washing facilities available on the 4<sup>th</sup> floor”? Bush House did. And the non-Muslims barely noticed when their colleagues disappeared for Ramadan prayers.</p>

<p>All that continues, of course, at the World Service's brand new home in Broadcasting House. Now, those animated Russians spill out of state-of-the-art studios, which mark a vast improvement on the much-loved but worn and clunky broadcasting cupboards of Bush House. Staff on English-language programmes sit at smart new desks alongside once-alien domestic radio colleagues. Indonesians smoke pungent clove cigarettes in Portland Place instead of the Strand.</p>
<p>So what if Bush House has closed then? It was just a building after all. Not quite. Bush House was always much more than its marble-clad staircases and art-deco halls. Even within the sometimes haughty circles of the far-bigger domestic BBC (and certainly amongst its competitors), “Bush” was respected as an ethos as much as a place: the embodiment of thoughtful, outward-looking journalism and a hub of international expertise. How will that survive the move?</p>
<p>The emptying of Bush House coincides with the slashing of World Service budgets. Further upheaval comes from the Foreign Office, once its funder and protector, now casting the corporation's international arm adrift.</p>
<p>The changes were announced in late 2010 when the World Service was already adapting to shrinking budgets. The new Conservative government demanded further savings — of 16 per cent. Five language services closed almost immediately. Radio broadcasts in seven others stopped, including Russian and Chinese (they're mostly online services now; there's also Russian TV). Shortwave signals in six more were switched off. The BBC's only daily English-language programme dedicated to European news disappeared.</p>
<p>There were other, less headline-grabbing casualties: an editor here, a producer there. Fewer slots for original documentaries, more repeats. And, perhaps most ominous, the letting-go of the experts. Off went the China, Russia and Central Asia specialists. The Arab analyst was let go in the middle of the Arab Spring. These were people you could call on for a steer on a complex story or at a minute's notice to deliver live analysis on air. Their jobs no longer exist.</p>
<p>There are of course still many people within the World Service with extraordinary knowledge and a real interest in the forgotten — as well as the more commonly reported — parts of the world. They are amongst the BBC's greatest assets, the staff who lend authority and credibility to BBC news and current affairs. But for how much longer?</p>
<p>In that same spending review, the Foreign Office announced that from 2014 it would no longer fund the World Service through a grant-in-aid. It will be paid for through the television licence fee, just like any other part of the BBC.</p>
<p>Except, of course, it is not like any other part of the BBC. While up to two million people a week do listen to World Service English radio programmes in the UK, that's not who the broadcasts are meant for. Everything the World Service does is directed at its 180 million strong audiences overseas. When it comes to deciding whose needs and wants come first in future, there's no way the BBC bosses can put the foreigners anywhere near the top of the list.</p>
<p>Promises have been made about budgets being protected. Affectionate lip service has been paid to the importance of the World Service and the need to keep the Bush House ethos alive. I'm not sure how it will happen without real commitment from the top of the BBC and from the government. They could start by explaining to the British public why the World Service is worth paying for. It is, after all Britain's most successful export, one of the few institutions aside from the Monarchy that provokes both affection and respect for this country overseas.</p>
<p>The World Service has lost resources and its much loved home; by 2014 it will have lost a quarter of its staff and its separate source of funding. Yes, there will be big benefits from working more closely with colleagues from other departments day-to-day. But the institution's leaders will have to be more confident and innovative if they are going to hold their own in a financially-embattled BBC.</p>
<p>For example, what about broadcasting some of the language services to the Diaspora audience in the UK, such as Somali, Bengali or Urdu — languages spoken by communities within Britain but rarely reached through domestic BBC programmess? They are also the communities most often associated with alienation and questions of Britishness. Why not bind them to Britain through one of its greatest institutions, the World Service of the BBC?</p>
<p>“Nation shall speak peace unto nation” is the BBC's motto. And so it shall. But the respected voice of this nation is already getting fainter. With the closing of Bush House, it's going to need all the help it can get to be heard.</p>
