<abstract>
<p>To test the efficacy and safety of corticotropin-based immunotherapies in pediatric opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, 74 children received corticotropin alone or with intravenous immunoglobulin (groups 1 and 2, active controls); or both with rituximab (group 3) or cyclophosphamide (group 4); or with rituximab plus chemotherapy (group 5) or steroid sparers (group 6). There was 65% improvement in motor severity score across groups (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), but treatment combinations were more effective than corticotropin alone (<italic>P</italic> = .0009). Groups 3, 4, and 5 responded better than group 1; groups 3 and 5 responded better than group 2. The response frequency to corticotropin was higher than to prior corticosteroids (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Fifty-five percent had adverse events (corticosteroid excess), more so with multiagents (<italic>P</italic> = .03); and 10% had serious adverse events. This study demonstrates greater efficacy of corticotropin-based multimodal therapy compared with conventional therapy, greater response to corticotropin than corticosteroid-based therapy, and overall tolerability.</p>

<body>
<p>In 1990, the National Pediatric Myoclonus Center was established to help children with myoclonus, and it began to specialize in opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811428816">1</xref>
</sup> in response to unmet needs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811428816">2</xref>
</sup> Because opsoclonus-myoclonus is rare, it was not feasible to develop a traditional randomized controlled trial. Instead, as new immunotherapies emerged, so did the opportunity and imperative to test their capacity to improve on remission and reduce the residual deficits that complicate opsoclonus-myoclonus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811428816">2</xref></sup> For these reasons, a prospective study to compare the efficacy and safety of opsoclonus-myoclonus immunotherapies was designed.</p>
<p>After evaluating treatment outcomes with corticosteroids, our center turned to high dose adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or corticotropin,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811428816">3</xref>
</sup> expanding on established protocols for infantile spasms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811428816">4</xref>
</sup> Intravenous immunoglobulin was added to the regimen in 1992.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811428816">5</xref>
</sup> The use of multimodal therapy started as a 3-agent regimen in 1994, first with steroid sparers, such as azathioprine,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811428816">6</xref>
</sup> and later, with mycophenolate mofetil<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811428816">7</xref>
</sup> or cyclophosphamide.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811428816">8</xref>
</sup> With the discovery of cerebrospinal fluid B-cell expansion as a biomarker of disease activity for opsoclonus-myoclonus in 2000,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811428816">9</xref>
</sup> the preferred third agent changed to the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811428816">10</xref>
</sup> By 2004, 4-agent immunotherapy (inclusive of chemotherapy) also was evaluated.</p>
<p>The first of the 2 predefined hypotheses was that the multimodal combination of corticotropin with anti–B-cell therapy, chemotherapy, or non–lymphocyte-depleting drugs (steroid sparers) would be more efficacious than conventional agents alone (corticotropin with or without intravenous immunoglobulin), which is standard-of-care therapy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811428816">2</xref>
</sup> Our second hypothesis was that failure of response to corticosteroids or partial improvement would not prevent subsequent response to corticotropin, based on its greater efficacy in our clinical experience.</p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This was a prospective, rater-blinded, exploratory study of corticotropin-based immunotherapies in previously untreated or steroid-treated opsoclonus-myoclonus, focusing on long-term rather than acute efficacy of 6 open-label treatments given with prophylactic medications and measures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073811428816">Table 1</xref>). Through comparison with conventional agents alone, it was active comparator controlled. An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence regardless of causality assessment. A serious adverse event was an adverse event that was immediately life threatening, required hospitalization, was disabling, or resulted in death. The primary end points were reduction in clinical severity relative to baseline (posttreatment total score and percentage improvement in total score).</p>

<p>Seventy-four children with opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073811428816">Table 2</xref>) were recruited to the National Pediatric Myoclonus Center from 1990 to 2008 by physician and patient referrals, or through our website (www.omsusa.org). Parents signed informed consent. Neuroblastomas were excised prior to inclusion in the study and handled in accordance with standard practice. The Center worked with local collaborating physicians, but all patients returned for re-evaluation at least once.

For the latter, patients were videotaped using a standardized set of instructions, and the coinvestigator (EDT) scored the videotapes (cued by assistants) blinded, using a 12-item motor scale rated 0 to 3 in severity to compute total score: 0 to 12 (mild), 13 to 24 (moderate), 25 to 36 (severe).<sup>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Distributional characteristics for each variable were examined to determine the most appropriate type of statistical test to be utilized (parametric/nonparametric). Chi-square tests of independence, or exact tests as appropriate, found no significant differences between the 6 treatment groups on dichotomous variables (sex, corticotropin dose, opsoclonus-myoclonus etiology, prior steroid use). Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests (nonparametric analysis of variance) were used to compare the groups on ordinal variables and continuous measures that were relatively skewed (age of onset, duration to diagnosis, baseline test age, baseline severity, level of steroid response), and a nonparametric multiple comparisons procedure was used in follow-up. To test hypothesis 1, two-way analyses of variance (group × time) were used to compare the groups on their changes in total score from baseline to post initiation. Follow-up comparisons were made with predesigned contrast comparisons (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Secondary statistical analyses performed on data pooled into preplanned groups are described. To test hypothesis 2, a paired <italic>t</italic> test was used for comparison of total score on steroids and then on corticotropin in the same patients. Bowker test of symmetry (3 × 3 table), a modification of the McNemar paired χ<sup>2</sup> test for a table higher than 2 × 2, was used for global assessment comparisons.</p>

<title>Corticotropin-Related Adverse Events</title>
<p>The main corticotropin adverse events were signs and symptoms of corticosteroid excess (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883073811428816">Figure 3B</xref>), which were reversed with corticotropin tapering or discontinuation. Four patients (5%) were treated with antihypertensives (group 2, propranolol and furosemide; group 3, chlorothiazide; group 4, hydrochlorothiazide). Parental compliance with recommended salt reduction was merely fair; many children got treats of salty processed food, though a few of them did not become Cushingoid. In an analysis stratified by length of corticotropin treatment (&lt; 1 year and ≥ 1 year; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883073811428816">Figure 3B</xref>), there were no significant differences between groups, even in bone fractures (<italic>P</italic> = .12), based on treatment duration.</p>
<p>The weight percentile in all groups combined was significantly increased after therapy: pre 46 ± 6, post 64 ± 6 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001, paired <italic>t</italic> test). The effect on weight percentile was attributable to corticotropin-treatment for ≥ 1 year (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), not &lt; 1 year (<italic>P</italic> = .14). The height percentile did not change: pre 54 ± 7, post 50 ± 7. There were no statistically significant differences between the corticotropin ± intravenous immunoglobulin groups and the multimodal groups. Mean body mass index rose by 40% post-treatment in the multimodal group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001; pre 18.5 ± 2.6, post 25.9 ± 3.7). In the conventional treatment group, it increased by 41% from 15.8 ± 4.2 to 22.3 ± 5.4 (<italic>P</italic> = .038). There were no significant differences between these groups.</p>
<p>There was a significant difference between the 6 groups on “hunger,” <italic>P</italic> = .019: the corticotropin + intravenous immunoglobulin + rituximab + steroid sparer group had a higher rate of hunger (3/6 = 50%) than the corticotropin + intravenous immunoglobulin group (0/17 = 0%), <italic>P</italic> = .011. When collapsing the groups receiving treatments other than corticotropin and intravenous immunoglobulin, a significant difference was again detected for hunger, <italic>P</italic> = .043.</p>
<p>For corticotropin-associated side effects, the occurrence of stomachache was significantly related to duration of treatment, <italic>P</italic> = .0080: the median duration for those with stomachache was 3.0 years (mean, 3.3 Years; SD, 1.6), for those without stomachache, 1.4 years (mean, 1.5 Years; SD, 0.9).</p>
<p>Of the 8 children with bone fractures (11%), details were available on 7. Six of 7 fractures (86%) resulted from falls. Six were in the upper extremity (1 finger, 2 wrist, 2 arm, 1 unspecified) and one was in the lower extremity (knee). No child had more than one fracture, and all healed uneventfully.</p>
<p>Twelve of 74 children (16%) had an adrenalectomy as part of the neuroblastoma resection. By χ<sup>

</sup> analysis, there were no significant differences in corticotropin-related adverse events between those 12 and the 62 (84%) without adrenalectomy.</p>
<p>On adverse event rates, the 6 groups differed significantly on “infection requiring intravenous antibiotics” (<italic>P</italic> = .022), “port infection” (<italic>P</italic> = .035), and “medication added” (<italic>P</italic> = .0032). Follow-up comparisons indicated the rate of infection requiring intravenous antibiotics for those receiving corticotropin + intravenous immunoglobulin + rituximab + chemotherapy was higher (4/8 = 50%) than for those receiving corticotropin + intravenous immunoglobulin + rituximab (2/30 = 6.7%), <italic>P</italic> = .012. Similarly, the rate of port infection was higher for those receiving corticotropin + intravenous immunoglobulin + rituximab + chemotherapy (2/8 = 25%) as compared with those receiving corticotropin + intravenous immunoglobulin + rituximab (0/30 = 0%), <italic>P</italic> = .040. The median duration of corticotropin treatment for those with infection requiring intravenous antibiotics was 2.3 years (mean, 2.3 Years; SD, 1.2), while the median duration for those without infection requiring intravenous antibiotics was 1.4 years (mean, 1.6 Years; SD, 1.0; <italic>P</italic> = .025). The groups did not differ significantly on the proportions of subjects who were off all immunotherapy.</p>
<p>To determine if multimodal immunotherapy posed significantly greater risk than conventional therapy, the 2 collapsed groups were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883073811428816">Figure 3C</xref>). The total number with adverse events (<italic>P</italic> = .032) was significantly higher with multimodal therapy; and there also may have been a trend for emergency room visits (<italic>P</italic> = .054), but not other adverse events.

<title>Serious Adverse Events</title>
<p>Seven patients (10%) had serious adverse events, which were heterogeneous in etiology. Three required hospitalization. There was 1 patient each with hypoglycemia (adrenal insufficiency treated with hydrocortisone), anemia, hypertension, rotovirus with dehydration, and syncope. One child in group 6 developed a septic hip in the setting of fever and transient neutropenia, which was diagnosed early and treated by antibiotic, intravenous immunoglobulin, and surgical drainage, with swift full recovery. Blood and synovial fluid cultures were negative. Corticotropin was discontinued abruptly without relapse.</p>
<p>An 8-year-old from group 3 died unexpectedly during a brief spell suggestive of a seizure, cardiorespiratory event, or asthmatic attack. After treatment for 1 year, she was in remission from motor aspects of opsoclonus-myoclonus on corticotropin 31 IU/m<sup>2</sup> every other day; but she had extreme rages requiring psychiatric hospitalizations. Under the care of her local physicians, multiple neuropsychotropic or antiepileptic drugs, some concomitantly, had been tried; and clonazepam, topiramate, and ziprasidone were stopped just before her death. Electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, and serum immunoglobulin concentrations were within normal limits. Postmortem examination did not reveal a cause of death. A voluntary MedWatch alert was filed with the US Food and Drug Administration.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is the first prospective, controlled study to compare efficacies of corticotropin-based immunotherapies in the largest group of pediatric opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome to date. It identifies corticotropin and intravenous immunoglobulin as beneficial, also finding additional efficacy for multimodal therapy. Although this study was not designed to evaluate efficacy during the first few months of therapy, these results show significantly less clinical improvement in the conventionally treated children after the first treatment year. Positive response to corticotropin-based therapy was independent of neuroblastoma discovery, indicating that children whose studies are negative for neuroblastoma should not be treated less aggressively for opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome.</p>

<p>Conventional immunotherapy failures spurred us to develop multimodal immunotherapies. The future of opsoclonus-myoclonus therapeutics is to arrive at evidence-based, disease-modifying therapy. This study, despite its limitations, is a step toward that process and provides Class III evidence. Multimodal immunotherapy is an expensive proposition, and the need for cheaper yet more effective agents or combinations is evident. Even so, currently available combination immunotherapy does make a difference in improving outcomes. Given the gravity of opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome and the lack of equally effective agents with fewer side effects,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811428816">2</xref>
</sup> the use of these immunotherapies seems justifiable. In view of our data, the standard bar for “acceptable” residual neurological deficits should be raised to zero tolerance. Further studies of treatment safety and risk stratification in opsoclonus-myoclonus are necessary.</p>
