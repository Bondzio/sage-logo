   <body>
      <p>All over the world, the challenges of defining the scope and boundaries of the degree of public recognition and accommodation that ought to be given to religious faiths and practices have come to occupy a place at the forefront of the public debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1358229112468377">Shachar, 2011</xref>: 1).</p>
      <p>These challenges are particularly acute in respect of religious symbols – one of the most visible manifestation of religion – and take a particular importance in the school context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1358229112468377">Hunter-Henin, 2012a</xref>: 10). State schools are both the bedrock of a nation’s values and the means by which it helps to form good citizens. Education, moreover, clearly belongs to the public sphere, which includes the state education system. State schools represent emblematically the chosen national model of Church/State relationships – and that model is often the result of historical conflicts in which schools were the battleground. Schools, from the state and independent sectors alike, are vital places for the building of a cohesive society and for the transmission of the nation’s cultural heritage – including its religious traditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1358229112468377">Häußler, 2001</xref>: 465). Consequently, any challenge to a given legal solution aimed at accommodating religious freedoms in school is often perceived as a direct threat to a nation’s identity.</p>
      <p>The recent radicalisation of the debate in certain European jurisdictions with legislation banning the wearing of full-face veils in the whole of the public sphere<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1358229112468377">1</xref>
         </sup> has increased the sensitivity of the chosen topic.</p>
      <p>In this rather confrontational context, Erica Howard’s monograph provides a welcome note of moderation, conciliation and negotiation.</p>
      <p>In this conciliatory tone and in a very accessible style, Howard takes her reader to an impressive number of various jurisdictions, whether at national or supra-national level. The breadth of her analysis thus includes England, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, the United States and Canada as well as the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and EU law. The focus of the book is on judicial activity and therefore also usefully covers a wealth of case law. The starting point of the analysis is the legal basis that is available to a claimant who wishes to wear a religious symbol in derogation to a given applicable school policy. This legal emphasis is reflected in the structure of the book. Following a summary of the arguments generally put forward in favour or against European bans on religious symbols (Chapter 2), the book is split between the various legal basis potentially available in such claims: a breach of the human right to freedom of religion, essentially<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1358229112468377">2</xref>
         </sup> under Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights (Chapter 3); a breach of anti-discrimination laws (Chapter 4); and a claim based on the concepts of either ‘reasonable accommodation’ or equality duties (Chapter 6). The legal basis is here construed as the conceptual basis for the claim rather than as the specific provision which is invoked. Indeed, if a human rights perspective is more likely to be associated with the European Convention on Human Rights,<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1358229112468377">3</xref>
         </sup> anti-discrimination provisions with EU directives<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1358229112468377">4</xref>
         </sup> and equality duties with the UK Equality Act 2010,<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1358229112468377">5</xref>
         </sup> protection against discrimination is sometimes also invoked under the auspices of the European Convention when Article 9 protecting the right to freedom of religion is combined with Article 14; and, more generally, anti-discrimination provisions can always arguably be seen as the negative side of equality duties. This overlap is well acknowledged by the author, who jumps with ease from one provision to the other. More fundamentally, this overlap between provisions lies at the heart of the author’s demonstration.</p>
      <p>The justification tests – identified as the area where the greatest overlap is noticeable between legal basis – receive particular attention in one of the central chapters of the book (Chapter 5). The similarities revealed in the tests<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1358229112468377">6</xref>
         </sup> then ground the proposal that, whatever the legal basis applicable, the justification test could be enforced in the same way – which Howard would wish to be one of strict proportionality.</p>
      <p>Before commenting on this proposal, brief observations may be made on the method adopted. The focus on the justification stage is one of the great assets of the book. Justification, explains Howard, is about the balancing of different rights (p. 102). Motivated by the wish to serve all interests at stake and to suggest pragmatic workable solutions, the focus on justification thus generates avenues for conciliation between what are sometimes perceived by contrast as incompatible clashing rights.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1358229112468377">7</xref>
         </sup> Amongst the concrete examples of subtle balancing is mentioned, for instance, a Swedish case<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1358229112468377">8</xref>
         </sup> relating to a student who wanted to wear a <italic>niqab</italic>
         <sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1358229112468377">9</xref>
         </sup> in the presence of male students. Her request was accommodated in a very practical way: rather than being asked to choose between her training and the <italic>niqab</italic>, she was allowed to sit at the front of the class, where she could take her <italic>niqab</italic> off without fear of any male peer students seeing her face (pp. 122, 142). Naturally such a refined balancing exercise is difficult to transpose to other cases. A similar compromise could not be recommended, for example, in a case where the pupil or student refused to be taught by male teachers unless her face was fully veiled. One may also argue that in instances where teaching not only entails the imparting of knowledge by a teacher but requires interactive contributions by students themselves, the covering of the face in class or seating arrangements in rows could be seen as a hindrance to communication between students.</p>
      <p>Beyond these practical considerations, the adopted approach potentially carries important theoretical consequences. These are not included in the present book but the exclusion does not diminish their potential influence.</p>
      <p>The implicit theoretical suggestion of the book seems to me that law (at least in the field of religious symbols at school) should be seen as a tool for <italic>negotiation</italic> between the diverse interests at stake.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1358229112468377">10</xref>
         </sup> Sociologically, this emphasis on negotiation (which I would personally endorse) would seem to allow a more individualized analysis of the personal reasons and motivations of each claimant. The importance of understanding personal motivations behind individual acts and requests cannot be emphasised enough.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1358229112468377">11</xref>
         </sup> This attention to individual motivations is indispensable if law is to be committed to protecting and promoting individual autonomy. In line with many feminist studies, this contextualized approach also avoids the pitfalls of making sweeping statements such as the crude suggestion, implicit in most European bans on religious symbols, that autonomy, feminism and religious beliefs can never be reconciled.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1358229112468377">12</xref>
         </sup>
      </p>
      <p>The emphasis on justification could therefore be the means to overcome the dichotomy between equality and human rights and to stimulate dialogue, beyond the tensions between constitutionalism and pluralism.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1358229112468377">13</xref>
         </sup>
      </p>
      <p>Such an approach could, moreover, help to demystify culture,<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1358229112468377">14</xref>
         </sup> by reducing it to one factor amongst many to be taken into account in the case. Viewed in this light, the cultural factor would thus be an element for understanding the motivations of the claimant but would not become a trump card whose presence would automatically trigger by itself a legal response (whether of rejection or acceptance). This fragmentation of culture into the diversity of the circumstances of cases ties in with socio-legal and comparative law research on multiculturalism.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1358229112468377">15</xref>
         </sup>
      </p>
      <p>This cultural dimension of the book is only implicit. Erica Howard clearly concentrates her attention on the tests applied by the courts and mainly studies European jurisdictions. However, the Western homogeneity of the context does not preclude deep cultural divides between legal traditions.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1358229112468377">16</xref>
         </sup> Admittedly, the chosen terms for comparison were likely to undermine any possible cultural differences amongst jurisdictions.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1358229112468377">17</xref>
         </sup> Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1358229112468377">Basil Markesinis and Jörg Fedtke (2009)</xref>, for example, has proven that convergence is more likely to emerge through the comparison of court decisions and practices than through the comparison of legal systems. It may well be that comparison of the former type is to be preferred to the latter. After all, if law is to be seen as a tool for negotiation, is this judicial pragmatic approach to comparison not more consistent than one which would threaten to reify legal traditions into abstract models and risk losing the multiple possible bridges and similarities between jurisdictions?</p>
      <p>To sum up, the book implicitly seems to embrace a feminist, neoliberal view of law, defined as a vehicle for negotiation; a fragmented and contextualized approach to culture; and a court-based approach to comparative law. All of these theoretical premises contribute to strengthen individual autonomy and promote meeting grounds for competing interests and competing national traditions. Each of these premises is, however, hotly disputed.</p>
      <p>Putting aside this broader theoretical debate, Erica Howard, no less interestingly, develops a different argument. Having analysed the various legal basis available to claimants, Howard observes that all the possible legal bases potentially available provide for justification tests. She then notes that all of these justification tests are quite similar. Indeed, the question raised is always whether a restriction or limitation has a legitimate aim and whether the means used to pursue this aim are proportionate and necessary. Finally, very similar considerations are taken into account by the courts under all these tests (p. 127). Therefore, Howard concludes, it does not appear to make much difference on which legal regime a claim will be based or whether the issue is presented as a violation of freedom of religion or as a breach of anti-discrimination rules. What varies is the way that the test is applied. This is less dependent on the legal basis which is used than on the court that applies it.</p>
      <p>Let us take for example the cases, both analysed in the book,<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1358229112468377">18</xref>
         </sup> of <italic>Dogru v. France</italic>
         <sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1358229112468377">19</xref>
         </sup> and of <italic>Begum</italic>,<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1358229112468377">20</xref>
         </sup> heard respectively by the European Court of Human Rights and the House of Lords. The House of Lords showed a greater attention to detail and adopted a stricter proportionality test (although arguably still not strict enough) than the European Court of Human Rights. Indeed, in <italic>Begum</italic>, the House of Lords noted how that particular school had gone to great length to devise a school policy in consultation with members of the local religious groups and school governors, the majority of whom were Muslims. It also considered the interests of other Muslim school pupils in that particular school by referring to actual fears expressed by other Muslim girls attending the same school of being pressured into wearing the <italic>jilbab</italic> should Ms Begum’s wish to do so be accommodated. By contrast, the analysis of proportionality carried out by the European Court of Human Rights in <italic>Dogru </italic>was much further detached from the facts of the case. The European Court considered in very general terms that the French school authorities’ assessment of the incompatibility, for security and hygiene reasons, of the wearing of the veil with sport activities was not unreasonable (para. 73) and that the rather heavy sanction of expulsion was not disproportionate given the possibility for the student to pursue her education through distance learning (para 75). The European Court chose in that case to examine the underlying principles and ignored the consequences that their application had on the facts. The willingness of the applicant in the case to substitute the headscarf for a cap or a hat was thus not discussed by the Court. The margin of appreciation granted to Member States in effect precluded any meaningful proportionality test.</p>
      <p>However, suggests Erica Howard (p. 112), the European Court of Human Rights could have been as demanding as the House of Lords. Tools were available to the Court to that end and indeed in some other instances, in relation to other Convention rights, the Strasbourg Court has shown far less deference. The wide use of the margin of appreciation concept in relation to religious symbol cases is indeed not satisfactory. It works like a shield used by the Court to shy away from political pressure rather than as a coherent mechanism designed to articulate national state sovereignty with human rights review. The swift overruling of the first chamber decision<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1358229112468377">21</xref>
         </sup> by the Grand Chamber<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1358229112468377">22</xref>
         </sup> in the <italic>Lautsi</italic> case illustrates the compelling force of political pressure in this context and the convenient use of the margin of appreciation by the European Court as a response. This is all the more unsatisfactory given that legal arguments (indeed mentioned by the Grand Chamber)<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1358229112468377">23</xref>
         </sup> would have been sufficient to justify the decision by the Grand Chamber on the basis of proportionality alone.</p>
      <p>However, even if these arguments had been more vehemently asserted, such a proportionality test would still have been much looser than the one used by the House of Lords in <italic>Begum</italic> and, even more so, than the one advocated by Erica Howard.</p>
      <p>According to Howard, the proportionality test in such claims should always include consideration of whether the educational institution could have dealt with the request in a less stringent way and could have accommodated the request (fully or at least partially) without suffering an undue burden. Such implicit duty to accommodate requests to manifest one’s religion could be read, she says, within present justification tests. However, the facts that it is not, and that the proportionality test used varies considerably depending on the court that applies it, cannot be dismissed briskly.</p>
      <p>Underlying issues regarding the legitimacy of judicial power and the overall consistency of legal systems and cultures arise. Is it really surprising to see that the House of Lords in <italic>Begum</italic> has developed a proportionality test which imposed a rather stringent duty on schools to consult widely with the local community before drawing up or amending their school uniform policy but which in practice left little space for renegotiation of this policy in the face of individual requests for derogation? This position was in line with the relevant legislation, the Education and Inspections Act 2006 (in preparation as the case was heard), which emphasized the need for schools to promote social cohesion. The local community emphasis of the Act is well reflected in the House of Lord’s judgment, as is the neglect in both of the individual dimension of the case (with the exception of Lady Hale dissenting). Without a strong individual focus in the legal surrounding framework, it is unlikely that a duty to accommodate religious individual requests would be read by judges in human rights claims.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, such a duty is much more likely to arise if such claims are considered on the basis of anti-discrimination legislation. Indeed the focus is then inevitably on the potential harm (directly or indirectly) caused to the particular claimant (as representative of a particular ethnic or religious group). Holding the institution responsible for accommodating individual requests (unless disproportionate consequences for the institution or others were to follow) seems therefore a possible and logical way of ensuring that the steps taken were non-discriminatory. By contrast, such a positive duty on the educational institution need not be imposed if the implicit underlying goal is (merely) to maintain harmony with the main local communities. In other words, the legal basis may, therefore, matter. It may be no coincidence that the successful claims in this area have been judged on the basis of anti-discrimination provisions.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1358229112468377">24</xref>
         </sup>
      </p>
      <p>This is not to say that anti-discrimination provisions always provide a more powerful legal basis or that human rights claim will necessary fail. Some proportionality test will be carried out in human rights cases and may well turn in the claimant’s favour. In the Turkish case of <italic>Ahmet Arslan</italic>,<sup>
            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1358229112468377">25</xref>
         </sup> the European Court of Human Rights thus held that the banning of a religious symbol was disproportionate. In that case, the prohibition of a peaceful religious event in the streets was held to amount to a disproportionate interference with religious freedoms. The principle of <italic>laïcité</italic>, even in the tense Turkish context, could not justify an absolute prohibition of religious public display, in the absence of a present proven threat to public security. Several factors, according to the ECtHR, pointed to a lack of necessity for the prohibition: the targeting of mere ‘citizens’ (para. 48), rather than public agents or teachers who could be reasonably submitted to more stringent restrictions; and the extension of the prohibition to ‘ordinary public places’ such as public streets (para. 49), rather than public buildings where the connection to the State could warrant a greater obligation of religious discretion. The court also remarked that the plaintiffs were members of a group devoid of influence or political ambitions (para. 51).</p>
      <p>With these qualifications and nuances in mind, it nevertheless seems that the stringent proportionality test proposed by Erica Howard would be far more likely to be applied in claims based on anti-discrimination than on human rights, and would have a greater chance of success before national courts than before supra-national institutions.</p>
      <p>The conclusion reached by the author, whereby the chosen legal basis and the court that applies it do not matter, may therefore need some nuance. In turn, this shows that ‘legal cultures’ of particular courts and particular jurisdictions – albeit not set in stone _ may not be dismissed entirely:</p>
      <p>The main advantage of thinking about law in the same breath as culture is that it alerts us to cultural variation in how law is thought about and its ascribed and actual role in social life. But we also need to learn about our own cultural common sense. […] When we find that foreign institutions do not perform as we expect them to, we may be too quick to describe their claims as myth rather than recognising that in some respects, nothing can be as important as a myth.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1358229112468377">Nelken, 2002</xref>: 128)</p>
      <p>If subtle cultural variations cannot be avoided, neither can one ignore the need to search for conciliation through more and better use of proportionality tests and negotiation processes. Erica Howard proposes exactly that: a strict and well-balanced test calculated to increase harmony, integration and autonomy in educational institutions across Europe. With this thoughtful and balanced proposal, Howard’s contribution to the debate on religious symbols in schools cannot be avoided either.</p>

               <p>Council Directive 2000/78/EC, for example, contains a general justification in its Article 2(5) which is quite similar to the justification given in the second paragraphs of Articles 8 to 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The same similarities can be detected between justification tests under Articles 9(2) and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, the EU Equality Directives and national anti-discrimination law. </p>
