<abstract>
<p>This exploratory study examines the information seeking and use behaviors of a group of US retired or near-retirement investors from everyday life information seeking and serious leisure perspectives. Although primarily qualitative, it also collects and analyzes quanitative data to describe retired investors’ information preferences and use. Semi-structured interviews and journaling are used to examine the information seeking behaviors of a diverse group of investors and to assess the impact that personal characteristics, such as sex, socio-economic status, and educational attainment have on their behaviors. Findings suggest that the female investors studied were less likely to create information intensive fields and that this tendency is exacerbated by low educational attainment. Furthermore, the male investors studied were more likely to adopt Internet technology for their investing information seeking regardless of their educational attainment. Recommendations are made for improving information services to this important segment of the population.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The largest generation in US history, the baby boomers, is heading rapdily towards retirement. By the year 2030, more than 72 million of them, an estimated 20% of the nation’s population, will reach age 65 or older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961000611434761">US Census, 2008</xref>). Over 50% of these older Americans own stocks and bonds, amounting to approximately $7.63 trillion: 20% of all such investment instruments held by the US population. Older investors’ financial success is clearly important to the overall health of the market, as well as to their own personal well-being. The urgent need for baby boomers to be capable investors is compounded by several trends. First, life expectancies are increasing by more than 32% since 1970 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000611434761">Anonymous, 2010</xref>). The average retiree can now expect to live 17–20 years post retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000611434761">Anonymous, 2010</xref>). Given steadily increasing health care and pharmaceutical costs, baby boomers’ savings will not only have to last longer, they will have to cover greater expenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961000611434761">Wenning, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, there has also been a dramatic decline of coverage by traditional, professionally managed pension plans: from 1985–2005 the number of private sector pensions declined from 114,000 to 31,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961000611434761">GAO, 2004</xref>). During that same period distributed contribution (DC) plans have nearly doubled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961000611434761">GAO, 2004</xref>). Thus retirees will have increasing responsibility for managing their financial portfolios. According to the Government Accountability Office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961000611434761">GAO, 2004</xref>: 31):<disp-quote>
<p>All of these developments magnify the importance of achieving rates of return on savings high enough to produce sufficient income for a secure retirement. In this environment, individuals will need to become more educated about financial issues, both in accumulating sufficient assets as well as learning to draw them down effectively during a potentially long retirement.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, investing is a complex process. It entails ‘gathering information, analyzing the information and making a decision based on that information. Investors’ opinions derive from their beliefs regarding the accuracy of the information they have obtained and their ability to interpret it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961000611434761">Nofsinger, 2008</xref>: 11). Investment information is prolific in the digital era, yet availability does not guarantee people will incorporate the best resources into their decision making. Clearly the ability to identify, locate, evaluate, select and use information is essential to successful investing. This is all the more true in the course of unmediated stock ownership, in which the onus for selecting and evaluating information falls on the shoulders of individual investors.</p>
<p>This study examines the information seeking and use of retired and near-retirement investors. It seeks to understand and describe their information behaviors and identify gaps between their information needs, values, and use. The knowledge generated by this research has the potential to inform the design and delivery of investment-related information products and the strategies library and information science (LIS) professionals use to attract, serve and educate older investors, as well as contribute to the growing body of research on information seeking in everyday life contexts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0961000611434761">
<title>Literature review</title>
<p>This study is based on the everyday life information seeking (ELIS) and serious leisure perspectives. Previous research on investor psychology informs this study. Research on investors’ information seeking and use also guide this inquiry, as do studies on the information seeking behaviors of older people. Early in the study, gender distinctions became an obvious focus of the findings. Thus, previous studies that include a gendered perspective are also particularly useful for this work. Each body of literature will be discussed in turn.</p>
<sec id="section3-0961000611434761">
<title>Information seeking theory</title>
<p>Until recently, information seeking research in the area of investing had focused on academic and workplace environments; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961000611434761">Kuhlthau (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961000611434761">Baldwin and Rice (1997)</xref> examined the information seeking behaviors of professional securities analysts, for example. However, for most investors, who are not professionals, investing falls into the categories of leisure and self-care. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961000611434761">Savolainen’s (1995)</xref> ‘everyday life information seeking’ (ELIS) model and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611434761">Stebbins’ (2009)</xref> serious leisure perspective inform the approach taken to this research. Although these bodies of research have grown too prolific for a thorough review here, a brief discussion of their fundamental concepts provides a useful context for this study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0961000611434761">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>As defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961000611434761">Savolainen (1995</xref>: 267), ELIS ‘refers to the acquisition of various informational (both cognitive and expressive) elements which people employ to orient themselves in daily life or to solve problems not directly connected with the performance of occupational tasks’. The ELIS model is concerned both with the set of dispositions individuals bring to information seeking and with the context in which it occurs. More specifically, it emphasizes how the effect of an individual’s material, social and cultural (cognitive) capital interacts with ‘the specific features of the problem situation that generate information seeking’ to determine his or her information use choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961000611434761">Savolainen, 1995</xref>: 267).</p>
<p>The ELIS perspective, then, is concerned with understanding the diverse ways in which individuals construct what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611434761">Savolainen and Kari (2004)</xref> call information source horizons, which they define as an imaginary landscape that provides the context for information seeking. Information source horizons are of two types: ‘first, relatively stable horizons indicating the ways in which people tend to value information across situations and second, the dynamic, that is, problem – or situation-specific horizons sensitive to the unique requirements of the task at hand’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961000611434761">Savolainen, 2008</xref>: 277). This study examines the second type to understand how individuals’ source horizons both enable and constrain information use for investing.</p>
<p>As will be demonstrated later in this study, some investors’ interest in investing extends beyond self-care, which is defined as the set of specific projects required to maintain order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961000611434761">Savolainen, 1995</xref>). For this reason, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611434761">Stebbins’ (2009)</xref> work is helpful in understanding the motivations of information seeking within the context of serious leisure, which he defines as (p. 622):<disp-quote>
<p>the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer core activity that people find so substantial, interesting, and fulfilling that, in the typical case, they launch themselves on a leisure career centered on acquiring and expressing a combination of its special skills, knowledge, and experience.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Stebbins outlines the features of serious leisure that distinguish it from other types of activity, including perseverance (positive feelings that come from ‘sticking with it through thick and thin, from conquering adversity’), career-like dedication based on special knowledge, skill and training, the derivation of durable benefits such as self-esteem and self-enrichment, in addition to pleasure, and the development of special social worlds which grow up around the leisure activity (p. 626). This study will assess how investors arrange or rearrange the elements of their information source horizons to accommodate their unique leisure activity (in this case, investing). Contextually focused case studies, such as this one, are important for advancing research on leisure realms, and this study of retired investors will contribute unique knowledge to this growing body of literature.</p>
<p>Finally, the set of dispositions people bring to their ‘mastery of life’ is also an important determinant of information seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961000611434761">Savolainen, 1995</xref>). Although the author approached this research with Savolainen’s cognitive/affective and optimistic/pessimistic orientation in mind, once data analysis began, it became evident that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434761">Bruce’s (1997)</xref> seven faces of information literacy were more useful for categorizing investors’ inherent information seeking styles. Although Bruce’s phenomenological work does not originate from the ELIS or serious leisure perspectives, it is theoretically compatible with them, because it is both experiential (based on the experiences of individuals) and relational (concerned with the qualitative interaction between people and information). Although disparate language is used to describe the object of study across these perspectives, ultimately they are each concerned with describing the set of dispositions individuals bring to the process of identifying, selecting, and using information.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434761">Bruce (1997)</xref> found that her participants exhibited one of seven unique approaches to finding, managing, and using information. Characteristics of the relevant typologies will be more usefully described in the findings of this article. Unfortunately, Bruce’s conceptions did not neatly depict all investors in this study. The researcher believes this is due to the disparity in the demographic make-up of the participants in this and Bruce’s study. Bruce’s participants were all highly educated employees of academic institutions, and her findings may not reflect the conceptions of less sophisticated information seekers. Thus, though her work does not fit perfectly, it will be employed here, both because it is useful in making sense of the study’s findings and because this research may extend her findings by suggesting additional typologies exist.</p>

<sec id="section4-0961000611434761">
<title>Investor behavior</title>
<p>Research on investment behavior and information use also provides a foundation for this study. Reporting on their study utilizing a telephone survey of 911 randomly sampled US investors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961000611434761">Hira and Loibl (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961000611434761">2009)</xref> demonstrate the relationship between gender and what types and constellations of sources investors use. They found that the investors in their study (65% of whom were male and 35% of whom were female) fell into five clusters of information use: high, online, moderate, workplace, and low. Investors in the high and online categories were self-reliant, information driven and practice multi-source, diversified, high-information use strategies. Unfortunately, these investors constituted only 22% of investors studied. They were also highly likely to be male, well educated, and possess the largest financial assets. The moderate information strategy group (24%) practiced a broad but less frequent information use strategy and was also highly likely to be male and well educated. The remaining 54% of investors were primarily female with the lowest educational levels and financial assets. They exhibited low information use strategies. These strategies were characterized by the use of few, if any, formal, mediated information sources and the non-adoption of technology for investment information. Hira and Loibl’s clusters will be used to classify investors in the qualitative stage of this study. They also designated a workplace-oriented strategy, but because these investors are generally retired, it will not be utilized here.</p>

<sec id="section5-0961000611434761">
<title>Attitudes toward investing</title>
<p>Although 60% of women studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961000611434761">Hira and Loibl (2006)</xref> described themselves as the primary manager of household finances, only 15% reported being the primary manager of their investment portfolio. Female investors were 20% less likely to describe themselves as confident in their investing abilities (w: 50%, m: 70%) and knowledgeable about investing (w: 50%, m: 70%). Low self-efficacy may help explain why, when it comes to information seeking, women were 10% less likely than men to ‘research it myself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961000611434761">Hira and Loibl, 2006</xref>: 62). Women were also more likely than men to exhibit negative attitudes toward investing, more often describing it as stressful (w: 80%, m: 68%), difficult (w: 71%, m: 61%), and time-consuming (w: 75%, m: 72%), while men were more likely to call it exciting (m: 69.7%, w: 61.7%) and satisfying (m: 80.8%, w: 78.4%) (p. 65).</p>

<sec id="section6-0961000611434761">
<title>Information seeking and use</title>
<p>Older studies, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961000611434761">McKay et al. (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961000611434761">Peter D. Hart Research Associates (1997)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961000611434761">Mezick (2002)</xref>, suggested that investors prefer printed sources of information, such as newspapers, magazines, and annual reports. For example, Mezick found 77% of investors cited magazine and newspapers as the most frequently used sources of information for investors. Friends and relatives (69%), web pages (54%) and search engines (36%) followed. Financial advisors, television, and stockbrokers were each cited by less than 6% of those surveyed as primary information sources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961000611434761">Hira and Loibl’s (2006)</xref> findings were quite different: investors in their study cited financial advisors (28%), magazines and newspapers (22%), the Internet (21%) and the workplace (10%) as the most often used sources of financial information. Friends, television, radio, and classes all followed with less than a 5% response for each. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961000611434761">Williamson (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961000611434761">2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961000611434761">Williamson and Kingsford Smith (2010)</xref>, who studied information use by 520 online and predominantly male investors (outnumbering women five to one) found that 82% of their participants used the Internet for investment-related information: brokers’ websites were the most often used sources of information, followed by company investor relations websites, advice from brokers or analysts via email, general financial information portals, and financial data or charting services. Traditional media were used as well; 79.2% of online investors obtained information from newspapers and 55.5% from electronic media (radio and TV) at least frequently. The majority of participants in their study (62.8%) reported rarely receiving information or advice from family, friends, and acquaintances. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961000611434761">Williamson (2008</xref>: 10) reported that ‘this result turned out to be questionable during the individual interviews. There was much more discussion with family and friends than people either wanted to admit, or thought of admitting’. The disparity between self-report and actual behavior, particularly on this aspect of information seeking, is a key area of interest for this study.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961000611434761">Williamson (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961000611434761">2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961000611434761">Williamson and Kingsford Smith (2010)</xref> provide some insight into how online investors select information. In interviews with 26 investors selected from their larger pool of 520, they found that convenience/ease of access, and content were important criteria to all their participants, while reliability/accuracy, currency/timeliness, and speed of access were important to the majority of them. They identified several problematic areas in information seeking and provision, including participants’ higher levels of trust in information sources than might be warranted, a predilection for speed in the delivery of information, and the impact of information overload, which they speculate may be greater on information seekers less experienced than most of those who participated in their study. Overall, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961000611434761">Williamson and Kingsford Smith (2010</xref>: 69) conclude, however, that online investors are a ‘relatively engaged and knowledgeable group’, which, they add, is ‘by contrast to the wider populations of investors who research demonstrates are extremely difficult to engage, even in their own self-interest’.</p>
<p>Only one identified study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961000611434761">Wicks, 2004</xref>) examined older peoples’ information use for financial activities, but did not focus strictly on investing. He found that professionals, family, friends, and other interpersonal sources, and newspapers and magazines were the most often used information sources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961000611434761">Williamson and Asla (2009)</xref> suggested that older people, particularly as they enter the fourth stage in which increasing disability is experienced, rely on interpersonal sources of information regardless of the type of information needed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961000611434761">Williamson (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961000611434761">1998)</xref> found that financial issues continue to be one of a few important areas of information need well into old age.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961000611434761">Hira and Loibl (2006)</xref> provide some insight into how information use differs by gender. Their data suggest female investors use fewer information sources in general and prefer less formal, more personal sources of information. Women were less likely than men to cite magazines and newspapers (m: 25%, w: 15%), professional advisors (m: 30%, w: 25%), television (m: 5%, w: 2%), and radio m: 5%, w: 1%) as highly used sources, while they were more likely to obtain information from friends and colleagues (w: 11%, w: 7%), in the workplace (w: 11%, m: 9%), and by attending classes (w: 5%, m: 2%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961000611434761">Hira and Loibl, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0961000611434761">
<title>Technology and library use</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961000611434761">Mezick (2002)</xref> found that the growing popularity of the Internet, even in 2001, was having an impact on investors’ library use. Of the respondents in her study 55% reported using the Internet daily or weekly, while only 6% used library sources with that frequency for investment information. Convenience (38%), currency (14%), and ease of use (14%) were cited by respondents as the primary reasons for Internet adoption.</p>
<p>Adoption of technology for investing and investment information seeking also varied markedly by investor characteristics, such as gender and age. Women were 20% less likely to use the Internet for investing information and three times less likely to trade on the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961000611434761">Hira and Loibl, 2006</xref>). When asked why they did not use the Internet for investing and investment information, 85% of female investors surveyed indicated they preferred working with people, 49% worried about security, and 44% found financial websites confusing.</p>
<p>Overall, older adults are also less likely to adopt the Internet for information seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961000611434761">Laurich, 2002</xref>). Only two aged participants (14%) in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961000611434761">Wick’s (2004)</xref> study cited the Internet as a source of financial information. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961000611434761">Singh et al. (2010)</xref> also found that older adults are less likely to adopt Internet stock trading. Additional research suggests that Internet adoption in the older population is more highly correlated to educational attainment and socio-economic status than it is in younger populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961000611434761">Campbell and Nolfi, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Drawing on the conceptual ELIS and serious leisure conceptual frameworks, this study addresses the following research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0961000611434761" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What kinds of information sources do investors incorporate into the information source horizons in the context of seeking investment information? Does this vary by gender?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What is the relationship between individuals’ attitudes toward investing and their investment-related information seeking and use behaviors?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do the actual use behaviors of investors vary from their self-reported information values?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Research in the ELIS and serious leisure traditions is largely undertaken from a ‘person-centered perspective and also reflects a shift towards an increased use of qualitative methods’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961000611434761">Bates, 2004</xref>: 16). Although the focus of this study is qualitative, some quantitative data were gathered both for comparison to older data on information use and to provide a richer context for the ensuing interpretivist inquiry. For this phase, purposive sampling was used, and, while efforts were made to recruit participants from diverse ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds, the main criteria were age (50 or older), retirement status (retired or near retirement), and active involvement in managing investments. Participants were recruited late in 2008 through advertisements in the local city newspaper and two neighborhood papers. Flyers were also posted in senior citizen centers and other locations retired investors were likely to visit. Fifty-two people responded to the advertisement and provided either a mailing or email address. Forty-four (85%) usable surveys were returned; 24 from men and 20 from women (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0961000611434761">Appendix A</xref> for the survey instrument). This survey was used to gather demographic data and basic information about respondents’ information preferences and use. In addition to being informative in and of itself, information from surveys was also used to select a pool for the qualitative phase of the study. Researchers selected participants that represented the overall pool, but also included as much diversity as possible. An open-ended question asking respondents why they were interested in participating in the study was included and helped researchers select participants who were better informants. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961000611434761">Table 1</xref> compares the demographic data of 43 respondents in the quantitative phase (one of the 44 survey respondents, a male, refused to provide demographic data) to 13 participants in the qualitative phase.</p>

<p>The qualitative component of this study explored investors’ information seeking ethnographically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961000611434761">Sandstrom and Sandstrom, 1995</xref>). This approach is characterized by the systematic observation, description, and analysis of human behavior and emphasizes the contextual nature of informants’ perspectives. Fourteen participants were selected for an interview and journaling phase, but one female with an advanced degree ceased participating mid-study. Thus, the voice of highly educated women is not as well represented in the qualitative pool as it otherwise might have been.</p>
<p>The remaining 13 men and women participated in both elements of the qualitative study. Participants were chosen for this phase to achieve a careful balance of capturing as diverse a set of voices as possible, while selecting informants who were apt to provide maximum disclosure about their information seeking activities. The pool was composed of seven men and six women. All but one, a black female, were Caucasian. They had careers in multiple fields. From the ‘other’ category, one of the participants was in the arts and the other was a technician. All of the men and four of the women were fully retired, and two of the women planned to retire in the next five years. Income turned out to be somewhat irrelevant, as participants reported their current income. Having been retired for various periods, income did not truly reflect socio-economic status and was not comparable across investors. Type of occupation was used instead as a marker of socio-economic class, which is precedented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961000611434761">Savolainen, 1995</xref>). This measure has limitations, however, particularly for the older women in this study, whose social standing may have been determined more by the careers and income of their husbands than by themselves. In future studies, the researcher would explore richer ways for assessing socio-economic status.</p>
<p>Semi-structured interviews were conducted early in 2009 by the researcher and a graduate assistant and typically lasted approximately two hours. A narrative interviewing approach was taken, and interviewees were asked to relate a story about the last time they needed information for investing. Follow-up questions were used to clarify why sources were selected and how they were used. Investors were also asked to describe their feelings throughout the information seeking process. Interviews were held in a variety of locations, including public libraries and coffee houses. Follow-up interviews were generally administered by email exchange or phone call, lasting approximately an hour. A double-entry journal was used to record researcher observations and reflections. Interviews were also tape-recorded, with permission, to facilitate post-interview review and analysis.</p>
<p>The journaling phase began after the first interview and lasted four weeks. Journal prompts were provided that asked investors to describe their information need, the sources they consulted, how information was used, and how they felt about the information seeking process. Interview notes, transcripts, and journal entries were iteratively analyzed through inductive and deductive analysis. The trustworthiness of findings was insured by peer and member checking. The collection of multiple data sources triangulated findings, as well. It provided researchers with the opportunity to compare and contrast data which, on one hand, confirmed findings supported by each and, on the other hand, identified conflicting information that could be clarified in follow-up interviews.</p>

<title>Findings: Quantitative phase</title>
<p>The quantitative findings of this study provide a portrait of this group of investors’ information use that is richer in detail, but largely consistent with previous studies. Data also highlight the substantial differences between male and female respondents’ information use for investing. It is important to note that although the data for this small sample size are not generalizable, they are highly consistent with Hira and Loibl’s findings on investing and gender. Male participants reported engaging in research for investing more often and for longer durations than their female counterparts. Of the males (<italic>n</italic>=23) 96% indicated they research their investments weekly or daily compared to 45% (<italic>n</italic>=9) of the females. On the other hand, 40% of the women reported engaging in research quarterly or sporadically. Although self-reported data are often less than reliable, data gathered from information seeking journals support the conclusion that the male investors in this study spent more time searching for information that did the female investors. This will be further discussed with the qualitative findings.</p>
<sec id="section10-0961000611434761">
<title>Information use</title>
<p>Participants were asked both about how they valued information (‘which sources are most important?’) and their intended information behaviors (‘which sources are you most likely to use?’) (See <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0961000611434761">Appendix A</xref> for the instrument used to collect data). The discrepancies between their values, reported behavior and actual behavior (as measured by journal reports) provide important information about how LIS professionals might intervene to help close such gaps.</p>
<p>Participants were asked to rate the importance of 12 types of information to their investment decision making on a scale of 1–5, with 5 being very important and 1 being not at all important. (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961000611434761">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Weighted averages for ratings are included in parentheses in the following discussion. Overall, investors rated historical performance (4.07), analyst opinion (4.05), stock price (3.93), and company financials (3.90) as the most important types of information. Personal knowledge of and experience with a company (3.88), stock, bond and mutual fund guide ratings (3.81), broker opinion (3.12), industry financial ratios (3.12), and measures of volatility (3.10) followed. The least important types of information for all participants were the social and environmental behavior of companies (2.74), other people’s opinion, (2.59), and the geographic location of companies (2.29).</p>
<p>As demonstrated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961000611434761">Figure 2</xref>, when broken down by sex, however, these rankings vary.</p>

<p>For female investors in this study, analyst opinion (4.44), historical performance (4.39), personal knowledge and experience (3.94), and brokers’ opinion (3.89) were the most important types of information (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0961000611434761">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Clearly the data reveal a distinction not only between what information the male and female respondents valued, but also what they actually used, which, although it is not generalizable, is consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961000611434761">Hira and Loibl, 2006</xref>). Female investors used fewer and less diverse sources. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0961000611434761">Figure 5</xref> illustrates lower use for females in every category of source type except for ‘other people’, which is also consistent with previous findings that females prefer personal sources of information (Hira and Loibl).</p>

</fig>
<p>The gap is particularly wide for Internet use: 51% fewer women (45%) than men (96%) in this study reported it being a likely source of information, which will be further discussed in the technology section below. Although 60% of the women respondents reported using magazines and articles compared to 88% of male respondents, when asked to identify which publications they used, women reported fewer titles then men. Men cited an average of 1.83 additional publications; the <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic> at 29% (<italic>n</italic>=7), <italic>Kiplinger’s</italic> at 29% (<italic>n</italic>=7), and <italic>Smart Money</italic> at 17% (<italic>n</italic>=4) were most frequently reported. On the other hand, female investors cited only .7 titles per person. <italic>Fortune</italic> and <italic>Smart Money</italic> were named by 20% (<italic>n</italic>=4) and 15% (<italic>n</italic>=3) of women investors, respectively. With very few exceptions, these publications were either purchased through subscriptions or accessed on the Internet.</p>
<p>Participants were also asked to indicate their use of stock, bond, and mutual fund rating sources, such as <italic>Standard &amp; Poor’s, Mergent’s, Value Line</italic>, and <italic>Morningstar</italic>. Seven (35%) female respondents indicated they used an average of 1.9 of these sources. Eleven (46%) of male respondents used an average of 2.1 sources. Nearly half the investors who used a rating service (7 of 18) indicated they used the free versions of the sources available on the Web. One investor accessed these sources through his broker’s website. Half of the investors (9 of 18) accessed them at the library. In fact, nine of the 10 investors who reported using the library reported that they used these sources in print format.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0961000611434761">
<title>Technology and library use</title>
<p>Male respondents’ nearly complete (96%) adoption of the Internet for investing is interesting given the older population studied. In contrast, only 45% of the female respondents reported using the Internet for their investment information seeking. Respondents were also asked about Internet access to determine whether or not adoption was an issue of access. All but two (92%) of the male investors accessed the Internet from home. Both of the men without home access reported using the library to access the Internet for investing and investment information seeking. Of the female investors 15 accessed the Internet from home and one from work. Four indicated they did not have access to the Internet. Of the 11 (55%) women who had not adopted the Internet for investment information seeking, only five of them were prevented from doing so by lack of access.</p>
<p>Although the Internet was widely adopted by these male respondents for information seeking, it was not for online trading: only three of 24 males (13%) reported this activity. An additional female, who had an advanced degree, also reported trading online. The other online activities of these investors are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0961000611434761">Figure 6</xref>.</p>

<p>Use patterns were similar across sex, but note that this element of data is primarily about male respondents, since fewer than half (45%) of the female respondents used the Internet for investment information seeking, while 96% of the men did. Participants reported low rates of library usage. Seven of 24 males (29%) and three of 20 (15%) females reported seeking investment information in a library in the past two years. Only two (8%) males reported using a library website for investment research. Unfortunately, since prior use data is unavailable, it is unknown how much of a decline in usage this represents.</p>
<p>The quantitative findings of this study provide useful data about this group of investors’ information use, but little insight into what motivates varied use patterns. The qualitative phase of this research explores how investors seek and use information more deeply and analyzes what internal and external conditions influence their behaviors.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0961000611434761">
<title>Findings: Qualitative phase</title>
<p>As stated previously, qualitative data were obtained through interviews and journaling. It is important to note that, with one exception, male participants’ journal entries were both more frequent and more detailed than female participants’ entries (m weekly average: 16.3 entries, w weekly average: 7.6 entries). Because of the disparity in the amount of data, the findings on actual behavior (versus described behavior garnered from interviews) generated from the journal component of this study provide a somewhat richer understanding of male behavior than of female behavior. At the same time, this disparity is, in and of itself, a significant finding, and data revealed that participants clearly fell into three categories: information intensive, moderate information use, and low information use. Each group was defined by both the frequency of information seeking episodes and by the quantity and diversity of sources used. The following discussion is organized by the aforementioned categories and includes precise definitions of each.</p>
<sec id="section13-0961000611434761">
<title>Information-intensive investors</title>
<p>Information-intensive investors sought information three or more times per week every week of the study, averaging five times weekly. The number of incidents of research reported in their journals ranged from 18–22 entries. They also consulted multiple types of information and multiple sources within many of the types. The information intensive group was made up of six investors, only one of whom was female. One male and one female were aged 51–60, and the remaining three males were 61–70. The female had earned a Bachelor’s degree and worked in a clerical/administrative support occupation. One of the males possessed a high school diploma and worked in an administrative/managerial occupation. A second earned an Associate’s degree and worked in a technical field. Another male possessed a Bachelor’s degree and worked in the technology field. Two of the males had advanced degrees; one was a professional educator and the other was a professional. All of the information-intensive investors reported managing assets in access of $100,000.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, the researcher did not enter this study with the intention to use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434761">Bruce’s (1997)</xref> work. However, once data analysis began, information-intensive investors fell clearly into two of Bruce’s conceptualizations: the information control and the information technology conceptions. Both will be discussed briefly to contextualize findings regarding each group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0961000611434761">
<title>Information control conception</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434761">Bruce (1997</xref>: 132) describes the information control conception as involving ‘specific strategies for establishing control of information’. It is centered on information organization, which is about ‘storing information, usually documents, in a fashion which ensures easy retrieval. All the information is selected on the basis of its likely value for future use in research’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434761">Bruce, 1997</xref>: 133). Bruce describes the structure as (1) recognizing and obtaining useful information, (2) storing and organizing the information and (3) being able to retrieve and use the information when required (p. 133). Four males exhibited this conception. One possessed a high school diploma, one an Associate’s degree and two of them earned advanced degrees.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961000611434761">Williamson (2008)</xref> discovered, investors with this conception regularly voiced concern about the impact of information overload. A male investor laughed when he was asked if investing was his hobby. He said:<disp-quote>
<p>It used to feel fun, but now it just seems like hard work. I’m trying to hold on to what I have and make my money grow, but there’s all this conflicting information coming at me. It’s a lot of work to sort it all out. It’s definitely no game.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another male investor described how he was trying to use new tools, such as blogs and RSS feeds, to cope with the ‘onslaught of stuff I need to know’. As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434761">Bruce’s (1997)</xref> study, investors used various strategies to impose some sense of order onto their information environments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961000611434761">Williams and Kingsford Smith (2010)</xref> found that online investors dealt with information overload primarily through the use of investment analysis software. A greater variety of coping strategies is a unique finding of this study.</p>
<p>One typical strategy was the maintenance of personal collections of investment-related resources. One investor retained all issues of four to five investment magazines, which he stored in plastic periodical containers. Another man held what he called a ‘sizable’ collection of books on financial management and had developed and maintained an extensive clipping file with news and general information organized by company, industry, investment types (bonds, commodities, and IRAs, for example), and other investment-related topics. He also maintained an electronic file where he stored materials, such as blogs, RSS feed content, and other web-based information. A third male investor had maintained a newspaper clipping file for more than 15 years.</p>
<p>In addition to maintaining personal collections, investors in the information control conception also organized numerical or statistical information to bring it under their controlling influence. For example, one male investor maintained extensive paper files containing printed Excel spreadsheets organized by investment type, which he updated quarterly. Another man created a paper worksheet (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0961000611434761">Figure 7</xref>), entered the worksheet data into Excel, generated monthly graphs, printed them out, and stored them (and the worksheets) in active folders for two years. Records were moved to a boxed archive after that period. He had records going back for 12 years.</p>
<fig id="fig7-0961000611434761" position="float">

</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0961000611434761-fig7.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>A third male had developed a very complex spreadsheet organizing data including, but not limited to, the share price, corrections (most often defined as drop of more than 10% in total value), one, three, five, and 10 year gains, rate of return, expense ratio, beta, standard deviation, and the stock, bond, or mutual fund rating. He stated that it is his ‘record keeping tools that keep me from being inundated with information I can’t process’. Although this participant agreed to allow the author of this article to discuss his system, he was reticent to actually provide a blank copy of his spreadsheet. He treated it as a sort of proprietary system of evaluating performance. The fourth investor in this conception also maintained an extensive spreadsheet which he updated monthly and summarized annually (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0961000611434761">Figure 8</xref>). His records went back approximately seven years.</p>

</fig>
<p>None of the investors in the information control conception relied heavily on brokers. When the services of a broker were employed at all, they were typically used for executing a transaction rather than providing investing advice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0961000611434761">
<title>Information technology conception</title>
<p>The information technology conception is typified by the idea that the ability to scan a broad information environment constitutes information competence. People in this category believe that the ‘major role of information technology is to make information accessible or to bring it into awareness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434761">Bruce, 1997</xref>: 117). According to Bruce (p.117): ‘accessing information in this category is seen as random scanning of the information environment – a “just in case”, rather than a need driven approach’. General awareness of what information exists on a given area of concern (in this case, investing) is central. One male and one female investor, both with Bachelor’s degrees, exhibited this conception.</p>
<p>Both of the investors with this conception organized their information seeking around routine, periodic exposure to sources of information. Their information fields were richly imbedded with sources accessed through convenient technologies such as the Internet, television, and radio. The female investor described her day:<disp-quote>
<p>Every morning I read the <italic>New York Times</italic> and the local newspaper. I read the business sections religiously and the other sections as I have time. While I eat breakfast, I watch <italic>CNBC Squawk Box</italic>. Then I check AOL for financial news and take a look at my portfolio. If I’m not too busy, I check these throughout the day. I also try to catch some financial news on television at noon, if I can, and I watch the <italic>Closing Bell</italic> every evening. I have also begun to watch <italic>Fast Money</italic> to get their take on things – though I find them more entertaining than reliable.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Investors with this conception tended to focus on how technology had made them better and more efficient investors. The female investor stated that she had ‘burned up the phone lines’ with her broker until she began to use the Internet. When she discovered online trading, she all but abandoned her relationship with him. The male investor related several anecdotes of bad advice given by multiple brokers and the relief he felt at being able to ‘rid’ himself of dependence on them when he discovered he could get what he needed online. Both of these investors expressed a sense of empowerment afforded them by information technology.</p>
<p>Both investors also voiced the belief that technology not only increased their access, but accelerated it as well. For them, early access to information was key to successful investing. One man said:<disp-quote>
<p>To make money you have to get a-hold of information before it becomes general knowledge. Am I going to get it first? No, but I don’t have to to make money. I just have to get it before your average Joe does.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He went on to say that he abandoned reading his many print magazines when he realized how old the information was before it got to him. He now only reads the online versions, which he is able to access much sooner than the paper copy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0961000611434761">
<title>Commonalities between information-intensive types</title>
<p>Though investors’ information seeking behaviors in the information-intensive category were of two distinct types, they shared several important commonalities. First and foremost, they were occupied in serious leisure across the board. The data presented above suggest that information-intensive participants’ engagement with investing is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611434761">Stebbins’ (2009)</xref> criteria. They exhibited the vocational zeal that focuses on the acquisition of special knowledge, skill, and training. Besides the extensive time commitments evidenced by their record-keeping and scanning activities, these participants also radiated energy and enthusiasm about investing during their interviews. As mentioned previously, they revealed positive feelings about achieving independence in managing their investments. At first pass, the male investor’s comment about it ‘being no game’ might appear contradictory to the pleasure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611434761">Stebbins (2009)</xref> describes as an essential ingredient of serious leisure. In actuality, however, it reinforces the notion that part of that pleasure is derived through ‘sticking with it through thick and thin, from conquering adversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611434761">Stebbins, 2009</xref>: 626).</p>
<p>Social worlds were also an important feature of information-intensive investors’ activities. Three of them currently belonged to investment clubs, while one, the woman, was considering joining one. In addition, these participants often reported talking to friends and family about their investing activities. Unlike investors in the moderate- and low-information-use categories, however, these contacts were viewed as fraternal, rather than informational in nature. For example, one male investor said:<disp-quote>
<p>I enjoy talking with friends – getting different viewpoints and opinions – debating the issues, but do I listen to them when I make decisions? Not much. They don’t know any more than I do.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another male investor, who happened to be an educator, stated that he had become the go-to-guy with his friends and family on investment matters. He was considering starting his own blog. This participant was beginning to view himself as a mentor.</p>
<p>The other characteristic common to information-intensive investors was a fairly substantial skepticism toward information. One male investor related an anecdote in which he located a desired piece of information on the Web, but felt ‘it was just too good to be true’. Attempts to verify the data confirmed his hunch. ‘You simply can’t trust a lot of what you read,’ he stated. Another male investor discussed how he weighs stock, bond, and mutual fund ratings in his decision making and stated: ‘you have to realize it’s only based on what they <italic>think</italic> will happen’. He also mentioned avoiding certain portions of corporate annual reports for fear of ‘being misinformed by marketing hype’. A female investor also discussed her feelings about using corporate annual reports for decision making:<disp-quote>
<p>I use them sometimes. There’s good stuff there. But you really have to know what’s fact and what’s fiction. The last person you should believe when it comes to evaluating a company is the CEO!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, all but one of the investors in the information-intensive category viewed investing as being about the bottom line. They were largely unconcerned with the social or moral behavior of the company. Nor were they particularly interested in assessing the value of companies through their experience with them or their products. One male related an anecdote in which he visited a restaurant in which he owned stock:<disp-quote>
<p>It was filthy and the service was horrible. The food wasn’t much better, but the company makes me money – why would I sell it?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A female investor was interested in investing in green technology companies, but because she expected them to make a profit, rather than as a matter of conscience. Another male investor stated that the only corporate behavior he cared about was ‘poor management and excessive executive compensation’.</p>
<p>One male investor, and educator, was a notable exception to this trend. He saw investing partly as social activism. He refused to invest in Wal-Mart due to their ‘employee practices’. He also refrained from investing in companies who sell alcohol, tobacco or any other type of harmful product. He stated:<disp-quote>
<p>I also want to invest in eco-friendly companies who are engaging in developing energy alternatives, but it just seems too volatile at this point. Hopefully one day soon.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<title>Moderate-information-use investors</title>
<p>Unlike information-intensive investors, moderate-information-use investors relied on rich and diverse personal networks for much of their information. Although they incorporated some formal sources into their information repertoires, it was at a much lower frequency and with less diversity in source selection. They reported less than three incidents of research per week, averaging 2.1 per week. Two male and two female investors fell into this category. One of the men earned a Bachelor’s degree. A male and female investor both possessed advanced degrees, while one woman earned an Associate’s degree. One man was a professional, aged 61–70, who managed $15,000–$50,000 worth of assets; the other was a professional, aged 71–80, who managed a portfolio worth more than $100,000. Both women were aged 51–60 and managed assets in excess of $100,000. One was a professional educator; the other was an administrator.</p>
<p>One male investor who typified this moderate-information-use type had maintained a complex network of professional connections even beyond his retirement. He relied primarily on his direct knowledge of the field and a network of informants constructed over the course of his career to build a substantial knowledge base about his industry. As a result, he tended to invest in companies in or related to that industry. He also has a close and longstanding relationship with his broker, a man who had once worked in the investor’s former profession, as well.</p>
<p>A female investor in this category constructed her knowledge base geographically. She had a high interest in local companies and talked with friends, family, and colleagues frequently about them. She tended to choose companies whose products were familiar to her, that she used and liked. As with the male investor, she had a close and long-term working relationship with a broker and met with him at least quarterly. She ‘scanned’ the <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic> and <italic>Money Magazine</italic> a few times per week, particularly for lists she found helpful (‘20 Top Earning Companies’, for example). She had, at one point, tried to incorporate corporate annual reports in her information repertoire, but gave up, saying: ‘they made me feel so unintelligent – why can’t they use plain English?’ She had also set up a profile in a portfolio management website, but simply did not have the time to keep it up to date. This woman was one of the few investors in the study who had not actually retired yet. As a busy professional, time clearly placed constraints on both her investing and information seeking activities.</p>
<p>Another female investor favored taking investment-related seminars offered at the public library or community center, often making personal contacts with presenters and consulting them later. She relied heavily on a ‘smart’ sister, and used the phone extensively to make contact with people she thought were ‘in-the-know’, including bank managers, financial counselors, and attorneys. She tended to turn to books when her personal networks proved inadequate, naming six separate titles in her journal. She clearly expressed the desire to find and use information more effectively to manage her investments, but for one reason or another, she simply had not yet amassed the skills she needed.</p>
<p>Investors in the moderate-information-use category also exhibited some features of serious leisure. They developed strong informal social worlds by talking about investing with people in their social networks, though none had considered forming or joining any formal social networks, such as investment clubs. As evidenced in the description above, they sought opportunities to develop the special skill required for serious leisure activities by attending classes and reading some materials. They also conveyed a sense of pleasure in their activities, though it was less pronounced than it was with information-intensive investors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0961000611434761">
<title>Low-information-use investors</title>
<p>Unlike moderate-information-use investors, low-information-use investors engaged in investing as an act of self-care, rather than serious leisure, and operated in a relatively sparse information environment. They reported an average of four or fewer incidents of research during the four-week study period. They were exclusively female: two had high school diplomas and one held a Bachelor’s degree. One woman, a manual laborer, was aged 51–60 and managed between $15,001 and $25,000 in investments, the second, an artist, was 61–70 and held a portfolio worth $5,000–$15,000, and the third, a clerical worker, was over 81 with more than $100,000 in assets. These female investors relied nearly exclusively on one or two sources to meet their investing information needs. More often than not, these sources were interpersonal. Their brokers were the most common source of information, but family members or colleagues were also mentioned. None of the women in this category had adopted the Internet for investment research.</p>
<p>The oldest investor in the group reported using the services of five brokers: ‘they all believe they’re the only one, but I hear them all out and go with the one that makes the most sense’. She also relied exclusively on male brokers: ‘I know it seems old-fashioned, but I think they just know more than women’. Another female investor relied exclusively on stock, bond, and mutual fund ratings, supplied by her broker, to make her decisions. The last investor in this category watched financial news occasionally, but relied on a former colleague, an accountant, as her primary advisor. The quality of these women’s investment decisions was wholly predicated on the quality of information provided to them through their trusted advisors. When asked, none of them could articulate specific reasons for choosing one advisor over another, but expressed it more as a ‘gut feeling’. As a result, they were more vulnerable to misinformation, both unintentional and fraudulent. In fact, two of the three participants reported near misses of falling victim to investing scams.</p>

<sec id="section19-0961000611434761" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While investors in this study clearly sought information at three distinct levels (intensive, moderate and low), what remains murky is why. Why do some investors build rich and diverse information fields when others live in veritable information poverty? All investors in the qualitative phase had information technology in their homes, so low use did not appear to be a function of access. Nor did socio-economic status seem particularly relevant, given that information-intensive investors came from the full range of educational attainment levels and occupational backgrounds. Although women with low socio-economic status and educational attainment were clustered in lower information use categories, male investors were dispersed across all three categories regardless of these variables. Clearly, additional large-scale, generalizable research is necessary to clarify the relationship between education, socio-economic class, and investors’ information seeking.</p>
<p>As other studies have suggested, gender was also a contributing factor to the quality and character of participant investors’ information fields. Female investors sought information for investing much less often and used fewer sources of information than did their male counterparts. As stated previously, low socio-economic status and educational attainment seemed to exacerbate this trend, but the relationship between female investors’ information fields and these demographics is hardly clear. For example, the only female in the information-intensive category had equal or lower educational attainment and a less prestigious occupation than some of the women in the moderate-and low-use categories. Additional research is necessary to determine what other variables intervene in women’s level of information use and their Internet adoption for investing. Furthermore, because the female participants sought information less frequently, female investors should be studied for longer periods of time in future research to provide more data about their information seeking activities.</p>
<p>The clearest predictor of information-intensive behavior suggested by this study is attitude toward investing itself. Participants who approached investing as serious leisure were understandably more likely to devote time and energy in developing their information fields for investing as well. Clearly this is true as it separates information-intensive from low-information-use investors. However, the engagement of moderate-information-use investors also demonstrated some of the features of serious-leisure, but at a less intense level than their information-intensive counterparts. For one of the female investors in the moderate-information-use category, stage of life (i.e. the fact she was not yet retired) appeared to constrain her engagement with investing and corresponding information seeking and use. But for the other two investors (who were all retired), time did not emerge as a central issue. It appeared to be, rather, a matter of style.</p>
<p>For example, information-intensive investors in this study exhibited an information seeking disposition oriented toward independence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961000611434761">Williamson (2008)</xref> noted independence as an important motivator for online investing, but these findings suggest it also shapes information seeking practices outside of the online environment. Investors achieved independence using two distinct approaches: one group through the exercise of control and the other group through the use of technology to achieve high orienting awareness. Skepticism was seen as a necessary feature of independence as it prevented anyone from exercising undue influence over decision making. To this end, all the investors in this group had either abandoned their broker altogether or reduced their relationship to an operational arrangement in which the broker enacted investor’s orders, but offered minimal advisory influence.</p>
<p>On the other hand, moderate-information-use investors in this study demonstrated preferences for interpersonal networks for investment information seeking and decision making. Thus personal orientation toward interdependence versus independence may be a critical distinguishing characteristic. This possibility should be explored further in future research. In fact, a more thorough understanding of how less sophisticated information seekers conceptualize their own information competence is needed all around. Although Bruce’s research provided an excellent foundation for interpreting the behaviors of information-intensive investors, it did not for moderate and low-information-use investors. Bruce’s ‘faces’ theoretically represent a finite number of unique variations in people’s conceptualizations of their information seeking competence. However, the sophisticated nature of Bruce’s participants resulted in conceptualizations that begin with and center on formal information sources, thus, people who are heavily oriented toward informal information sources are not reflected in her typologies. Yet, previous research (for example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961000611434761">Connaway et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961000611434761">Savolainen, 2008</xref>), indicates that many people rely primarily on interpersonal and informal sources of information. Further research should be undertaken to develop additional typologies that include them.</p>
<p>Finally, this research demonstrates that there is much room for LIS professionals to improve their services to retired investors. Library use (reported by only 23% of the 44 quantitative phase participants in this study) was very low across all investor types, particularly compared to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961000611434761">Williamson (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961000611434761">Mezick (2002)</xref> who found 35% and 78% of their participants respectively used the library to some extent. One opportunity to increase library use is related to stock, bond, and mutual fund rating guides; although many investors indicated they were important sources, a significant number of respondents failed to utilize them. As mentioned in the findings, 11 of the 39 investors (28%) who rated the guides a 3.00 or higher in importance reported no use of this type of source. Half of the 18 investors who reported using rating guides accessed them at a library. In fact, nine of the 10 investors who reported using a library indicated that they accessed rating guides there in print format. It seems to be this source type, rather than Internet access (given that only 2 investors used the library as their access point for the Internet) that drew investors in this study to visit libraries.</p>
<p>No respondents reported using stock, bond, or mutual fund rating guides through library websites. Either the proprietary versions of rating guides were not available online through participants’ public libraries (which is likely given their high cost) or participants were unaware they were. Current information about the online availability of these sources across US public libraries could not be identified, but would prove useful in assessing how well library collections serve investors. If the availability of remotely accessible proprietary stock, bond, and mutual fund rating sources is low, increasing it would help close a significant information gap for investors, particularly older investors who may have less ability to physically access print collections. If these sources are widely available through library web sites, increased awareness through marketing is necessary.</p>
<p>This research furthermore demonstrates that moderate- and low-information-use investors, particularly women, would benefit from increased use of formal information sources, including the Internet. New library-based services, user-education programs, and outreach specifically designed for women may help close the gap between male and female investors’ information seeking behaviors. Low Internet adoption is also a significant concern, and user studies are needed to determine what types of interfaces facilitate their increased Internet use for investing and investment-related information seeking.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The findings of this study have several important implications for information providers and LIS professionals. First, there is an opportunity to meet the information management needs of information-intensive investors through the development of new products. Information overload is an important theme with these investors, and better-developed knowledge management tools would be a tremendous asset to them. Second, the disparity between male and female investors’ information use must be addressed through the development of new information sources and user education. Investment-related information should be delivered through technologies that are more attractive and usable for women. Through user-education programs and new services, LIS professionals may also help bridge the gap between the interpersonal sources preferred by women and the data-oriented sources that provide a necessary counterpoint. Finally, this study suggests that investors are increasingly less likely to view libraries as important providers of their investment information needs. Investment-related information must be made available remotely and in formats that are convenient and easy to use in order to attract this constituency once again.</p>
<p>The more thoroughly LIS professionals understand retired investors’ existing information behaviors, the more able they will be serve them. Interventions, such as user education, service design and delivery, user outreach, and the development and/or redesign of information systems are all enhanced through knowledge of current behavior. This research describes the information behaviors of a small group of retired investors, identifies existing information gaps, and suggests some means by which these gaps can be addressed. However, since so little knowledge exists currently, its more important function may be to provide a foundation for future research by identifying the key questions that remain. A substantial generation of investors is close to retirement, and information professionals need to stand informed and ready to meet their needs.</p>
