<p>There has been a recent revival of interest in just war teaching but can a medieval theological theory help us address 21<sup>st</sup> century security concerns? The just war principles do not, as some philosophers have recently argued, need to be radically reinterpreted to maintain their relevance. But the moral principles do need to be reinforced by the theory and practice of the virtues, as Aquinas taught. The virtues required by the military are examined, including moral courage - the virtue lacking in the officers, including the chaplain, criticised by the judge in the Baha Mousa inquiry for failing to prevent the physical abuse of Iraqi detainees. The virtues – lost in recent just war thinking – need to be rediscovered and reintegrated in just war thinking.</p>

<title>The revival of just war doctrine</title>
<p>On a recent visit to the Treasures of Heaven exhibition at the British Museum, displaying medieval reliquaries exquisitely fashioned to contain sacred relics, such as the multitudinous fragments of the True Cross, I was struck by how alien much of medieval theological thought is from our modern culture. Medieval Christian theology is out of fashion in most areas of modern life. But there is one notable exception - the crucial area of peace and war.</p>
<p>In recent years the medieval just war theory has surprisingly come back into fashion. Since war can cause immense human suffering it is hardly surprising that war should be an area of grave moral concern. But what is surprising is that our modern secular culture should be seeking guidance from a medieval Christian theory. Discussion of the morality of contemporary conflicts is being conducted using concepts and principles borrowed from the medieval theory of a just war. Just war concepts have become part of our vocabulary for appraising war, with even politicians, at times, employing the language, if not the substance, of just war doctrine. We criticise politicians for taking us to war in Iraq without just cause. We condemn the unjust behaviour of our soldiers on the streets of Basra in ill-treating civilian detainees.</p>
<p>Contemporary debates about war are being conducted employing a framework furnished by medieval theologians. Indeed, the theory is older than medieval since it dates back at least to St Augustine in the 5<sup>th</sup> century AD who wrestled with the perennial question of whether Christians can wage war without sin. It flourished in the medieval period, particularly as a result of the teaching of St Thomas Aquinas in the thirteenth century. The theory reached its zenith in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with theologians such as Vitoria and Grotius. It was, however, then almost completely lost to sight. It was only rediscovered late in the twentieth century initially to help furnish a moral framework for the debate then raging over the morality of nuclear deterrence. The language of just war is now fashionably rolled out to provide a critique of all kinds of contemporary wars. But can such an antique theory really help us address our current security concerns?</p>

<title>Challenges to just war doctrine</title>
<p>I shall consider first whether the just war principles now need to be radically reinterpreted if their relevance is to be maintained. I shall then consider whether such principles alone are sufficient to guide military conduct.</p>
<p>Just war teaching sets out a number of principles that have to be followed if a war is to be just. There must be: just cause, right intention, competent authority and the harm likely to be caused should be judged not to outweigh the good to be achieved, taking into account the probability of success; while in its conduct the principles of proportion and non-combatant immunity should be met; and the war end in the establishment of a just peace. The tests to be met before a decision is taken to go to war are known as the <italic>jus ad bellum</italic> principles; and those to be met during war are the principles of <italic>jus in bello</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0014524611426762">1</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0014524611426762">
<title>The moral equality of soldiers</title>
<p>According to the usual understanding of just war teaching, while the <italic>jus ad bellum</italic> and <italic>jus in bello</italic> principles are closely related, it is possible to make a distinction between them. In particular, participants in a war may fulfil the first - <italic>jus ad bellum</italic> - set of criteria but not the latter or, conversely, they may comply with the laws of war but fail to meet the <italic>jus ad bellum</italic> criteria. While only one side in a just war may have justice on its side, there is a moral parity between the ordinary combatants. Soldiers on either side are entitled to use force to prevent harm whether to themselves or those it is their duty to protect. Crucially soldiers on either side are required to comply with the <italic>jus in bello</italic> constraints. A just war can be conducted unjustly and an unjust war conducted justly. So, for example, the Second World War was a just war for the Allies but the indiscriminate bombing of German cities was not. Conversely, we praise Rommel who, in the prosecution of an unjust war, still performed just acts, such as burning the order from Hitler on 28 October 1942 that all enemy soldiers encountered behind enemy lines were to be killed at once.</p>
<p>One of the merits claimed for the doctrine of the equality of soldiers is that it provides an incentive for soldiers, whether fighting for a just or unjust cause, to moderate their actions, and to treat even their enemies with respect. Even a soldier fighting an unjust war can still earn moral credit by obeying the laws of war. A soldier fighting for a just cause is not licensed to break the rules of war just because his cause is just. This is an important constraint particularly since most soldiers are likely to believe, however mistakenly, that their cause is just. The crusaders who sacked Jerusalem in 1099 and waded up to their ankles in the blood of the slaughtered inhabitants acted unjustly, however much they may have been convinced of the justice of their cause.</p>

<sec id="section4-0014524611426762">
<title>Moral equality challenged</title>
<p>The doctrine of the moral equality of combatants, it is argued, helps promote restraint in war. But even if it does, is the doctrine true? In recent years a number of philosophers have argued that it is not. They have also argued that its abandonment, far from removing restraint in war, would help make wars less likely. For people would be less likely to support a war, still less to volunteer or enlist to fight in it, if they knew that those fighting an unjust war would be held morally responsible for the wrongs of the war and would be condemned as unjust warriors.</p>
<p>Jeff McMahan, for example, has argued that the doctrine of moral equality both inaccurately describes our moral thinking but also makes it too easy for people to resort to war. According to the traditional account soldiers on either side are justified in using force to prevent harm occurring. But posing a threat of harm does not, in McMahan’s view, make one liable to attack. For if that were true a policeman about to shoot a gunman threatening the lives of citizens would render himself liable to defensive attack by the gunman. The gunman, however threatened he may feel, has no right to take defensive action against the policeman. ‘It is therefore,’ McMahan claims, ‘false that by posing a threat to another, that necessarily makes one liable to defensive action.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0014524611426762">2</xref></sup> What makes one so liable is ‘moral responsibility for an objectively unjustified threat of harm.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0014524611426762">3</xref></sup> ‘The act of posing a threat has no relevance apart from the contribution it makes to the person’s moral responsibility for the threat.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0014524611426762">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>So applying this to war, what makes soldiers and, indeed, some civilians liable to attack is that they are morally ‘responsible for a wrongful war or for the wrongful acts of which it is composed.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0014524611426762">5</xref></sup> The combatants fighting a just war have no such moral responsibility and so are not liable to attack. But combatants fighting an unjust war are morally responsible for its injustice and are hence liable to attack. The doctrine of the moral equality of combatants is, therefore, false. It also, crucially, provides too little disincentive to people to resort to war. Jettisoning the doctrine would help make wars less likely.</p>
<p>Let us examine each step of McMahan’s argument.</p>
<p>First, is he right to claim that we always require an attribution of moral responsibility to justify defensive action in non-war contexts? I am not sure we do. Let us look again at the example of the policeman and the gunman. What justifies the police action is surely the perceived threat to other lives posed by the gunman. For all the police officer knows the gunman might be an innocent dupe, coerced so to act by an evil third party, or a madman suffering from paranoid delusions. Such excusing conditions, while not justifying the gunman’s action – he is, after all, threatening harm - may excuse it by reducing or removing his responsibility for the action. But, in so far as he is posing a threat to life, police action against the gunman can still justifiably be taken to prevent this. This does not mean that the moral responsibility of the agent is not important. It is crucial to our moral appraisal of the action. It is also crucial to determining whether and how the gunman should be punished. But the policeman in the midst of a dangerous operation, still less a soldier in the heat of battle, are neither best placed to make such judgements of moral responsibility. Police or soldiers are not appropriate organs of punishment. We accordingly leave it to the courts subsequently to determine questions of moral or legal responsibility, which are crucial to the apportionment of punishment. The police are not licensed to exact punishment. What the police are licensed to do is to protect citizens from threatened harm so that ‘normal life can continue.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0014524611426762">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, if it is moral responsibility for the threat that renders one liable to be attacked and the act of posing a threat ‘has no relevance to liability’ except by contributing to such responsibility, it might appear that the police would be licensed to shoot an evil third party who was responsible for the gunman’s activities. Indeed, they might be so justified, even if he had no current influence or control over what was happening, and his shooting was not required to remove the current threat. Let us suppose the evil third party has hypnotised the gunman and, under hypnosis, instructed him to open fire. He is, however, now distant from the scene of action and peacefully watching television in his flat. Would the police be justified in rushing in and shooting him? The answer is surely not.</p>
<p>Let us now consider McMahan’s application of his argument to the military context. The crux of McMahan’s argument is that most combatants fighting an unjust war are morally responsible for the wrongful war or for the wrongful acts of which it is composed. He concedes that a few may have such strong excuses (irresistible duress or justified ignorance) as to evade responsibility. But most unjust combatants do not have such strong excuses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0014524611426762">7</xref></sup> They may have been subjected to some coercive pressures but not to unbearable duress, still less duress that is literally irresistible. Nor can they be excused through ignorance since even if they are ignorant their ignorance may still be culpable. Soldiers typically do not give enough thought to the wars in which they are engaged but should be encouraged to do so. So most soldiers can legitimately be held morally responsible for the injustice of the wars in which they are engaged. Moreover, if they are held to be so responsible, they will be less likely to engage in war.</p>
<p>But can soldiers legitimately be held responsible in this way? Perhaps soldiers should be encouraged to give more thought to the wars they conduct. Perhaps the duress they face is not usually unendurable. The duress faced by Germans who refused to fight for the Nazis was, however, fairly extreme since the penalty for such disobedience was beheading. So should the Allies have declined to attack them?</p>
<p>Most importantly, it surely strains the concept of moral responsibility beyond legitimate usage to hold most combatants on the unjust side as responsible for the injustice of the war. Nor can they be held responsible for the injustice of its component acts in so far as this simply reflects the injustice of the war rather than the individual choices of combatants. We hold people morally responsible for actions over which they have some influence or control; and to the occurrence of which they have in some sense given their consent. Control and consent are the two key preconditions of the attribution of moral responsibility. The generals who advised Hitler may have had such influence over events and consented to their occurrence. They can, therefore, legitimately be held morally responsible for the injustice of the war both as a whole and its component acts. But that is not true of the ordinary soldiers who had no influence or control over the decision to go to war. To hold such people morally responsible for the injustice of the war would seem neither appropriate nor fair. It was for this reason that the Nuremberg tribunal rightly rejected the argument that all military actions undertaken by the Germans were war crimes because they were carried out in pursuit of an aggressive war.</p>
<p>In determining the attribution of responsibility we need to attend to the various levels at which decisions are made. In war these are typically four-fold: the political, strategic, theatre and tactical levels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0014524611426762">8</xref></sup> The political and strategic levels are the levels at which, respectively, the decision to go to war is taken and the strategy formulated for how it is to be won. The theatre and tactical levels are where individual decisions are taken on the conduct of the war, ranging from the Normandy campaign at the theatre level to tactical operations, such as the battle for Caen or a skirmish on the streets of Kabul. At the higher levels those involved – both military and civilian - have influence or control over the decision to resort to war and so it is legitimate to hold them morally responsible for this. Such responsibility may extend considerably further down than just the top generals. But it is not appropriate to hold responsible those at the lower levels who have no such influence or control. The moral equality of combatants may not hold at the higher command levels. The doctrine needs thus to be qualified. But it does still hold at the lower levels.</p>
<p>Ordinary combatants cannot meaningfully be held responsible for the justice or injustice of the cause for which the war is fought. But they can be held responsible for how it is conducted over which they have influence or control. For an ordinary soldier, as Michael Walzer notes, ‘when he violates the rules of war, superior orders are no defence. The atrocities he commits are his own; the war is not.’ <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0014524611426762">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>It, therefore, strains our concept of moral responsibility to hold ordinary soldiers responsible for the injustice of a war. But are there, nonetheless, pragmatic reasons for doing so because it will make soldiers less willing to fight wars and so lead to a reduction in the suffering caused by war?</p>
<p>Holding the generals and civil servants who advise the political leaders morally responsible for an unjust war is both appropriate and fair and may, indeed, act as a disincentive to those who might otherwise too readily resort to war. But to hold ordinary soldiers morally responsible for decisions over which they have no influence in order to promote some wider good would appear a morally questionable move. It is also far from clear that it would achieve the wider good claimed for it. Granting to combatants fighting a just cause a moral superiority over unjust combatants could encourage them to prosecute the war with crusader’s zeal, a zeal likely to be very widely shared since, as already noted, most combatants, however mistakenly, believe their cause to be just. Conversely, those castigated as already unjust may feel they have less incentive to restrain their actions and abide by the <italic>jus in bello</italic> code. Far from promoting restraint, abandonment of the doctrine of moral equality would seem more likely to have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>There is thus good reason for the moral parity we accord to ordinary combatants. The doctrine of moral equality certainly needs qualification to recognise the guilt of those at or near the top, who are rightly judged unjust warriors. But it would be unwise to abandon the doctrine altogether.</p>
<p>Just war doctrine does not, therefore, need radical reinterpretation in this respect to meet contemporary security challenges. In particular, the principles that are the core of the doctrine remain valid. But the question still arises whether a set of principles is enough to help guide, shape and improve the behaviour of those involved with the fateful decisions on war.</p>
<p>A moral rule book is necessary for the ethical behaviour of those involved with war. But our aim is not simply to ensure that our politicians and soldiers are well versed in just war teaching. What matters is that they behave justly. The challenge is to ensure that the right decisions are taken before, during and after war, even amidst all the passions and fury this may arouse. Moral principles alone will not suffice to achieve this. A moral rule book is necessary to guide our actions but it is only part of what we need. So what else is needed?</p>
<p>To answer this question we need not to abandon medieval teaching but rediscover one of its key elements. Just war doctrine, as it emerged from the pens of the lawyers and legally-minded theologians of the 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries, was conceived as a set of rules to be followed. But further back in the tradition it was recognised that these rules needed to be reinforced by the theory and practice of the virtues. Indeed, the teaching of Aquinas on just war was embedded in his wider doctrine, which he had inherited from Aristotle, on the importance to our moral lives of the virtues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0014524611426762">
<title>The role of virtues in just war doctrine</title>
<p>Moral principles provide the necessary guidelines for how we can live together well in communities and so flourish as human beings. But we also need to have acquired appropriate skills to enable us to enact those principles in our daily conduct. This is the role played by the virtues. Virtues are those habits of thought, feeling and action that enable us to choose what is right and then to act rightly, despite the many pressures there may be to do otherwise. The virtues are crucial to moral conduct generally but they are particularly important in the area of war where the pressures to act unjustly are likely to be particularly acute.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0014524611426762">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>So what virtues are needed to ensure the just conduct of war? In traditional medieval thought, based on Aristotle, four virtues are identified as pre-eminent or ‘cardinal’ in our moral lives. They are: practical wisdom, courage, self-control and justice. Lets us consider each in turn.</p>
<p>The just war principles are inevitably of a general nature. We need, therefore, help and guidance in relating the general to the particular: to recognise which principle applies to which particular situation, to discern how it applies and what action it requires. Such guidance is furnished by the virtue of practical wisdom - ‘a habit of sound judgment about practical situations.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0014524611426762">11</xref></sup> Practical wisdom is essential to ensure the correct application of the principles to the messy, complex and shifting realities of the battlefield. It is thus the virtue that we need above all to ensure the just conduct of war.</p>
<p>Aquinas distinguished three kinds of practical wisdom which he thought were necessary in political and military affairs. The first kind is the practical wisdom or prudence of the ruler, called by Aquinas statesmanship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0014524611426762">12</xref></sup> This is the virtue which the ruler needs if he is to promote the common good, of which a key component is ensuring the safety and security of the state, including its protection from external aggression. This is the highest form of practical wisdom. The second kind of practical wisdom is that which the subjects in a state need to exercise if they are to play their role in serving the common good.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0014524611426762">13</xref></sup> The third kind of practical wisdom is called military. It is the virtue needed to ensure that ‘war is managed by due ordering’: ‘Actual fighting calls for courage, but its direction calls for prudence, especially that of the good generalship of the officer commanding.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0014524611426762">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Aquinas rightly observes that practical wisdom needs to be exercised at varying levels of responsibility. It needs to be exercised, above all, by the political leaders, together with their military and civilian advisers, who take the fateful decision whether or not to go to war. It is they, after all, who decide whether there is a just cause for war. It is they who must assess the consequences of taking military action and determine whether more good than ill is likely to result from it. It is they - as we have argued - who are to be held morally responsible for the justice or injustice of war. These are daunting responsibilities, with many temptations to err, particularly amid all the passions and fury generated by conflict. Practical wisdom, in its highest form of statesmanship, is crucial if our political leaders are to take the right decisions.</p>
<p>Practical wisdom also needs to be exercised by the ruled. The political responsibilities of subjects in the princely kingdoms which Aquinas takes as the norm, although important, were limited. Of much more importance is the practical wisdom required of citizens in a democracy who can choose their leaders and the policies they support, as well as those in the churches, media, academe or non-governmental organisations who may have influence on the formation of opinions. We should choose leaders with an established track record of practical wisdom, leaders who, through precept, practice and personal example, have acquired ‘a habit of sound judgment about practical situations.’ Recognising such leaders, as well as the fulfilment of our other duties as citizens, will require us to exercise practical wisdom.</p>
<p>Military practical wisdom is for Aquinas a virtue to be exercised chiefly by the general commanding the army. Generals directing warfare at the strategic and theatre levels of command need, by careful training and experience, to have acquired and exercise practical wisdom. They will need this to enable them to provide sound advice to their political leaders and to make right decisions on the battlefield about how the war and its individual battles are to be conducted.</p>
<p>It is a feature of modern warfare that critical decisions on the conduct of war can be devolved to low levels. Practical wisdom needs to be exercised at the tactical level, often by service people of junior rank. The ‘strategic corporal’ can be responsible for taking life and death decisions. It is he who may have to decide whether the passenger in the car at the checkpoint on the Afghan roadside is a dangerous terrorist or an innocent citizen to be protected by the principle of non-combatant immunity. The modern battlefield demands of all its participants an increasing range of skills, with activities capable of shifting within the space of three city blocks from war fighting through peace support operations to humanitarian relief – the so-called ‘Three Block War.’ Practical wisdom needs to include an ability to adapt rapidly and respond appropriately to fast changing situations. Since the decisions may have to taken in split seconds, the exercise of practical wisdom needs to have become, through long training and practice, second nature, a deeply ingrained habit of sound judgement.</p>
<p>Practical wisdom is thus exercised at a variety of levels, ranging from that of the statesman deciding whether or not to go to war to that of the humble soldier deciding how to react at a vehicle checkpoint. The application of the just war principles to the messy, complex realities of daily life in peace and war needs, above all, the virtue of practical wisdom. But the just conduct of war also requires the other cardinal virtues of courage, self-control and justice.</p>
<p>Courage is the virtue we need to enable us to persevere in the face of difficulty and danger, not allowing fear to obscure our judgement of what needs to be done. Physical courage is the much prized virtue of the warrior on the battlefield. But soldiers may also require moral courage to stick to their principles despite pressures from their comrades or superiors to do otherwise.</p>
<p>It was such moral courage that was lacking in the officers, including the medical staff and padre, who failed to do anything to stop the savage beatings and other abuse by British soldiers that took place in Basra on 14 -16 September 2003. This abuse led to the death of Baha Mousa and serious injuries to eight other Iraqi civilian detainees held in British Army custody. Sir William Gage, who chaired the public inquiry into these events, expressed ‘concern about the lack of discipline and lack of moral courage to report abuse within 1 QLR (Queen’s Lancashire Regiment).’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0014524611426762">15</xref></sup> He criticised the padre who ‘must have seen the shocking condition of the detainees, and the deteriorating state of the TDF (Temporary Detention Facility). He ought to have intervened immediately, or reported it up the chain of command but, in fact, it seems he did not have the courage to do either.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0014524611426762">16</xref></sup> It is accordingly a key recommendation of the Gage report that we need to devise better ways to teach moral courage to the military.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0014524611426762">17</xref></sup> Courage, both moral and physical, is an important virtue for the military. Moral courage is also a virtue we should look for in our politicians. The courageous political decision may be not to go to war, despite the popular clamour or pressure from allies to do so.</p>
<p>As well as courage, soldiers need the cardinal virtue of self-control. They need to exercise self-control if they are to achieve and maintain the physical fitness required to undertake their duties, neither eating too much nor too little to sustain their physical strength. Self-control is, like practical wisdom, a virtue that is needed in support of the exercise of other virtues. It is the character trait that helps a man never lose his head, whether through anger or fear or lust for pleasure and so always to exercise a dispassionate judgment of what is the right thing to do. Self-control is a key virtue on the battlefield. It is also a virtue that those outside the military profession require. This includes our political leaders and their advisers who need to take decisions on war and peace without allowing anger, greed or other passions to obscure their judgement.</p>
<p>Finally, and crucially, our politicians and soldiers need to learn and practise the virtue of justice, showing concern for others and learning to respect and promote their good. The just war principles set out the criteria to be met if war is to be just in its inception, conduct and conclusion. To enable us to meet this challenging demand requires that we learn and practise the virtue of justice, respecting and promoting the welfare of others.</p>
<p>So soldiers, like ordinary citizens, need the four cardinal virtues of practical wisdom, courage, self-control and justice. What other virtues do they need? According to the British Army’s statement of its Core Values and Standards, the qualities required of our soldiers are: selfless commitment, courage, discipline, integrity, loyalty and respect for others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0014524611426762">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Courage we have already considered, as we have respect for others which underlies the virtue of justice. Selfless commitment is the requirement for the individual to place the interests of the group within which he operates above his own interests. Discipline is necessary to ensure the prompt execution of orders on which the lives of others may depend in the heat of battle. Such obedience is critical in the military context, although it should be not be blind, unthinking obedience. The obedience needs to be reflective, able to discern and, if necessary, decline orders that are manifestly illegal or immoral. Integrity is about honesty and truthfulness which can be crucial to the saving of lives where inaccurate information can put those lives at risk. It requires consistency between principle and practice: meaning what one says, saying what one means and doing what one says. A leader needs integrity if he is to earn the trust of those he commands.</p>
<p>Finally, loyalty to one’s comrades and to the military unit in which one serves is a virtue much needed on the battlefield. It is the virtue that drives the soldier to go back and rescue a comrade, even though this may put his own life at risk. Loyalty needs, however, to be properly directed and not so narrowly focussed as to be misplaced. It was such misplaced loyalty that led soldiers in the Baha Mousa court martial to decline to give evidence against their comrades, so leading to what the judge in the court martial criticised as a ‘wall of silence’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0014524611426762">19</xref></sup> The silent witnesses may have been loyal to their immediate comrades but were disloyal to their regiment, the Army and the wider society in whose service they were employed.</p>
<p>The British Army’s Core Values provide a good summary of most of the qualities needed by the military. But there are two key additions that need to be made: the cardinal virtues of self-control and practical wisdom which are as crucial to military, as non-military, life.</p>

<p>The challenge is how to ensure that war is only fought when it is just and is conducted and concluded justly: ‘to make war just, and to make only just war.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0014524611426762">20</xref></sup> The just war principles provide crucial guidance but rules alone are not enough. All those involved in decisions about peace and war – from the politicians, generals and civil servants at the highest level down to the ordinary soldiers, sailors, airmen and women - need also to have been trained to confront the moral challenges they face with the appropriate beliefs, desires and feelings and to have acquired a habit of sound reasoning in practical matters. They need, in other words, to have been schooled in the virtues so that ethical conduct becomes for them instinctive, as deeply engrained as habits of thought and action as may be the weapon drills in which they have been daily trained. Only thus will there be any prospect that the right decisions will be taken in the heat and passion of war. The virtues - lost in recent just war teaching - need to be rediscovered and reintegrated within the just war tradition, as they had been in the thirteenth century teachings of Aquinas. But practical wisdom is no longer, as Aquinas taught, the prerequisite of princes and generals. It is required, along with the other virtues, of all those involved - at all levels - in the conduct of war.</p>
<p>So the medieval just war theory can still provide guidance to assist us in addressing contemporary security concerns. The theory does not require radical surgery or reinterpretation to ensure its continuing relevance. But what it does need is to be supplemented and reinforced by both the theory and practice of the virtues. This requires us not to abandon elements of the medieval theory but rather the rediscovery from medieval writers of the crucial importance of the virtues to our moral lives both in general and, in particular, in the area of war.</p>
