<p>In this issue Roseanne Russell discusses the problem of achieving equal pay in the UK, where women still earn less than men, despite the enactment of equal pay legislation 42 years ago. She highlights the tension between business values and egalitarian principles and discusses the problems with a shareholder value paradigm. Russell argues that while we need to involve companies to achieve advances for women, the ‘business case’ for equal pay is problematic. A narrow focus on shareholder values undermines other interests, excludes women as employees and diverts attention from other causes inhibiting pay equality. Russell highlights the issues of the gendered division of labour, continuing gender stereotypes and the notion of the male ‘ideal worker’ with domestic support. What is needed, she argues, is to go beyond the instrumental appeal to equal pay being good for business and to develop a new approach that is based on feminist legal theory, which considers other stakeholders, including women employees, and focuses on relational values.</p>
<p>Jogchum Vrielink considers the issues raised by the recent unsuccessful case brought by Bienvenu Mbuto Mondondo, a Congolese student, under the Belgian Anti-Racist Act, against the comic book, <italic>Tintin in the Congo</italic>, by Hergé. The applicant sought an injunction to prevent the sale and distribution of this work, or, at the very least, for the publishers to include a disclaimer and introduction warning of the offensive content. Concerns regarding this particular work, first published in 1931 and containing negative stereotypes, have not been limited to Belgium. In the UK a request to bookstores by the Commission for Racial Equality demanding its withdrawal from publication was refused, although the comic book is now wrapped with a warning that it is unsuitable for younger readers. In the United States it is available only in selected libraries with restricted access. Vrielink considers the reasons why the case failed in the Belgian court and the implications for free speech if the application had succeeded.</p>
<p>Christopher Monaghan discusses the problems in bringing a claim for dismissal discrimination where the claimant is an illegal immigrant in the light of the recent case of<italic> Hounga v Allen </italic>in the Court of Appeal. Here, the court refused to allow the claimant to enforce an illegal contract of employment on public policy grounds because it did not want to appear to condone the use of illegal labour. Ms Hounga argued that the dismissal had been for racially discriminatory reasons and that she had also been discriminated against during the course of her employment. Her claim for dismissal discrimination was rejected because she had knowingly worked illegally in the UK. The court focused on the fact that the claim for dismissal discrimination was tainted with illegality for which she was culpable and from which she should not be allowed to benefit. As Monaghan argues, this case may potentially provide a defence to the employer that employs illegal immigrants and then discriminates against them.</p>
<p>Donathan Brown considers the debate over Arizona's Senate Bill 1070, which is a key element of Arizona's strategy to control immigration, and which allows law enforcement officers to question the immigration status of those violating non-immigration offences. Its constitutionality has recently been reviewed by the United States Supreme Court in <italic>Arizona v United States</italic>. While the majority of the provisions were declared unconstitutional, the remaining provision, Brown argues, can be seen as an invitation to racial profiling. Brown analyses the Bill in its political and social context and reviews its implications for the meaning of national identity.</p>
