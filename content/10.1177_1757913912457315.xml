<p>War and suffering go together akin a horse and cart. As with love, aggression is an animal instinct and human nature. Wars are usually between two unequal parties and sometimes between equals. World wars I and II are the only vivid examples of confrontation between two equals. Rarely two lions can fight each other but often a lion attacks a lamb. I remember an Indian story; a lion drank water from a canal. He saw a lamb drinking water a few yards down stream. The lion was very civilised. He went to lamb and told “you have polluted my water and I will eat you”. The lamb said “sir, I was on the lower level of the canal and I did not pollute your water”. The lion told the lamb “you are arguing with me, how dare you, so I shall eat you” and he meant it.</p>
<p>Suffering is an inevitable result of wars, which affect not only soldiers but also women, children, disabled and weak people in the whole country. Suffering is a dehumanising experience with pain and sorrow. To suffer is to lose sight of one’s personhood and a sense of connection with anything beyond oneself. Recovery is regaining one’s sense of human, embodied self and its connection with the world. In addition, the prejudices based on gender, age, ethnic and sexual identity can also cause suffering. This thought provoking well written book focuses on war, gender, health, suffering and global connections.</p>
<p>The meaning of suffering and its place in human life have, in pre-modern times, been important issues for religious and metaphysical thinkers. With the emergence of modernity and its rational, scientific approach to problems the role of God, gods and fate in suffering has retreated. The pursuit of economic wealth through expanding commodity markets has been a central strategy for avoiding and dealing with the suffering of poverty and sickness. Modern science has improved health and prolonged life, where possible. In its eight chapters, 14 authors have skilfully described the sad reflection of the widespread nature of suffering with war and conflicts globally, especially in Uganda, Morocco, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Northern Ireland. The authors accept that wars are inevitable but describe how there is a vision of peaceable life, survival, health and happiness. Sociologists, anthropologists, politicians, public health professionals and academics would find this book an interesting, readable, concise and authentic research collection across the globe.</p>
