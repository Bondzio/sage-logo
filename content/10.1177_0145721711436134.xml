<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to assess (1) medication adherence in individuals with diabetes, (2) barriers to adherence, and (3) what factors were related to medication nonadherence.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>A self-administered anonymous survey was provided to adults with diabetes (N = 59) who used a grocery store chain pharmacy or a community clinic for the underserved. Participants were recruited by pharmacy staff to complete a 10- to 15-minute survey to assess adherence, access, barriers, medication use, and demographics. Adherence was measured using the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS), which is a reliable and valid self-report adherence instrument. Access (eg, use medications from Mexico, transportation), barriers (eg, cost, language difficulties), medication use (eg, complementary and alternative medicine, prescription medication), and demographics were also measured. The survey was available in English and Spanish. Data collection occurred from December 2010 through February 2011.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Fifty-nine participants completed the survey. Approximately 57% of study participants were male, 85% were Hispanic, and the mean age was 50.4 ± 10.3 years. Over 50% of participants had hypertension or dyslipidemia and were taking 3 or more medications. Participants (52.6%) reported their health status as good or excellent and over one-half (56%) of the participants were nonadherent (score 0-6). The following factors were significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) related to nonadherence: cost, no refills, poor health status, fewer disease states, and any reason.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>This study increased awareness of barriers to medication adherence in a predominantly Hispanic underserved patient population. This may lead to more informed recommendations and perhaps address gaps in health disparities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>According to 2007 prevalence data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), diabetes affects nearly 24 million people in the United States,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721711436134">1</xref></sup> and this number is expected to nearly double by the year 2034.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721711436134">2</xref></sup> Diabetes is a chronic disease that can lead to serious complications if left uncontrolled. In 2007, diabetes expenditures totaled $174 billion, with $116 billion as direct medical costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721711436134">3</xref></sup> Diabetes complications can be short term (eg, hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia) and long term (eg, blindness, kidney damage, cardiovascular disease, and lower-limb amputation). These complications are less likely to occur if individuals adhere to treatment regimens and control blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipid levels. Adhering to treatment regimens can include a variety of strategies such as: lifestyle management; diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension pharmacotherapy; as well as self-monitoring of blood glucose levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721711436134">3</xref></sup> Almost one-half of individuals with diabetes do not reach the A1C glycemic goals set by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721711436134">2</xref></sup> Therefore, it is important that patients adhere to treatment regimens.</p>
<p>Medication adherence is only one aspect of treatment, but according to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 50% of individuals with chronic diseases do not take their medications as prescribed. This nonadherence is responsible for $290 billion in health care expenditures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721711436134">4</xref></sup> WHO offered an all-encompassing explanation of poor adherence as any deviation from the prescribed course of medical treatment. Nonadherence can include any of the following behaviors: failure to pick up or renew prescriptions, failure to take prescribed medicine at the prescribed dosage level or at a prescribed interval, failure to persist with medication, as well as abandonment of a medication regimen altogether.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721711436134">4</xref></sup> Patients with chronic diseases (eg, diabetes) are more likely to be nonadherent to their medications than patients with acute illnesses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721711436134">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721711436134"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721711436134">4</xref></sup> One-third to one-half of all patients do not take their medications as prescribed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721711436134">4</xref></sup> which means adherence is an important health care issue. In a systematic review of oral hypoglycemic agent medication, adherence ranged from 36% to 93%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721711436134">5</xref></sup> Other studies examining diabetes medication adherence among Medicaid patients (ie, underserved) revealed adherence rates ranging from 49% to 56%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721711436134">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721711436134">7</xref></sup> Increases in adherence will lead to improved drug regimens, reduced health care expenditures, and overall improved patient outcomes.</p>
<p>Several organizations are investigating barriers to medication adherence to improve patient outcomes. The National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS) recommends that adherence interventions be a research priority for health care. In addition, improved adherence was a goal of the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act. The legislation promoted Medication Therapy Management services to target Medicare beneficiaries for extended medication counseling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721711436134">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721711436134">8</xref></sup> A 2010 <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic> article emphasized that medication adherence, or the lack thereof, is a priority for the health care reform. The authors reported that out-of-pocket costs, lack of coordination of care, and personal factors such as lifestyle, psychological issues, health literacy, support systems, and side effects are significant barriers to medication adherence in patients. This article also highlighted examples of integrated approaches to promoting adherence that have resulted in increased adherence (5%-7%) in several programs and decreased costs ($476 per patient) in another program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721711436134">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although barriers to adherence have been documented in various patient populations, unique issues such as obtaining drugs from Mexico, using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), and encountering language barriers may impact medication adherence among persons with diabetes in underserved areas of Texas. Pharmacists are in an optimal position to help patients with medication adherence because they are typically the last health care professional patients encounter prior to receiving their medications. Results from this study may identify unique barriers to adherence from a prevalent patient population in Texas. Making health care providers more aware of these issues may lead to better patient-provider interactions and potentially increase patient adherence to medications.</p>

<title>Objectives</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to better understand medication adherence in a predominately underserved Hispanic population. The study objectives were to assess: (1) medication adherence in individuals with diabetes, (2) barriers directly related to medication adherence, and (3) factors related to medication nonadherence.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section4-0145721711436134">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>This study employed a nonexperimental cross- sectional design using an anonymous self-administered survey for data collection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0145721711436134">
<title>Study Sample and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</title>
<p>A convenience sample of adults ≥ 18 years of age with diabetes who received their prescriptions at a local grocery store chain pharmacy or a community clinic for the underserved comprised the study population. Patients were initially identified and recruited because they had at least one diabetes medication prescription. After identifying patients through medical records, pharmacists then confirmed with the patient that they had diabetes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0145721711436134">
<title>Study Settings</title>
<p>A south Texas regional grocery store chain pharmacy and a community clinic for the underserved were the two sites that participated in this study. The sites were specifically selected due to the prevalence of Spanish speakers and underserved patients.</p>
<p>The grocery store pharmacy chain has over 315 stores throughout Texas and northern Mexico. The study site was chosen because of its high Hispanic population (85%). Approximately 25% of patients at that grocery store chain participate in the discount rewards program that offers a list of 500 medications at $5 for a 30-day supply or $9.99 for a 90-day supply. One-fourth of the participants who use the discount rewards program also are in a patient assistance program that provides them with brand medications at a 90-day supply for only $3 (dispensing fee). Both of these characteristics are indicative of an underserved population.</p>
<p>The community clinic study site serves residents of Travis County, Texas, who do not have any type of insurance coverage. They have been serving patients for 45 years and provide services free of charge; however, a $5 donation is suggested. The clinic has two walk-in night clinics for acute care and one chronic condition (eg, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia) night clinic for patients. Patients can get basic medical care, follow-up services, chronic disease management, medication assistance, nutrition counseling, and social service information. The community clinic also has a pharmacy to provide patients with their medications at no additional cost or donation.</p>

<title>Study Variables and Survey Instrument</title>
<p>The survey instrument was comprised of 24 items to collect information on the dependent and independent variables (described in the following). The survey was available in both English and Spanish. The Spanish survey was translated, back-translated, and compared to ensure accuracy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0145721711436134">
<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<p>The primary dependent variable, medication adherence, was measured using the self-report 8-item reliable (α = .83) and valid Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721711436134">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721711436134">10</xref></sup> Patient medication adherence can be measured using electronic monitoring devices, pharmacy refill records, pill counts, biologic concentrations (ie, blood or urine), or through self-report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721711436134">11</xref></sup> This study focused on self-report measures because of their ease of administration at the pharmacy counter and their ability to capture modifiable factors (eg, forgetfulness, side effects) related to nonadherence. A variety of self-report measures are available, but the MMAS has been validated in several disease states, including coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, and Parkinson’s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721711436134">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721711436134"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721711436134"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721711436134"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721711436134"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721711436134">17</xref></sup> The 4-item MMAS has been used in a number of studies, but the Cronbach’s alpha value was .61, which is below the acceptable range. The recently created 8-item MMAS has improved reliability (Cronbach’s alpha &gt; .80) and good test-retest reliability. Thus, it was chosen to assess adherence in the present study. The MMAS ranged from 75% to 84% concordance with pharmacy fill adherence and medication possession.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721711436134">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721711436134">10</xref></sup> The 8-item MMAS is easy to administer with 7 yes/no questions and 1 question with a 5-point Likert scale response ranging from never to always. For the first 7 yes/no items, each yes response receives 1 point, while a no response receives 0 points. The 5-point Likert question response of never receives 1 point, while the remaining responses (ie, almost never, sometimes, quite often, always) receive 0 points. The MMAS has a score range of 0 to 8, with higher numbers representing better adherence. The MMAS can also be categorized into 3 levels of adherence: high (score = 8), medium (score range 6-7), and low (score range 0-5).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721711436134">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721711436134">10</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0145721711436134">
<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>The primary independent variables were: (1) barriers to medication adherence, (2) CAM use, and (3) patient perceptions and preferences. Barriers to medication adherence included cost, transportation, no refills, pharmacy out of stock, forgetfulness, side effects, or hospitalization. CAM use included the following categories: use of spiritual healers, home remedies, and herbal medications. For barriers and CAM use, respondents were asked to check all that apply. Patient perceptions and preferences included perceived health status, verbal and written communication language preferences, and pharmacist and patient understanding. Participants were asked if they viewed their personal health status as excellent, good, fair, or poor and if they preferred English or Spanish when communicating with the pharmacist and on their prescription labels. Regarding communication with their pharmacist, participants were asked “How often do you fully understand what your pharmacist is trying to say about your medications?” and “How often does your pharmacist fully understand what you are trying to say about your medications?” Options for answering these questions included never, almost never, sometimes, quite often, and always.</p>
<p>Data on clinical (number of medications taken daily and concomitant disease states) and sociodemographic (gender, age, race/ethnicity, annual household income, and highest education level) characteristics were also collected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0145721711436134">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>A total of 150 surveys were provided to the study sites. Pharmacy staff at both sites invited participants who met the inclusion criteria to participate. Participants from the grocery store were asked to participate in the survey upon dropping off or picking up a prescription for diabetes medications. Participants from the community clinic were asked to complete the survey while waiting for their appointments if they had diabetes. Data collection began in December 2010 and continued through February 2011. This study was approved by The University of Texas Institutional Review Board.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0145721711436134">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Means and frequencies were used to describe the patient population and to address objectives 1 and 2, which were to describe medication adherence and barriers to medication adherence. Objective 3 was to assess factors related to nonadherence. The MMAS was dichotomized into nonadherent (0-6) and adherent (7-8), and chi-square analyses were used to identify significant factors. The a priori significance level was <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 and SAS version 9.1 (Cary, NC) was used for statistical analysis.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0145721711436134" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Fifty-nine participants (39.3% response rate) completed the survey, with the majority (72%) of participants recruited from the community clinic for the underserved. Baseline statistics revealed no statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) differences between respondents from the two study sites regarding medication adherence and sociodemographic variables. Approximately 57% of study participants were male and the mean age was 50.4 ± 10.3 years (range 30-71). Approximately 85% of the participants were Hispanic, 70% had less than high school education, and 77% had annual incomes of less than $20 000. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721711436134">Table 1</xref> shows that over 50% of participants had hypertension and dyslipidemia, were taking three or more medications, and reported their health status to be either excellent or good (7% and 45.6%, respectively). Study participants were asked if they preferred to speak in English or Spanish, as well as their prescription label language preference. Over one-half of the participants preferred both written (52.5%) and verbal (52.5%) communication in Spanish. Most respondents (72.9%) indicated that they “always” understood the pharmacist and 67.9% felt that the pharmacist “always” understood them.</p>

<p>On average, the MMAS score was 5.6 ± 2.1, which indicates low to medium adherence, and the scale alpha value was .76, which indicates acceptable reliability (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145721711436134">Table 2</xref>). When addressing objective 1, two separate scales were used to describe adherence levels. First, participants were grouped based on the MMAS 3 levels as described in the methods section. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145721711436134">Figure 1</xref> shows the highest frequency was in the low adherence group (45%), followed by medium (32%) and high (24%) adherence. To conserve power for the inferential statistics, adherence was reclassified into two levels: nonadherent (0-6) and adherent (7-8). Results for this dichotomous scale showed that over one-half (56%) of respondents were nonadherent (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0145721711436134">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Objective 2 was to assess barriers to medication adherence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0145721711436134">Figure 3</xref>). Cost was the most prevalent reason for medication nonadherence (22%), followed by no refills (20.3%). Other less common barriers were forgetfulness (11.9%), CAM use (10.0%), inadequate pharmacy stock (8.5%), and transportation (6.8%). Side effects from medications (1.7%) and hospitalizations (1.7%) were not commonly indicated as barriers to medication adherence. To determine whether or not the respondent indicated any one of the eight reasons as a barrier, an additional dichotomous variable was created and called “any reason.” Over 40% (44.1%) of respondents had at least one barrier to medication adherence.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Adherence is a major issue in chronic disease state management for health care professionals. Pharmacists are in a unique position to counsel patients on the importance of medication and lifestyle regimen adherence because they are typically the last health care professional to interact with the patient prior to receipt of medications. Inaccurate assessments and/or assumptions regarding medication adherence may lead to unnecessary therapy modifications (eg, dose increase, therapy augmentation), which may result in increased costs and suboptimal outcomes. In this study, the 8-item MMAS was used to assess adherence, and it revealed that the study participants were primarily nonadherent. The study results were consistent with a review of diabetes medication adherence studies, which revealed that most patients have suboptimal adherence (ie, &lt; 80%) with values ranging from 36% to 93%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721711436134">5</xref></sup> as well as two studies of underserved diabetes patients where adherence ranged from 49% to 56%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721711436134">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721711436134">7</xref></sup> Because pharmacists and other health care professionals increasingly have limited time available to interact with patients, the MMAS may provide an efficient and reliable method for assessing medication adherence and targeting specific interventions and strategies for those who are nonadherent.</p>
<p>Once a patient’s adherence level has been assessed, health care professionals should investigate barriers to adhering to pharmacotherapy and/or lifestyle recommendations. In this study, the target population listed cost and no refills as issues impeding adherence to their medication regimens. Since the majority of participants were from the community clinic for the underserved, it was surprising that cost emerged as the top barrier. These participants receive medications free of charge, and although not required, a donation of $5 is suggested. Another study showed that even when patients were not charged a copayment, adherence rates still declined and were suboptimal (&lt; 80%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721711436134">18</xref></sup> Similarly, two studies of Medicaid patients (who typically have minimal out-of-pocket expenses) revealed suboptimal adherence of less than 60%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721711436134">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721711436134">7</xref></sup> This may mean that simply removing cost as a barrier may not translate into higher adherence, nor does it mean that patients do not perceive costs associated with obtaining medications. Thus, providing discounted or free medications with coupons, samples, or patient assistance programs alone may not positively impact adherence rates.</p>
<p>Medication refills were the second most prevalent barrier. A simple question and/or perusal of a prescription bottle may provide the health care professional with an assessment of medication supply. Many physicians’ offices require the patient to contact the pharmacy and then have the pharmacy contact the doctor to request prescription refills. Pharmacists should routinely check the patient’s bottles, determine the refill status, and proactively work with the patient to make refill requests. Examining barriers to specific patient populations may help health care providers to understand more about patient’s adherence characteristics, particularly among underserved populations, who tend to experience more barriers to health care services. CAM therapy was thought to be substantial in this population from previous knowledge received during Medication Therapy Management sessions with a similar patient population. However, study findings indicated that approximately 10% of the participants revealed that they used some form of CAM therapy such as spiritual healers, herbal medications, dietary supplements, and home remedies. When examining other studies conducted with residents living along the US/Mexico border, the percentages of CAM use was higher: New Mexico (22%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721711436134">19</xref></sup> and El Paso (33%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721711436134">20</xref></sup> Because Austin is located in central Texas, and the aforementioned areas are closer in proximity to the border, the current study’s prevalence of 10% may be valid.</p>
<p>Although the majority of patients in this study indicated that they understood their pharmacists and that their pharmacists understood them, one article cited that one of the most commonly overlooked elements to ensure adherence is appropriate evaluation of patient comprehension regarding the need for treatment and the value of the therapeutic regimen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721711436134">2</xref></sup> Even though communication perceptions were relatively positive in this study, overall adherence rates were still below the target of 80%. Each study site has on-site resources to address language barriers. This may be helpful in areas where communication barriers are significant. Having readily available translators may mitigate communication or language barriers between patients and pharmacists. This study, however, did not assess patient-physician communication perceptions or whether patients understood the value of or need for their treatment regimens. Health care providers can improve communication barriers by taking extra time to ensure proper comprehension of prescribed regimens and explaining symptoms or complications of their disease state. In addition, creating a trustworthy relationship with the patient,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721711436134">2</xref></sup> continuity of care and follow-up, and increasing coordination of care with other health care providers are also very instrumental in patient improvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721711436134">8</xref></sup></p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study gave insight into an underserved Hispanic population’s personal barriers to diabetes medication adherence. However, several issues may limit the findings. First, generalizability is limited due to use of a convenience sample, a small sample size, and nonrepresentative population (85% Hispanic). Respondents were not evenly distributed between the study sites; however, there were no differences between the two sites on demographic characteristics and medication adherence. Second, researcher bias may have discouraged individuals from acknowledging and revealing CAM therapy use or the purchase of drugs across the border.</p>

<sec id="section15-0145721711436134" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The MMAS revealed suboptimal adherence to diabetes medications among a predominantly underserved Hispanic sample. Prevalent barriers included cost and lack of refills. Health care providers should be proactive in understanding patient-specific issues and identifying optimal communication methods to improve health outcomes and reduce utilization of health care services.</p>
