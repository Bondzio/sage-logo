<p>This year’s ARNOVA 2012 Conference took place in Indianapolis, Indiana. As always the conference featured several hundred paper presentations and was well-attended. We look forward to seeing the best research presented at the 2012 Conference submitted and published in NVSQ. The Editors congratulate Dr. Sarah Busse Spencer for receiving the NVSQ Best Article Award for 2011 for her article, “Culture as Structure in Emerging Civic Organizations in Russia,” published in volume 40, number 6.</p>
<p>At the 2012 ARNOVA Conference, the Editors-in-Chief, the NVSQ Editorial Board, and Leah Fargotstein, the Editor of Social Science Journals at Sage Publications, discussed next steps in furthering the development and recognition of NVSQ as the leading journal in the nonprofit field. After acknowledging the improvement in impact of NVSQ and the growth in manuscripts submitted, we concluded that NVSQ should move into the world of social media and consider other possibilities to reach out to a broader audience. Surprisingly, Wikipedia seems to be a very important referring system for journal content and NVSQ. As a consequence, NVSQ now has a Wikipedia page that contains bibliographical information plus links to the NVSQ homepage. Sage Publications also hosts several Facebook and Twitter channels in Political Science and Public Administration, Management and Sociology where NVSQ articles are featured. Please see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://facebook.com/sagecqpolitics">http://facebook.com/sagecqpolitics</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/SAGECQPolitics">http://twitter.com/SAGECQPolitics</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/SAGEManagement">http://twitter.com/SAGEManagement</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/SAGEsociology">http://twitter.com/SAGEsociology</ext-link>.</p>
<p>At our request, Sage Publications has provided tips for NVSQ authors and friends to support the journal and increase recognition of their own work and NVSQ.</p>
<list id="list1-0899764012473387" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Contribute to Wikipedia – We recognize that many students use Wikipedia as the starting point for their research. We have created a basic page for NVSQ which, with additional content, will increase the visibility of NVSQ.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Join Facebook or LinkedIn – Setting up a Facebook page for NVSQ offers a simple way of engaging with readers outside the journal. We have asked ARNOVA, parent association to NVSQ, to establish a Facebook page for NVSQ.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Upload videos and audio – User-generated and multimedia content – e.g. podcasts and YouTube videos – are an increasingly important research resource, especially for students. We plan to make podcasts that introduce articles in issues of NVSQ to the readership and to other interested followers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Join and use Twitter – Twitter is a micro-blogging service that enables its users to send and read short text-based messages known as tweets. Twitter allows users to set up search terms so that they can monitor discussions in their areas of interest. Twitter is an ideal way for you and the journal to reach new audiences.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Join academic social networking sites – Academics, researchers and students use online social communities as a way of meeting and exchanging ideas with people who share the same research interests. These sites offer an immediate way to monitor what other people are discussing in a field, or to craft papers around online conversations. Consider these sites to promote your own work and NVSQ: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Academia.edu">Academia.edu</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Mendeley.com">Mendeley.com</ext-link> or <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ResearchGate.net">ResearchGate.net</ext-link>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Start blogging – Linking journals to blogs is an excellent way of enhancing discoverability. Search engines such as Google rate blogs highly when determining page rankings. Consider creating your own blog, to include papers that you have published in NVSQ and/or other related papers. Identify any bloggers in your field and participate in discussions by posting comments, and link to relevant NVSQ content.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Engage with other websites – Consider participating in online discussions, and link your work and relevant articles from NVSQ to them.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Set up a profile on Google Scholar – The My Citations profile allows you to group your citations on Google Scholar and easily share them. By making your profile public, you will receive a url to add to your homepage or email to colleagues. A public profile also appears in search results when people search for your name, even if your name is shared by other scholars.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As Editors-in-Chief of the journal, we plan to be part of this new development toward making authors aware of the importance of social media. We discussed the possibilities for authors to promote their articles online. NVSQ authors will receive a letter with tips (similar to those above) on how to promote their newly published articles. If you would like to promote your existing articles, please visit the sites below for the most current support: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sagepub.com/journalgateway/promote.htm">http://www.sagepub.com/journalgateway/promote.htm</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sagepub.com/journalgateway/usage.htm">http://www.sagepub.com/journalgateway/usage.htm</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sageconnection.wordpress.com/">http://sageconnection.wordpress.com/</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Turning to the current issue of NVSQ, we begin volume 42 with a review article, “Religious Congregations as Voluntary Associations: An Overview,” by Ram Cnaan and Daniel Curtis. We anticipate that this review article, just as the other review articles that have been published in the journal, will be very helpful for the scholars in our field. We hope and expect to receive many new manuscript submissions following the ARNOVA 2012 Conference. We thank the authors for their interest in NVSQ, the countless peer reviewers who will assist us, and all of you for using social media and other means for helping NVSQ to continue and grow as the leading journal in the nonprofit field.</p>
