<p>Guanine triphosphate (GTP)–cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1)–deficient dopa-responsive dystonia due to GCH1 gene mutation is characterized by childhood-onset dystonia with dramatic and persistent response to low-dose L-dopa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811420871">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811420871">2</xref></sup> The patients are typically reported as having diurnal fluctuation with more severe dystonia in the evening and may be misdiagnosed with cerebral palsy. We report 2 children with GTP–cyclohydrolase 1–deficient dopa-responsive dystonia and GCH1 gene mutations who presented with frequent daily intermittent falling to the ground and briefly review GTP–cyclohydrolase 1–deficient dopa-responsive dystonia.</p>

<title>Case Reports</title>
<sec id="section2-0883073811420871">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>This 8-year-old previously healthy girl was born at term after normal pregnancy, labor, and delivery with normal milestones. She was in her usual state of health until age 8 years, when she developed frequent daily intermittent tripping and falling to the ground while walking for a few minutes with normal consciousness. Her physical and neurological examinations were normal except brisk deep tendon reflexes in the knees and ankles and her right foot turning inward when walking for a few minutes. Her brain and whole-spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were both normal at age 8 years. No brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy was done. Dopa-responsive dystonia was suspected, and carbidopa-levodopa 10/100 mg, ½ tablet twice daily, was started. Two weeks later, her right foot turning inward while walking and her falling completely disappeared, brisk deep tendon reflexes in her knees became normal, and ankle clonus was gone. This patient was tested and had a heterozygous single base pair deletion in exon 1 c.172-175 del C. This mutation has not been described previously but is likely to be pathogenic as it leads to a frame shift changing 56 amino acids in exon 1 (Laboratory of Dr Keith Hyland, Atlanta, Georgia). She has been treated with carbidopa-levodopa and has no more right foot turning inward or falling, and the efficacy has persisted for more than 3 years. Because of her persistent dramatic response to carbidopa-levodopa, complete resolution of her dystonia, and the presence of the GCH1 gene mutation, the patient and her mother declined cerebrospinal fluid studies for neurotransmitters. Family history is negative for neurological disorders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0883073811420871">
<title>Case 2</title>
<p>This 4-year-old girl was born at term after a normal pregnancy and labor via cesarean section, weighing 6 lbs 4 oz without postnatal problems. She began walking at age 11 months but had toe walking and an abnormal gait (she tended to lean forward and fall to the right side shortly after she began walking). She was diagnosed with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy at age 2 years. Her brain and spine MRI studies as well as serum creatine kinase were normal. No brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed. Despite treatment for spastic cerebral palsy with baclofen and diazepam for 2 years, she continued to have right foot inversion and frequent daily falls when walking. Her neurological examination at age 4 years was normal except for the presence of leg spasticity, worse on the right, and increased deep tendon reflexes at her knees and ankles. Shortly after she walked for a few minutes, her right foot would turn inward and she would fall to the right, which was suspicious of exertion-induced dystonia. She was started on carbidopa-levodopa treatment. She could walk, run, and play normally for hours without the right foot turning inward or falling 1 week after carbidopa-levodopa treatment and has walked normally without exertion-induced dystonia and no more falling for at least 1.5 years. Her neurological examination is now normal. She was tested and had a heterozygous missense mutation in exon 5: c.595 C &gt;T (P199S), leading to substitution of serine for proline. This pathogenic mutation, previously described by Hyland,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811420871">3</xref></sup> leads to dopa-responsive dystonia. Her mother also had been suffering from dystonia of her feet since childhood and has improved dramatically with carbidopa-levodopa 25/100 mg, 1 tablet 3 times a day. The patient and the mother declined cerebrospinal fluid studies for neurotransmitters because of the positive mutation of the GCH1 gene in the child’s blood and the persistent dramatic response to carbidopa-levodopa treatment in both.</p>
<p>In further investigation of family history, the patient’s mother, the maternal grandmother, and a maternal aunt and her daughter all suffered from muscle tightness and the foot turning inward when walking or running for several minutes since childhood. Another maternal aunt and her 2 daughters did not have similar muscle tightness or foot dystonia. However, other affected and unaffected maternal family members live in other states and have not agreed to get medical attention or treatment for muscle tightness.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Dopa-responsive dystonia, a childhood-onset dystonia initially described by Segawa et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811420871">2</xref></sup> is characterized by dramatic and sustained response to low-dose levodopa and diurnal fluctuation. Dystonia fluctuates during the day, often worsens in the evening, and improves in the morning after sleep. Recently, dopa-responsive dystonia has been reported with deficiencies of GTP–cyclohydrolase 1, tyrosine hydroxylase, and sepiapterin reductase, as well as autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811420871">4</xref></sup> Among dopa-responsive dystonia patients, GCH1 point mutations are shown in 50% to 62.5% and GCH1 deletions in 8% to 11% in reported series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811420871">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811420871"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811420871">6</xref></sup> No correlations are seen between types of GCH1 gene mutations (nonsense mutations; missense mutations, including exon 5 mutations; splicing mutations; small deletions and large deletions) and clinical phenotypes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811420871">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811420871">7</xref></sup> In patients with GCH1 gene mutations, the percentage of exercise-induced dystonia is unknown, but some patients develop dystonia only after exercise or exertion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811420871">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811420871">8</xref></sup> Patients with the GCH1 mutation typically present with pure dystonia affecting the lower extremities, with onset most frequently in the first decade of life, but onset between ages 11 and 27 years also has been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811420871">4</xref></sup> Over time, dystonia in the lower limbs often becomes generalized. Brisk deep tendon reflexes, ankle clonus, and spasticity are seen in many patients, and patients may be misdiagnosed as having cerebral palsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811420871">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811420871">9</xref></sup> These patients often are unresponsive to a variety of treatment modalities for cerebral palsy. However, when treated with levodopa, these patients improve dramatically with resolution of ankle clonus, spasticity, and dystonia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811420871">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811420871">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811420871">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811420871"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811420871"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811420871">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811420871">9</xref></sup> No dopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, or on-off phenomena were seen. There is a female predominance in GTP–cyclohydrolase 1 deficient dopa-responsive dystonia, with a female to male ratio of 2:1 to 6:1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811420871">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811420871">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811420871">9</xref></sup> GTP–cyclohydrolase 1 catalyzes the conversion of GTP to dihydroneopterin triphosphate, the first and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin, which is the cofactor for the activities of tyrosine hydroxylase, tryptophan hydroxylase, and phenylalanine hydroxylase. Tetrahydrobiopterin serves as a cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine, for tyrosine to convert to L-dopa and eventually to dopamine, and for tryptophan to convert to serotonin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073811420871">Figure 1</xref>, the concentrations of total biopterin and total neopterin in the cerebrospinal fluid are reduced in individuals with GTP–cyclohydrolase 1 deficiency. Reduction of both biopterin and neopterin is not seen in deficiencies of sepiapterin reductase, tyrosine hydroxylase, or other tetrahydrobiopterin-deficient states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811420871">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811420871">7</xref></sup> Brain and spine MRI studies are normal in patients with GCH1 mutations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811420871">7</xref></sup>

<p>Synthesis and catabolism of dopamine and serotonin. Dopamine and serotonin are formed from the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan, respectively. Their synthesis also requires 2 cofactors. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is formed in a 3-step pathway from guanine triphosphate (GTP) and is the cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase. It is also required for the activity of PAH. The second cofactor is pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, which is required for aromatic L–amino acid decarboxylase activity. Following release of dopamine and serotonin, they are rapidly metabolized to form HVA and 5HIAA, respectively, and these metabolites are measured in spinal fluid and provide an indication of the overall turnover of these neurotransmitters.
