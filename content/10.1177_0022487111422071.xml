<abstract>
<p>In recent years, Teach for America (TFA) has placed thousands of high-achieving college graduates in hard-to-staff schools, and its popularity continues to grow. TFA thus represents an anomaly: it attracts higher education’s top students to primary and secondary education’s least desired jobs. This article reviews the current explanations for TFA’s success and draws from credentialism theory to explain how these theories overlook a key characteristic differentiating TFA from other programs, and how this difference limits TFA’s generalizability. Using credentialism theory, previous research, and official recruitment messages, this article delineates TFA’s use and exchange values and finds that TFA, by recruiting noneducation majors from prestigious universities, remaining selective, embedding members in a resource-rich social network, and increasing access and reducing the costs for its members to connect to nonteaching career ladders, has increased its credential’s exchange value relative to other preparation programs. The research and policy implications of TFA’s high exchange value are discussed.</p>

<p>Much has changed since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022487111422071">Lortie (1975)</xref> labeled teachers’ social position “special but shadowed.” Today, entering teaching typically entails more stringent academic qualifications, longer formal teacher education—in some cases, including yearlong practice teaching—and more school-based induction. Although these reforms were mostly intended to enhance teacher quality, several can be attributed to attempts to professionalize teaching and raise its social status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022487111422071">Holmes Group, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022487111422071">National Commission on Teaching and America’s Future, 1996</xref>). Yet, teachers have been unable to escape Lortie’s shadow. Teachers’ social status has remained relatively stable, and to many, teaching remains a semiprofession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022487111422071">Ingersoll &amp; Perda, 2008</xref>). The academic backgrounds of entering teachers typically reflect teaching’s middling social status: entering teachers’ test scores have continued to lag the average college graduate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022487111422071">Hanushek &amp; Pace, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022487111422071">Podgursky, Monroe, &amp; Watson, 2004</xref>). In some ways, the shadow has darkened: numerous reports partly attribute U.S. students’ poor international performance to inadequately prepared, low-quality, and ineffective teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022487111422071">Akiba, LeTendre, &amp; Scribner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022487111422071">Schmidt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022487111422071">Suh &amp; Fore, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0022487111422071">Teaching Commission, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The status of teachers in low-income areas is even worse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022487111422071">Ingersoll &amp; Perda, 2008</xref>). Schools in these areas typically struggle to attract higher quality teachers—as measured by licensure tests, undergraduate institution selectivity, and SAT scores—and struggle even more to retain them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022487111422071">Bacolod, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022487111422071">Ingersoll, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022487111422071">Lankford, Loeb, &amp; Wyckoff, 2002</xref>). Current policy rhetoric, especially at the federal level, has introduced the phrase “the teacher quality gap” into the educational lexicon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022487111422071">Cohen-Vogel &amp; Hunt, 2007</xref>), implying that teachers in low-income areas are of generally lesser quality than their suburban-teaching peers. Teaching’s relatively low status does little to attract higher education’s top students, but the even lower status attributed to teachers in low-income schools, coupled with the typically poorer working conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022487111422071">Ingersoll, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022487111422071">Loeb, Darling-Hammond, &amp; Luczak, 2005</xref>), makes recruiting recent high-achieving graduates still more challenging. It is for these reasons that the success of Teach for America (TFA) is so puzzling.</p>
<p>TFA recruits new college graduates to work for 2 years in hard-to-staff schools. Most TFA participants have strong academic backgrounds. The 2009 TFA cohort had an average grade point average (GPA) of 3.6 and received an average standardized aptitude test (SAT) score of 1,344, and most attended competitive universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022487111422071">TFA, n.d.-c</xref>). TFA has grown considerably since its inception in 1989. Since 2000, the number of TFA applicants has more than quintupled (from 4,068 to nearly 25,000 in 2009) and the number of new participants has more than quadrupled (from 868 to nearly 3,600 in 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022487111422071">Decker, Mayer, &amp; Glazerman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022487111422071">TFA, 2009a</xref>). In general, TFA has been, and currently is, very successful at placing high-achieving, high-status students in low-achieving, low-status schools; it is so successful, in fact, that TFA’s acceptance rate is lower than several of the prestigious universities from which it recruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022487111422071">TFA, 2009a</xref>).</p>
<p>TFA thus represents an anomaly: it attracts higher education’s top students to primary and secondary education’s least desirable jobs. Explaining this paradox has not been straightforward. This article draws on credentialism theory, especially as developed by David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022487111422071">Labaree (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022487111422071">2004</xref>), to develop a framework for understanding TFA’s success. This framework helps organize existing research and commentary on TFA, clarifies their connection to existing theories for the program’s success, and illuminates a key characteristic of TFA that differentiates it from other programs, namely, that TFA provides a credential that is fundamentally different from those provided by other preparation programs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022487111422071">1</xref></sup> Unlike most preparation programs, which focus primarily on increasing the usefulness of its services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022487111422071">Labaree, 2004</xref>), TFA increases members’ use <italic>and</italic> exchange value. TFA, by recruiting noneducation majors from prestigious universities, remaining selective, embedding its members in a resource-rich social network, and increasing access and reducing the costs for its members to connect to nonteaching career ladders, provides a valuable credential that can be exchanged for educational and occupational positions. TFA members can easily exchange their credential for well-paid jobs or acceptance to top graduate schools; non-TFA teachers cannot. Because this framework shows that TFA’s credential differs substantially from those bestowed by other teacher preparation programs, this article argues that policy makers should be cautious when attempting to generalize the success of TFA, especially if their efforts focus only on current explanations for TFA’s popularity.</p>
<sec id="section1-0022487111422071">
<title>Explaining TFA’s Success: Current Perspectives</title>
<p>Previous research and commentaries have typically pointed to three interrelated explanations for why TFA successfully attracts high-achieving students: deregulating entry to teaching, delayed career decisions, and social justice.</p>
<sec id="section2-0022487111422071">
<title>Deregulating Entry</title>
<p>Many attribute TFA’s success to its ability to minimize traditional teacher preparation requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022487111422071">Ballou &amp; Podgursky, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022487111422071">Finn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022487111422071">Hess, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022487111422071">Matthews, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0022487111422071">Thomas B. Fordham Foundation, 1999</xref>). From this perspective, often referred to as “deregulationist” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022487111422071">Cochran-Smith &amp; Fries, 2001</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0022487111422071">Wilson &amp; Tamir, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0022487111422071">Zeichner, 2003</xref>), traditional certification routes are barriers, or “walls,” blocking potential teachers from entering the profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022487111422071">Hess, 2001</xref>). Deregulation advocates argue that traditional university-based preparation programs are expensive and time-consuming. These programs typically require students to spend several years taking education-related coursework, and several months practicing teaching, before becoming teachers. From a deregulation perspective, the costs of paying for such coursework, as well as the opportunity costs of spending time in these courses and practice teaching without pay, make becoming a teacher unappealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022487111422071">Hess, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0022487111422071">Thomas B. Fordham Foundation, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, deregulation advocates argue that the coursework offered by traditional preparation programs does little to actually prepare better teachers. From this perspective, these programs require coursework that is arbitrary, unchallenging, and unneeded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022487111422071">Finn, 2001</xref>). Whether or not deregulation advocates’ characterization of teacher preparation coursework is correct, there is little denying that most universities’ schools, colleges, or departments of education (SCDEs) are not highly regarded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022487111422071">Labaree, 2004</xref>). Thus, deregulation advocates argue that higher education’s best students may be interested in becoming teachers but are turned off by their institutions’ SCDEs’ poor reputations for intellectually unchallenging coursework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022487111422071">Greenspan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0022487111422071">Thomas B. Fordham Foundation, 1999</xref>)—if an SCDE even exists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022487111422071">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>For many deregulation advocates, TFA represents the “ideal” deregulated route to teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022487111422071">Finn &amp; Petrilli, 2007</xref>). Unlike traditional teacher education programs attached to colleges and universities, TFA concentrates participants’ formal preparation into an intensive summer training session. TFA members attend a summer institute that involves observing veteran teachers, practice teaching in a collaborating summer school, and coursework covering leadership, instructional planning, classroom management, diversity, learning theory, and literacy development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022487111422071">TFA, n.d.-h</xref>). So although TFA members do not enter the classroom preparation-less, they spend substantially less preservice time preparing to teach than do their “traditional” counterparts. Consequently, TFA members lose little money—in fact, TFA members are eligible for US$1,000 to US$6,000 in no-interest loans and grants to cover expenses resulting from traveling to and from training as well as relocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022487111422071">TFA, n.d.-i</xref>)—and time to lengthy preparation requirements, and remain unconnected to “burdensome” and ill-reputed SCDEs before obtaining paid teaching positions. As the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0022487111422071">Thomas B. Fordham Foundation (1999)</xref> noted, the popularity of such programs as TFA “indicates that the prospect of teaching without first being obliged to spend years in pedagogical study appeals to some of our brightest college graduates” (p. 10).</p>
<p>Yet, existing research does not necessarily support this notion, although it does not disprove it either. Research on other alternative pathways to teaching demonstrates that removing entry barriers was indeed the primary impetus attracting program participants. In a study of 13 alternative route programs across four states, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022487111422071">Johnson, Birkeland, and Peske (2005)</xref> found that participants in all 13 programs cited low costs (both monetary and opportunity), quick and convenient training, and practical coursework (as opposed to the theoretical courses that many believe are typically part of traditional preparation programs) as the main reasons for choosing their particular programs. All four of these reasons are consistent with the deregulation perspective. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022487111422071">Liu, Johnson, and Peske (2004)</xref> found that many of those who took part in Massachusetts’s signing bonus program, which included a US$20,000 signing bonus over 4 years, were more strongly attracted to how the program reduced the requirements needed to enter teaching than the additional money. Several of these program participants stated that they had long contemplated teaching as a career but did not want go through what they considered to be unnecessary preparation.</p>
<p>None of the above studies, however, included TFA participants, and most program participants were midcareer switchers rather than first career entrants (of which nearly all are TFA members). It is difficult to ascertain whether TFA applicants are attracted to the same deregulation-based incentives—and perhaps more importantly, although TFA streamlines entry into teaching, because TFA does not actually certify teachers, many TFA members must work toward certification while teaching. In many states, this includes enrolling in university-based preparation programs. Although deregulation advocates lament these requirements—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022487111422071">Finn and Petrilli (2007)</xref> called them the “warts of the alternative certification movement”—they do not seem to be making TFA any less popular; TFA’s applicant pool has continued to increase annually.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022487111422071">3</xref></sup> If deregulation was the only reason recent college graduates joined TFA, we would expect TFA’s size to decrease as its members faced more regulations. But, in fact, the opposite has happened. For example, in 2003, New York began requiring TFA members to work toward certification while teaching, so that by the end of the program TFA members will have completed a set of courses similar to those taken by traditional university-based program graduates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022487111422071">Boyd, Grossman, Lankford, Loeb, &amp; Wyckoff, 2006</xref>). Yet, these increased regulations have not corresponded to a decreasing New York City TFA presence; the number of TFA members in New York City nearly doubled from 2003 to 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022487111422071">Boyd, Grossman, Lankford, Loeb, &amp; Wyckoff, 2006</xref>). Although it is difficult to tell how many more applications TFA would have garnered if they had not been required to gain certification, it does not appear as though regulations have been as repellent as some have argued.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0022487111422071">
<title>Delayed Career Decisions</title>
<p>Closely related to the deregulation perspective—in many ways part of the deregulation perspective—some argue that TFA successfully recruits top college students because it allows graduates to delay their choice of career. Because TFA only requires members to teach for 2 years, it attracts those who have not wanted to teach all their lives but still want to explore teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022487111422071">Ballou &amp; Podgursky, 1998</xref>). This perspective is part of the larger research agenda on the changing conceptions of teaching careers (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022487111422071">Peske, Liu, Johnson, Kauffman, &amp; Kardos, 2001</xref>). Unlike earlier cohorts of teachers who typically remained in teaching until retirement, many current entrants, from traditional and alternative pathways, do not envision a similar lifelong commitment and instead approach teaching “tentatively and conditionally” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022487111422071">Peske et al., 2001</xref>, p. 305). Teaching is not unique in this respect; changing careers has become increasingly common. In a Public Agenda survey of recent college graduates, half believed that they would eventually change careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022487111422071">Farkas et al., 2000</xref>); even many adolescents perceive their future career paths to fluctuate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022487111422071">Schneider &amp; Stevenson, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>From this perspective, TFA is successful because it is aligned with college graduates’ shifting career visions. TFA better reflects these current labor market realities than traditional preparation programs because it makes it easy for recent college graduates to explore teaching. TFA also coalesces with recent college graduates’ tentative approaches to choosing careers, as it allows its members to delay any permanent career decisions for 2 years. Whether TFA members are considering teaching or deciding among other occupations, TFA provides its members time to think about future career trajectories while earning a teacher’s salary.</p>
<p>The few studies examining TFA members’ motives for joining provide some support for the delayed career decision perspective. In their national study of alternative teaching pathways, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022487111422071">Humphrey and Wechsler (2007)</xref> found that nearly half (46%) indicated they joined TFA to “explore teaching as a career,” only 12% of members joined TFA because “teaching has always been their calling,” and only 11% of members planned to teach for at least 10 years. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022487111422071">Stevens and Dial (1993)</xref> interviewed approximately 33 TFA members working in a southwestern urban district and found that most joined the program because, after graduating college, they were indecisive about their future career plans or had limited occupational opportunities. These results indicate that many TFA members are indeed tentative about their career plans; many have only minimally considered teaching prior to joining the program and are using TFA to test teaching as a career or as something to do before making longer career commitments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022487111422071">
<title>Social Justice</title>
<p>The third explanation for TFA’s recruiting success is its focus on eradicating educational inequality. TFA’s recruitment messages often refer to this country’s achievement gap and emphasize that, given hard-working and dedicated teachers, students in hard-to-staff schools have the potential and ability to eliminate this gap. TFA seeks those interested in social justice and members join the program to answer TFA’s call to service. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0022487111422071">Zeichner (2003)</xref> labeled this attribute “missionary,” and described it as a goal to attract “idealistic” young people to help poor, low-achieving students (p. 504).</p>
<p>Compared with the career-exploration and deregulation perspectives, TFA’s recruitment messages most strongly emphasize social justice. TFA sees its program’s primary mission as building “the movement to eliminate educational inequity by enlisting our nation’s most promising future leaders in this effort” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0022487111422071">TFA, n.d.-f</xref>). From the social justice perspective, TFA is successful because it taps into the large cadres of graduating students looking to ameliorate broad social inequalities. Because TFA only places members in low-income, hard-to-staff schools, it is an attractive way for recent graduates to help quickly and in places where inequality is acutely felt.</p>
<p>Yet, although TFA strongly emphasizes the social justice perspective, in the same national study referenced earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022487111422071">Humphrey and Wechsler (2007)</xref> found that fewer TFA members joined the program because they “wanted to contribute to society before moving on to another field outside of education” (about 33%) than those who joined to explore teaching as a career (46%). In addition, in examining TFA cohorts in Houston, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022487111422071">Raymond, Fletcher, and Luque (2001)</xref> found that those TFA members who continued to teach after their 2-year requirement tended to move from lower achieving schools to higher achieving schools, and thus further away from the students most affected by social injustice.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022487111422071">
<title>Overlapping Limitations of Existing Theories</title>
<p>None of the explanations of deregulation, delayed career decision, or social justice have been overwhelmingly able to explain TFA’s recruiting success. This is due to the fact that no single explanation will represent all members’ motives. Applicants do not choose one reason or another to apply to TFA, but are instead likely motivated by some blend of all three. But these explanations also share two important shortcomings: none of the existing explanations demonstrate why TFA is more appealing to high-achieving college graduates than other streamlined programs, and researchers have yet to study the motivations of TFA applicants rather than members, depleting all three theories of a sound evidentiary base.</p>
<p>To begin, the three existing theories are not unique to TFA. Other streamlined programs are equal, if not more deregulated, allow easy access for career explorers, and connect to hard-to-staff schools and districts. Compared with other alternative pathways, including those with less preservice requirements than TFA, TFA’s ability to attract higher education’s top students is unrivalled. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022487111422071">Humphrey and Wechsler (2007)</xref> found that 79% of the approximately 200 TFA members in their sample graduated from a competitive college, whereas all seven of the other programs studied enrolled less than 62% of such graduates.</p>
<p>Although TFA’s substantial resources—TFA raised 114.5 million dollars in operating revenue in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022487111422071">TFA, 2009a</xref>)—and large presence on college campuses make it difficult to compare TFA with other alternative route programs and expect similar success, it helps explain why top college graduates tend to choose TFA. But researchers have yet to explore whether TFA applicants are unaware of other alternative routes to teaching or simply choose not to apply. Because more than 20,000 applicants did not join TFA in 2009, one might expect that there are potentially 20,000 recent college graduates interested in teaching. Whether these applicants considered TFA as the only program worth applying to, the only program they knew about, or whether they did in fact seek access to teaching elsewhere is an unanswered question.</p>
<p>This question is difficult to answer because research has yet to examine TFA applicants themselves. Existing studies of TFA, including studies exploring why members joined the program or became teachers, have restricted their sample to TFA members. In most cases, this constriction is prudent and logical. Studies analyzing the student achievement effects of TFA gain nothing by studying applicants who were not accepted. But studies looking at why members joined TFA have limited generalizability. This is especially salient because only 14% of applicants actually become members. Given TFA’s intensive recruitment and screening processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022487111422071">Foote, 2008</xref>), TFA members are not a random sample of applicants and possibly differ in motivation and incentives than those not selected to join the program.</p>
<p>Not only have existing theories sometimes struggled to explain TFA’s success, but all three miss a key difference between TFA and other programs. The logic underlying existing theories is that TFA differs substantially from other routes to teaching—it is less regulated, allows members to easily explore teaching, and provides opportunities to fight social injustice—and some combination of these differences has allowed TFA to explode in popularity. Yet, using a credentialism framework, this article illuminates another important difference between TFA and other programs—a difference that demonstrates the difficulty encountered when trying to generalize TFA’s recruiting success and the caution needed when using TFA as an example on which to set policy regarding the preparation of all teachers.</p>

<title>Theoretical Framework: Credentialism</title>
<p>Like most theories, credentialism represents a diffuse set of ideas. At its core, however, credentialism is a theory about advantage. Mostly originating from Max <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0022487111422071">Weber (1968)</xref>, credentialism theorists argue that individuals seek credentials (usually in the form of educational degrees) to monopolize access to occupational positions and legitimate power within organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022487111422071">Brown, 2001</xref>). Credentials limit different sector’s labor supply by barring access for those individuals without certain credentials, thus providing credential holders distinct labor market advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022487111422071">Collins, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022487111422071">Illich, 1970</xref>).</p>
<p>That (usually educational) credentials provide individuals labor market advantages is not surprising. Many see the credential-labor market connection as meritocratic and rational: one’s credentials indicate or “signal” his or her ability, productivity, motivation, and/or employability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022487111422071">Arkes, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022487111422071">Spence, 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022487111422071">1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0022487111422071">Weiss, 1995</xref>). In fact, human capital theory posits that acquiring credentials necessarily implies acquiring important skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022487111422071">Becker, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022487111422071">Schultz, 1962</xref>). Employers would, consequently, be wise to select credential holders. Employers seek to reduce the uncertainty of bringing new members into their organization, and credentials serve this function by providing valuable information about prospective employees or, from the human capital perspective, guaranteeing that credential holders have gained important job-related skills.</p>
<p>However, credentialism theory argues that credentials are only minimally associated with job skills, duties, or worker productivity, and are often arbitrary means of controlling access to elite occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022487111422071">Berg, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487111422071">Bills, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022487111422071">Collins, 1979</xref>). Credentialism theorists vary, however, in assessing employers’ rationality for using credential-based hiring procedures. Some argue that credentials are completely unconnected to occupational productivity, and employers who choose applicants because of their credentials are irrational and counterproductive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022487111422071">Berg, 1971</xref>). Others maintain that credentials are nothing more than “cultural currency”—or “formal summary announcements of the quantity of cultural goods an individual has acquired” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022487111422071">Collins, 1979</xref>, p. 62)—and that credentials signal certain cultural dispositions, such as language and oratorical skills, obedience, and “relatively uniform character types,” that employers find valuable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022487111422071">Brown, 1995</xref>). In general, however, credentialism theorists argue that credentials are largely unrelated to technical skills, and instead derive their value from being able to be traded for lucrative occupational positions.</p>
<p>The connection between human capital theory and credentialism is captured by discussing credentials in terms of their use and exchange values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022487111422071">Labaree, 1997</xref>). A credential bestows use value if it supplies its holders with skills and knowledge that help carry out various, usually work-related, roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022487111422071">Labaree, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022487111422071">2004</xref>). Alternatively, credentials have exchange value if the credential, independent of what was actually learned or gained while acquiring it, can be exchanged for something, usually a job, the credential holder finds more valuable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022487111422071">Labaree, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022487111422071">2004</xref>). Both signaling theory and human capital theory argue that credential holders represent more productive workers and more usable knowledge, and are thus worth more on the labor market. In other words, both theories argue that holders of educational credentials have use value, and this use value is directly proportional to its exchange value; better credentials are rightfully exchanged for better jobs.</p>
<p>Credentialism theory does not maintain an inherent link between credentials and use value, however. Instead, it posits that individuals seek credentials not to obtain the skills and knowledge that will assist future life roles, but for their exchange value.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022487111422071">4</xref></sup> Evidence that credentials also bestow exchange value independent of any use value has been found in two related phenomena: the “sheepskin effect” and credential inflation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487111422071">Bills, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022487111422071">2004</xref>). Sheepskin effects represent the nonlinear relationship between educational attainment and wages: returns to schooling bump upward for credential holders. In other words, an additional year of schooling is worth considerably more if it is associated with obtaining a credential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022487111422071">Bills, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022487111422071">Hungerford &amp; Solon, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022487111422071">Park, 1999</xref>). Sheepskin effects imply that an individual with 4 years of college has fewer opportunities than someone with 4 years of college and a degree. If credentials were solely linked to use value, there should be little difference in a credential’s exchange value between years of schooling, as each year should provide a relatively equal amount of job-related skills. Of course, this does not exactly prove that credentials have independent exchange value as degree holders may be fundamentally different from those who spent 4 years in college but did not earn a degree, especially if these differences include dedication, effort, and other work skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022487111422071">Bills, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Credential inflation also demonstrates that credentials have exchange value independent of their use value. Credential inflation represents employers and educational consumers “raising the ante” over jobs and occupations’ credential requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487111422071">Bills, 2003</xref>). The average job’s credential requirements have far outpaced the same job’s technical (or use value) requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022487111422071">Collins, 1979</xref>). Because credentials have come to represent exchange value, individuals seeking to gain or preserve labor market advantage need to continually possess more credentials. A credential’s exchange value decreases as more individuals possess it so individuals must, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022487111422071">Brown (2001)</xref>, engage in “defensive posturing in labor market queues” or find their credential is too ordinary to be exchanged for anything very worthwhile (p. 22).</p>
<p>In many ways, credentialism theory supports the deregulation perspective outlined above. Much like credentialism theorists, deregulation advocates argue that traditional teacher preparation programs bestow few technical skills or useful knowledge and are instead arbitrary means for restricting labor supply and monopolizing access to teaching. In other words, traditional teacher certification bestows little use value. However, in other ways, deregulation does not agree with credentialism. Most deregulation advocates require teaching entrants to have a subject-matter degree and are thus from a credentialism perspective simply shifting the locus of control from educational credentials to subject-matter credentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022487111422071">Darling-Hammond, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022487111422071">Hawley, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022487111422071">Stoddart &amp; Floden, 1995</xref>) and are consequently no less exclusionary. Applying credentialism theory to traditional teacher preparation is not the focus of this article (however, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022487111422071">Tamir &amp; Wilson, 2005</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0022487111422071">Wilson &amp; Tamir, 2008</xref>, for a more extended discussion of neo-Webarian challenges to traditional teacher preparation). Instead, this article uses credentialism theory to examine TFA’s use and exchange values and compare them with the credentials bestowed by other preparation programs. Applying this framework helps organize current research on TFA and demonstrates that the exchange value of a TFA credential is fundamentally different and distinctly more valuable than the credentials bestowed by other preparation programs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022487111422071">
<title>TFA’s Use and Exchange Value</title>
<p>Research on TFA is still growing (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0022487111422071">Zeichner &amp; Conklin, 2005</xref>, pp. 675-684, for a recent review). However, previous studies have narrowly focused on one aspect of TFA’s use value and have consequently neglected its exchange value.</p>
<sec id="section8-0022487111422071">
<title>Use Value</title>
<p>The use value of TFA depends on the context in which alumni will apply their skills. This context can be broadly dichotomized into use value for teaching and use value for nonteaching positions, which may or may not be related to education. Use value for teaching incorporates those skills that help make TFA members good teachers; use value for nonteaching positions represent the skills TFA members acquire in the program and that are valuable for occupational or educational positions outside of the classroom.</p>
<p>TFA’s use value for teaching has three components: recruitment and selection, preservice preparation, and induction and ongoing support. First, TFA members may be effective teachers, because TFA is able to cull the best teachers from a large applicant pool. TFA chooses “individuals who have the potential to achieve based on the skills and strengths that [TFA has] determined over time lead to success in our classrooms” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022487111422071">TFA, n.d.-i</xref>); in other words, TFA seeks to only select those who already have considerable use value for teaching. From a deregulation perspective, TFA’s recruitment and selection criteria are the sine qua non of its ability to place productive teachers in low-income schools. Recruiting and selecting productive teachers does not involve TFA actually providing members with technical skills or knowledge—TFA’s recruitment and selection strategies do not <italic>increase</italic> its members’ use value for teaching. Nevertheless, from the perspective of school administrators hiring TFA members, TFA’s intensive screening procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022487111422071">Foote, 2008</xref>) help ensure that incoming members are capable teachers.</p>
<p>Second, TFA may increase its members use value for teaching through its summer preparation program. Although the short time frame has led several to argue that it is unlikely that TFA’s preservice preparation adds significant use value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022487111422071">Darling-Hammond, 1994</xref>), the program’s tailored nature—the summer institute specifically seeks to prepare TFA members for low-income schools—and long and demanding hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022487111422071">Foote, 2008</xref>) may indeed increase members’ effectiveness. Third, TFA seeks to increase its members’ use value for teaching by providing mentorship and educative seminars while members teach. These induction and support activities may help TFA members improve their practices as they serve their 2-year commitment.</p>
<p>Although nearly all studies of TFA have focused on its members’ effectiveness, few have disentangled the differential effects of TFA’s recruitment/selection, preservice preparation, and induction/support components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022487111422071">Humphrey, Wechsler, &amp; Hough, 2008</xref>, provide one recent exception). Instead, previous studies have mostly examined whether TFA members’ students achieve higher, lower, or similarly to non-TFA teachers working in similar settings, without regard to why these differences exist. In other words, prior research has examined whether TFA members are generally “better” or “worse” than the teachers districts would otherwise hire. The results of these studies tend to show that TFA members do not harm their students’ achievement growth and in some cases improve it over what would have been expected had the same students not had a TFA teacher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022487111422071">Boyd et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022487111422071">Decker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0022487111422071">Xu, Hannaway, &amp; Taylor, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>From a credentialism perspective, then, most studies of TFA focus entirely on the program’s use value for teaching. The use value gained by participating in TFA is not limited to increasing one’s teaching abilities, however. Because TFA members spend 2 years teaching in a hard-to-staff school, TFA may also increase individuals’ nonteaching use value by providing the type of job experience that enhances members’ sense of responsibility, leadership, ability to work within organizations, time management, work ethic, and a bevy of other work-related characteristics that can transfer to performance in other occupations. This type of use value is especially valuable to those members who join TFA as a way to engage in public service before moving on to a nonteaching career.</p>
<p>This perspective seems to be reaffirmed by graduate schools and employers, as the University of Michigan Medical School’s Director of Admissions notes that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The skill set that [TFA] candidates will bring with them is in some ways at a higher level relative to the way he or she handles diverse groups of people, the way they take some leadership initiative, [and] the way they organize time and energy and individualize the attention and care necessary for the various individuals within the spectrum of say one classroom. I think those are the kind of skills that are very transferable. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022487111422071">TFA, n.d.-e</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Employers’ and graduate schools’ intense interest in TFA alumni encouraged <italic>BusinessWeek</italic> to rank TFA the seventh best place to launch a career in 2009.</p>
<p>From a credentialism perspective, employers and graduate schools view TFA as providing members additional use value, although not necessarily the same use value that increases one’s teaching abilities. To many organizations, a TFA credential implies one has earned valued leadership and organizational skills, and is a more productive employee. Some organizations allow TFA members to defer acceptance of a job or admission into a graduate program so that they may serve their 2-year commitment, under the assumption that those 2 years will be spent increasing their future employee’s use value. A TFA credential may better capture a job applicant’s use value than a college degree, which many credentialism theorists argue symbolizes few technical skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022487111422071">Berg, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022487111422071">Collins, 1979</xref>). This notion fits squarely with traditional human capital theory: a TFA credential is worth more on the labor market because TFA alumni have necessarily gained important abilities.</p>
<p>Research has yet to study this side of TFA’s use value, however, so it is difficult to ascertain whether one’s TFA experience actually represents increased nonteaching productivity. Moreover, TFA’s support to members during their 2-year commitments is centered on teaching and student performance, not general work-related skills. Although TFA does provide several career resources, these resources focus primarily on finding and securing jobs rather than improving job-specific skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022487111422071">TFA, n.d.-a</xref>). Any increase in nonteaching use value gained by joining TFA should consequently be earned primarily through the experience of working as a teacher in a hard-to-staff school. Therefore, if employers and graduate schools value TFA members’ nonteaching work skills, they should similarly value non-TFA teachers, as they too have presumably acquired the type of use value that is derived from teaching experience. Yet, non-TFA teachers are rarely held in equally high esteem. Law and medical schools do not maintain scholarship opportunities for former teachers, as many do for former TFA members; businesses do not seek access to networks of non-TFA teachers, although many recruit heavily from TFA’s ranks—for example, J. P. Morgan treats TFA as a “core recruiting school” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022487111422071">TFA, n.d.-d</xref>). A stark difference exists in graduate schools’ and employers’ interest in recruiting TFA members versus non-TFA teachers. However, it is difficult to attribute this difference to differences in the nonteaching use value earned while teaching, as neither TFA nor other preparation programs spend many resources attempting to increase the nonteaching productivity of its current members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022487111422071">
<title>Exchange Value</title>
<p>The difference in employers and graduate schools’ efforts to recruit TFA versus non-TFA teachers demonstrates that the exchange value of a TFA credential is higher than those bestowed by other preparation programs, although the amount of nonteaching use value learned in the respective teaching experiences is relatively similar. What explains this discrepancy? One reason is that traditional university-based preparation programs have typically bestowed credentials with very little exchange value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022487111422071">Labaree, 2004</xref>). The reasons for these programs’ low exchange value are numerous. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022487111422071">Labaree (2004)</xref> argued that it is partly due to teacher preparation and teaching’s historical themes, such as its connection to the public sector, middle class, women, and children, and partly due to the supply demands it has faced and currently faces—a large number of new teachers must be produced annually. Traditional teacher preparation programs’ credentials also have low exchange value because they represent “soft” and “applied” knowledge, rather than the hard (e.g., natural science), pure (e.g., philosophy) knowledge characterizing higher education’s most prestigious departments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022487111422071">Labaree, 2004</xref>). But ultimately, traditional preparation programs provide little exchange value because they are associated with teaching; or as Labaree put it, they are “bonded to one of the more lowly paid and more ordinary professions” (p. 70).</p>
<p>TFA escapes traditional programs’ low exchange value fate in four ways, all of which are independent of the amount of use value earned while partaking in the program: (a) recruiting noneducation majors from prestigious universities, (b) remaining selective, (c) embedding members in resource-rich social networks, and (d) increasing access and reducing the costs for its members to connect to nonteaching career ladders.</p>
<p>TFA heavily recruits from the most prestigious universities and colleges and therefore recruits members who already have credentials with high exchange value. This point may seem frivolous but is important when we consider that most traditionally certified teachers come from lower exchange value regional or state universities. Moreover, most TFA members did not major in education (only 3% of 2009’s cohort); most studied the social sciences, policy, and business and economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022487111422071">TFA, 2009b</xref>). TFA members are not defined by an education degree and are not subject to its typically lowly status.</p>
<p>Taken together, TFA members’ acclaimed, noneducation-based backgrounds implies that TFA members are less likely to be characterized as teachers by default—that is, one who becomes a teacher because they are not talented enough for more prestigious occupations. Instead, TFA members are more likely to be characterized as philanthropically giving their services when their high-status education could have provided a more lucrative job. Thus, although most TFA members already have considerable exchange value, joining TFA <italic>increases</italic> this value by portraying its members as service oriented. Primarily recruiting from the nation’s most selective universities and colleges—and purposefully doing so from the program’s inception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022487111422071">Foote, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022487111422071">Kopp, 2003</xref>)—characterizes TFA members as quasi volunteers. A TFA credential allows its holders to signal a higher level of selflessness, integrity, and work ethic, all of which employers and graduate schools seemingly desire. Indeed, President Obama in signing the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act alluded to TFA’s volunteeristic spirit:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s the same spirit of service I’ve seen across this country. I’ve met countless people of all ages and walks of life who want nothing more than to do their part. I’ve seen a rising generation of young people work and volunteer and turn out in record numbers . . . [They’re] why 35,000 young people applied for only 4,000 slots in Teach for America. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022487111422071">Obama, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What is surprising is not that TFA members are extolled for teaching in hard-to-staff schools but that this work is equated to volunteering and public service when they are asked to perform the same work and are paid the same amount as all 1st- and 2nd-year teachers in their respective districts. Non-TFA members tend to lack the highly acclaimed educational backgrounds and are thus not typically described as bypassing more lucrative opportunities to teach; teaching for them is usually just labeled a job. Consequently, non-TFA members’ exchange value is less affected by working in hard-to-staff schools. In the end, the social justice component of TFA may not only attract members to the program but also increase their exchange value by signaling a type of devotion and selfless ethic.</p>
<p>Second, TFA has high exchange value because it is highly selective: only about 16% of TFA applicants eventually become members. Selectivity boosts exchange value because it provides distinction. By design, TFA has been a selective program since it began, even though the number of applicants in its nascent years was much smaller than that of today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022487111422071">Kopp, 2003</xref>). Anecdotal evidence shows that the program’s prestigious nature is part of its appeal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022487111422071">Foote, 2008</xref>). In turn, TFA’s selective admissions signal to employers and graduate schools that its members are a carefully chosen group—the “best and brightest”—and are worthy of top occupational and educational positions. Traditional preparation programs, however, cannot match TFA’s selectivity. Being a part of many traditional preparation programs is hardly a distinction—most who apply are accepted. As a result, traditional teacher certification does not distinguish a select group of students and thus does not provide many nonteaching labor market advantages.</p>
<p>Third, TFA increases the program’s exchange value by embedding members in a resource-rich social network. TFA facilitates interactions among alumni through their Career and Leadership Center, where alumni can “identify and pursue career opportunities through resume coaching, alumni mentors, resume collections, career webinars, subscription-based newsletters in nine different career areas, and a comprehensive job board” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022487111422071">TFA, n.d.-a</xref>). TFA also organizes alumni summits, which, among other activities, provide an opportunity for TFA alumni to “explore career and job opportunities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022487111422071">TFA, n.d.-a</xref>). A TFA credential therefore grants access to a vast alumni network and increases alumni’s social capital. Most of the connections in this network are weak—a TFA alumnus will not personally know most other alumni—and weak connections are most valuable when using social networks to find and secure jobs because they are more likely to present nonredundant and otherwise inaccessible information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022487111422071">Granovetter, 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022487111422071">1995</xref>). This network creates situations where various career opportunities are presented to TFA alumni, opportunities TFA members would be less likely to access or even know of without a TFA credential. Although university-based preparation programs can create social networks connecting graduates to job opportunities, these opportunities are generally teaching jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022487111422071">Maier &amp; Youngs, 2009</xref>). TFA, however, embeds its alumni in a network that is connected to significantly more opportunities, both teaching and nonteaching alike, increasing its credential’s exchange value.</p>
<p>Last, TFA makes admission to top graduate schools and businesses more accessible and inexpensive. TFA has numerous partnerships with graduate schools and high-status employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022487111422071">TFA, n.d.-d</xref>). For example, Yale and MIT’s graduate schools of business, the University of Chicago and the University of Michigan’s law schools, and Duke and Harvard’s graduate schools of public policy and government, among numerous other graduate schools, provide scholarships aimed <italic>exclusively</italic> at TFA alumni (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022487111422071">TFA, n.d.-d</xref>). TFA has similar partnerships with many businesses and law firms. Moreover, through its partnership with Americorps, after completing their 2 years of service, TFA members are eligible for more than US$10,000 to help pay for future educational expenses or pay back student loans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022487111422071">TFA, n.d.-j</xref>). So not only does a TFA credential facilitate access to top graduate schools and businesses, but it can also reduce the costs.</p>
<p>The career ladders of traditionally certified as well as most other alternative programs’ teachers are not so alluring. Non-TFA teacher certification connects its members to schools and, for the most part, schools only. Recent college graduates not joining TFA, but who work 2 years in a hard-to-staff school, are prohibited from applying to the many scholarships and fellowships aimed exclusively at TFA alumni and most are not eligible to receive more than US$10,000 in loan forgiveness or educational credit even though they spent the intervening 2 years in a relatively similar manner. Consequently, TFA can be the initial stage in multiple high-status career ladders; a non-TFA educational credential provides access to teaching’s relatively flat career.</p>

<title>Exchange Value and Current Explanations for TFA’s Success</title>
<p>A credentialism framework illuminates an important difference between TFA and other teaching pathways. Applying this framework demonstrates that TFA has a higher exchange value than other routes to teaching, especially traditional university-based preparation programs. This difference has important implications for how researchers and policy makers interpret the success of TFA.</p>
<p>To begin, research has yet to examine the direct effects of exchange value on TFA’s popularity. A credentialism framework makes clear that being a TFA alumnus facilitates access to educational and occupational opportunities. Although most TFA members’ reputable academic backgrounds already made them good candidates for such opportunities, TFA’s high exchange value increases the likelihood that TFA alumni will have access to these positions. Whether this higher exchange value goes unnoticed by applicants is difficult to ascertain because research has yet to examine applicants themselves, and studies of TFA members typically only ask about the traditional explanations for TFA’s popularity—that is, social justice, reduced entrance requirements, and delayed career decisions.</p>
<p>Increasing one’s exchange value beyond a bachelor’s degree from a competitive university is not inconsequential, however. The number of Americans earning postsecondary degrees is rising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0022487111422071">Snyder &amp; Dillow, 2011</xref>). As greater percentages of the population become credentialed, the exchange value of a Bachelor’s degree decreases. Recent college graduates will increasingly find that their undergraduate degrees provide fewer distinctions, making the high exchange value of a TFA credential more salient.</p>
<p>A saturated credential market also helps explain why many employers and graduate schools seek TFA alumni. Employers and graduate schools attempt to reduce the uncertainty of bringing new members into their organizations. Both types of organizations want to accept the most productive applicants possible but have only limited information on which to base such decisions. For most organizations, higher education degrees serve as a “screen” or “filter” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022487111422071">Arrow, 1973</xref>) that signals a potential employee’s productivity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487111422071">Bills, 2003</xref>, for a review of screening theory). But when the percentage of applicants with such degrees increases, organizations can less easily discern and compare applicants’ quality—when most applicants have an undergraduate degree, using a bachelor’s degree as a screen does little to narrow the applicant pool. Applicants with an additional TFA credential, therefore, stand apart and are situated above applicants without such a distinction. One reason for this preference is the belief that TFA increases members’ use value. Although this seems plausible, it has yet to be researched, and the fact that graduates of other preparation programs with several years of experience are not equally valued (although one would assume they acquired similar leadership and organizational skills) implies that graduate schools and employers also prefer TFA credentials independent of the skills acquired while in the program.</p>
<p>Although the benefits of TFA’s exchange value are clear, only future research will indicate how strongly it directly attracts applicants. Just as it is unlikely that individuals choose only one of the current explanations as their motivation for applying to TFA, it is equally unlikely that they pursue TFA solely for its exchange value. TFA likely attracts applicants through all four overlapping mechanisms, and applicants likely choose TFA for multiple reasons. From this perspective, TFA’s high exchange value does not supplant existing theories of TFA’s success but enhances them. A credentialism framework provides evidence that when TFA members join the program, they are not just exploring teaching, delaying career decisions, or fighting social injustice, they are doing all these things while situating themselves in advantageous labor market and social positions. TFA allows all members to join the program for any of these existing reasons without derailing their careers. In fact, a credentialism framework indicates that it likely advances them. TFA becomes not only an opportunity to fight social injustice and help low-income students but also a place to further one’s career—to do good but also to do well.</p>

<title>Discussion: Implications of TFA’s High Exchange Value</title>
<p>A credentialism framework demonstrates that TFA’s credential is fundamentally different than other teaching pathways. This difference has important implications for how researchers and policy makers generalize and attempt to expand TFA’s success. Assuming TFA’s success over university-based preparation is due solely to some combination of reduced regulations and an emphasis on social justice misses the fact that the exchange value and social status of a TFA credential are also fundamentally different from these programs. What separates TFA from traditional routes to teaching is more than the way it allows candidates to easily explore teaching or help eliminate the achievement gap. One must therefore be cautious when using TFA’s success as evidence that simply tearing down the wall will automatically attract more high-status teachers.</p>
<p>Although the extent to which a high exchange value contributes to TFA’s popularity awaits further research, a credentialism framework highlights the difficulties that other preparation programs have bestowing a credential with similar advantages. For example, university-based preparation programs will likely never match TFA’s selectivity and cannot recruit from the most prestigious universities—most of which have already eliminated their SCDE. More importantly, however, programs focusing exclusively on preparing and placing teachers in schools, without working to connect their career ladders to other occupations or leadership positions within education remain firmly cemented to teaching as a profession. TFA, however, is not solely connected to teaching. Its alumni are not just teachers but also future administrators, leaders, politicians, doctors, and lawyers. In a sense, TFA has commodified the “special” in Lortie’s special but shadowed argument—bestowing the deserved acclaim that goes to those who do the difficult work of teaching in the form of an exchangeable credential—but avoided the shadow by situating teaching as an initial rung in a more prestigious career, not necessarily the career itself.</p>
<p>A credentialism framework also highlights ramifications for TFA and its members. Depending on the extent to which TFA’s high exchange value factors into applicants’ motivations—a question that cannot be answered here—TFA’s exchange value may in some ways constrain its scope. A credential has little exchange value if most everyone has it—a point demonstrated well by the growth of the high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022487111422071">Cohen &amp; Neufeld, 1981</xref>). Yet, high–exchange value credentials are strongly desired and obtained. A credential’s success is its own downfall. Currently, TFA does not produce the number of teachers needed to devalue its credential, although TFA is the largest teaching route program in the United States. Nevertheless, if TFA were to admit all or most who apply, its exchange value would decline.</p>
<p>Possibly more importantly, this article’s analysis shows that TFA bestows a credential with significant exchange value that helps distinguish its alumni in a labor market saturated with educational degrees. However, in many ways TFA’s high exchange value may hinder its ability to retain its members as teachers. By providing TFA members with a credential that can be traded for valuable educational and occupational positions, TFA is effectively increasing the opportunity costs of those alumni who remain in the classroom. Those who continue to teach past their 2-year obligation are, due to their TFA credential, worth more on the labor market than if they had spent those same 2 years teaching as a non-TFA member. Even if a TFA member joined the program with the intention to stay in teaching for many years, TFA’s high exchange value will nonetheless create increased career and graduate school opportunities. It may become difficult to rationalize life as a teacher when a TFA credential can be exchanged for potentially more rewarding careers.</p>
<p>TFA may therefore struggle to keep its teachers in schools. This does not necessarily contradict TFA’s mission—they do not expect all of their members to remain after the 2-year commitment. Part of TFA’s mission is to inculcate its alumni with a sense of educational advocacy so that former members can work for educational reform from a variety of occupations. Yet, keeping TFA teachers in schools has proved to be especially important, as research has shown TFA members’ effectiveness to increase with more years of experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022487111422071">Boyd et al., 2006</xref>). Although research has shown that, relative to the teachers that a district might otherwise hire, new TFA members tend to either enhance or not significantly affect the achievement gains of their students; these gains are not substantial enough to fully eliminate current achievement gaps. Keeping TFA members in the classroom so that they can grow professionally and increase their effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022487111422071">Boyd et al., 2006</xref>), therefore, has important ramifications for the students that TFA serves.</p>
<p>Although the extent to which a high exchange value influences TFA alumni’s decisions to leave teaching awaits further research, it nonetheless brings attention to long-standing debates over the viability of TFA as a strategy to provide high-quality teachers to hard-to-staff schools. This article helps frame why TFA members gain certain advantages by joining the program, but the notion that these advantages accrue is not entirely novel. Much of the debate over TFA, which at times has been heated, centers on who bears the costs of these advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022487111422071">Darling-Hammond, 1994</xref>). This article shows that TFA members, unlike their traditionally prepared colleagues, are provided a valuable credential as a reward for their 2-year service. If this reward also contributes to turnover, then it does so at a cost to the students, parents, and communities that TFA serves.</p>
<p>Ultimately, a credentialism perspective helps us understand TFA’s status anomaly. TFA has reversed the low regard given to most teachers working in hard-to-staff schools. Whether the high exchange value and status of TFA will generalize to all those who become teachers in hard-to-staff schools or remain the domain of TFA members is unknown. More broadly, a credentialism framework brings to light questions that research aimed exclusively at the program’s effects on student achievement—a form of its use value—misses. A credentialism framework demonstrates that TFA has policy ramifications beyond the program’s members or the students they teach, coinciding with essential questions about the nature and status of teaching as a profession.</p>

<p>In this article, a credential is not the same as teacher certification. This is especially true for Teach for America (TFA), which does not actually confer teacher certificates. When speaking of a preparation program’s credential, I simply mean the status of being a program alumnus. Anyone completing the 2-year TFA program is considered to have a TFA credential. I use the word “credential” to maintain consistency with the article’s theoretical framework.</p>

<p>Many prestigious colleges and universities have thought their schools, colleges, or departments of education (SCDEs) to be of such poor quality that they have eliminated them. This was true at Yale, John Hopkins, Duke, and the University of Chicago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022487111422071">Labaree, 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>This point is also shared by signaling theory. Unlike human capital theory, signaling theory does not argue that education necessarily bestows technical skills. Instead, signaling theory maintains that credentials or educational attainment sort students who may already differ in productivity and skills, and students with more use value use educational credentials to inform employers of their abilities. So, although signaling theory does not require education to increase students’ use value, those students who are already more productive, and thus have more use value, tend to stay in school longer and consequently obtain more advanced credentials. Unlike credentialism, signaling theory does posit that those with more advanced credentials have more use value. (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0022487111422071">Weiss, 1995</xref>, for further discussion of signaling theory, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487111422071">Bills, 2003</xref>, for a comparison of human capital theory, signaling theory, and credentialism.)</p>
