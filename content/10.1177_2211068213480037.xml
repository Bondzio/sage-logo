<abstract>
<p>The yeast <italic>Kluyveromyces marxianus</italic> is a potential microbial catalyst for fuel ethanol production from a wide range of biomass substrates. To improve its growth and ethanol yield at elevated temperature under microaerophilic conditions, <italic>K. marxianus</italic> NRRL Y-1109 was irradiated with UV-C using automated protocols on a robotic platform for picking and spreading irradiated cultures and for processing the resulting plates. The plates were incubated under anaerobic conditions on xylose or glucose for 5 mo at 46 °C. Two <italic>K. marxianus</italic> mutant strains (designated 7-1 and 8-1) survived and were isolated from the glucose plates. Both mutant strains, but not wild type, grew aerobically on glucose at 47 °C. All strains grew anaerobically at 46 °C on glucose, galactose, galacturonic acid, and pectin; however, only 7-1 grew anaerobically on xylose at 46 °C. <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> NRRL Y-2403 did not grow at 46 °C on any of these substrates. With glucose as a carbon source, ethanol yield after 3 d at 46 °C was higher for 8-1 than for wild type (0.51 and 0.43 g ethanol/g glucose, respectively). With galacturonic acid as a carbon source, the ethanol yield after 7 d at 46 °C was higher for 7-1 than for wild type (0.48 and 0.34 g ethanol/g galacturonic acid, respectively). These mutant strains have potential application in fuel ethanol production at elevated temperature from sugar constituents of starch, sucrose, pectin, and cellulosic biomass.</p>

<p>A wide variety of biomass feedstocks will be needed to meet the increased requirements for total renewable fuel by 2015 mandated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2211068213480037">1</xref></sup> In the near future, these feedstocks will include lignocellulosic materials, such as agricultural and forestry residues, that are composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2211068213480037">2</xref></sup> Hydrolysis of these materials yields the hexose sugars (glucose, mannose, and galactose) and the pentose sugars (xylose and arabinose). Other possible biomass feedstocks are fruit- and coffee-processing wastes that contain pectin, a polymer of galacturonic acid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2211068213480037">3</xref></sup> <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is currently the most employed microbial catalyst in the biotechnology industry, but it is limited in its range of substrates for producing fuel ethanol, although genetic engineering has improved its utilization of some of the constituent sugars of lignocellulosic materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2211068213480037">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2211068213480037"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2211068213480037"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2211068213480037"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2211068213480037"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2211068213480037"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2211068213480037"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2211068213480037"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2211068213480037"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2211068213480037"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2211068213480037">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, increasing attention has been directed toward developing microbial catalysts for ethanol production at elevated temperatures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2211068213480037">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2211068213480037"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2211068213480037"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2211068213480037"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2211068213480037">18</xref></sup> Fermentation processes conducted at elevated temperatures will significantly reduce cooling costs, improve efficiency of simultaneous saccharification and fermentation, allow continuous ethanol removal by evaporation under reduced pressure, and reduce risk of contamination, all of which would improve profitability of fuel ethanol production from biomass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2211068213480037">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2211068213480037">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2211068213480037">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2211068213480037">19</xref></sup> The temperatures suitable for conventional strains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> are relatively low (25 to 30 °C), although some <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains have been isolated that are able to produce ethanol efficiently at 40 °C or 42 °C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2211068213480037">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2211068213480037"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2211068213480037">22</xref></sup> The yeast <italic>Kluyveromyces marxianus</italic> has advantages that make it a promising candidate for development as a versatile, thermotolerant, industrial ethanologen. This species has been reported to grow at 47 °C and above<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2211068213480037">23</xref></sup> and to produce ethanol at temperatures greater than 40 °C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2211068213480037">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2211068213480037">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2211068213480037">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, <italic>K. marxianus</italic> offers other benefits compared with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, including the ability to grow on a wide variety of substrates not used by <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> such as xylose, xylitol, cellobiose, lactose, arabinose, and glycerol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2211068213480037">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2211068213480037">25</xref></sup> <italic>K. marxianus</italic> also grows on sucrose, raffinose, and inulin at 45 °C under a static condition even when glucose is present, unlike <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. This suggests that <italic>K. marxianus</italic> is useful for high-temperature fermentation using biomass composed of these sugars.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2211068213480037">26</xref></sup> Because of these advantages, <italic>K. marxianus</italic> is currently being developed as a viable alternative to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> for ethanol production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2211068213480037">25</xref></sup> Some <italic>K. marxianus</italic> strains have generally-recognized-as-safe status,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2211068213480037">16</xref></sup> similar to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>K. lactis</italic>; therefore, these strains are also acceptable for expression of high-value co-products for human or animal use in addition to producing fuel ethanol.</p>
<p>We describe two novel <italic>K. marxianus</italic> strains that were obtained by UV-C irradiation of wild-type <italic>K. marxianus</italic> NRRL Y-1109 cultures, followed by 5-mo anaerobic growth on glucose at 46 °C. UV-C irradiation is a standard technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2211068213480037">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2211068213480037"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2211068213480037">29</xref></sup> for inducing mutations in yeast. It produces large numbers of random mutations broadly and uniformly over the whole genome to generate unique strains. Automated protocols were developed and implemented on a robotic platform for picking and spreading the irradiated cultures and for rapid sterile processing of the plates. The mutant strains were assessed for growth and ethanol production at elevated temperature and for carbon source utilization under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The irradiation method is similar to that previously used by Hughes and coworkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2211068213480037">27</xref></sup> for producing mutagenized <italic>Scheffersomyces stipitis</italic> strains. However, the work described in this article extends the technique by increasing the radiation exposure time with the intention of maximizing the occurrence of mutations and by incubating the irradiated cells at an elevated temperature to produce strains with improved thermotolerance and enhanced ability to produce ethanol under microaerophilic conditions from a wide variety of substrates. These strains have potential application in industrial fuel ethanol production at elevated temperatures from sugar constituents of starch, sucrose, pectin, and cellulosic biomass.</p>

<title>Production of <italic>K. marxianus</italic> Mutant Strains 7-1 and 8-1 by Irradiation of <italic>K. marxianus</italic> NRRL Y-1109 and Evaluation of Growth</title>
<p>Duplicate 2 L Fernbach flasks were prepared by adding 1 L of YM medium (0.3% yeast extract, 0.3% malt extract, 0.5% peptone [Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ], and 1.0% dextrose [Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO]) to each flask and inoculating with 20 mL of a culture of wild-type <italic>K. marxianus</italic> NRRL Y-1109 (USDA, ARS Culture Collection) grown on YM medium in a 100 mL flask at 28 °C for 2 d. The Fernbach flasks were incubated at 28 °C for 2 d at 100 rpm. The culture from each flask was divided into two Beckman 500 mL spin bottles and pelleted in a Beckman Avanti J20 centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) at 20 °C for 20 min at 2056 × g. Cell pellets were washed and resuspended in 50 mL of sterile water. A 25 mL aliquot was taken from each resuspension and placed into a Marsh RR-0014 deep-trough plate with baffled bottom (Marsh Biomedical Products, Inc., Rochester, NY). Before irradiation, a 10 µL sample was taken from the resuspension in the trough plates, diluted to 10<sup>−5</sup>, and evaluated using a Reichert Neubauer/Bright-Line hemacytometer (American Optical Corp., Buffalo, NY) to obtain an estimate of cell density. The cells were irradiated for 9 h with 234 nm UV-C radiation (UVP, LLC Light Table [inverted], Upland, CA) at a distance of 14 cm above the plates. Samples (100 µL) were taken every hour during irradiation, diluted to 10<sup>−4</sup>, and plated, and the surviving colonies were counted to determine the kill curve.</p>
<p>An automated protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2211068213480037"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>) on a robotic work cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2211068213480037">30</xref></sup> was used after irradiation to spread 600 µL aliquots from each trough plate onto 128 × 96 mm Omni Tray plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) containing YM medium (0.3% yeast extract, 0.3% malt extract, 0.5% peptone, 2% Bacto Agar [Becton, Dickinson and Company], and 1.0% dextrose) or 2% xylose complete minimal medium plus all amino acids (1.4 g yeast synthetic dropout medium supplement, 0.06 g L-leucine, 0.04 g L-tryptophan, 0.02 g L-histidine, 0.02 g L-uracil; 20 g D-xylose [Sigma Aldrich], 20 g Bacto Agar; and 6.7 g yeast nitrogen base without amino acids [Sigma Aldrich] per liter). The plates from several passive and active stackers were moved to the liquid handler in a scheduled fashion, where they were spotted with medium and then with irradiated culture from the Marsh deep-trough plates on the deck. The spread plates (a total of 192 plates, 96 from each trough plate) were wrapped and placed into Mitsubishi anaerobic chambers (Mitsubishi Gas Chemical America, Inc., New York, NY) containing an AnaeroPack dry chemical system (Sigma Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) at 46 °C for 5 mo. This lengthy incubation period at elevated temperature under stringently anaerobic conditions was chosen not only to ensure that surviving strains would grow well in these conditions but also to minimize background growth of strains that were less robust.</p>

<p>Two YM plates, 7 and 8, each contained one growing colony when the spread plates were unwrapped. Duplicate samples were picked manually from these colonies, designated strains 7-1 and 8-1, respectively, and spread onto plates containing YM or YPD (1.0% yeast extract, 2.0% Bacto Peptone, 2.0% Bacto Agar, and 2.0% D-glucose [Sigma Aldrich]) medium or 2% xylose complete minimal medium plus all amino acids, and the plates were incubated at 46 °C for 2 wk anaerobically to isolate individual colonies. Four colonies were picked manually from each of the respread anaerobic plates onto plates containing YM, YPD, or xylose complete minimal medium plus all amino acids (one sample per plate, four samples per medium) and incubated aerobically at 28 °C for 3 d to confirm that strains 7-1 and 8-1 were still capable of aerobic growth.</p>
<p>Samples were also taken and plated on YPD medium for evaluation of growth at 30 °C and 47 °C to compare thermotolerance of mutant strains to that of wild-type <italic>K. marxianus</italic> NRRL Y-1109. The mutant strains were further evaluated for growth on various substrates aerobically and anaerobically at 46 °C in comparison to wild-type <italic>K. marxianus</italic> NRRL Y-1109 and to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> NRRL Y-2043. The cultures of wild-type <italic>K. marxianus</italic> used to inoculate the media containing the various substrates were not the cells from the primary screen but were taken from the ARS NRRL collection, as were the cultures of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Mutant strains 7-1 and 8-1 were passaged 10 times in YM medium before inoculation. All four strains were grown at 30 °C to an OD 600 of 0.1 before inoculation. Polymeric substrates—cellulose, pectin, starch, and guar—were untreated and used as received from the supplier (Sigma Aldrich).</p>

The density of the preculture was adjusted to an absorbance equivalent to 1.0 at 660 nm (Beckman DU 800; Beckman Coulter, Inc.), and 20 mL was added to 1 L of YM medium in the Fernbach flask. The fermentation was carried out at 46 °C at 100 rpm for 30 h. The absorbance at 660 nm and ethanol production were measured at approximately 10 h intervals.</p>

The tubes were removed from the dryer, 70 µL of water was added, and the tubes were allowed to stand for 10 min. The concentration of genomic DNA obtained was determined by densitometry using an AlphaImager 3400 (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Diego, CA).</p>
<p>The PCR mixture contained 2 µL genomic DNA (0.5 mg/mL), 32.5 µL water, 10 µL 5X Phusion HF Buffer with MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 µL 10 mM dNTPs, 4 µL (0.1 mg/mL) VNTR oligonucleotide primer (5′CAGCAGCAGCAGCAG3′), and 0.5 µL Phusion Enzyme (Finnzymes Phusion High-Fidelity PCR kit; New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The PCR reaction was prepared in a Phenix MPC-3420 96-well PCR plate (Phenix Research Products, Candler, NC) on ice and was carried out in a PTC-225 Tetrad Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) using the following conditions: hold at 95 °C for 5 min, cycle at 95 °C for 1 min, 42 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, repeated for 30 times, followed by 72 °C for 5 min and a 4 °C hold. The procedure amplified the genomic sequence between two VNTR sequences to determine alterations in the microsatellite or minisatellite regions in the genome.

Tetramethyl benzidine substrate was added, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min protected from the light. Stop solution was added to each well, and the plates were evaluated within 5 min in a Bio-Rad Ultramark Microplate Absorbance Reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.) at 450 nm. A reading at 570 nm was subtracted from the reading at 450 nm. This subtraction will correct for optical imperfections in the microplates. If the microplate reader has wavelength correction available, it should be set at 540 or 570 nm. Readings made directly at 450 nm without correction may be higher and less accurate.</p>

<title>Number of Cells Irradiated and Robotic Selection</title>
<p>Approximately 20% of the genome of <italic>K. marxianus</italic> has been sequenced, and about 1300 novel genes encoding proteins were identified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2211068213480037">33</xref></sup> Based on this information and on the results from sequencing of the <italic>K. lactis</italic> genome regarding the number of genes (about 5331) and the average length of a gene transcript (approximately 1800),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2211068213480037">34</xref></sup> it can be roughly estimated that tens of millions of cells would need to be irradiated to maximize mutation of the <italic>K. marxianus</italic> genome. The culture samples of wild-type <italic>K. marxianus</italic> NRRL Y-1109 taken prior to irradiation contained more than 100 million cells.</p>

Up to 270 plates can be stacked on the work cell for continuous processing, and the stacks can be readily refilled as needed. The SoftLink software moved the plates from several passive and active stackers to the liquid handler in a scheduled fashion, where they were spotted with medium and then with irradiated culture from the Marsh deep-trough plates on the deck. The plates with the irradiated samples were then selected for anaerobic growth at elevated temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2211068213480037"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>, step 2).</p>

<title>Growth Characteristics of Mutant Strains Selected for Anaerobic Growth at Elevated Temperature (Isolates 7-1 and 8-1)</title>
<p><italic>K. marxianus</italic> NRRL Y-1109 wild-type strain was subjected to 234 nm UV-C irradiation to achieve a target mortality of about 80%, which was expected to eliminate any background growth. The progress of the irradiation was monitored by taking samples every hour during irradiation, diluting and plating them, and counting the surviving colonies to determine the kill curve. The results show that 80% mortality is obtained after 9 h of irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2211068213480037"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>). After the wild-type strain was irradiated for 9 h, followed by incubation on YM or xylose medium for 5 mo at 46 °C in an anaerobic chamber, only two YM medium plates contained growing colonies when the spread plates were unwrapped. Samples from these surviving colonies were spread onto plates containing YM medium and incubated at 46 °C for 2 wk anaerobically to isolate individual colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2211068213480037"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>, step 2). Samples of these colonies were then spread on YM, YPD, and xylose plates and incubated aerobically at 28 °C for 3 d.

The SEMs of the wild-type <italic>K. marxianus</italic> NRRL Y-1109 and mutant strains grown on glucose show that the cells were generally similar in size, shape, and surface features. On the other hand, the micrographs of cells from these strains grown on xylose show that the cells of mutant strain 7-1 are larger than those of the wild-type strain and that more of the 7-1 cells have cratered surfaces compared with the wild-type cells. The cells of mutant strain 8-1 grown on xylose are smaller than those of mutant strain 7-1; however, the surfaces are not only cratered but also wrinkled, and the shapes of the cells are flattened and distorted compared with the shapes of wild type and 7-1 cells. The micrographs of cells from strains grown on galacturonic acid show that most of the cells of the wild-type strain have a relatively smooth, noncratered surface and are urn shaped with budlike projections at the tops. In contrast, the cells of mutant strains 7-1 and 8-1 are larger and their surfaces are more cratered than those of the wild-type strain.

<p>The results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2211068213480037"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref> show that with glucose as the carbon source, the ethanol yield after 3 d at 46 °C was 19% higher for mutant strain 8-1 than for wild-type <italic>K. marxianus</italic> NRRL Y-1109 (0.51 and 0.43 g ethanol/g glucose, respectively). Cell growth of mutant strain 8-1 on glucose as measured by OD 660 was 2.7 times greater than that of the wild-type strain. The cell growth and ethanol yield on glucose were the same for mutant strain 7-1 and wild type. With galacturonic acid as the carbon source, the ethanol yield after 7 d at 46 °C was 41% higher for mutant strain 7-1 than for wild-type <italic>K. marxianus</italic> NRRL Y-1109 (0.48 and 0.34 g ethanol/g galacturonic acid, respectively). Cell growth of mutant strain 7-1 on galacturonic acid as measured by OD 660 was 1.3 times greater than that of wild-type strain. The cell growth and ethanol yield on galacturonic acid were the similar for mutant strain 8-1 and wild type.</p>

<title>Patterns of Cell Growth and Ethanol Production at 46 °C for Wild-Type <italic>K. marxianus</italic> NRRL Y-1109 and Mutant Strains 7-1 and 8-1</title>
<p>The pattern of cell growth for mutant strain 8-1 was similar to that of wild-type <italic>K. marxianus</italic> NRRL Y-1109 with cell density rising from initial OD 600 values about 0.16 rising to a maximum of 1.57 at 15 h. However, the growth of mutant strain 7-1 (initial OD 660 of 0.12) showed a delayed entry into log phase, with the OD 660 value remaining at 0.18 until 5 h, then rising to 1.22 at 15 h, showing a growth rate (based on slope) similar to that of wild type and 8-1. Mutant strain 7-1 initiated ethanol production at 5 h, the same time as mutant strain 8-1 and wild-type strain, and similar ethanol production levels were observed for all strains at the end of the experiment (30 h). At that point, ethanol production was decreasing for wild-type and 8-1 strains but appeared to be increasing for strain 7-1. This suggests that mutant strain 7-1 might be better adapted to ethanol production under extended microaerophilic conditions than mutant strain 8-1 or wild-type strain.</p>

<sec id="section21-2211068213480037">
<title>SEM and VNTR Analysis for Wild-Type <italic>K. marxianus</italic> NRRL Y-1109 and Mutant Strains 7-1 and 8-1 Strains</title>
<p>The SEM results indicated that the two <italic>K. marxianus</italic> strains that were selected for growth at elevated temperature under anaerobic conditions are unique strains because their morphologic features differ from each other and from those of the wild-type <italic>K. marxianus</italic> strain when grown on xylose or galacturonic acid. Most notably, the micrographs of cells from strains grown on galacturonic acid show that most cells of the wild-type strain have relatively smooth, noncratered surfaces and are urn shaped with budlike projections at the tops, whereas the cells of mutant strains 7-1 and 8-1 are larger and their surfaces have more indentations. The shapes of most of the cells of strain 8-1 grown on galacturonic acid are round with dimples in striking contrast to the urn-shaped cells with budlike projections at the tops observed in the micrograph for the wild-type strain.</p>
<p>The differences observed in the PCR products amplified from the genomic DNA of <italic>K. marxianus</italic> NRRL Y-1109 wild-type strain and mutant strains 7-1 and 8-1 using the VNTR sequence as PCR primer demonstrate that the mutant strains are different from each other and from the wild-type strain. These differences in the PCR products can be used to distinguish differences in the genome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2211068213480037">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2211068213480037">36</xref></sup> VNTR analysis of wild-type and mutant strains 7-1 and 8-1 indicated mutations had occurred in the wild-type strain to produce strains 7-1 and 8-1. The exact nature of these mutations will need to be investigated by comparative DNA sequencing.</p>

<title>Growth of Mutant Strains 7-1 and 8-1 on Substrates of Potential Use for Renewable Fuels</title>
<p>The mutant strains 7-1 and 8-1 grew on substrates that are constituents of the sugar, starch, or biomass materials commonly considered as feedstocks for renewable fuels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2211068213480037">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2211068213480037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2211068213480037">38</xref></sup> The sources may be sugar cane, corn starch, sugar beet pulp, fruit waste, dedicated plants, plant waste, forestry by-products, or urban waste.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2211068213480037">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2211068213480037">40</xref></sup> As expected, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> NRRL Y-2043 did not grow at 46 °C. None of the strains tested grew on untreated cellulose or starch. Interestingly, although no colonies were isolated from xylose medium after irradiation, one strain selected for elevated temperature and anaerobic growth that initially survived on glucose medium showed anaerobic growth on xylose substrate at 46 °C. The mutant strain that grew on xylose did not grow as well on the pentose substrate as on the hexose substrates.</p>
<p>Guar is a plant gum of considerable commercial interest. It consists of a main chain of β-1,4-linked D-mannopyranose units, with D-galactopyranose units linked α-1,6 to the mannose backbone. It is commonly used as a thickener in foods and as a thickener and suspending agent in oilfield applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2211068213480037">41</xref></sup> Therefore, enzymatic modification and biodegradation of guar are of potential interest. To use guar as a carbon source, an organism would most likely need to produce at least an α-galactosidase and quite likely also an endo-β-D-mannanase and a β-mannosidase, although these enzymes have not been reported for <italic>K. marxianus.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2211068213480037">16</xref></sup> It is expected that some of these enzymes would need to be secreted into the growth medium because of the macromolecular nature of the guar polymer. Growth of the <italic>K. marxianus</italic> strains on guar indicates that galactose and mannose are being used by these strains aerobically and by mutant strain 7-1 also anaerobically.</p>
<p>The results of the tube assay confirm that mutant strain 7-1 has the ability to depolymerize pectin and to use the resulting mono-, di-, and tri-galacturonic acids to the same extent as the individual acids tested separately, reflecting endopolygalacturonase activity typically produced by <italic>K. marxianus</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2211068213480037">3</xref></sup> Endopolygalacturonases are an industrially important subgroup of pectinases because they promote a rapid decrease in the molecular weight of pectin and hence in the viscosity of pectin-containing solutions. Currently, commercial preparations are a mixture of pectic enzymes that includes some enzymes with undesirable activities. <italic>K. marxianus</italic> is being evaluated as a source because it produces almost exclusively endopolygalacturonase. It has been shown that during alcoholic fermentation by <italic>K. marxianus</italic> CCEBI 2011, endopolygalacturonase accumulates together with ethanol,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2211068213480037">3</xref></sup> which contributes favorably to the economy of the bioprocess.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2211068213480037">3</xref></sup> The dark color of the colonies on the pectin plates and especially on the galacturonic acid plates indicates the production of an unknown pigment. The identity of the pigmented material is under investigation.</p>

<title>Cell Growth, Substrate Use, Ethanol Yield, and Melanin and 2,3-Butanediol Production by Mutant Strains 7-1 and 8-1 Compared with Wild-Type <italic>K. marxianus</italic> NRRL Y-1109 with Glucose or Galacturonic Acid Medium in Braun Fermentor at 46 °C</title>
<p>Using glucose as substrate, strain 8-1 gave a higher ethanol yield after 3 d at 46 °C than wild type or 7.1 (0.51, 0.43, and 0.45 g ethanol/g glucose, respectively). Using galacturonic acid as substrate, strain 7-1 gave a higher ethanol yield after 7 d at 46 °C than wild type or 8-1 (0.48, 0.34, and 0.35 g ethanol/g galacturonic acid, respectively).</p>
<p>Rodrussamee and coworkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2211068213480037">25</xref></sup> obtained an ethanol yield of 0.48 g ethanol/g glucose after 12 h for <italic>K. marxianus</italic> DMKU3-1042 on YPD medium at 45 °C under a shaking condition, compared with 0.43 g ethanol/g glucose for wild-type <italic>K. marxianus</italic> NRRL Y-1109 at 46 °C after 72 h in our work. Pang and coworkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2211068213480037">29</xref></sup> used UV irradiation and N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine to mutate <italic>K. marxianus</italic> GX-15. They obtained a yield of 0.46 g ethanol/g glucose for the best mutant strain, <italic>K. marxianus</italic> GX-UN120, and this strain completely consumed all glucose at 60 h. In our work, the mutant strains 7-1 and 8-1 completely consumed all the glucose after 72 h and all the galacturonic acid after 168 h in comparison with the wild-type strain, which consumed 92% of the glucose and 96% of the galacturonic acid.</p>
<p>On galacturonic acid, the production of 2,3-butanediol was inversely correlated with ethanol production. Mutant strain 7-1 on galacturonic acid had the highest ethanol level and the lowest 2,3-butanediol level, whereas wild type and 8-1 had lower ethanol levels but higher 2,3-butanediol levels. No correlation was observed for the strains on glucose substrate. Although melanin was not found to be a major product, melanin levels for strains 7-1 and 8-1 were higher on galacturonic acid than on glucose and also higher than wild-type <italic>K. marxianus</italic> NRRL Y-1109 on both substrates.</p>
<p>The robust thermotolerant <italic>K. marxianus</italic> mutant strains resulting from the intense multigene mutagenesis strategy used in this work appear to have traits that have potential application in industrial fuel ethanol production at elevated temperature from biomass hydrolysates and fruit and coffee-processing wastes. Growth and high levels of ethanol production at elevated temperature provide an advantage over <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in industrial fermentations. These mutant strains have an additional advantage in their ability to produce ethanol from a wide variety of substrates, including constituents of starch and sucrose as well as biomass feedstocks such as wet mill corn pericarp waste or fruit- and coffee-processing wastes.</p>
