<abstract>
<p>Alcohol has a variety of effects on the human body, affecting both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. We examined the peripheral blood flow of alcohol drinkers using a micro-integrated laser Doppler blood flow meter (micro-electromechanical system blood flow sensor). An increased heart rate and blood flow was recorded at the earlobe after alcohol ingestion, and we observed strong correlation between blood flow, heart rate, and breath alcohol content in light drinkers; but not heavy drinkers. We also found that the amplitude of pulse waves measured at the fingertip during an arm-raising test significantly decreased on alcohol consumption, regardless of the individual’s alcohol tolerance. Our micro-electromechanical system blood flow sensor successfully detected various physiological changes in peripheral blood circulation induced by alcohol consumption.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Alcohol ingestion affects the cardiovascular system through the physiological effects of ethanol and acetaldehyde, an intermediate alcohol metabolite, as exhibited by increased heart rate and systemically vasodilatation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912452974">1</xref></sup> There is a considerable population of so-called light drinkers who have less active aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which is responsible for the metabolism of acetaldehyde into acetic acid, especially in Asian countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912452974">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912452974">3</xref></sup> When such light drinkers ingest alcohol, their faces immediately become flushed owing to increased vasodilatation, leading to a substantial increase in peripheral blood flow. It is expected that we can monitor alcohol consumption from alteration of peripheral blood flow. There have been several studies measuring such alterations in peripheral blood flow arising from alcohol consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912452974">4</xref></sup> where increased peripheral blood flow was observed after alcohol ingestion. However, no comparison between blood flow changes of the peripheral blood flow to blood alcohol content has been made in these studies, and there were no particular studies focusing on potentially differential effects between light drinkers and heavy drinkers by alcohol ingestion.</p>
<p>There are various methods for measuring peripheral blood flow, and a laser Doppler flow meter is favored owing to its non-invasive nature. We have previously developed a micro-integrated laser Doppler blood flow-meter (micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) blood flow sensor), the volume of which is one-three hundredth of that of a conventional laser Doppler blood flow meter. The weight of the sensor is about one-thirtieth and the power consumption is only one-twentieth of a conventional instrument.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912452974">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912452974">6</xref></sup> This MEMS blood flow sensor is very compact and can measure static blood flow, even while the subject is moving, owing to its compact wireless transmission system, which eliminates the noise caused by vibration and movement that would otherwise occur in a system utilizing fiber-optics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912452974">7</xref></sup> In the present study, we used our MEMS blood flow sensor to monitor various cardiovascular changes in the peripheries of alcohol drinkers, including heart rate (HR) and peripheral blood flow at the earlobe and fingertip. We compared these data with the breath alcohol content (BAC) values of light and heavy drinkers.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>The research was complied with ethical standards of the responsible committee of the Kyushu University on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1964; as revised in 2008. A total of 31 healthy volunteers (29 males, 2 females, mean age 22.5 years old, range 21–28) participated in this study. It is known that effects of alcohol ingestion are affected by many conditions, such as gender and weight of the drinker. However, in the present study, to simplify the experiment model in a more practical setting, we divided participants into two groups of light drinkers and heavy drinkers, defined by means of only an ethanol patch test, which is a quick and simple test to determine the subject’s tolerance to alcohol as their physical nature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912452974">8</xref></sup> Subjects were fully informed of the experimental details and any potential risks before their participation in the study. Subjects were requested not to ingest any alcohol for at least 9 h prior to the experiment, to avoid any unexpected effects from residual alcohol.</p>

<sec id="section4-0954411912452974">
<title>MEMS blood flow sensor</title>
<p>We used a MEMS blood flow sensor, which has been described in a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912452974">6</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912452974">Figure 1(a)</xref>). The MEMS blood flow sensor can measure peripheral blood flow non-invasively under the principle of the Doppler phenomenon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912452974">9</xref></sup> The MEMS blood flow sensor consists of a probe and the main sensor body. The probe is made up of an optical MEMS chip and first step operational amplifiers, while the main sensor body is composed of a digital signal processor (DSP), a display, a battery, and a Bluetooth wireless link. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912452974">Figure 1(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912452974">(c)</xref> shows schematics of the optical MEMS chip. The optical MEMS chip consists of two silicon plates. One plate has two cavities and the other has a silicon microlens. A distributed feedback laser diode (DFB-LD) chip and photodiode (PD) chip are respectively bonded in each cavity. The wavelength of the DFB-LD is 1310 nm, which can easily penetrate human skin. The PD is an InGaAs type PD. These chips are connected by wire bonding and through-silicon vias (TSV). The cavities are sealed with an upper silicon plate. This structure enables a wafer-level package. The laser beam, irradiated from the DFB-LD, is vertically reflected on an etched mirror formed by depositing gold onto the silicon &lt;111&gt; facet. Then, the beam is focused by the silicon microlens and irradiated onto the subject’s skin. The backscattered light from the subject’s skin passes through the window. The PD detects this backscattered light, and the microlens decreases its coupling loss. The MEMS blood flow sensor can non-invasively measure blood flow while the subject is moving because it does not use optical fiber.</p>

<p>Blood flow waves obtained by the sensor consist of three main components: basic waves, cardiac waves, and reflex waves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912452974">10</xref></sup> The basic waves have about 10 s-periods, and some researchers have reported that these large oscillations are modulated by the sympathetic nerve system or by the sympathetic vasomotor tone,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912452974">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912452974">12</xref></sup> while the cardiac waves are much smaller and simply reflect the subject’s HR. The reflex wave is a phenomenon in which peripheral blood flow temporarily decreases greatly when the subject takes a deep breath or is engaging in physical activity, for example. It should also be noted that the reflex waves only appeared at the palmoplanter areas.</p>

<title>Metabolism of alcohol</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912452974">Figure 2</xref> shows the metabolic pathway of alcohol. First, ingested ethanol is mostly absorbed and introduced into the blood circulation via the stomach and small intestine. Next, some of the ethanol is sent to the liver and primarily metabolized into acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912452974">13</xref></sup> microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912452974">14</xref></sup> and catalase. The acetaldehyde is then metabolized into acetic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). The remaining, non-metabolized, ethanol enters the systems circulation. After this, it enters a second round of systemic circulation to be metabolized again. Some of the ethanol that is not metabolized in such repeats of circulation is also directly excreted into the urine, sweat, or breath. The acetic acid generated in the liver is metabolized into water and carbon dioxide during systemic circulation, and is eventually egested. Light drinkers, whose ALDH activity is less than that of heavy drinkers, consists of about 40%–50% of the Japanese and Chinese population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912452974">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Blood flow in a steady state after alcohol ingestion</title>
<p>The probe of the MEMS blood flow sensor was attached to the earlobe, and the subjects were required to drink 500 ml of beer with 5% alcohol. The peripheral blood flow at the earlobe (BFE) and BAC were measured before and 10, 30, and 60 min after beer drinking. If necessary, the measurements were further continued every 15 min until the BAC became 0 mg/L, which was defined as “the end point” in the alcohol drinking test. BAC was measured using a semiconductor-type breath alcohol sensor (AC-008, Toyo Mark Manufacturing Co. Ltd, Osaka, Japan) and recorded as the evaluation index of alcohol intoxication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0954411912452974">
<title>Arm-raising test</title>
<p>The arm-raising test can detect a characteristic response in blood flow at the fingertip.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912452974">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411912452974">16</xref></sup> During this test, the subject first holds their right arm at their heart height in a sitting position. The subject then raises their right arm to the vertical position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912452974">Figure 3(a)</xref>). When the arm is raised vertically, blood flow at the fingertip drops rapidly then recovers gradually (reflex waves) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912452974">Figure 3(b)</xref>). However, the blood flow does not recover completely owing to a large decrease in hydrostatic pressure at the fingertip. This large decrease in hydrostatic pressure, combined with less blood flow at the fingertip, causes higher amplitude pulse waves (APW), by offering a flexibility of blood vessel walls. We examined the APW in the arm-raising test and assessed the relationship between APW and alcohol drinking.</p>

<title>Alcohol ingestion-induced increased heart rate and blood flow in a steady state</title>
<p>A total of 30 healthy subjects (28 males, 2 females, mean age 22.5 years old, range 21–27), of which 14 subjects (14 males, mean age 22.9 years old, range 21–27) were defined as light drinkers and the remaining 16 subjects (14 males, 2 females, mean age 22.2 years old, range 21–24) were defined as heavy drinkers, ingested 500 ml of beer. A control group consisting of: 4 light drinkers (4 males, mean age 21.8 years old, range 21–23) ingested the same amount of a non-alcoholic beer in a blinded manner; 7 mixed subjects (7 males, mean age 23.1 years old, range 21–28); and 6 mixed subjects (6 males, mean age 22.3 years old, range 21–25) ingested the same amount of a warm (37 °C) or cold (4 °C) sports drink product, respectively. The sports drink product contains 245 mg of sodium, 100 mg of potassium, 10 mg of calcium, and 3 mg of magnesium in 500 ml. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912452974">Figure 4(a)</xref> describes a typical example of BFE of a light drinker before (lower line) and at 60 min after (upper line) alcohol ingestion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912452974">Figure 4(b)</xref> describes the crossover graph of these two blood flow waves after fast Fourier transformation (FFT). An individual’s blood flow after drinking is much higher compared with before drinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912452974">Figure 4(a)</xref>). Additionally, the HR rose from around 60 b/min to 90 b/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912452974">Figure 4(b)</xref>).The BFE was the mean value of the data in a stable range of waves with a data length of 2048 points (= 40.96 s). The HR was determined by the peak frequency of its spectrum distribution; typically determined within a value of around 40–180 b/min. The mean change rate of BFE and HR, and the mean BAC after beer drinking are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912452974">Figure 4(c)</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912452974">(e)</xref>, respectively, and the statistical details of these results are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912452974">Table 1</xref>.

<title>Smaller amplitude of pulse waves after drinking regardless of alcohol tolerance</title>
<p>In the arm-raising test, 21 healthy subjects (20 males, 1 female, mean age 22.4 years old, range 21–27), of which 10 subjects (10 males, mean age 22.8 years old, range 21–27) were defined as light drinkers and the remaining 11 subjects (10 males, mean age 22.1 years old, range 21–23) were defined as heavy drinkers, ingested beer. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912452974">Figure 5(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912452974">(b)</xref> shows typical examples of blood flow signal at the fingertip, in the arm-raising test, before and at 30 min after drinking, of a light drinker and a heavy drinker, respectively.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We investigated the response of peripheral blood circulation to alcohol ingestion using the MEMS blood flow sensor. We found that the sensor could detect the considerable cardiovascular changes in the peripheries of light drinkers; and that the sensor was even more effective in assessing the effects of alcohol ingestion, regardless of the subject’s alcohol tolerance, when combined with the arm-raising test.</p>
<p>In a steady state, we measured BFE, HR, and BAC, and investigated their mutual relationship using multiple linear regression analysis. The BFE and HR of light drinkers were much higher than that of heavy drinkers or of other controls, and strong correlation between the BFE, HR, and BAC was observed in light drinkers. This suggests that BFE and HR are good indicators of alcohol ingestion in light drinkers. However, those values were not correlated with BAC and, therefore, not so useful in heavy drinkers.</p>
<p>To further explore more reliable indicators, we examined APW, BFF, and BFAR using the arm-raising test. APW significantly decreased at 10 and 30 min after alcohol ingestion in both light drinkers and heavy drinkers. This is an interesting result, since BAC at 10 and 30 min exceeded 0.15 mg/l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912452974">Figure 5(f)</xref>), and drivers with BAC &gt; 0.15 mg/l are, in Japanese road traffic laws for instance, classified as being drunk. These results suggest that the APW may be a more reliable indicator of a subject’s alcohol ingestion, independent of their alcohol tolerance. Alcohol ingestion relaxes blood vessels through the effects of acetaldehyde,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912452974">17</xref></sup> which may lower vasoconstriction of blood vessel and, therefore, induce lower APW. A potential problem with using APW as an indicator of alcohol ingestion would be that the value for each individual in a sober condition would have to be measured and recorded to use as a comparison to their levels while in an inebriated state.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we investigated the physiological responses of the skin to alcohol ingestion using a MEMS blood flow sensor. We demonstrated that BFE and HR increased largely after alcohol ingestion in a steady-state measurement in light drinkers. In addition, we found that the APW in an arm-raising test significantly decreased after alcohol ingestion, regardless of subject’s alcohol tolerance. These results suggest that the MEMS blood flow sensor has the potential to be utilized as a new portable device for detecting alcohol consumption.</p>
