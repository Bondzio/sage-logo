<abstract>
<p>Improving housing performance in ecological terms is a major objective of sustainable development policies. This paper looks at the perception that households have of their environment in their homes, in terms of diagnosis, damages and control. Based on a survey of 107 households, it shows that their environmental concerns only partly reflect current ecological and health risks and that people are finding it difficult to reduce these risks. In order to increase environmental awareness at the level of their homes, the authors highlight the importance of providing support on an individual basis and suggest several courses of action, which should be adapted to the four levels of awareness that were identified by the study.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11429474" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Household consumption within the home is expressed in terms of input fluxes of matter and energy (energy, water, materials) and output fluxes (wastewater, heat, refuse, polluting emissions into the indoor air, acoustic and electromagnetic waves). On an individual level, these fluxes play an important role in terms of health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11429474">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11429474">2</xref>], and also have economic and psychosocial dimensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11429474">3</xref>]. On a local, regional or global scale, they exert pressure on natural resources and ecosystems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11429474">4</xref>]. Reducing them constitutes a major objective of sustainable development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11429474">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Many political and industrial actions are working along these lines. Local and national governments use different instruments to encourage and guide citizens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11429474">6</xref>]: applying financial incentives to facilitate access to the most efficient technologies (e.g. tax benefits for ecological construction or renovation), strengthening regulations aimed at producers and distributors of goods and services (e.g. environmental labelling), organising awareness and information campaigns on reducing fluxes (e.g. reducing waste), training individuals (e.g. educating about the environment and sustainable development) and professionals who interact directly with households (e.g. social workers, etc.). Manufacturers are now offering goods and services that are more and more efficient (e.g. eco-design), “intelligent” (e.g. domotics) and “transparent” (e.g. information about the environmental quality of products).</p>
<p>While these measures may produce some environmental improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11429474">7</xref>], they seem to be insufficient to reverse consumption and flux emission trends at domestic level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11429474">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11429474">9</xref>]. Several reasons are usually put forward to explain the limited influence of this set of measures: changes in households’ behaviour can be limited by their economic or structural context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11429474">10</xref>], the increase in the number of household appliances can counterbalance the ecological gains achieved through product eco-efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11429474">11</xref>], any actions that households put in place in one area can be offset by unexpected pollution transfers, called rebound effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11429474">12</xref>]<italic>.</italic></p>
<p>It is widely recognised that policies that aim to involve citizens in protecting the environment must take account of their perception of this environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11429474">13</xref>]. A clear understanding is needed of whether people are aware of the risks they are running and if they find them acceptable. The extent to which the social perception of risks is taken into account in the decision-making process varies considerably: this practice is firmly established for nuclear energy, and the trend is increasing in relation to areas like local air pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11429474">14</xref>] or climate change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11429474">15</xref>]. At the scale of the environment in the home, however, it must be acknowledged that the measures in area rarely are taken into consideration, namely, the perceptions of the occupants. There have already been various studies in this field, covering indoor air quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11429474">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1420326X11429474">18</xref>] and, to a lesser extent, drinking water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X11429474">19</xref>], EMR emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X11429474">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1420326X11429474">21</xref>] and energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X11429474">22</xref>]. These studies reveal that there is frequently a discrepancy between the level of exposure to a flux and the level of awareness or recognition of this flux. Different authors have suggested that these variations can be detrimental to the effectiveness of public and industrial policies for sustainable housing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X11429474">23</xref>].</p>
<p>When studying the perception of risks associated with the home environment, the same analysis framework is used as for the perception of environmental risks in general. Three areas of observation deserve particular attention: perception of the level of exposure to a flux or an environmental disturbance, perception of potential impacts in terms of quality of life (health, economic and social costs), perception of control over reducing fluxes and/or potential impacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11429474">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X11429474">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1420326X11429474">26</xref>]. These areas of observation are labelled diagnosis, damages and control and are discussed below.</p>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X11429474"><title>Diagnosis</title>
<p>This involves people’s ability to obtain qualitative and quantitative data on the state of the environment in their homes. This diagnosis may be based on information or on self-assessment, that is, the person’s own assessment of the state of their indoor environment. At the level of the home, information on the environment only has meaning for the occupant if it is personalised: general information (e.g. average household water consumption) is not helpful in enabling households to assess their own situation. At present, there are only a few actors who are able to provide households with personalised information (water or energy providers), the main difficulty with this kind of individual information provision being that procedures can be fairly unwieldy (e.g. pay-by-weight system for household refuse) and are often intrusive. Given this situation, clearly at the level of the home more than at any other environmental level, self-assessment should be heavily relied on for carrying out a diagnosis. While this type of information is readily available for water and energy, as households can look at their meters or their bills from the various operators, for other fluxes, measuring tools are too restrictive (e.g. using scales to weigh waste), too costly (e.g. passive diffusion tubes to measure indoor air quality) or again they may be too technical (choice of sampling strategy inside the house, analysis and interpretation of results) for most people to use. Given these limitations, there would seem to be a considerable risk that households might find it difficult to assess the state of the environment in their homes.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1420326X11429474"><title>Damages</title>
<p>This refers to people’s perception of health, socio-economic and ecological issues associated with the environment in their homes. Risk analysis shows that this perception can be linked with information and experience. Information may come from various sources: institutions, scientists or the mass media. Several authors have stressed the role of trust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1420326X11429474">27</xref>] and the consensual nature of information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1420326X11429474">28</xref>] in the social perception of risks that are environmental in origin. At present, information on the home environment, like that available in relation to drinking water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X11429474">19</xref>], is surrounded by uncertainty. Experience should therefore play a key role in risk assessment related to quality of life, especially as in terms of time and money spent, and also emotional investment, the home represents a key area in people’s lives. Different health or economic indicators can be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11429474">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11429474">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1420326X11429474">29</xref>]. However, two types of problem are encountered. The first lies in the fact that many types of damage related to quality of life (e.g. illness, debt) are the result not of a single factor but of a combination of factors. The second concerns the intimate and emotional dimension of the home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1420326X11429474">30</xref>], which may be the reason why some of the most negative environmental impacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1420326X11429474">31</xref>] are met with denial. In this context, there is a major risk that households will find it difficult to appreciate the potential impacts of the environment on their quality of life.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1420326X11429474"><title>Control</title>
<p>This concerns people’s perception of their ability to reduce flux and damages linked to the environment in their homes. The main feature of the domestic space is that it is here that perceived control is theoretically greatest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1420326X11429474">32</xref>]. Even though outside pollution sources can affect the home environment (neighbours, nearby industrial activities or traffic, etc.), it is recognised that the majority of domestic matter and energy fluxes derive from household consumption activities or the nature of the housing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1420326X11429474">33</xref>]. In practice, however, many changes require specific resources (money, know-how, time, knowledge, etc.) and so real control is much more variable depending on the households. Thus, as many researchers have shown, there is a risk that this strong feeling of control may lead to an undervaluation of the real risks, due to optimistic biases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1420326X11429474">34</xref>].</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to gain a clear understanding of how people construct and express their environmental concerns at the scale of their homes. Our study looks at all fluxes of matter and energy (indoor air, water, energy, EMF emissions, waste, noise) and covers the three areas of observation described above (diagnosis, damages and control).</p>
<p>The aim of the study is to provide the main decision-makers (local and national governments, companies) with recommendations for better support to households with a view to achieving sustainable housing, and to do this, it is essential to look at the diversity of social perceptions associated with the home environment. This information can be doubly useful for decision-makers. In the context of a large-scale regional diagnosis, the diversity of the population’s expectations and needs can be identified before any decisions are taken, and also potential targets can be identified for specific actions. After decisions have been taken, the effects of actions can be assessed, for example, by observing progress in the percentage of people who have concerns about the environment in their homes. Various studies have shown that type of habitat (individual or collective), local environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1420326X11429474">35</xref>] and also local socio-cultural characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1420326X11429474">36</xref>] can all influence the nature of the indoor environment and the way people occupy it. In contrast, we hope to show in this article the diversity of perceptions that can be found at a micro-social level, and all within an area that from the point of view of habitat and environment is fairly homogeneous.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1420326X11429474"><title>Material and Methods</title>
<sec id="sec6-1420326X11429474"><title>The Questionnaire</title>
<p>A four-part questionnaire was used, covering diagnosis (part 1), damages (part 2), control (part 4) and socio-demographic variables (part 4).</p>
<p>Part 1 of the questionnaire (diagnosis) started with an open question about people’s main environmental concerns at the scale of their home (Q1). It is widely recognised that by using this type of question at the beginning of a questionnaire, a range of spontaneous and diversified responses can be obtained. Next, we wanted to see whether these concerns were stronger or weaker than concerns associated with other environmental scales (local, regional, national, planetary; Q2). An assessment of the state of the environment at each of these scales was proposed (Likert scale, from 1 Very poor to 5 Very good). We then looked at the question of information about the domestic environment. We wanted to assess the amount of information obtained from the main local actors who might be expected to provide it (Likert scale, from 1 Never to 5 Very often; Q3). In combination with this, we measured the level of satisfaction people had with this information (Likert scale, from 1 Not at all satisfied to 5 Completely satisfied; Q4), next, we asked about the kind of extra information people would like to have about their domestic environment (open question; Q5).</p>
<p>In part 2 (damages), we wanted to assess the risks associated with a deterioration in the indoor environment, in terms of quality of life. Three main factors were considered: health of the occupants, the local environment (surroundings) and the household’s economic resources. We focused on water consumption, energy consumption and indoor air pollution (Q6–Q8).</p>
<p>In part 3 (control), we wanted to estimate the perceived degree of control over the indoor environment (Likert scale, from 1 Very weak to 5 Very strong; Q9), and then to see which consumption activities were perceived as having the most impact on the indoor environment (Q10). To do this, we selected domestic activities associated with different environmental impacts (water or energy consumption, indoor air pollution, electromagnetic radiation [EMR], noise, etc.). For each one, a Likert scale was used to assess the impact on the indoor environment, from 1 Zero risk to 5 High risk.</p>
<p>From part 4 (socio-demographics), we were able to define the respondents in terms of their socio-demographic characteristics: age (Q11), gender (Q12), family structure (Q13), level of education (Q14) and level of income (Q15).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1420326X11429474"><title>The Sample</title>
<p>The study covered a periurban area close to the city of Bordeaux, France [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1420326X11429474">37</xref>]. In this area, 95% of accommodation is private homes with a garden, and 70% of these have more than four rooms (2.5 people per household). A mail survey was carried out in 2008. The total population of the area is 1,838 households. By applying the appropriate statistical formula for the size of the sample for these proportions, with a significance threshold of 5% and a margin of error of 10%, a sample of 91 households is needed. Given the usual response rates for mail surveys, which are between 10 and 20%, we sent out 600 questionnaires with an accompanying letter and stamped addressed envelope. Of the returns, 107 questionnaires (18% of those sent out) were useable. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11429474">Table 1</xref> shows a good distribution of profiles in terms of age, gender, family structure, level of education and salary.

<sec id="sec8-1420326X11429474"><title>Ecological Characteristics of the Homes</title>
<p>Data bases on the housing environment had to be used to interpret the data (section 3). Measurement campaigns are expensive and intrusive and for this reason they are carried out infrequently, both at local and national levels. In this study, we used local data (water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1420326X11429474">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1420326X11429474">39</xref>], waste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1420326X11429474">40</xref>]) and some more general data, available at national level (energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1420326X11429474">41</xref>], indoor air [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1420326X11429474">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1420326X11429474">43</xref>]).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1420326X11429474"><title>Typology of Respondents</title>
<p>Drawing on the results obtained (Q1–Q10), we were able to establish profiles of the people we interviewed. These profiles were defined according to their level of awareness of risks associated with the domestic environment (diagnosis, damages) and according to the level of control they had over these risks. Among those with a high level of awareness, we noted the “anxious” (fairly low level of control) and the “aware” (fairly high level of control). Among those with a fairly low level of risk awareness, we found the “optimists” (fairly high level of control) and those who were “not very concerned” (fairly low level of control). This is a common way of grouping individuals together to distinguish groups according to their perception of ecological risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1420326X11429474">44</xref>].</p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1420326X11429474"><title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Analyses were carried out using XLStat software. For questions Q2, Q3 and Q10, the significance of the differences between means was tested with a single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). To group respondents according to their perception of risks at the level of their home, we used ascending hierarchical classification (Euclidian distance) and then a discriminant function analysis (DFA; Ward’s method).</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1420326X11429474"><title>Results</title>
<sec id="sec12-1420326X11429474"><title>Diagnosis</title>
<p>Different concerns were mentioned in relation to the environment in the homes (Q1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11429474">Figure 1</xref>). Results show on the one hand that more than 50% of respondents mention no concern at all. On the other hand, they also show that concerns are varied and felt at different degrees of intensity: five topics are mentioned, with energy (46% of respondents) and water (44%) being the ones that concern most people. Air (21%), waste (17%) and EMR (8%), on the other hand, are of less concern.
<fig id="fig1-1420326X11429474" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>General concern in relation to the home environment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11429474-fig1.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>To complement this, we looked at whether these environmental concerns at the scale of the home were more or less stronger than concerns at other ecological levels (Q2). Respondents considered that the environment was more and more degraded according to the different scales of observation, from local to global (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11429474">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, at the scale of their housing and commune (very local), a significant number ( <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) considered that ecological problems were less serious or of less concern than at any other scale of observation.
<fig id="fig2-1420326X11429474" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Perception of the state of the environment using five scales of observation, from planet level to housing level.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11429474-fig2.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>Generally, respondents said they received little in the way of information about their home environment (Q3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11429474">Figure 3</xref>). However, a statistical analysis shows that they did not consider that they were informed to the same extent by all actors ( <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). In their opinion, information came most often from the media and their family (i.e. they identified and quantified fluxes themselves). Less frequently, respondents said they received information from friends and service providers (e.g. energy suppliers), and even less frequently still, they said that their information came from local governments, associations (legal organizations governing common interests) and doctors.
<fig id="fig3-1420326X11429474" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Perception of sources of information about the home environment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11429474-fig3.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>However, the media and friends do not have the means to provide people with accurate and objective information about fluxes in their homes. At the very most, they can provide general information about pollution levels at the scale of the population in the context of measurement campaigns. The family and service providers are the only ones able to generate relevant and objective information about matter and energy fluxes in their homes: hence, the perception of the information provided by service providers seemed poor.</p>
<p>Finally, respondents said that they very rarely received information from their local government, doctors and associations. For the local government this seems a fairly normal response, as they do not as yet concern themselves very much with matters relating to the indoor environment. However, it seems to be a poor result for doctors, as various complaints (e.g. sick building syndrome) can be linked with features of the indoor environment.</p>
<p>In addition, respondents said they were not very satisfied with the data they had on their home environment (Q4; mean of 2.7). We might expect people to want a lot of information; however, our results (What further information would you like to receive about the environment in your home?) revealed fairly low expectations: energy, which was in first position, was mentioned by only 14% of respondents (Q5).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec13-1420326X11429474"><title>Damages</title>
<p>Respondents had to associate one or several issues (cost, health, ecosystem) to three factors that characterised housing: water (Q6), energy (Q7) and air (Q8). Results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11429474">Figure 4</xref>.
<fig id="fig4-1420326X11429474" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Perception of health, ecological and economic risks associated with three components of the home environment (indoor air, water and energy).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11429474-fig4.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<sec id="sec14-1420326X11429474"><title>Health</title>
<p>Respondents associated health concerns essentially with two components: indoor air (36%) and water (23%). For indoor air, this result is poor compared with the health risks that have been demonstrated in national measurement campaigns. For benzene, median concentrations observed are 2.1 µg·m<sup>−3</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1420326X11429474">42</xref>] and the guideline for carcinogenic haematological effects for a “lifetime’s” exposure is 2 µg·m<sup>−3</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1420326X11429474">43</xref>]. Thus, more than one household in two is exposed to concentrations of pollutants that present a risk to health. In contrast, the perception of the health risk posed by water seems high when we consider local data about drinking water, which show that it meets the standards of drinkability and that it has no effect on the health of individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1420326X11429474">38</xref>].</p></sec>
<sec id="sec15-1420326X11429474"><title>Cost</title>
<p>Respondents associated cost concerns mainly with energy (53%) and water (37%). For energy, this result seems logical as household energy budgets are increasing constantly: 13% of French people spend more than 10% of their income on energy. For water, however, this result seems high as household water bills correspond on average to 1% of the total budget [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1420326X11429474">45</xref>].</p></sec>
<sec id="sec16-1420326X11429474"><title>Ecosystems</title>
<p>Less than 4% of respondents mentioned the issue of ecology in relation to energy, water and indoor air. And yet, these first two domestic fluxes are associated with worrying ecological impacts. For energy, the national government aims to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by 20% before 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1420326X11429474">46</xref>]. In France, electricity production is dominated by nuclear power. This industry has less impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, but it does produce other types of impact and ecological risks (e.g. nuclear waste). For water, there is a resource management plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1420326X11429474">39</xref>] that is to be applied at local level in the survey area. The aim is to reduce water withdrawal by 20% by 2015, 74% of which is for the production of drinking water for households and local communities. Households have an important role to play in terms of achieving these objectives, thus, our respondents’ perception of ecological issues seems poor. This reveals a lack of consideration given to local, regional and global ecological consequences compared with that given to domestic matter and energy fluxes.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec17-1420326X11429474"><title>Control</title>
<p>The majority of respondents thought they had only little control over the environment in their homes: only 33% believed that they had a strong influence and none believed that they had a very strong influence on the domestic environment (Q9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11429474">Figure 5</xref>). This perception of their lack of control seems high as the majority of matter and energy fluxes result from consumption activities by the occupants themselves.
<fig id="fig5-1420326X11429474" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Perception of personal influence on the state of the home environment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11429474-fig5.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>Alongside this, the perception of ecological impacts associated with domestic consumption was analyzed (Q10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11429474">Figure 6</xref>). Results show that the general perception of environmental risks in the home associated with consumption activities is fairly low. They show significantly ( <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) that for the respondents, cleaning the home was the most polluting activity, ahead of a group of activities consisting of painting, heating, laundry and computer use. Pets were associated with very low levels of impact on the home environment. Thus, consumption activities using chemicals are thought to pollute most, but heating and electrical appliances on the other hand, despite their essential contribution to energy consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1420326X11429474">41</xref>], are considered to have less impact. The minimum level of ecological impact is from pets, even though they can be associated with noise and the production of allergens in the indoor air [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1420326X11429474">47</xref>]. Thus, in this case, there is an underestimation of the real impacts.

</p></sec>
<sec id="sec18-1420326X11429474"><title>Profiles</title>
<p>We identified four groups of respondents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1420326X11429474">Figure 7</xref>, right) on the basis of their environmental perception of their home (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1420326X11429474">Figure 7</xref>, left). Axis 1 (52% of variance) can be assimilated to awareness of risks in the domestic environment and Axis 2 (38% of variance) to individual control over these risks. The “aware” (<italic>n</italic> = 53; 50% of the sample) recognise their influence on the environment in their home, identify the associated socio-ecological issues but would like to have a better environmental diagnosis. The “optimists” (<italic>n</italic> = 20; 19%) have a very positive perception of their indoor environment which, in their opinion, presents no particular risk. The “not very concerned” (<italic>n</italic> = 18; 16%) are in an intermediate position: they have no clear-cut opinion on questions linked with the indoor environment and consider that the information they have is satisfactory. The “anxious” (<italic>n</italic> = 16; 15%) are worried about the lack of information and the seriousness of the health consequences of the indoor environment. A further examination of the socio-demographic profiles of these four groups shows that the oldest people (&gt;65-years-old) are best represented in the group of optimists ( <italic>p</italic> = 0.04).

<sec id="sec19-1420326X11429474"><title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="sec20-1420326X11429474"><title>The Question of Exposure</title>
<p>The results show that general levels of anxiety were very uneven depending on the matter and energy fluxes considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11429474">Figure 1</xref>), but that compared with more global ecological scales, anxiety levels were fairly low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11429474">Figure 2</xref>). These concerns were not at all closely correlated with wider ecological considerations, in fact, the results showed an almost systematic absence of consideration given to the local, regional and global ecological consequences of domestic matter and energy fluxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11429474">Figure 4</xref>). Instead, concerns were linked more to the direct consequences on quality of life: budgetary factors appear to predominate in creating concerns about domestic fluxes and the health factor also plays a part. However, perception of the issues ranged from undervaluation, as in the case of indoor air, to overvaluation, as in the case of water. These observations are in agreement with those found in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11429474">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X11429474">19</xref>]. These differences between perception and reality could have dramatic consequences for households, as they limit their ability to anticipate harm to health or economic damage. Thus, it is important to try and reconcile real risks and people’s perception of them.</p>
<p>From this perspective, information on the domestic environment occupies a key position. People state that they receive this information from several sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11429474">Figure 3</xref>). The analysis of environmental information about housing demonstrates a return to the most obvious sources (the people themselves, via their perception or measurements, and the service providers), which falls far short of what could be achieved. In contrast, the media seem to play a vital role. However, although they can provide information on exposure in general associated with the domestic environment, they are not in a position to provide information that is appropriate and specific to each household. Moreover, the diversity of types of media raises the question of the consistency of the messages they send. The risks involved in providing information on risk perception in this way have to a large extent already been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1420326X11429474">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1420326X11429474">26</xref>].</p>
<p>It would therefore seem that there is a great deal of progress to be made, to find a suitable balance between access to reliable information of a general nature on exposure and damages associated with the indoor environment, and access to specific information, relevant to the situation in each household.</p>
<p>The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11429474">Figure 2</xref>, however, should prompt us to be cautious about the link between environmental information and expertise. It is possible that the reason for the low level of concern generally derives not only from ignorance of the individual domestic environment but also from a denial mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1420326X11429474">48</xref>]. It is possible that there may be too great an emotional investment in the domestic space; several environmental psychology studies have shown that this attachment can lead to an underestimation of nuisance and annoyance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1420326X11429474">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1420326X11429474">50</xref>].</p></sec>
<sec id="sec21-1420326X11429474"><title>The Question of Control</title>
<p>For the most part, people believe that they have little influence over the environment in their homes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11429474">Figure 5</xref>). They consider that their ability to change it is low. This result is surprising, given the control that people would appear to have over their home environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1420326X11429474">32</xref>]. Even if the indoor home environment can be modified by the external local environment (e.g. air) [51], where people’s control over pollution is clearly low, the possibilities available to occupants to improve the ecological performance of their homes are real and often affordable: for small purchases, this could consist of choosing to buy ecoproducts, making very minor investments, for instance, in water-saving taps, controlling fluxes (water, energy, ventilation). There could be two reasons for this perception of a lack of control.</p>
<p>The first lies in the difficulty people may find in having a clear understanding in the first place of relationships between consumption and the indoor environment. Studies have shown that people find this difficult in the case of energy consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X11429474">22</xref>]. Our results suggest that this difficulty also arises in relation to emissions of polluting substances, with the tendency being to underestimate environmental risks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11429474">Figure 6</xref>). There is therefore a risk that the courses of action that households identify as bringing about improvements in their indoor environment are not the right ones, and that they have only little effect.</p>
<p>The second stems from the fact that reducing pollution may require a considerable amount of investment in terms of financial resources, time or human effort (putting in insulation, changing floor covering, replacing electrical goods, etc.). Thus, many households might feel that they have reached a stalemate in terms of improving the environment in their homes.</p>
<p>So, here also a great deal of progress can be made, in finding a balance between, on the one hand, fairly general recommendations that can be useful to identify priorities for action (the situation that is currently favoured), and on the other, possible actions that are specific to individual contexts (time, money, consumption, house, etc.).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec22-1420326X11429474"><title>Directions for Sustainable Habitat Policies</title>
<p>At the scale of the area studied here, the results highlight the fact that there is frequently a discrepancy between the perception of the indoor environment and reality. While this difference may be psychological in origin, for many people it is also the result of a lack of any set of references in relation to their own home. This observation endorses the idea that there should be more individual forms of support available for people in relation to their indoor environment. Such a strategy would complement measures that are currently in place, and which are fairly general, such as information on risks associated with the indoor environment and recommendations on how to reduce them (e.g. eco-efficient investment, environmentally friendly and efficient consumer goods).</p>
<p>This personalisation strategy must take into account the diversity of awareness of the domestic environment. Two major trends emerge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1420326X11429474">Figure 7</xref>): the lowest level of awareness is made up of “optimists” and the “not very concerned”. In the study, they represent 35% of respondents. The highest level of awareness is by the “aware” and the “anxious”: this is 65% of households in the study. These results are in agreement with those obtained for perception of the local environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1420326X11429474">37</xref>] and they reveal a real awareness of the environment in the homes. However, given the numbers of respondents in each group, the results should be considered with some caution: with the survey method used, it is possible that more “aware” people replied to the questionnaire than people who were “not very concerned”. The percentage calculated for this study could therefore be an overestimate of the real situation in the area studied. Nevertheless, if this diversity in awareness is to be taken into account then several forms of support have to be envisaged.</p>
<p>It would be useful if those who are most aware had access, on a voluntary basis, to ways of extending their own environmental diagnosis and identifying personal solutions for reducing the most worrying fluxes. More and more local governments are offering this kind of support to households in relation to energy. This focus on “energy” is in-line with our own observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11429474">Figure 1</xref>) and issues such as increasing fuel poverty. This study provides support for the idea of extending this personalised advice to other matter and energy fluxes associated with housing (towards an energy/water/waste/air/EMR package). As Dingle and Lalla [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11429474">16</xref>] have shown, it is important that a structure like this is based on scientific findings, to ensure maximum credibility. Given the socio-demographic profiles observed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1420326X11429474">Figure 7</xref>), it is relevant to target those who are involved with these concerns on a daily basis (associations, trade unions, etc.) and also the youngest individuals and households. In addition, it is important that people do not have too narrow a vision of the possibilities for reducing the most worrying fluxes. Thus, collective “expertise” should be encouraged, by organising networks so that people can share their experiences and their knowledge.</p>
<p>The presence of a fairly large proportion of people who are apparently not receptive to this type of support suggests that more systematic and non-targeted actions should be implemented. In our opinion, there are two routes that should be given priority. In the first, people are simply passive receptors. It involves all actors associated with housing: social actors (e.g. social services) and economic actors (e.g. artisans, estate agencies). They must gradually become credible and competent intermediaries for information on risks (social and health in particular, cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11429474">Figure 4</xref>) linked with the home environment. Recent measures on energy labelling in homes are an excellent example of putting this into practice. Next, the question of education is crucial, with the introduction of higher education courses (university diplomas) and continuing education courses (e.g. for social workers and building workers). To complement this, demand-side management must be actively put into practice. The perception of risks associated with the indoor environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11429474">Figure 4</xref>) gives us some interesting information. It shows, for example, that the economic dimension is fundamental in water and energy management. As a result, it is important that water- and energy-saving measures are not based solely on material investment, information or knowledge. They must also seek to reward the efforts that consumers put into energy saving, especially through water and/or energy pricing systems. More and more measures such as these are currently being tested, like variable pricing at different time periods, for instance, so that energy production and distribution can be better managed, or also progressive pricing, which encourages reductions in consumption.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec23-1420326X11429474" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study explores the nature and the diversity of social perceptions of risks related to the housing environment. Although it may be inappropriate to extrapolate the results to areas with different environmental and/or anthropic characteristics, they nevertheless make a useful contribution to this area of research, which is still in its infancy. In particular, we have shown that there are two aspects where risk assessment by households may become distorted: self-assessment of the environment and the establishment of links between consumption and the environment at the level of the home. As levels of awareness in the population vary considerably, we recommend both systematic and specifically targeted intervention. More generally, with this type of study, it will be possible to monitor how public awareness as a whole is progressing with regard to the question of sustainable housing.</p></sec>
