<p><italic>Learning nothing from their response to the previous threat from television, newspapers have been slow to react to the internet</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The threat posed to existing media by internet entrepreneurs has proved a classic example of the way in which technological advances create unexpected pressures from new entrants. With no entry barriers worth considering, these organisations have wreaked havoc in the traditional newspaper industry, taking great advantage of low cost bases. Within a very short time, the traditional newspapers' reliance on their very expensive production plant and well-paid employees to ward off intending publishers was seen to be not only a hollow defence, but also a financial burden. The nimbler electronic publishers made dramatic inroads in the newspaper market, not only because they were offering a new service, but also because the newspaper industry was slow to react.</p>
<p>The business strategist Henry Mintzberg has pointed out that the age of an industry will often determine its structure. The older the industry, the more formalised its behaviours and the more difficult it becomes to change them. The same effect applies to organisations with an industry. In the media industry, this is most evident in newspapers – the oldest sector in this field – and least noticeable in local internet publications. The latter are new and usually smaller in terms of staff, and inferior in terms of profitability, but they have agility when needing to change course.</p>
<p>What did papers need to do when they were confronted by the internet? They needed to think about strategy. The business analysts John Pearce and Richard Robinson define strategy as being “large-scale, future-oriented plans for interacting with the competitive environment to optimise the achievement of organisation objectives”. They provide a useful set of criteria to identify those factors that should be regarded as strategic issues:</p>
<list id="list1-095647480813492472" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Those that require a top management decision</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Those that involve the allocation of substantial amounts of company resources (i.e. people, physical assets or money)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Those likely to have a significant impact on the long-term prosperity of the firm</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Those that are future-oriented</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Those that have multi-functional or multi-business consequences</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Those that necessitate the consideration of factors in the firm's external environment</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>All media firms, whether traditional or innovative, must satisfy basic questions. What are they setting out to do, and do they have the resources with which to do it? The resultant company profile is a summary of the firm's performance capabilities based on the available resources, whether actual or accessible. Once the strategic analysis is complete, the range of possible choices will become evident and the overall grand strategy will begin to form. The first level will be the answer to the question “What is possible?” The second is “What is desired?” One of the most frequent mistakes made when attempting to formulate a strategy is to attempt to start with what is desired, without paying any regard to what is possible. The result at best is a series of false starts with considerable wastage of time and effort – and at worst a complete disaster from which the firm may never fully recover.</p>

<title>Newspaper boardrooms were stubborn</title>
<p>The most basic question that needs to be asked is “What is your objective?” It is important not to confuse the company's objective with its mission statement, which is most often a declaration of lofty intent with regard to what the firm sees as its social responsibility. To be of greatest use an objective should describe, in clear terms, what the senior management desire in market share, profitability, return on investment or any other concrete measure they decide to insist upon. Without this clearly-stated and universally-known statement, it is possible that the firm will descend into management drift, in which the lack of direction will result in a lack of purpose.</p>
<p>In newspaper boardrooms, group-think, bureaucracy and a stubborn belief that people valued newspapers held sway. What escaped them for some time was that while people value news they do not necessarily value newspapers.</p>
<p>The media industry is a spectrum of organisations that extend from news-heavy national newspapers on one hand to lightweight gossip magazines on the other. Media players are first and foremost service organisations that can be grouped within a service industry sector. The single most important characteristic of a service is its intangibility, whereas a product can be seen and touched, a service can only be experienced. It is most often created and delivered at the same time, for example in the case of a haircut – in this the barber or hairdresser provides a service literally on demand. Generally services cannot be stored for later use, they must be consumed when required.</p>
<p>Though hard-copy newspapers and magazines are physical products, their publishers are in effect providing a news and entertainment service. It has been argued that these media, having originally launched print products as the only means of contacting their widespread market, appear to have continued out of habit. A countervailing argument has been that information and its implications can take time to absorb, and a medium that allows its readers to reference back makes for more efficient communication. Even with the advent of electronic devices, a newspaper or magazine in physical format may be convenient. To this extent news media are either “experience” or “credence” services, in as much as previous use has proved to be satisfactory or not (experience service), or, because even after the service has been bought but not yet consumed, as in the case of unclaimed insurance, it may not be possible to decide whether it is satisfactory (credence service).</p>
<p>There are three functions media companies can offer – information, entertainment or persuasion. The last has almost entirely moved to the internet in what has become known as the blogosphere, the home of the latter-day pamphleteer. The relatively small amount of persuasion that remains in traditional media is usually in the politically committed national press and news magazines.</p>
<p><italic>Understanding readers:</italic> The character of individual media is largely defined by the admixture of information in the form of news, or items of entertainment which do not have the substance or time criticality of news stories. National newspapers and serious news magazines are at one end of this spectrum and celebrity gossip publications at the other. Each medium has its own core community, and while there is some degree of multiple connections, these groups are usually sufficiently distinct to permit categorisation based either on geographical location, demographics, profession, leisure pursuits, or social class.</p>
<p>Let's examine the least complicated of these communities of interest, which is the one served by local newspapers, magazines, radio or television stations. While the principal interest of members of the community is in their own wellbeing, an additional concern is their identity within the community, which is sustained by news items that bear directly on the community of which they are members.</p>
<p>The sense of belonging is the essential glue that binds communities, and it is the free flow of information filtered and directed by the news media which the community uses to strengthen this bond. Families use news to assess the importance or otherwise of the events which are likely to bear upon the family as a unit. Communities depend upon the news media to provide them with some indication of the relative importance of the events that are about to affect them. Interpretation increases in significance as the world in which communities exist becomes more complex.</p>

<title>The internet is overwhelmingly popular</title>
<p>The German sociologist Ferdinand Tonnies (1855–1936) hypothesised that groups of people consisted of two types of human association; gemeinschaft, which is usually translated as “community,” and gesellschaft, which is taken to be “society” or “association”. Gemeinschaft is considered to be a more cohesive social entity – Tonnies regarded family or kinship to be perfect descriptors of gemeinschaft whereas gesellscaft describes a group motivated largely by self-interest. He was at pains to point out that these groupings are not mutually exclusive and that other shared characteristics, such as place or belief systems, could also be major contributors to gemeinschaft.</p>
<p>The importance of Tonnies' concept to media companies is that it permits deconstruction of communities along other than simple demographic lines. It may also go a long way to explain why the internet has proved to be so overwhelmingly popular, especially with those in the gesellschaft category. From the media companies' viewpoint, especially those providing news, it is gemeinschaft group that is of most interest.</p>
<p>A major attribute of residents displaying gemeinschaft characteristics is a high degree of loyalty and commitment to the community in which they live. Individuals with this trait usually live within families, so it is the family unit that becomes the main focus of a media company's attention, and as it is the adults within families who set the tone for the family view of their community, it is the family units which become the primary targets for any form of promotion.</p>
<p>An example of this type of research, conducted on behalf of the UK Newspaper Society, which represents local and regional newspapers, surveyed weekly newspaper readers throughout the country. In response to the question: “Do you feel you are a part of the local community?” more than 43 per cent of the young families, teen families or empty nesters (families whose children have left home) replied in the affirmative. This is a strong indication that these family units could qualify for inclusion in the gemeinschaft group, and, at worst, provide a strategic target for goal setting.</p>
<p>But it is the gesellschaft concept which is most useful when seeking to understand the remarkable growth of the web and the internet generally. It is easy to dismiss the internet as a passing phase enabled by the introduction of personal computers, but this is very far from the reality. The desire to have the world of knowledge at one's fingertips is very much a gesellschaft feature of people, who are less concerned about the community in which they live and more about their personal needs and desires.</p>
<p>People in the gesellschaft segment are considerably less local in their interests, and use the internet as a communication tool for national and international topics. The young, while giving the appearance of displaying no interest in local affairs, could well be displaying an eagerness to explore worlds to which they may not have had access before the internet. They could be described as being in a state of transition, likely to move to the gemeinschaft category when they have established a place in the community. By commissioning straightforward attitudinal research using this sociological typology, it is possible to estimate a media firm's achievable potential within a community.</p>
<p><italic>Readers and advertisers:</italic> Media industries need to have twin-track strategies, one aimed at the consumers and the second at the advertisers. While these are distinctly different target groups, the objectives required of each must not be in any form of conflict, because the number of consumers directly affects the amount that can be charged for advertising, and the advertisement revenues determine the amount, and quality, of information or entertainment that can be offered to the consumer.</p>
<p>It is clear that for some individual media businesses, especially the electronic media, the product has no direct cost to the consumer, and for others, particularly local and regional newspapers, the product cost has been held at an artificially low level for marketing reasons. Holding down product costs to the consumer was thought to encourage sales which in turn would justify higher advertisement rates.</p>
<p>The balance between the quality of the information provided to readers and the cost of providing it is a delicate one. In general, those media that provide most in-house generated material have the highest costs because staff must be paid on a continuing basis irrespective of the amount of material they produce. The benefit of directly employed staff is the ability of the management to control the quality of the published, or broadcast, content. Bought-in material, while involving less cost, is usually not unique in that it is available to any medium willing to pay for it. When assessing whether to produce copy or to buy it in more cheaply, it is useful to point out the trade-off that media managers must address, which is the amount of local content that will satisfy the audience. The more local the medium, the more need for the content to be generated in-house.</p>

<title>Images on television were more glamorous</title>
<p>Of course, the internet is not the first existential challenge to be faced by the print media. The last great assault came from the television industry and the bitterest battles were fought over advertising. The first stage was the growth of the commercial television sector which concentrated on attracting national advertisers, thus directly confronting the national newspaper and national magazine markets. Initially only these national advertisers could afford the high rates. The moving images provided by television were glamorous in comparison with the black and white, static images on the printed page, and television advertisements became even more attractive when colour television became available.</p>
<p>This advance forced the print media to introduce full colour in order to be able to match, at least in part, television's material. Some larger groups that already had magazine supplements which offered colour managed to retain some national advertising, but the overall response to the threat from the commercial television companies was patchy.</p>
<p>Television marketing executives launched viewing figures to give advertisers an alternative to numbers of copies sold, and suddenly, newspapers – used to treating advertising agencies with some arrogance – had to fight for their share of ad spend. Regional newspapers were not as badly affected as the national press because the advertising they carried provided the local address of stockists of the products and services advertised on television.</p>
<p>This incursion into what had been the comfortably profitable world of newspapers revolutionised the competitive arena in media. As long as the barriers to entry into the print world remained high, the incumbents had little to fear because they knew that high fixed-costs of production and low unit prices of sales would preclude any serious competition. That reliance on the entry barriers which had made newspapers a rich man's sport had caused them to ignore threats from new entrants who did not have the same affection for the traditional way of doing things.</p>
<p>You might have thought the print industry would apply the lessons of the fight with television and be ready to react when the internet appeared on the horizon. Rather, they continued in a blinkered view of the environment, apparently in the belief that an industry that had survived the arrival of radio and television would see off the new arrival by maintaining its traditional ways. As was said of the Bourbons, “they have learned nothing and forgotten nothing”.</p>
