<p>This issue of <italic>Public Works Management &amp; Policy</italic> has a decidedly transportation focus. In “The Dynamic Impacts of State Revenue Capacity on Highway Investment,” Arwiphawee Srithongrung investigates the short-term effects of earmarked state highway revenues and federal grant expenditure on current-year state revenue sources and highway investment. “Funding Rail: Federal Decisions and Local Financing” by Kate Lowe tests the hypothesis that local financing decisions—as a demand-side factor in funding allocations—can drive federal rail spending. Michelle Renee Oswald and Sue McNeil present a methodology to integrate climate change adaptation efforts into the long range transportation planning process and describe a tool to assist planners in “Methodology for Integrating Adaptation to Climate Change Into the Transportation Planning Process.” Peter F. Swan and Michael H. Belzer question whether the economic benefits of highway concessions exceed the costs of diverting truck traffic to rural roads in “Tolling and Economic Efficiency: Do the Pecuniary Benefits Exceed the Safety Costs?” and William E. Sitzabee, Edward D. White and Austin W. Dowling present a performance model to predict the remaining life of highway pavement markings to maintain a standard level of service in “Degradation Modeling of Polyurea Pavement Markings.”</p>
<p>We have also issued a Call for Papers for a symposium issue of PWMP to address the issue of Performance Management for Public Infrastructure. Please note the details as described later in this volume.</p>
