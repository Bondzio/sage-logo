<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The focus in recent years on Better Regulation within the European context has seen a significant development of ex ante practices for the introduction of policies and legislation, not only in the European Commission itself, but also in national administrations. Regulatory Impact Assessment, Pilot-Test Casing, and standard financial ex ante evaluation have become commonplace tools in many national administrations before wider implementation of policies and legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356389012460439">HM Treasury, 2008</xref>). The European Commission too, has introduced a rigorous Impact Assessment process as part of policy proposal development since 2000, which has now become a well-accepted and highly appreciated tool by its decision-makers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356389012460439">COM, 2002</xref>: 276). However, to date very little in the way of ex post evaluation of policy and legislation practice exists, with many administrations opting to focus mainly on activities that involve public spending, using evaluation as a means of accountability. Indeed, at the European Commission also, evaluation of spending programmes is a well-established discipline that forms part of the Financial Regulatory Framework governing the EU budget. The evaluation of policies and legislation, on the other hand, is still a relatively new and developing field, albeit one that is gaining importance.</p>
<p>In 2007 the European Commission revised its framework and quality standards for evaluation, placing more emphasis on the ex post evaluation of policies and legislation. By doing so, the European Commission has firmly committed itself to developing ex post evaluation of these non-spending activities to match the importance of its Impact Assessment process. However, early experience when evaluating legislation, and EU Directives in particular, has highlighted that some adaptation of existing evaluation practices, that rely on traditional methods typically designed for evaluating spending programmes, would be necessary to meet the quality standards and needs of decision-makers.</p>
<p>Finding little by way of specific guidance that could be used for evaluating EU legislation and dealing with the complexities certain legislative forms can create, the Directorate General for Internal Market and Services has developed its own methodology for evaluation of EU legislation encompassed in a practical step-by-step guidance to its staff. Note that this methodology has only been adopted by the Directorate General for Internal Market and Financial Services. Other policy areas in the European Commission have since commissioned their own guides and methodologies that suit their relevant policy fields and legislative frameworks. In addition, the Secretariat General’s Evaluation Unit are also currently setting out some procedural guidelines that encourage Directorate Generals to adopt a wide range of methodological practices for evaluation of legislation to suit their policy fields and needs.</p>
<p>Not wishing to reinvent the wheel, this methodology does not claim to be revolutionary in its techniques, but draws strongly on existing evaluation thinking and practices (e.g. the use of an intervention logic, evaluation criteria for setting evaluation questions, analytical tools, and so on). Where it differs is in its attempts to modify definitions and adapt the application of certain tools to better suit the evaluation of non-spending activities within an EU context. Presenting this proposed methodology at the European Evaluation Society’s Bi-annual Conference in Lisbon in 2008 highlighted significant interest in the development of EU evaluation practices for national administrations similarly working toward a policy of evaluating legislation/policy, and for evaluation practitioners often involved in EU evaluation projects.</p>
<p>This contribution aims to provide some insight for evaluation practitioners into:</p>

<p>Readers should note that what follows contains specific relevance to EU legislation from an EU official’s perspective, and while much of what follows may be transferrable to similar political and organizational environments, the author is currently not in a position to identify how this may be done.

<sec id="section2-1356389012460439">
<title>Evaluation in the European Commission</title>
<p>The European Commission defines evaluation as a reliable and objective evidence-based assessment of the results and impacts of its interventions in the light of the needs they aim to satisfy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356389012460439">SEC[2000]1051</xref>). The evaluation of activities, particularly spending programmes, is a well-established discipline at the European Commission.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1356389012460439">1</xref></sup> For a long time, evaluation has been a useful way to assess and provide evidence for sound and efficient management. With the arrival of Activity Based Management (ABM) in 2000, evaluation became the main tool for judging how well interventions were achieving their objectives and determining any necessary improvements. Two Communications provided a strong framework for evaluation, defining rules and standards and embedding evaluation as a key tool for evidence-based decision-making.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1356389012460439">2</xref></sup> Spending programmes, in particular, have relied on evaluation results to produce an evidence-based judgement for budgetary decision-making.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1356389012460439">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>As ABM has evolved over the last decade, so too has evaluation. Evaluation has expanded from a method for judging whether programmes and policies had achieved their objectives into an essential learning and development tool. Today, evaluation also provides key data, justification and sound knowledge allowing policy- and decision-makers to plan, design, implement and manage complex EU policies with ambitious objectives. As a result, there is a need for more systematic evaluation of all types of EU action as an integral component in achieving better regulation, simplification and joined-up policy-making.</p>
<p>In essence, the European Commission’s evaluation framework encompasses a mix of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356389012460439">Scriven (1981)</xref> refers to as summative and formative evaluation approaches. The early focus on spending programmes, which are usually well defined with regard to their objectives and available resources, tangible and measurable actions and results, easily identifiable beneficiaries and affected parties, has meant that evaluation generally concentrated on whether money was being spent wisely. This predominantly summative approach has gradually evolved more toward the formative approach as the role of evaluation has broadened.</p>
<p>However, although Impact Assessment is an accepted means of ensuring that <italic>new</italic> proposals are based on more informed policy-making, evaluating the results of the policy instruments used (e.g. legislation) has been a less common practice. Assessing whether and to what extent the expected impacts of current legislative instruments have borne true is equally valuable, if not more so, to policy- and decision-making. As an essential learning and development tool, evaluation provides key information and solid evidence so that the European Commission can adapt its policies according to the needs of ever-changing political situations, allowing EU policy-makers to ensure their policies contribute to an effective regulatory environment and demonstrate to the citizen the benefits of Europe (and in this specific case, the benefits of the Single Market).</p>
<p>That said, evaluation of policies and legislation – the main type of evaluation carried out by the Directorate General for Internal Market and Services – is a relatively new and developing field, gaining increasing importance in the era of better regulation. While the Communication on evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356389012460439">SEC [2007]</xref>213) set out a revised framework and quality standards for evaluations of <italic>all</italic> types, even emphasizing the formative evaluation approach, most available guidance remains very general and mainly related to programme evaluation. Yet, EU Legislation, which often deals with ‘concepts’ or ‘principles’ and hence result in multiple layers of complex interaction, produces interlinked medium- and longer-term impacts that are difficult to capture with traditional evaluation models designed for standard spending programmes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1356389012460439">
<title>Complexities of EU legislation</title>
<p>Given its unique position, the European Commission, in aiming to evaluate its policies and legislative instruments, must consider the effects on the entire EU, which inevitably will vary across the 27 Member States, each with their own legal landscape and other political and economic circumstances that can impact on how well EU policies and legislation have achieved their aims. Therefore, the first reflection for developing an appropriate methodology was the type of legislative instruments under consideration for evaluation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1356389012460439">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The totally binding nature of EU Regulations entails that Member States apply and implement them entirely in accordance with the text. Hence, using the standard approach adopted by the European Commission’s existing framework causes few problems. Any complexities arising from the specific political and/or economic circumstances within which the Regulation has been introduced can be negotiated using the same tools as for the more intricate spending programme evaluations that typically occur, for example, in Humanitarian Aid. Such cases (although rather few at the time of writing) have applied a necessarily more qualitative approach to these tools.</p>
<p>Other types of EU legislation are far more complex since Member States have considerable freedom on how to implement them. These range from non-binding instruments such as Recommendations, Resolutions and Communications to Directives, which are binding on Member States in terms of results to be achieved, but allow for flexibility in terms of legal form and implementation. Inevitably, such instruments are far more complex to evaluate when considering an EU of 27 Member States, all of whom may take different paths toward achieving similar goals.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the highly complex nature of legislative instruments other than EU Regulations was taken as the focal point for this new methodological approach and should be borne in mind throughout reading this contribution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1356389012460439">
<title>What is an evaluation of EU legislation?</title>
<p>An evaluation of legislation is a factual analysis that looks at the extent to which the implementation of the legislative or other non-binding instrument is addressing the issue/problem initially identified.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1356389012460439">5</xref></sup> It is much more than an enhanced implementation report, however; an evaluation should look at all aspects of legislation and its process over a given time-frame, ideally covering adoption, implementation and, most importantly, impacts. It should consider not just whether the legislation did what it was expected to do, but also what other effects may have happened as a result. By measuring these changes against the situation at the time of adoption, the evaluation can then judge just how well legislation has met its targets in the real world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1356389012460439">6</xref></sup> Most importantly since evaluation of EU legislation is intended to be used as a policy-development tool rather than a simple verification instrument – a significant attitudinal change of approach to that of spending programme evaluation – the evaluation must consider equally changes that may be negative as well as positive in order to exemplify the formative process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1356389012460439">
<title>Why is evaluation theory different for EU legislation?</title>
<p>The majority of spending programmes tend to fit within the linear model of traditional evaluation theory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356389012460439">Figure 1</xref>) quite well, it being generally easier to establish for their evaluation:</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1356389012460439-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In evaluating EU legislation, the complexity of the many potentially diverging paths and possible interactions that occur during implementation, but which nevertheless (hopefully!) lead toward achieving the desired change/s (objective), are difficult to reflect in such a linear cause-effect logic. As key components in most EU legislation, a cause-effect logic model must consider that there are:</p>
<list id="list3-1356389012460439" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold>multiple actors</bold> (i.e. EU, Member State, regional/local government);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>multiple types of legislation</bold> (i.e. Regulations, Directives, <italic>sui generis</italic> instruments, all with varying degrees of binding nature);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>a number of ways for implementation and transposition to occur</bold> (i.e. direct transposition; gold-plating; use of options and/or derogations; delayed, incorrect or incomplete transposition, etc.).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1356389012460439">7</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Equally, the focus of an evaluation of EU legislation tends to be on how these many diverging interactions, both positive and negative, affect the outcome (or not) of the issue/problem it was aiming to address and on the wider impact of the legislation in an EU (and possibly global) context. In doing so, it needs to take into account:</p>
<list id="list4-1356389012460439" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold>various trade-offs</bold> between those who benefit (winners) and those who are adversely affected (losers) among <bold>targeted groups and other parties</bold>;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>positive and negative effects</bold> and any attempts to maximize and minimize them respectively;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>a range of indirect as well as direct impacts and unexpected as well as expected effects</bold>.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In other words, there is rarely just one way to achieve the aims of EU legislation – in general there are many alternative routes, different methods of getting there and possible diversions along the way. When evaluating legislation, these different possibilities that make up myriad combinations across the 27 Member States must be taken into account in order to understand what the <italic>actual</italic> impacts have been and the evaluator must also look at what changes have occurred due to other extenuating circumstances. Uncovering the extent to which the issue/problem has been resolved due to the EU legislation or by other actions and/or world events is challenging.</p>
<p>As if 27 Member States implementing one set of legislative measures alone were not complex enough, in the majority of cases this involves a combination of options, derogations and/or measures often not only from the legislation being evaluated but of a national administration’s own making or possibly even in combination with a totally different piece of legislation.</p>
<p>Given the need to focus on evaluating i) how these many diverging interactions affect the outcome (or not) of the issue/problem the legislation was intended to address, and ii) the wider impact of the legislation in an EU (and possibly global) context, it is practically impossible to create an understandable picture that fits within the linear model of programme evaluation theory (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356389012460439">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1356389012460439-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Even by looking at the highly simplified illustration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1356389012460439">Figure 2</xref>, it becomes apparent that there is a need for a more workable model that can capture the complexity of these variables, particularly in relation to how the measures within the legislation and the Member State choices relate not only to each other but also to the effects.</p>
<p>One of the initial difficulties in using the standard cause-effect model for evaluating legislation is the duality of the EU legislation itself: not only can it be considered an <italic>input</italic> (a resource that the EU puts into the mix), but also as an <italic>output</italic> (an action that requires something to happen). This already creates an overlap and a dilemma as to how to treat the legislative base from the outset.</p>
<p>Another is that EU legislation is implemented by Member States and, other than EU Regulations that are fully binding in nature, each Member State is at liberty to implement the legislation through a choice of measures either stipulated within the legislation as options or of their own volition. While it could be argued that their actions are the results of the EU legislation, it is <italic>not</italic> the role of the European Commission to evaluate the actions of Member States. Yet, their intervention cannot be ignored when evaluating EU legislation and, so, for this reason, Member State action must be considered together with the EU legislation as an <italic>output</italic>.</p>
<p>In this way, the reactions to the combined EU and Member State action can be determined as the <italic>results</italic>. The evaluation will verify whether these are in fact the same as those expected at the time of adoption of the EU legislation and will, quite probably, uncover several unexpected effects, not least because Member State choices will undoubtedly be varied.</p>
<p>Lastly, due to the very nature of legislation, which can have consequences reaching far beyond the initial objectives, the evaluation will have a greater focus on the <italic>impacts</italic>: not only the direct ones, but it must also examine the indirect impacts, and by definition, not only on those groups that the legislation was aimed at, but on others affected inadvertently. As a result, it becomes necessary to expand the standard cause-effect logic and develop a model that would capture the elements specific to legislation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1356389012460439">Figure 3</xref> illustrates how the cause-effect logic used in programme evaluation can be reinterpreted to better reproduce the cause-effect logic for legislation.</p>

<caption>
<p>Modified cause–effect logic to suit EU legislation.</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1356389012460439-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1356389012460439">Figure 3</xref>, the dual role of legislation is now better reflected in terms of the objectives and the measures inherent in legislative instruments. The Member State action, in turn, can significantly affect the successful achievement of the required objectives and the extent of the positive impacts expected, even potentially magnifying the negative impacts. Such potentially quite diverse action is especially the case for Directives and other non-binding instruments, which are by far the most complex to evaluate. While we cannot say we have total control over this ‘output’ as suggested by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1356389012460439">Figure 1</xref>, legislation nevertheless provides certain limitations within which Member State choices are made. Finally, notwithstanding that evaluation of other EU actions (spending programmes included) also examine the full range of impacts, evaluation of legislation – due to its very nature – must focus more on the area of impacts of all kinds.</p>
<p>The development of this modified cause-effect logic for evaluating legislation obviously leads to significant changes in the approach to the design and conducting of the evaluation project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1356389012460439">
<title>Designing evaluation of legislation</title>
<p>Having established that the cause-effect model for evaluating legislation requires an adapted approach, it follows that the evaluation <italic>design</italic> will also need to be adjusted. This mainly involves a variation on some of the tools normally used for designing a high quality evaluation as well as applying other tools normally used within a different context.</p>
<sec id="section7-1356389012460439">
<title>Changes to the Intervention Logic Model</title>
<p>Developing an Intervention Logic Model for EU legislation bearing in mind the modified ‘cause-effect’ logic also requires a slightly different, although not totally alien approach to those developed by evaluation practitioners such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356389012460439">E.J. Davidson (2005)</xref>. The first thing to note is the potential multi-layers that may be required and the dynamism of the Intervention Logic that is much more important here than may be for programme evaluation. This will be particularly relevant for the evaluation of EU Directives and other non-binding instruments where Member States are provided with options or derogations that allow them to choose their preferred method of implementation/action.</p>
<p>In order to keep the intervention logic simple at the design stage, what needs to be plotted is the intended cause-effect links between the aims of the legislation, the options, derogations or measures to attain these aims, the likely results of chosen options and the expected impacts. The measures by Member States, even if known at this stage, should be extracted temporarily from the cause-effect picture and noted alongside any external factors (unexpected causes/effects) and context (the original issue being addressed) that may be known at this point in order to bring the logic back to the basic conception of the legislation. From this, the various assumptions regarding the impacts of the legislation – some of which may have been examined in the Impact Assessment carried out during the proposal stage when considering policy options – can be clearly plotted for the evaluation to test.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1356389012460439">Figure 4</xref>, the grid-style model for the development of an intervention logic that has been designed for evaluation managers within the European Commission provides a simple starting point from which to grasp the complexities of EU legislation in several stages. Interestingly, in practice, while this basic model is constantly consulted in the construction of intervention logics, what is actually produced tends to be more fern-like and free-flowing in structure, reflecting the intricacies of legislation.</p>
<fig id="fig4-1356389012460439" position="float">
<label>Figure 4.</label>
<caption>
<p>A basic model for an intervention logic for legislation.</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1356389012460439-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The idea of the intervention logic as a dynamic tool is to capture at this design stage the maximum impact that each option or measure of the legislation was expected to generate. The original Impact Assessment, if such a document is available, should provide the basis of the expected effects of the retained option, thereby providing a picture against which the expected and actual effects can be measured in the evaluation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1356389012460439">8</xref></sup> In addition, some Impact Assessments may contain scenarios that attempt to establish the magnitude of the effects based on measures the 27 Member States could possibly select, particularly where the instrument is a Recommendation. However, although a form of intervention logic and the evaluation design and/or indicators should ideally be available in the Impact Assessment, in practice this section of the proposal assessment has been somewhat lacking until recently, requiring the reconstruction of the intervention logic in most cases.</p>
<p>As many of the legislative evaluations are likely to pre-date the requirements for an Impact Assessment, a good starting point is to look at the explanatory memorandum, the objectives written in to the legislation itself, or any feasibility, scoping or other ex ante study that may provide similar insight.</p>
<p>However, as Member State Action can be so varied, it would be impossible to map out in the intervention logic how each measure has been implemented without the intervention logic becoming unmanageable. At this design stage, it therefore seems appropriate to extract any known national implementation measures temporarily from the equation, noting them for subsequent analysis. This will allow for an intervention logic that shows the initial expectation of effects at adoption of the legislation. What is desired at this stage is a visual diagram of the intentional logic of the legislation as it was drafted and subsequently adopted.</p>
<p>In the structuring phase of the evaluation, a preliminary analysis of Member State Action through the use of certain tools is advisable (we will return to this point later in the text). The results of the analysis of Member State action can then be inserted into the intervention logic appropriately without over-complicating the visual picture, but rather will allow more complete (and weighted) versions of the logic model to be drawn up. Member State Action, along with the related results, may be identified from implementation reports and similar feedback from Member States allowing further versions of the logic model to be completed as more information (e.g. on unexpected effects and contextual issues, is gathered – perhaps even in the later stages of evaluation). By examining the dynamic intervention logic the evaluation manager can ascertain areas upon which the evaluation design should focus its limited resources. However, it does mean more in-depth preparation for the evaluation is necessary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1356389012460439">
<title>Adapted criteria for evaluation questions</title>
<p>Similarly, the evaluation criteria for traditional evaluation lack the appropriate essence to allow the evaluation to examine the cause-effect relationships of the legislation. Therefore, to test the assumptions of the intervention logic of EU legislation, some of the definitions or focus of six most commonly used categories of evaluation questions (relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, distributional effects, acceptability and consistency) have been reinterpreted to reflect better the requirements for evaluating EU legislation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1356389012460439">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig5-1356389012460439" position="float">

<p>Evaluative criteria reinterpreted in relation to the cause-effect logic for legislation.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1356389012460439-fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>While the basic definitions remain the same as in programme evaluation, what the questions need to look at with respect to the legislation is often slightly different. Each criterion below will show how the focus has been readjusted to suit the evaluation of legislation.</p>
<sec id="section9-1356389012460439">
<title>Relevance</title>
<p><italic>Do the objectives and EU inputs still respond to the needs/problem?</italic></p>
<p>While this criterion doesn’t necessarily change from the standard interpretation of checking whether a programme’s objectives are still pertinent, advances in technological and scientific development, political will, and citizen’s agendas continually influence the policy environment. It may also be the case that industry/business adapts their practices according to market changes and problems that are being addressed by legislation are no longer warranted. In the light of any such changes it is paramount to check whether the problem is still valid or has perhaps evolved. In the EU context this allows policy-makers to determine whether legislation is obsolete and needs repealing or whether adjustments and revisions are required.</p>

<title>Effectiveness</title>
<p><italic>Have the EU legislative measures been appropriate for achieving the desired outcomes? Were they clear, direct and unambiguous, allowing for swift and smooth transposition and implementation?</italic></p>
<p>Here, unlike evaluation of spending programmes in the European Commission, the focus is less on the extent to which objectives have been achieved, but rather on whether the legislative measures have been appropriate and easy to implement or whether the same could have been achieved through other means.</p>
<p>If the EU legislative measures have been appropriate for achieving the objectives and have been presented in a clear, direct and unambiguous manner, then they should be successful in achieving the desired effects. If this is not the case, it may be possible to see how things such as delays and infringements have prevented progress. Equally, Member States may affect the outcome as they can decide to take additional action possibly to address perceived/actual transposition failures or to strengthen measures they feel require extra impetus in their political arena.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1356389012460439">
<title>Efficiency</title>
<p><italic>Has the EU legislation delivered its results without disproportionate costs (e.g. administrative, compliance, transposition)?</italic></p>
<p>Again, while the principle of efficiency remains the same as for programme evaluation of examining the extent to which the desired effects are achieved at a reasonable cost, the resources for spending programmes tends to be a fixed sum. When evaluating legislation, the resources considered are from a different context, vary from Member State to Member State, and in many cases, may even be difficult to gather information on and hard to calculate without the appropriate monitoring exercises in place.</p>
<p>Resources can be broken down into a number of categories: time, staff, transposition cost, enforcement costs, administrative costs, compliance costs, etc. EU legislative (or national) measures that introduce disproportionate burdens or complexity in relation to the problem they are trying to address are poor performers in terms of efficiency. This is of particular interest in the current climate of better regulation, reducing administrative cost/burden and simplification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1356389012460439">
<title>Distributional effects</title>
<p><italic>How have the benefits and costs been spread across different groups, sectors, regions?</italic></p>
<p>Whenever this criterion is used in programme evaluation the focus tends to be on assessing the extent to which positive and negative effects have been maximized or minimized, often with the main consideration being to assess the distribution of the positive effects across the beneficiaries. Since legislation is never a win/win situation, with every change meaning a shift in welfare, the focus shifts to understanding exactly who has been affected positively and negatively by the legislation and why.</p>
<p>The evaluation should explore how the benefits (and costs) of the legislation have been distributed across multiple groups, for example: winners versus losers; large business versus SMEs; business versus consumer; business versus employee; business versus environment; incumbents versus new entrants; between sectors; between government levels; between geographical regions, etc. Some distributional effects will be deliberate. However, in addressing a problematic issue for one set of target groups it is quite possible that an intervention may have an unintentional effect on other groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1356389012460439">
<title>Acceptability</title>
<p><italic>How well did the stakeholders receive the EU legislation and its effects (including any additional national measures) as a result of its implementation?</italic></p>
<p>This criterion is not especially important for programme evaluation per se, in that assessing whether stakeholders accept the policy in general quite often tends to be a positive where funding is involved. Although it may be raised more whenever new programmes are introduced, when it comes to evaluating legislation acceptability takes on extra importance.</p>
<p>With legislation affecting the majority of citizens across the EU and in a variety of political arenas, the question of acceptability contributes to the resistance by Member State administrations to implement legislation in the desired manner or may result in numerous complaints.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1356389012460439">
<title>Consistency</title>
<p><italic>Are the actual impacts still in line with wider Commission policy objectives?</italic></p>
<p>Similarly, consistency maintains the same definition as for EU spending programme evaluation of looking into the positive and negative spill-over effects into economic, social or environmental policy areas, but again these are particularly important with regard to legislation.</p>
<p>Legislative instruments inevitably are interlinked with a variety of other instruments and policy strategies and, therefore,it is vital to examine how the positive and negative effects of a particular instrument contribute to the wider Commission policy aims and other policy fields. Evaluation of legislation is predominantly formative evaluation and any findings on the issue of consistency may possibly contribute to simplification, administrative burden reduction or at the very least better synergies between policy fields.</p>
<p>An additional question of <bold>EU added-value</bold> may also be pertinent, depending on the assessment of how effective legislation has been:</p>
<p><italic>Was addressing the issue at EU level the most appropriate?</italic></p>
<p>This question is often added in programme evaluation as a matter of justifying EU budgetary intervention, and although this may seem obvious for EU legislation, it may be examined in particular where the legislative instrument being evaluated is potentially outdated.</p>
<p>If there was an Impact Assessment accompanying the original proposal, this should have concluded that EU action was <italic>expected</italic> to be necessary. The evaluation may wish to consider if this expectation was justified, or whether other means of achieving the same (or better) outcomes were actually feasible.</p>
<p>As with any evaluation, but particularly given the complex nature of evaluating legislation and the scarce resources available, there is a real need to focus on the issues of most benefit to future policy development where evidence-based findings are required for decision-making. The combination of a dynamic intervention logic and these adjusted evaluation criteria should provide the evaluator with the necessary approach to identify significant and pertinent questions that permit more than a superficial analysis of what has happened and why.</p>
<p>The drawback is the temptation to either oversimplify the intervention logic that distorts the cause-effect to such a degree as to be potentially useless and the difficulty in devising questions that can adequately direct the research in the desired areas without narrowing the scope of the evaluation beyond use.</p>
<p>Indeed, much more effort at the design stage is required in comparison to programme evaluation. In Directorate General Internal Market, this stage is conducted on the basis of several workshops between the legislative team and the evaluation team in an attempt to ensure an appropriate design that will cut through the complexity of legislation without losing its formative value.</p>

<sec id="section15-1356389012460439">
<title>Conducting an evaluation of legislation</title>
<p>For the most part, conducting an evaluation of legislation is the same as any other programme or large project evaluation: desk research, data gathering, validating information, in-depth analysis and drawing conclusions. It should still be divided into four key phases: structuring, data collecting, analysing and validating findings, and concluding. However, for the structuring phase, a thorough preliminary understanding of how Member States implemented legislation, extenuating factors that affected results and the direct and indirect impacts (along with other basic information mainly obtained through desk research) is necessary for a more complete overview of the multi-dimensional interactions that make legislation complex to evaluate. Equally, due to the cyclical nature of evaluation within the European Commission context, the concluding phase should ensure that there is adequate analysis of findings with which to inform any future impact assessment that must accompany any proposal to amend, review or introduce legislation.</p>
<sec id="section16-1356389012460439">
<title>Reconsidering the appropriate use of existing evaluation tools</title>
<p>Executing the structuring phase well is particularly important when evaluating legislation, where there are so many different aspects to consider. Building on the adapted intervention logic model, there are some tools that can be recommended to help provide a comprehensive picture of those aspects that would otherwise complicate the intervention logic, such as Member State action. This would, furthermore, allow for identification of areas that may require more clarification.</p>
<p>As with any evaluation at EU level, it is impractical to consider analysing the situation in each of the 27 Member States. The analysis may also need to focus on specific elements or issues identified as of particular importance. Inevitably, selective representative analyses for extrapolation are required. In the European Commission, programme evaluation has generally used this method of selecting a number of ‘representative’ Member States and subsequently tried to extrapolate the results to other countries. Such choices were often made intuitively without examining in detail any particular issues that could be further examined. While this may work well for specifically defined measures such as programmes, there are too many interlinked factors in legislative measures to make this a reliable method from which to extrapolate findings. Due to the complexity of the varied political landscape of the EU in terms of legislation, identifying key aspects on which to focus uniquely from the intervention logic is also not so obvious. This suggests that before specific evaluation questions can be properly formulated, some preliminary analysis is required based on the intervention logic that has been drawn up.</p>
<p>To help select areas where the evaluation may focus its enquiry, tools generally used in other contexts may be considered for use here. For example, Stakeholder Consultation, Concept/Issue Mapping and Social Network Analysis can provide an alternative perspective of the intervention logic and can be used to capture the multi-dimensional aspects of legislation, drawing out strands that may be worth closer inspection, rather than simply focusing in-depth enquiry on a particular geographic or demographic selection and extrapolating it, perhaps erroneously, to the wider world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1356389012460439">9</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section17-1356389012460439">
<title>Stakeholder consultation</title>
<p>Stakeholders, particularly those in the public domain, can play an important role throughout the evaluation and are often involved in the familiar tools of surveys, interviews, focus groups and case studies. While in programme evaluation the stakeholder base may be narrowed to beneficiaries and other involved groups, the stakeholder base for legislation is often much broader and can often be impossible to narrow down. In programme evaluation, stakeholders have usually been called upon in the stages of fact finding, data verification and bridging gaps in data sources. At the early stages of an evaluation of legislation, however, it can be very important to obtain stakeholders’ perspectives and insights as to how the legislative measures have been implemented. The European Commission already has detailed guidance and minimum standards for undertaking stakeholder consultations, along with a number of web-based tools to assist with questionnaires and other consultation methods that are already a key component in the Impact Assessment process for new legislative proposals. It makes sense, therefore, to make broader use of this tool to help obtain a consensus of key issues and an understanding of how various factors have influenced progress toward success (or not). Nevertheless, this necessarily becomes a larger exercise that may take place several times with a different objective throughout an evaluation of legislation, highlighting the importance of this tool as a key mechanism for such projects.</p>
<p>That said, despite the in-depth explicit guidelines developed at the European Commission for using this tool, caution must be exercised with regard to the development of the survey questions and more importantly with the analysis of the responses that will contain qualitative information that may be difficult to assess. In addition, experience has shown that evaluators must be attentive to intended acts of bias that stakeholder groups occasionally initiate in survey responses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1356389012460439">
<title>Concept/issue mapping</title>
<p>By establishing similarities/differences between entities, concept/issue mapping is a fairly straight-forward technique that involves clustering similar topics together and rating each cluster according to its perceived importance. This can be particularly helpful when the design of the legislation is complex. Normally used in brainstorming sessions, the tool is already quite well-known. It is a fairly straight-forward technique that involves clustering similar topics together and rating each cluster according to its perceived importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356389012460439">Trochim, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This tool is particularly useful when applied to analysing stakeholder consultation responses and for identifying major/minor direct and indirect, positive and negative impacts, which can help focus the evaluation on specific areas relevant to the evaluation purpose.</p>
<p>The practical application of this tool can usefully also be applied in the early stages of evaluating legislation, particularly for constructing the intervention logic, where it can help with identifying clusters of impacts, groups and outcomes for a variety of elements within a common type, such as of Member State action or impacts relating to cross-border activity or similar styles of administrative cooperation. While there are a variety of methods for concept mapping, for evaluating legislation this is done using a six step approach based on Trochim’s research methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356389012460439">Trochim, 1989</xref>):</p>
<list id="list5-1356389012460439" list-type="bullet">

<list-item><p>Step 5: Translating the matrix into a ‘point map’ to select the clusters of impacts;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Step 6: Rating impacts and calculating average scores for clusters.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In Step 1 an exhaustive list of possible impacts, relevant issues, etc. and their associated ratings of importance (where asked for) can be established from the stakeholder consultation analysis. This highlights the importance of formulating questions to retrieve informative and evaluative information through a mix of closed and open-ended questions in the Stakeholder Consultation or similar survey techniques. There is the likelihood that this list may contain hundreds of responses, which should be numbered into a list following some simple amalgamation of the most obvious similar replies.</p>
<p>The next step involves proactive input from the evaluation team, and/or in the European Commission context also potentially the Steering Group, if there is one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1356389012460439">10</xref></sup> Each team member assesses and groups the list into themes or categories that s/he feels belong together and hence ‘clustering’ the list into a few more manageable groups. These clusters are not pre-determined themes, but rather should be left to each team member to interpret in their own manner. This results in a different set of groupings for each team member, which may or may not be alike.</p>
<p>Each of these groupings should then be plotted into individual similarity matrices using a binary representation depicting the connection between each of the impacts/issues within the various clusters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1356389012460439">Figure 6</xref>). There should be one for each team member that may be different (or not) depending on how they individually interpreted the clusters and the similarity of the impacts/issues.</p>
<fig id="fig6-1356389012460439" position="float">

</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1356389012460439-fig6.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Next, the individual similarity matrices should now be condensed into a single matrix to establish the team’s view of the common/related elements in the long list. This is done in the same manner only this time using the actual number of times two impacts/issues were placed together by team members (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1356389012460439">Figure 7</xref>). As some responses may fall into potentially different groups, this should lead to a discussion of the various categorizations by the evaluation team to find a consensus on ambiguous issues.</p>
<fig id="fig7-1356389012460439" position="float">
<label>Figure 7.</label>
<caption>
<p>Example of a ‘group similarity matrix’ – reflects views of a 3 person evaluation team.</p>
<p><italic>Note</italic>: the matrix is symmetrical along the diagonal, so the row total for a given impact will always equal the column total for the same impact. The maximum number in a given cell is equal to the number of evaluators in the team. Individual row/column totals are unlikely to be equal as they reflect the team’s opinion of which impacts can be grouped together.</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1356389012460439-fig7.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>This matrix should then be plotted in a point map by placing each issue close to those it was matched up with by using an appropriate radial (e.g. 1 cm for the maximum points; larger cm distance for minimum scoring). The larger the number in the matrix the closer these impacts should be to each other reflecting the fact that they were placed together more frequently. This should help to establish clusters of points that can be labelled with a common theme (similarity).</p>
<p>In order to establish a list of areas/issues by importance if additional focus is needed, this cluster map may be further enhanced by using the rating – if it has been requested during the stakeholder consultation, for example – to analyse the magnitude that has been attributed by your data sources to the particular impact/issue. This is done by attributing the rating set for each item in the list and plotting it within the cluster map (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1356389012460439">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1356389012460439-fig8.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>It is now possible to calculate the average rating scores given to each cluster (e.g. Market = 5 + 5 + 4/3 = 4.67) to establish the perceived importance of each grouping. By using the label/theme in the logic model, it should be possible to establish a clearer view of the more important strands that allow for a more focused examination. In this way a global spectrum of issues can be grouped under useful ‘headings’ or ‘topics’, enabling a complex picture to be reduced cohesively into a set of coherent and manageable groupings.</p>
<p>Care needs to be taken though not to dismiss lower rating issues too quickly, as what may be perceived as less important by Stakeholders overall may, however, have a significant impact despite its relatively innocuous nature. The need to ascertain how likely this may be calls for a tool that can help assess this. The European Commission suggests that Social Network Analysis may be usefully applied to this task.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1356389012460439">
<title>Social Network Analysis</title>
<p>A still relatively new tool employed generally for evaluations where social interactions play a significant part such as in Development and Humanitarian Aid programmes, Social Network Analysis has been strongly promoted by evaluators such as Rick Davies<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1356389012460439">11</xref></sup> working predominantly in this field. This tool can be particularly effective in understanding complex cause-effect of the intervention logic when applied to evaluating legislation. It can help identify and rate the causal links establishing a better understanding of their nature and the consequence of their interaction by expanding on the logic models and the outcome of the mapping techniques.</p>
<p>The most obvious role for this tool is how it can help clarify the links between Member State action and the wide ranging impacts, positive and negative, on various groups, in effect, almost creating a 3-dimensional view of this for the intervention logic. As previously stated, the European Commission is not concerned with evaluating Member State action per se and this tool provides the evaluator with a technique for assessing Member State action more anonymously, i.e. without the need to associate a particular Member State with a specific action or set of outcomes. Similarly, this tool may be helpful when making subsequent choice of case studies or decisions on where to focus further in-depth enquiry easier.</p>

<sec id="section20-1356389012460439">
<title>Practical usage of Social Network Analysis in evaluating legislation</title>
<p>One of the major complexities in evaluating legislation is that the relationship between the measures of EU legislation and the results they anticipated can often be significantly altered by the manner in which Member States decided to implement them.</p>
<p>It is important to understand <italic>how</italic> Member State action can deflect the cause-effect arrow – but this needs to be done in a ‘manageable’ way. If this were to be included in the Intervention Logic directly, it would no longer be possible to follow the logic as the model would be confused by all the different actions (boxes and arrows!) of 27 Member States for each measure.</p>
<p>Clustering the type of Member State action – for example, into four thematic areas of transposed, not transposed, gold-plating, and use of derogation – can help make the intervention logic more manageable, but the diagram still remains superficial in terms of the evaluative information it provides. However, analysing the relationship arrows can provide you with a more informative picture against which strands worth focusing further investigation can be identified.</p>
<p>In essence, by plotting a matrix of measures by 27 Member States using the clusters (identified in the concept mapping, especially if the issue of gold-plating is also broken down further into common clusters), it is then possible to map out the strength of the relationship between the measure and the MS action. A matrix that cross-references <bold>Member State × Measure × Implementation</bold> should provide a better understanding of <italic>how</italic> particular measures have been implemented or gold-plated and the effect on the anticipated results. It may also confirm which strands may be a good source for a case study comparison. The information for this type of analysis is expected to be available either in Implementation Reports or if not, may have to be attained through a targeted preliminary consultation/questionnaire.</p>
<p>The matrix can be transformed into a visual graph by interpreting the relationship between Measure and Implementation as denoted by the number of Member States that acted in that way. This is done by taking the implementation typology and making a link to the measures for every Member State that has applied it, producing thicker lines that can then subsequently be distinguished by colour or pattern (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1356389012460439">Figure 10</xref>).</p>

</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1356389012460439-fig11.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>It is now possible to see obvious results of which measures were implemented in a given way, for example, mainly gold-plated or transposed, without losing the context of the other transposition/implementation behaviour.</p>
<p>If this information is now transferred back to the intervention logic, the logic starts to take on a 3-dimensional picture, where the specific threads become more readily identifiable and the additional elements can be also considered. This is done by applying the main patterns (or weightings) to the relevant part of the intervention logic, for example, the element relating to Member State action that was initially extracted to facilitate building a workable representation, can now be reintroduced without complicating the flow of cause-effect. In other words, the arrows linking the measures to the results can now be depicted with the outcome of the network analysis of Member State action.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the example above, it is now visually clear that measures B, C and D have been gold-plated (added to) by the majority of Member States. It may be worth exploring not only what type of gold-plating, but more importantly to what extent it is the add-on by Member States that has contributed to the impact achieved. It is imperative, however, that evaluators of legislation recognize that these are preliminary findings and more investigation is necessary to unearth the extent of the legislation’s true effects.</p>
<p>Besides being an excellent aide for structuring interview guides, wider surveys, etc. and helping focus data collection on key issues, this technique can also be used to explore other relationship links across the intervention logic where a better understanding of the complex interlinking of elements is required; principally, for example, in the analysis of positive and negative impacts on a variety of target groups.</p>
<sec id="section21-1356389012460439">
<title>SWOT Analysis</title>
<p>Although assessing the <bold>S</bold>trengths, <bold>W</bold>eaknesses, <bold>O</bold>pportunities, <bold>T</bold>hreats (SWOT analysis) of a given situation and relating them to the desired objectives is a tool generally associated with the structuring phase of prospective evaluation, in evaluating legislation it is more usefully applied in the concluding phase. Despite the retrospective nature of evaluating legislation, in this way, it can build on the findings and provide pertinent information for use in any future impact assessment. In the European Commission context a SWOT analysis is an obvious tool to use if the evaluation being conducted precedes a review, which will need an impact assessment to accompany any proposal for changes to the legislation.</p>
<p>In other words, by applying the SWOT analysis in the concluding phase of an evaluation of legislation, a bridge is made between the evaluation and the impact assessment, the latter focusing on the impact of the future proposal. In this way, the policy cycle is closed and the evaluation of legislation contributes constructively to Better Regulation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As can be seen, in providing guidance specifically for evaluating EU legislation there has been no reinventing the wheel, but rather an approach that builds on already well-established evaluation practice that requires an adjustment of perspective to accommodate the peculiarities of legislation. By establishing what makes evaluating EU legislation so complex, the key changes made relate to altering existing definitions and applying certain readily available tools in a different context that mean evaluating legislation can now be tackled more confidently and consistently.</p>
<p>Possibly the key issue of complexity in evaluating EU legislation is the behavioural focus of policy, not only from the involvement of multiple actors who often interpret elaborate legislation differently, but that the target beneficiaries of policy are also susceptible to behavioural differences related to cultural diversity. As emphasized above, it is not the role of the European Commission to evaluate or judge Member State action, but reactions and interactions with policy cannot be ignored. Inevitably, this calls for a more qualitative style of assessment than most EU funding programme evaluations rely on. Indeed, as touched upon above, the testing of the behavioural assumptions drawn in Impact Assessment of policies introduced since 2000 is to be further enhanced as per the promise of the current European Commission executive in its commitment to strengthening the evaluation process across all its activities.</p>
<p>As with all new approaches, while the initial reception by colleagues within the Directorate General for Internal Market and Services, across the European Commission generally and even some of our peers outside the institution has been promising, changes in practice will be refined as the approach is tested and better use of techniques are uncovered. Nevertheless, as this approach is taken forward over the coming years, it is hoped that evaluating EU legislation will become an established and if not easy, at least easier, discipline, contributing directly to the successful design and delivery of EU policy.</p>

<p>Since many Member States may have taken preparatory action in the period between when the ‘baseline’ was established in the Impact Assessment and prior to actual adoption, evaluating legislation needs to use a more stable starting point than the ‘baseline’.
