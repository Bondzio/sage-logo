<sec id="section1-0363546513482884">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>There is high interest but very little evidence to support labral reconstruction of the hip.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513482884">
<title>Purpose/Hypothesis:</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical effectiveness of arthroscopic hip labral reconstruction using gracilis autograft in the multistep surgeries for femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). The hypothesis was that patients undergoing arthroscopic hip labral reconstruction with gracilis autograft would have improvement in symptoms and function attributable to this procedure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513482884">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513482884">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A comparative retrospective review at a large medical facility was performed of patients who underwent labral reconstruction with a gracilis autograft (RECON group) and those who underwent labral refixation (REFIX group) between October 2008 and November 2009. Inclusion criteria were adult patients having undergone arthroscopic surgery for symptomatic cam-pincer FAI without advanced radiographic osteoarthritis, who had both acetabular and femoral osteoplasties with a minimum 2-year follow-up. Patient satisfaction and preoperative and postoperative nonarthritic hip scores (NAHS) were obtained. Predictive modeling, linear regression, and a nested case-control study were performed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513482884">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>A total of 54 patients met the inclusion criteria. The RECON group (n = 8; mean age, 34.6 years; range, 18-58 years) with an average 30-month follow-up (range, 24-37 months) and 100% participation reported a high level of patient satisfaction (7 high, 1 moderate). The mean NAHS improved by 50.5 points (<italic>P</italic> = .008) in the RECON group and 22.5 points (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) in the REFIX group; however, the preoperative NAHS was lower (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) in the RECON group than in the REFIX group. Only the surgery group (RECON vs REFIX) and the preoperative NAHS were significantly associated with the NAHS at follow-up. The predictive model and linear regression revealed a 15.0- and 14.6-point increase, respectively, in the postoperative NAHS in the RECON group compared with the REFIX group. There were no major complications, revision surgeries, or conversion arthroplasties after labral reconstruction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546513482884">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Arthroscopic hip labral reconstruction with gracilis tendon autograft is a safe and effective procedure. Patients undergoing labral reconstruction may not necessarily have outcomes inferior to those of patients undergoing labral refixation despite more severe initial labral insufficiency.</p>

<p>There has been a recent trend toward labral preservation in the hip.

<p>There is high interest but little evidence to support labral reconstruction of the hip. Despite the rapid growth of hip arthroscopic surgery and hip preservation in the surgical literature, the literature on labral reconstruction is limited to 2 open<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513482884">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513482884">23</xref></sup> and 1 arthroscopic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482884">19</xref></sup> surgical outcome studies. These studies demonstrated short-term clinical benefit but were uncontrolled case series that did not determine the contribution of the labral reconstructive procedure to outcomes as part of multistep surgeries; correction of the associated skeletal deformities via osteoplasties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482884">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513482884">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513482884">23</xref></sup> or reverse periacetabular osteotomies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513482884">23</xref></sup> may have contributed to some or all of the observed clinical improvement.</p>
<p>Since the development of the iliotibial band autograft technique in 2005, there have been several alternative grafts introduced, including the gracilis tendon autograft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513482884">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513482884">15</xref></sup> Arthroscopic hip labral reconstruction with the gracilis tendon offers potential benefits of a homogeneous autograft requiring no postharvest structural alteration and graft harvest from the knee familiar to many surgeons. External graft suturing and intra-articular insertion of the fully prepared graft construct encourage a surgeon-friendly approach to an inherently challenging arthroscopic procedure. Suture anchor systems that permit intentional seating of the terminal ends into their respective drill holes allow graft tensioning, theoretical osteointegration, and flexibility in graft length. By overlapping the terminal graft ends in intimate relation to the capsular side of the native labral margins, a combination of graft tensioning and buttressing effect may conceptually restore a fluid seal not only at the graft intercalary section but also, by compression, at the graft–native labrum junctions. Moreover, the larger adjacent semitendinosus tendon is an available option if a larger labral graft is desired.</p>
<p>We present our experience and early outcomes using gracilis autograft as an alternative graft source for arthroscopic hip labral reconstruction. With a preponderance of labral lesions occurring in the setting of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513482884">24</xref></sup> we chose to investigate this diagnostic category and further chose to focus on the most common mixed cam-pincer subtype to minimize confounding. We compared outcomes of labral reconstruction versus labral refixation in cohorts undergoing otherwise similar osteoplastic procedures to gain insight into the contribution of labral reconstruction in the multistep surgeries in which it is typically employed. We hypothesized that patients undergoing arthroscopic hip labral reconstruction with gracilis autograft would have improvement in symptoms and function.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>After institutional review board authorization was obtained, and after consultation with our lead statistician (R.J.B.), we performed a retrospective review of our initial patients who underwent arthroscopic hip labral reconstruction during the study period of October 2008 to November 2009 with gracilis autograft (RECON group) and those who underwent labral refixation (REFIX group) with concurrent study periods and similar lengths of follow-up (2-year minimum). Inclusion criteria for the study and control groups were adult patients (&gt;18 years of age) with symptomatic mixed cam-pincer FAI without significant osteoarthritis (Tönnis grade 0 or 1), who (1) had arthroscopic surgery including acetabuloplasty and femoroplasty plus either labral reconstruction or labral refixation by the same surgeon (D.K.M.), (2) underwent similar postoperative rehabilitation protocols, and (3) completed self-assessed preoperative and minimum 24-month postoperative nonarthritic hip scores (NAHS) at final follow-up. All patients were asked (1) if they were highly satisfied, satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied, or highly dissatisfied with the surgical outcome; (2) if they experienced any complications including any specific to the knee; and (3) how long they had experienced postoperative knee pain at the autograft harvest site. Information on complications, revision surgery, and conversion or scheduled conversion to resurfacing or total hip arthroplasty (THA) was extracted from an electronic medical record review.</p>
<p>A total of 54 patients met our study inclusion criteria: 8 patients (8 hips) in the RECON group and 46 patients (46 hips) in the REFIX group. The RECON cohort had 1 female and 7 male patients with a mean age of 34.6 years (range, 18-58 years) and average follow-up of 30 months (range, 24-37 months). Five patients had no radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis (Tönnis grade 0), and 3 (38%) had Tönnis grade 1 radiographic osteoarthritic changes (ie, mild). One patient had protrusio acetabuli, whereas the others had either coxa profunda (n = 5) or acetabular retroversion (n = 3), with 1 hip having both. Two patients underwent bilateral single-staged FAI, 1 of whom had previous labral debridements. The REFIX cohort consisted of 46 patients with a mean age of 37.5 years (range, 18-73 years), of which 54% were male and 15% exhibited Tönnis grade 1 osteoarthritic changes.</p>
<p>Both groups underwent statistical analysis to detect the effect on the postoperative NAHS from the preoperative NAHS and other covariates, including surgery group (RECON or REFIX), as well as to predict the expected postoperative NAHS from the preoperative NAHS and other covariates in the REFIX-only group. A linear regression equation was developed using backward elimination for the postoperative NAHS on the combined groups starting with the following variables: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Tönnis grade, intraoperative Outerbridge score, surgery group, and preoperative NAHS. In addition, a prediction model for the postoperative NAHS was developed, maximizing adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> based only on the REFIX group and starting with the same variables as before (except for surgery group). This regression equation was used to predict expected outcomes for the reconstruction group if it in fact consisted of refixation patients. The difference between what was observed and what was expected was compared pairwise for the reconstruction group. Furthermore, a one-to-one matched, nested case-control study was made between the RECON and REFIX groups by selecting cases from the REFIX group that were the closest match to those in the RECON group based on age and initial NAHS. For each case, the control that had the least sum of squared difference in age and squared difference in preoperative NAHS was selected. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for the one-to-one matched comparisons to examine the improvement of patients compared to themselves within each group, and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare results between groups. Statistical significance for the comparisons was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 utilizing SAS 9.2 (Cary, North Carolina).</p>

<title>Surgical Procedure</title>
<p>Dual-portal hip arthroscopic surgery in the supine position was performed. The anterolateral portal was used for viewing with a 70° arthroscope; the modified midanterior portal (MMAP) was the working portal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513482884">15</xref></sup> Once it was determined that the labrum was nonsalvageable because of a severe deficiency in quantity (eg, segmental loss) and/or quality (eg, labral ossification), the acetabular rim was prepared by rim trimming any acetabular overhang and resection of pathological labral tissue (eg, unstable, severely attenuated, and/or ossified) to stable margins. A resultant defect of 2 cm was typical (as measured with a calibrated arthroscopic probe) in our labrum-reconstructed cohort. Predrilling of all anchor sites at 8- to 10-mm intervals was then performed with intentional overlap of the terminal graft fixation sites so as to provide intimate contact with stable labral tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513482884">Figure 1</xref>). The ipsilateral gracilis tendon was harvested via a small vertical knee incision medial and distal to the tibial tubercle using a technique familiar to many surgeons. A graft approximately 2 cm longer than the length of the labral deficiency was harvested. Graft preparation was performed on a sterile table by securing whipstitches of No. 2 nonabsorbable sutures to each graft end with intercalary simple midsubstance stitches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513482884">Figure 2</xref>). Labeling of each set of sutures or using different colored sutures aided suture management.</p>

<p>The fully prepared graft construct was passed into the hip via an 8.25-mm arthroscopic cannula in the MMAP. The leading terminal sutures were “pulled” into the hip with the knotless suture anchor insertion instrument (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513482884">Figure 3</xref>). Beginning with the anchor site furthest from the arthroscopic lens (typically anteroinferior) so as to minimize arthroscopic obstruction, the leading graft end was partially inserted into a 3.2-mm drill hole with the suture anchor inserter, followed by deployment of the 3.5-mm anchor with an interference fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546513482884">Figure 4</xref>). Seating of the gracilis tendon sometimes required gentle expansion of the drilled entrance with a blunt arthroscopic obturator tip. The middle suture anchors then secured the graft along the acetabular rim. The “tail” end of the gracilis graft was inserted into the final anchor site located in an overlapped position with its labral margin. Graft tensioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513482884">15</xref></sup> occurred during this step with apposition of the arced tendon against the femoral head, followed by deployment of the final knotless suture anchor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546513482884">Figure 5</xref>). The buttress effect of tensioned labral graft tissue at the sites overlapping the native labral margins facilitated a junctional fluid seal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0363546513482884">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0363546513482884">7</xref>). The goal was a labral construct with some capsular-side overlap adjacent to the stable native labral margins, re-creating an immediate fluid seal without any end-to-end gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0363546513482884">Figure 8</xref>). Arthroscopic femoroplasty was performed to eradicate cam impingement, which can cause ongoing symptoms/degeneration and early mechanical failure of the reconstructed labrum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513482884">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513482884">15</xref></sup> Arthroscopic dynamic testing was performed with terminal range end points of hip motion including flexion of 120° and flexed hip internal rotation of 30° (see the online Video Supplement summarizing this technique).</p>

<p>There were no major postoperative complications (eg, femoral neck fractures, osteonecrosis, deep infections, pulmonary embolism, abdominal compartment syndrome) as defined by Clohisy et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513482884">4</xref></sup> or Matsuda et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513482884">17</xref></sup> Two patients with labral reconstruction had transient neurapraxias of the pudendal nerve that resolved completely by 3 months, of which 1 with protrusio acetabuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513482884">16</xref></sup> had a more challenging hip distraction and the other had single-stage bilateral surgeries. There were no sciatic, femoral, or lateral femoral cutaneous neurapraxias. Patients reported an average 2.4 weeks of incisional knee pain (range, 1-3 weeks) without residual complaints of pain, weakness, or knee functional deficit. There were no revision surgeries or conversions or scheduled conversions to resurfacing hip arthroplasty or THA.</p>
<p>Linear regression of the postoperative NAHS at follow-up showed that the RECON group was associated with a 14.6-point increase in the postoperative NAHS at follow-up (<italic>P</italic> = .02). Comparison of the actual postoperative NAHS in the RECON group (n = 8) with the predictive equation for the postoperative NAHS (built on the REFIX group) for the RECON group showed a 15.0-point increase (<italic>P</italic> = .02) in the postoperative NAHS in the RECON group compared with what would have been expected in our study cohort.</p>
<p>In a one-to-one matched comparison, there were no duplicate patients. The maximum difference in age was 5.2 years, the maximum difference in BMI was 11.3, and the maximum difference in the preoperative NAHS was 6 points. Despite these differences, graphical as well as univariate and multivariate statistical analyses revealed no statistically significant differences between the RECON and REFIX groups on these variables in our study cohort. The matched analysis revealed that while the RECON group had on average 13.25 more points on the NAHS than the REFIX group, this did not reach statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = .11, Wilcoxon signed-rank test).</p>
<p>Those who underwent labral reconstruction tended to be younger overweight male patients with a lower preoperative NAHS who also had mild osteoarthritis. Overall, the logistic regression results could correctly classify 89% of our cases, supporting the utility of further one-to-one matching performed to assess the effects in comparable populations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is only the fourth outcome study on hip labral reconstruction. It is the first study to investigate outcomes using the gracilis tendon as an alternative graft source, has the longest minimum follow-up to date, and is the first comparative study. An initial published study included 5 patients with open labral reconstruction using a harvested ligamentum teres.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482884">19</xref></sup> The authors stated that this structure was ruptured during open surgical dislocation and, when harvested, typically required an incision to unfold and lengthen the relatively short autograft to span a labral defect and even then might be insufficient. The short follow-up (minimum, 5 months) limited conclusions. A recent study from the same institution included 19 patients (20 hips) who had labral reconstruction during open surgical dislocation with either a ligamentum teres or fascia lata autograft (numbers not specified) with minimum 12-month outcomes but had diverse FAI subtypes and diverse procedures including concurrent reverse periacetabular osteotomies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513482884">23</xref></sup> Three patients underwent conversions to THA, and of the 17 remaining hips, 15 had subjective improvement in pain and function. However, the authors stated that the clinical benefits were likely derived from the correction of underlying structural deformities and could not discern if benefit was derived from the labral reconstructive procedure. A larger study with a minimum 12-month follow-up showed a significant clinical improvement and high patient satisfaction with arthroscopic labral reconstruction using a tubularized iliotibial band autograft harvested from an ipsilateral hip incision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482884">19</xref></sup> A mean 23-point improvement in the modified Harris Hip Score was reported, excluding 4 patients (9%) who underwent conversions to THA.</p>
<p>Our desire to gain insight into the effectiveness of labral reconstruction in the multistep surgeries in which it is typically employed required a comparison group. We chose to compare outcomes from labral reconstruction with those of labral refixation. Although comparison with a similarly matched cohort that underwent labral resection would theoretically produce an ideal control group, an ethical conflict prevented this. With our current understanding of the functional importance of acetabular labral function,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513482884">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513482884">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513482884">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513482884">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513482884">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482884">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513482884">22</xref></sup> we very rarely perform labral resection and, if so, only in older patients with significantly more osteoarthritis (the antithesis of our labral reconstruction patients), which would yield a very different subset of patients, preventing valid comparisons. Indeed, patients with significant osteoarthritis (eg, &lt;2-mm remaining joint width) are typically not candidates for hip arthroscopic surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513482884">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482884">19</xref></sup> Moreover, no patient has yet refused to undergo labral reconstruction if deemed indicated, precluding nonrandomized controls. Hence, we compared the outcomes of labral reconstruction with labral refixation, a gold-standard treatment of labral tears in the setting of FAI,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513482884">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513482884">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513482884">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513482884">20</xref></sup> to investigate the relative efficacy when controlled for variables such as acetabular and femoral osteoplasties.</p>
<p>Patients who underwent labral reconstruction had a lower preoperative NAHS and a higher postoperative NAHS. The lower preoperative scores were statistically significant and may be reflective of more severe labral insufficiency relative to those patients with reparable labrae.</p>
<p>The difference in the postoperative NAHS between cohorts reached statistical significance in the linear regression analysis and in the predictive model comparisons but not the one-to-one matched comparison. These findings are not in conflict. While the latter requires a larger sample size to confirm or refute statistical significance in this regard, the magnitudes of effects are comparable. We acknowledge that the quantitative measure of this effect in our study cohort is at best suggestive, and the absolute contribution of acetabular and femoral osteoplasties to clinical outcome has not been established. However, both statistical methods demonstrated that the RECON cohort had outcomes at least as good as the REFIX cohort, supporting a qualitative contributory effect from labral reconstruction with gracilis autograft. Furthermore, our findings suggest that patients undergoing labral reconstruction may not necessarily have poorer outcomes than those undergoing labral refixation despite more severe labral insufficiency.</p>
<p>Despite our findings, we do not recommend labral reconstruction when the hip is treatable with refixation. A possible explanation for our findings is the resection of painful pathological labral tissue with associated nociceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513482884">8</xref></sup> and replacement with a denervated gracilis tendon. Moreover, some alternatives to labral reconstruction exist. Encouraging early outcomes have been reported with arthroscopic labralization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513482884">14</xref></sup> in which undermined articular cartilage during rim trimming is carefully retained as a pseudolabrum. Abrams et al (unpublished data) demonstrated labral reconstitution in the form of a neolabrum after segmental resection. However, we observed no evidence of this in 1 patient more than 1 year after previous superior labral resection. She underwent ipsilateral labral reconstruction and contralateral labral refixation, reporting a higher NAHS for the former procedure. Her 2-year postoperative magnetic resonance arthrogram shows the labral graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0363546513482884">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

<p>Our current indication for acetabular labral reconstruction is an active young patient with a nonsalvageable or irreparable labrum in a hip without significant arthrosis by radiographic and/or intraoperative evaluation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513482884">14</xref></sup> Interestingly, our 50- and 58-year-old patients, both with Tönnis grade 1 osteoarthritis, had excellent short-term clinical outcomes. There were no conversions or scheduled conversions to total or resurfacing arthroplasties, although patient selection may have contributed, as we did not perform these procedures on patients with a &lt;2-mm joint width. In another series, 3 patients (15%) who had open labral reconstruction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513482884">23</xref></sup> underwent conversion to THA; however, 2 were noted to have had significant intraoperative degenerative changes. Four patients (9%) who had arthroscopic labral reconstruction with an iliotibial band<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482884">19</xref></sup> underwent conversion to THA, of which 3 had preoperative joint narrowing &lt;2 mm, which has been shown to portend poorer outcomes after arthroscopic hip surgery in general.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513482884">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513482884">20</xref></sup> None of our labrum-reconstructed patients had this degree of osteoarthritis. Hence, the adjusted outcomes are more uniformly successful in this regard. Moreover, 14 of 20 hips required reoperation for either hardware removal or lysis of adhesions after open labral reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513482884">23</xref></sup> No reoperations were required in our labrum-reconstructed patients, which may be attributed to the absence of trochanteric osteotomy and earlier rehabilitation possible with the arthroscopic method.</p>
<p>The ability to preoperatively predict candidates for labral reconstruction merits discussion. Of the labrum-reconstructed patients in this study, we predicted that 3 might require labral reconstruction based on preoperative history (previous labral resection) or imaging (labral ossification and protrusio acetabuli). The majority was not predicted to require labral reconstruction until discovered on arthroscopic examination to have nonsalvageable labrae in hips deemed otherwise in relatively good (nonarthritic or minimally arthritic) condition. Hence, we now include labral reconstruction as part of the surgical consent discussion and perform sterile skin preparation of the ipsilateral knee on all patients with few exceptions. Moreover, our findings suggest that younger male patients with higher BMIs and mild osteoarthritis may be at greater risk of requiring labral reconstruction.</p>
<p>Arthroscopic labral reconstruction with gracilis autograft is a relatively safe procedure without major complications and minimal harvest site morbidity. Despite an average 2.4 weeks of incisional knee pain, there were no reported functional knee deficits or iatrogenic damage to the saphenous nerve.</p>
<p>Limitations of this study include the small size, retrospective design, and lack of postoperative radiographs. However, we believe that the small size reflects the relative paucity of cases with severe labral insufficiency. We currently perform labral reconstruction on 3% of our patients. Also, although we cannot confirm equal amounts of osteoplastic resection between cohorts without postoperative imaging, the surgeon used a consistent technique of acetabuloplasty and incremental femoroplasty with intermittent arthroscopic dynamic testing with consistent terminal range of motion end points. Furthermore, our study cohort does not allow us to determine whether there are sex-specific outcomes or interactions in the comparisons.</p>
<p>The main strengths of this study are the inclusion of a comparison group to elucidate the contribution of labral reconstruction in patients with mixed cam-pincer FAI undergoing similar surgeries (including acetabular and femoral osteoplasties) by the same surgeon using the same postoperative protocol with similar follow-ups during the same time period utilizing a validated hip outcome score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513482884">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Arthroscopic hip labral reconstruction with gracilis autograft is a safe and effective procedure in the setting of comprehensive surgery for FAI. Our results add to those of Sierra and Trousdale,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513482884">21</xref></sup> Walker et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513482884">23</xref></sup> and Philippon et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513482884">19</xref></sup> in lending support for the clinical utility of labral reconstruction for symptomatic improvement and theoretical hip preservation in patients with severe labral insufficiency.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Arthroscopic hip labral reconstruction with gracilis tendon autograft is a safe and effective procedure in the setting of comprehensive surgery for FAI.
