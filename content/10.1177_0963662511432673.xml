<p>The Centre for BioSystems Genomics (CBSG) is a Dutch public-private partnership in plant genomics active in potato and tomato research and exploitation. Its Societal Interface Group (SIG) has been developed to inform its communication strategy and governance practice. This new instrument identifies and discusses early signals from society by bringing together people from different societal backgrounds with members of CBSG management. This interactive learning process facilitates the inclusion of public concerns and needs in scientific developments in the field of plant genomics, and simultaneously enables genomics scientists to search for more societal aims, meanings, and starting points for their research agenda. Analysis of the SIG sessions revealed that the input of public expertise is not threatening or irrational, but provides the opportunity to harness the creative potential of future users highly relevant for the development of societal practices in which plant genomics plays a role.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>The Centre for BioSystems Genomics (CBSG) is a Dutch public-private partnership in plant genomics active in potato and tomato research and exploitation. CBSG aims to exploit a broad range of genomics tools in order to create new opportunities for sustainable agri-production that benefit producers and consumers alike. However, society’s absorption of new technological solutions has not always been a smooth process. Public and stakeholder groups can change the speed and direction of technology trajectories. From biotechnology developments it has become clear that, where the public is insufficiently represented formally, such representation will occur informally through public protest and consumer boycott (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662511432673">Bauer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662511432673">Jasanoff, 2005</xref>). After years of controversy, corporate social responsibility and an open attitude toward the world outside are needed to regain public trust. Being accountable and recovering credibility will continue to be the most important issues in the process of transferring life sciences and technology to the market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662511432673">Gutteling et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Hence, governance of societal issues surrounding genomics innovation requires the facilitation of checks and balances between different types of knowledge, discourses, and world views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662511432673">Gremmen, 2007</xref>). Dealing with societal issues in a sensible way is crucial for plant genomics innovations and their embedding in society. CBSG is interested in social science research that informs its communication strategy and governance practice, and in that way provides the groundwork to further interactive arrangements between members of the public and genomics experts. With this aim in mind, we have developed the Societal Interface Group (SIG). This new instrument can point to and discuss early signals from society by integrating outsiders – people from different societal backgrounds – and insiders – members of CBSG management. In this paper, we evaluate this interactive learning process in which on the one hand public concerns and needs can influence scientific developments in the field of plant genomics, and on the other hand genomics scientists can search for more shared aims, meanings, and starting points for their research agenda. Before we elaborate on the SIG and evaluate its first five sessions, we first place the SIG against the background of the literature on public involvement.</p>

<sec id="section2-0963662511432673">
<title>2. Understanding communication and governance</title>
<p>Over the last decades, many instruments have been developed and used for public involvement in technological issues or research funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662511432673">Elliot et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662511432673">Rowe and Frewer, 2005</xref>). To date, outcomes of these activities with publics have only had marginal effects on policy and decision-making, and have not led to institutional changes in the governance of science and technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662511432673">Pellizzoni, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662511432673">Irwin, 2006</xref>). Given this situation, in the last few years the question has been raised as to what the benefits have been of all these public activities both for society and for the participating members of the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511432673">Felt and Föchler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662511432673">Rowe et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In these activities, an asymmetry remains between scientific and corporate experts in positions of power (insiders) and members of the public acting more or less as laypeople (outsiders) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662511432673">Decker and Ladikas, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511432673">Castle, 2006</xref>). Public concerns and questions are not taken up in communication processes, or are not taken seriously. Members of the public have hardly any opportunity to set up a discussion agenda or contribute their own questions apart from the topics decided on beforehand by authorities and experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662511432673">Schibeci and Harwood, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662511432673">Petts, 2008</xref>). Too easily, lack of public interest or a critical attitude is attributed by scientific and industrial representatives to a lack of comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662511432673">Sturgis and Allum, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>When arrangements for public involvement have not been prepared in a careful way, views and issues from publics become easily disregarded or excluded and stances of scientists and corporate managers will serve as the main and obvious ones. In addition, genuine two-way communication causes assumptions to change not only about communication, but also about governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511432673">Hamlett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662511432673">Hanssen, 2009</xref>). Experts and laypeople become involved in the same appraisal process. In two-way communication, mutual attribution of meaning and negotiation between insiders and outsiders serve as a basis for interactions. Participants are more equal, interactions more symmetrical, and positions of power more balanced. Moreover, outcomes of these deliberations are explicitly connected with policymaking. Distinctive approaches to public involvement, in addition to being a mode of communication, also imply a mode of governance. Therefore, organisers should explicate communication procedures and assumptions about governance to make clear beforehand to participants what is to be expected in terms of the application of outcomes of their interactions. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963662511432673">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>3. Societal Interface Group</title>
<p>CBSG looked for a new instrument that would enable constructive deliberation between members of CBSG management and critical members of the public. CBSG did not opt for a group of advisors at a distance or a one-way consultation that might lead to misunderstanding or might not come to grips with the actual issues. Therefore, social scientists from CBSG’s society programme developed the Societal Interface Group (SIG). Their intention was to set up an interactive learning process in which on the one hand public concerns and needs could influence scientific developments in the field of plant genomics, and on the other hand scientists could search for more shared aims, meanings, and starting points for their research agenda.</p>
<p>An important governance principle of the SIG was that internal and external members were equal, and that responsibility for outcomes of deliberations was shared. It was the obligation of the management team to address the recommendations and autonomy of the SIG. Members of the SIG were allowed to determine relevant topics within the CBSG research agenda, to suggest new research topics, and to bring in wider issues. External members in the SIG were not regarded as representative of the public, but as critical individuals who were able to assess and introduce distinct consumer and citizen stances into the discourse.</p>
<p>In the selection procedure no exclusionary criteria were used for external SIG candidates or any approval of CBSG’s executive committee. They all were members of relevant networks in civil society with relevant backgrounds in production, preparation, and appreciation of food (for instance a farmer, a chef, a journalist, and a trend watcher).</p>
<p>External SIG members maintained no relations with the CBSG nor supported views that would favour plant genomics beforehand. Their independent and critical position provided the opportunity to bring in knowledge claims, questions, and concerns of different publics, and even marginal problems. Such contributions represent public stances better than official constructions of public interests articulated by spokespersons of official civil society organisations and stakeholder groups with vested interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662511432673">Hess, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662511432673">Kleinman et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2005, the SIG started, and in the next two years five sessions were held. In the SIG, eleven external members together with seven members of the CBSG management team (representatives of universities and companies participating in the public-private partnership), led by an independent external chair, discussed the research agenda and societal context of that research. Next, they talked about broader topics like corporate social responsibility, public outreach activities, or genomic tools for organic farming. At the end of each session, the SIG formulated a set of recommendations for CBSG’s executive committee and management team.</p>
<p>In 2009 the Dutch Centre for Society and Genomics asked the developers of the SIG to perform a scientific evaluation of the SIG meetings. CBSG’s executive committee underlined the independence of this evaluation by fully cooperating and giving access to all relevant management minutes and policy documents.</p>

<sec id="section4-0963662511432673" sec-type="methods">
<title>4. Central questions and evaluation method</title>
<p>The evaluation research tried to answer the following questions. (i) Did members of the public in the SIG have enough room to express their own practical knowledge and to apply that knowledge in the context of CBSG? Are members of CBSG in the SIG sensitive enough with regard to societal expectations and worries about genomics applications? (ii) May the SIG be considered as an instrument that facilitates public involvement and empowers its members in deciding on a research agenda and formulating (strategic) policies in the context of CBSG?</p>
<p>From the literature, we have derived two basic conditions for successful public involvement. In the first place, participants must be able to articulate and name those issues that will play a significant role for relevant stakeholders and public audiences. In the second place, the results of these arrangements for public involvement should have effects on policy and decision-making processes about the issues at stake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511432673">Hamlett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662511432673">Van Est and Hanssen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662511432673">Decker and Ladikas, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662511432673">Rowe and Frewer, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662511432673">2005</xref>). Evaluation of these activities is rather difficult because concepts like “effectiveness” and “impact” cannot be formulated unambiguously and depend on position (participant, contractor, researcher, etc.) and the targets formulated. However, overviews of evaluation criteria have been published, from which criteria for specific instruments like the SIG can be deduced. (Additionally, we asked some professionals and academic experts to reflect on, and if necessary to adjust, our criteria.) This resulted in the list of 21 conditions shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0963662511432673">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>These evaluation criteria were able to address more <italic>objective</italic> aims of CBSG as well as more <italic>subjective</italic> experiences of the participants. They were the starting point for the questionnaire that the members of the SIG were asked to answer. Interviews were held in spring 2009, all external (11) and internal (7) SIG members participated. Open questions left room for personal notes and evaluations on deliberative processes and governance mechanisms in the SIG. In addition to answering open questions, the members had to rate on a five-point Likert scale each of the 21 conditions deemed necessary to enable public involvement in communication and governance of plant genomics within the SIG setting.</p>
<p>Answers to the open questions were structured against the backdrop of the 21 conditions shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0963662511432673">Table 2</xref>. In this way it was possible to associate quantitative ratings of SIG members with hands-on SIG experiences. Secondly, these practical experiences and personal observations, allowed us some further elaboration on the SIG design as a new instrument for public involvement.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0963662511432673">Table 2</xref> shows the ratings of the 21 conditions deemed necessary to enable public involvement in communication and governance of plant genomics as experienced by the individual members within the actual SIG process. From the table it is clear that most conditions have an average rating of four or higher; this means that these conditions were considered to be (very) important or necessary in the process of creating public involvement in communication and governance of plant genomics within the SIG setting. The four highest scoring conditions are: (1) <italic>There is room for multiformity in value judgements and societal perspectives</italic>; (2) <italic>SIG members are allowed to voice critical or controversial remarks from outside their own domain</italic>; (3) <italic>The chair is independent</italic>; (4) <italic>There is room for questions about hidden motives and aims of proposed applications of genomics</italic>.</p>
<p>The last column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0963662511432673">Table 2</xref> indicates significant differences between the ratings of CBSG and external SIG members on specific conditions. It is remarkable that there is a difference between CBSG members and external members with regard to the scores of conditions (3) and (4), mentioned above. In both cases, the CBSG members value these conditions even more highly than the external members (<italic>p</italic>-values are both 0.16). A significant difference between the two groups can be observed in the case of condition (13) <italic>External members mainly express their own expertise and experiences</italic> (<italic>p</italic>-value 0.06). This is an important feature as it shows the willingness of CBSG members to accept contributions from external members. With respect to condition (8) <italic>External members become involved in possible societal questions at an early stage</italic>, the image is reversed and external members score more highly than CBSG members (<italic>p</italic>-value 0.19). This is less surprising as it was their role to bring societal issues into the CBSG discourse.</p>
<p>To determine whether, according to its members, the SIG has been an instrument that facilitates public involvement, we have to compare these quantitative results with the answers to the open questions. According to the table, the SIG members agree that most conditions apply: average ratings are four or higher. The answers on open questions support the ratings. Also, the atmosphere during SIG meetings was positive and constructive (see condition 7 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0963662511432673">Table 2</xref>). “<italic>Yes, my knowledge of research trajectories has grown, therefore I can better weigh societal impact against scientific interests</italic>,” commented an external member on the open questions. Or as a CBSG member stated: “<italic>I felt no need to defend myself, nor did I feel uncomfortable in the SIG deliberations</italic>.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are doubts in the case of five conditions. With respect to condition (8) <italic>External members become involved in possible societal questions at an early stage</italic>, several SIG members declared that it was hard to determine the right time to involve external members, because many issues are linked to international developments and have their own dynamics. It has proved difficult to meet the condition (10) <italic>SIG members make explicit uncertainties in their knowledge claims and assumptions</italic>. However, the SIG members unanimously strive for a clear and understandable formulation of issues and to explicate uncertainties when known.</p>
<p>Both external members and CBSG members are confused about condition (11) <italic>In CBSG there exists a legitimation for the SIG</italic>. In the arrangement of the SIG there was no clear definition given of position and role of the SIG in CBSG’s governance, so legitimation remained somewhat implicit. The condition (12) <italic>The SIG induces a structured and open decision-making process</italic> also gave rise to questions. External members do not understand how CBSG management makes its decisions, and whether or not the SIG recommendations have played a role in this. There is doubt about condition (9) <italic>The advice of the SIG is integrated in CBSG policy and research agenda</italic>. The external members’ opinion is that they are unable to verify this. At first hand, CBSG members agree in the open questions more or less that the SIG results have only a restricted and implicit influence on the research agenda and policymaking process. To establish tangible results from SIG sessions into CBSG research and policy, we looked more closely at the responses of the CBSG management team to the SIG recommendations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0963662511432673">
<title>6. Influence on CBSG policy and research agenda</title>
<p>On the basis of the analysis of CBSG management minutes and policy documents we were able to determine whether and how SIG advice has been used in policymaking and agenda setting. The executive committee considered the advice of the SIG not only as input to the management team, but also as direct recommendations to the CBSG staff to start targeted activities. In the first round of its programme, CBSG was reviewed by an international committee of five experts in the field of plant genomics. The committee explicitly recommended the continuance of this kind of activity in the second round of CBSG.</p>
<p>After discussing the genomics research of the tomato programme and its possible societal impact, the SIG recommended to continue sensory research and to start consumer studies in the tomato programme. On the basis of these recommendations the members of this programme in 2005 discussed a new project proposal about the nutritional value and better taste of tomatoes. The aim was to develop plant breeding instruments that would be able to cope with quality characteristics suggested by consumers. Other recommendations of the SIG were to focus more on the quality of food and sustainability (increase disease resistance and reduce chemical usage) in the potato programme. Another example is the SIG input into the CBSG society programme. In 2007, all the SIG recommendations were used to develop the new society programme. The ever-widening gap between consumers and producers became the main theme of the society programme. Explicit SIG topics like <italic>naturalness</italic> and <italic>communication between experts and publics</italic> have been translated into new social research projects.</p>
<p>The CBSG regards the SIG as a means to make its work more relevant to society’s wishes and concerns, and to find out which are the best tools for genuine societal interaction. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0963662511432673">Table 3</xref> gives an overview of CBSG’s responses to the SIG’s recommendations and tangible follow-up actions in research and policy.</p>

<title>7. Conclusions</title>
<p>The mix of scientific and practical knowledge in the SIG is able to articulate social, cultural, and moral aspects of plant genomics in society. More insight into the actions of people and experiences from everyday life can help genomics innovators to translate prospective consumer wishes and concerns into relevant technological trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662511432673">Van den Heuvel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662511432673">Veen et al., 2011</xref>). In this way, the SIG also moves beyond serving as a public relations forum for acceptance of genomics to a place where knowledge and different interests are communicated and negotiated. Such interactive learning is not merely about new facts, but rather is an augmented understanding of the complexity of plant genomics issues, the wide range of societal views, and the various ways to negotiate and analyse these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662511432673">Davies et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662511432673">Hanssen et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>External SIG members raised questions of broader interest that were not (fully) addressed within CBSG’s research and policy. The consortium did not come through enough in linking up the research agenda with pressing public and political issues like the “greening of the economy” and “food security.” Or scientific and especially corporate partners in this public-private partnership had to put more effort into developing a corporate social responsibility framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662511432673">Gremmen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662511432673">Frow, 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, SIG members did not have to agree on everything, but deliberations have led to a greater understanding of each other’s interests and viewpoints. The SIG sessions have shown that public expertise is not threatening or irrational, but highly relevant for the development of societal practices in which plant genomics plays a role. SIG input provides the opportunity to use the creative potential of future users in the development of genomics applications, at a time when they can still influence research trajectories.</p>
<p>According to the members of the SIG, most of the necessary conditions in the design of the SIG have been fulfilled; see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0963662511432673">Table 2</xref>. Nevertheless, there were some doubts, and improvements in the design of the SIG are needed. These doubts originate on the one hand from a transparent feedback to the SIG about what has been done with its recommendations by the executive committee and management team, and on the other hand from the lack of an explicit legitimation of the SIG within the CBSG governance structure. In the first round of the SIG, the governance legitimation has been unclear. In the second round, CBSG’s executive committee and management team will provide legitimation beforehand. They already agree that the SIG will be an official organ in CBSG’s governance, resulting in a more clear position and feedback procedures on SIG recommendations.</p>
