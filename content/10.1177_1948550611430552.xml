<abstract>
<p>Previous research has shown that angry people sometimes aggress to improve their mood. The present research tests whether people who have been treated unjustly seek revenge (i.e., retributive punishment) to improve their mood. The authors hypothesized that retributive punishment is generally not fuelled by a desire to improve one’s mood, whereas more destructive forms of aggression (e.g., venting one’s anger against people or inanimate objects) are. In Study 1, half of the participants were led to believe that their mood was frozen. In Study 2, half of the participants were led to believe that their mood would automatically improve at the end of the study by visiting a “good mood room” with snacks, beverages, and media. Retributive punishment was not affected by either mood management manipulation, whereas destructiveness was. Study 3 expands these findings by showing that retributive reactions were only reduced by a mood improvement manipulation when self-focus was induced.</p>

<p>“Revenge is sweet and not fattening.” —Alfred Hitchcock (1899–1980)</p></disp-quote>
<p>People who have been unjustly treated often seek retribution by punishing the wrongdoer. It is widely assumed that such revenge tastes “sweet,” and that it is this sweetness that motivates people to seek revenge. This assumption is not unreasonable. After all, people like to feel good and they try to repair their mood when they feel bad. Indeed, the attempt to regulate one’s mood is sometimes regarded a universal motivational principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550611430552">Larsen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1948550611430552">Morris &amp; Reilly, 1987</xref>). It motivates many different behaviors, such as helping others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611430552">Cialdini &amp; Kenrick, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1948550611430552">Manucia, Baumann, &amp; Cialdini, 1984</xref>), eating food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550611430552">Frost, Goolkasian, Ely, &amp; Blanchard, 1982</xref>), and engaging in risky actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1948550611430552">Leith &amp; Baumeister, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous research has also shown that people sometimes aggress against others to improve their mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550611430552">Bushman, Baumeister, &amp; Phillips, 2001</xref>). In this research, participants first took a pill (actually a placebo) that was said to improve reaction time. Half of the participants were told that the pill had a nonharmful side effect—it would freeze their mood for about 1 hr. The other half were told that the pill had no side effects. The results showed that the mood-freezing manipulation reduced aggression in people who believed that venting was an effective way to get rid of their anger. The present research addresses the question whether the desire to improve one’s mood also motivates revenge.</p>
<p>Some scholars argue that “all vengeful acts are attempts to escape pain” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550611430552">Frijda, 1994</xref>, p. 279). In line with this view, research has shown that people who have been treated unfairly by another person expect to feel better after punishing that person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611430552">Carlsmith, Wilson, &amp; Gilbert, 2008</xref>). Moreover, findings from neuroimaging studies suggest that the contemplation of punishment is directly connected to reward-related areas in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611430552">de Quervain et al., 2004</xref>), which implies that punishing is associated with experiencing satisfaction (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550611430552">Knutson, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are good reasons to doubt that retributive punishment is motivated by a desire to feel better. Philosophers and psychologists agree that retributive punishment can be conceived of as a means to restore justice—to make the offender pay for violating social norms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550611430552">Gollwitzer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1948550611430552">Miller, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1948550611430552">Tripp, Bies, &amp; Aquino, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1948550611430552">Vidmar, 2001</xref>). Retributive punishment appears to be motivated by an intrinsic desire for justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611430552">Cropanzano, Goldman, &amp; Folger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550611430552">Folger, Cropanzano, &amp; Goldman, 2005</xref>): People retaliate in order to give perpetrators what they deserve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611430552">Aquino, Tripp, &amp; Bies, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550611430552">Bies &amp; Tripp, 1996</xref>). In line with this reasoning, research has shown that laypersons’ punitive attitudes are more strongly shaped by deservingness concerns than by utilitarian concerns. More precisely, retributive punishment is more strongly predicted by the offender’s blameworthiness than by any deterrent effects a punitive sanction might have (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611430552">Carlsmith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611430552">Carlsmith, Darley, &amp; Robinson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611430552">Darley &amp; Pittman, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, a deservingness approach to retribution is backed up by research on “altruistic punishment,” which shows that people are willing to sacrifice a considerable amount of their own resources in order to punish the offender, even if the punishment is administered anonymously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550611430552">Fehr &amp; Fischbacher, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611430552">Fehr &amp; Gächter, 2000</xref>). Taken together, the deservingness approach suggests that retribution is generally about giving wrongdoers what they deserve, rather than about making oneself feel better.</p>

<title>Overview of Present Research</title>
<p>Three studies were designed to scrutinize whether or not retributive punishment is motivated by a desire to feel better. In Study 1, half of the participants were told that a bogus drug would freeze their mood for a short time period (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1948550611430552">Manucia et al., 1984</xref>). In Studies 2 and 3, half of the participants were led to believe that their mood would improve automatically at the end of the study. If retribution was indeed motivated by a desire to feel better, then participants in these conditions should punish less. However, if we are correct in assuming that the desire to feel better is <italic>not</italic> the primary motivation underlying retribution, then the mood management manipulations should have no effect on punishment. However, mood management manipulations should have an effect of venting one’s anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550611430552">Bushman et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, we included a measure of the desire to vent one’s anger in Studies 1 and 2 in order to test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>We are not suggesting that retributive punishment is <italic>always</italic> immune to mood management manipulations. There may be instances in which retributive punishment is indeed motivated by a desire to improve one’s mood. For example, when self-focus is induced, affect regulation motives should become more salient, and, consequently, retributive punishment should be influenced by a mood management manipulation. This hypothesis can be deduced from self-awareness theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611430552">Duval &amp; Wicklund, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1948550611430552">Wood, Saltzberg, &amp; Goldsamt, 1990</xref>). For example, research has shown that negative mood leads to a stronger experience of physical symptoms (headache, cold hands, and dizziness) when self-focus is experimentally induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550611430552">Gendolla, Abele, Andrei, Spurk, &amp; Richter, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, hedonic affect regulation is a salient motivational goal only when people in an intense mood are aware of their current feeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611430552">Gendolla, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1948550611430552">McFarland &amp; Buehler, 1998</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that victims’ desire to improve their mood can be a salient goal underlying retributive punishment, but only when self-focus is high. We test this hypothesis in Study 3.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 134 college students who received course credit. Of these, six refused to take the drug and four were suspicious. Thus, the final sample consisted of 124 students (70% female; <italic>M</italic>
<sub>age</sub> = 22.4, <italic>SD </italic>= 3.84).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1948550611430552">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>After informed consent was obtained, participants were given a bogus drug called “Passiflor” (actually a placebo). They were told that the drug increased information processing speed. Half of the participants were additionally told that “Passiflor” had a harmless side effect—it froze one’s mood for about 20 min (mood-freezing condition). The other half were told that “Passiflor” had no side effects (control condition). As a manipulation check, participants were asked to report what effects and side effects “Passiflor” had. All participants in the mood-freezing condition correctly recalled the mood-freezing side effect.</p>
<p>After taking the pill, participants rated how <italic>angry</italic>, <italic>outraged</italic>, and <italic>annoyed</italic> they felt right now (0 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 5 = <italic>very much</italic>; Cronbach α = .75). Filler items were used to diminish demand effects. Next, participants completed a public goods dilemma (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1948550611430552">Komorita &amp; Parks, 1996</xref>). They were told that they would play an investment game with three other participants seated in separate rooms. Each participant was given 20 1-€ coins that could be invested into a “common project.” If the sum of all four investments amounted to at least 40 € (about $67), a bonus of 80 € would be added to the common pool for all participants to share equally. The implicit norm in such step-level public goods games is to follow the “equal division rule” (i.e., each of the four players is expected to invest 10 €; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1948550611430552">Van Dijk &amp; Wilke, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1948550611430552">1996</xref>). Players who follow the equal division rule are angry at those who do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1948550611430552">Stouten, De Cremer, &amp; Van Dijk, 2006</xref>), and they punish such free-riders at their own expense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611430552">Carlsmith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611430552">Fehr &amp; Gächter, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Participants invested 8–20 € into the common project (<italic>M </italic>= 13.94; <italic>SD </italic>= 3.73). After making their own contribution, participants learned that Player 2 invested 9 €, Player 3 invested 10 €, and that Player 4 violated the equal division rule and invested only 0–4 € (depending on the participant’s investment). Thus, the sum was never at least 40 €. The experimenter said that each player was free to decide how much money to invest (blame condition), or that Player 4’s investment was randomly determined by the computer (no blame condition; for a similar manipulation see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1948550611430552">Stouten et al., 2006</xref>). The no blame condition was included as a means to establish the construct validity of our retributive punishment measure: Player 4 should only receive punishment when his or her behavior was undoubtedly attributable to egoistic intentions and not to factors beyond his or her control.</p>
<p>After participants completed the mood form a second time (Cronbach α = .87 for the three state-anger items), the experimenter said that “Passiflor” would probably be fully absorbed in their bloodstream by now. To measure venting anger, participants rated how much they wanted to use a large hammer to destroy six objects that were presented to them (e.g., snow globe, glass, Beatles record; 1 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 10 = <italic>very much</italic>; Cronbach α = .72). To measure retributive punishment, participants were told that they could deduct up to 10 € from any of the three other players. The amount of money deducted from Player 4 (i.e., the free-rider) was used to measure retributive punishment. A debriefing followed.</p>

<title>Retributive Punishment</title>
<p>A 2 (Mood-Freezing, No-Side Effects) × 2 (Blame, No Blame) ANOVA showed that participants punished Player 4 more in the blame condition (<italic>M </italic>= 5.31, <italic>SD </italic>= 4.08) than in the no blame condition (<italic>M </italic>= 2.17, <italic>SD </italic>= 3.34), <italic>F</italic>(1, 120) = 21.77, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001, <italic>d </italic>= 0.84.

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 69 nonstudent adult volunteers who earned raffle tickets for 25 € (about $42) book certificates. They were recruited via flyers and newspaper ads. Six participants were excluded because they were suspicious. The final sample consisted of 63 participants (70% female; <italic>M</italic>
<sub>age</sub> = 48.6, <italic>SD </italic>= 15.8).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1948550611430552">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>After informed consent was obtained, participants took turns solving anagrams with an ostensible partner of the same sex seated in another room. For each anagram correctly solved in 4 min, the team earned one raffle ticket toward a 25 € gift certificate. Teams solved 22.8 anagrams on average (<italic>SD </italic>= 6.3). The bogus partner took about as long to solve the anagrams as the participant did. After learning about the number of anagrams solved together, both players were asked to make a recommendation for distributing the raffle tickets between them. On average, participants recommended about an equal split (<italic>M </italic>= 51.45% for themselves, <italic>SD </italic>= 10.19%). The ostensible partner recommended that he or she take the lion’s share—90%, (leaving only 10% for the participant). The final distribution was obtained by averaging the two recommendations. Previous research has shown that such an unfair distribution proposal by one’s partner induces anger and retributive intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611430552">Gollwitzer, Meder, &amp; Schmitt, 2011</xref>). Half of the participants were told that their partner freely chose the distribution of tickets (blame condition), whereas the other half were told that the partner’s recommendation was determined randomly by the computer (no blame condition).</p>
<p>Rather than using a pill, which some participants refused to take in Study 1, half of the participants were randomly assigned to a mood-improvement condition in which they could eat snacks, drink beverages, and consume media after the study. Thus, taking revenge would not be necessary for these participants if mood improvement actually was the central motivation underlying revenge.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1948550611430552">1</xref>
</sup> As a manipulation check, participants were asked to what extent they expect themselves to feel <italic>angry</italic>, <italic>outraged</italic>, and <italic>annoyed</italic> (0 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 5 = <italic>very much</italic>; Cronbach α = .86) by the end of the study. Three persons did not answer these questions.</p>
<p>The desire to vent anger was measured by asking participants to write down what they usually do to “let off steam,” and to rate how much they wanted to do that activity right now (0 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 5 = <italic>very much</italic>). Retributive punishment was measured with the “hot sauce paradigm” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1948550611430552">Lieberman, Solomon, Greenberg, &amp; McGregor, 1999</xref>), which has been used previously to measure retributive punishment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611430552">Evers, Fischer, Rodriguez Mosquera, &amp; Manstead, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1948550611430552">Meier &amp; Hinsz, 2004</xref>). The experimenter explained that the final part of the experiment was about taste, and handed the participant two glasses of tomato juice and some red chili powder. Participants were told that one teaspoonful of chili powder would make the drink mildly spicy, three teaspoonfuls would make it moderately spicy, and six teaspoonfuls would make it very spicy. Participants mixed two drinks, one for themselves and one for their partner. The difference in the number of teaspoonfuls of chili powder between the two drinks was used as a measure of retributive punishment. One participant refused to mix a drink for his or her partner. Finally, all participants were escorted to a “good mood room,” which contained snacks, beverages, media to consume (e.g., music, magazines, and newspapers), and a comfortable chair. After spending as much time as they wanted in the “good mood room,” participants were debriefed.</p>

<title>Venting Anger</title>
<p>When asked what they usually do to “let off steam,” most participants listed sports (43%), followed by listening to music (23%; including violent music), screaming or shouting (23%), relaxing (20%), engage in a distracting activity (20%; e.g., Sudoku puzzle), and behaving destructively (17%; e.g., breaking dishes). Only participants (<italic>n </italic>= 38) who used an “anger-out” expression style (i.e., expressing anger toward innocent people or objects; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1948550611430552">Spielberger et al., 1985</xref>) were included in the analyses.<sup>

<p>Studies 1 and 2 suggest that retributive punishment is not motivated by a desire to feel better. Study 3 was designed to establish boundary conditions on this finding.

<p>Participants were 162 college students who could earn raffle tickets for five 30 € (about $50) cash prizes. Nine participants were discarded because they were suspicious. Thus, the final sample consisted of 153 participants (55% female; <italic>M</italic>

</sec>
<sec id="section21-1948550611430552">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>After informed consent was obtained, participants took turns solving anagrams with an ostensible partner of the same sex seated in another room. The procedure was generally the same as in Study 2, except only 1 min was given to solve anagrams. Participants solved 7.2 anagrams on average (<italic>SD </italic>= 2.7). They were informed that their partner’s score was roughly equal to their own. Both players recommended how the raffle tickets should be divided between them. Again, participants’ partners always recommended an unequal split (90% for self; 10% for participant).</p>
<p>We used the same mood-improvement manipulation as in Study 2 (i.e., the good mood room). Participants were then told that their partner would stay and complete a tedious and unpleasant task (i.e., describing unpleasant pictures, such as rotting animals). All participants were told that they could decide later how many unpleasant pictures (0–9) their partners would have to describe (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1948550611430552">Mussweiler &amp; Förster, 2000</xref>, Study 3, for a similar measure of retributive punishment). Participants were randomly assigned to a self-focused or to a control condition. Participants in the self-focused condition were instructed to select the number of pictures they wanted their partner to describe, and to explain how they felt and what motivated them to select the pictures for their partners by typing it into a text window on the computer screen. Participants in the control condition were also asked to select the number of unpleasant pictures, but they were not instructed to contemplate their feelings and explain their behavior. On average, participants chose 2.9 pictures (<italic>SD </italic>= 2.7). All participants then spent as much time as they wanted alone in the “good mood room.” A debriefing followed.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>The number of unpleasant pictures chosen for one’s partner were analyzed using a 2 (Mood-Improvement, No Mood-Improvement) × 2 (Self-Focused, Control) ANOVA. Participants in the self-focused condition chose fewer pictures for their partner (<italic>M </italic>= 2.45, <italic>SD </italic>= 2.46) than did participants in the control condition (<italic>M </italic>= 3.24, <italic>SD </italic>= 2.84), <italic>F</italic>(1, 149) = 4.18, <italic>p </italic>= .04, <italic>d </italic>= 0.30. This main effect was qualified by the predicted interaction between mood improvement and self-focus, <italic>F</italic>(1, 149) = 4.03, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .05 η<sup>2</sup>
<sub>partial</sub>, = .03 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1948550611430552">Figure 2</xref>). Simple effects tests showed that the effect of mood improvement on retributive punishment was significant in the self-focused condition, <italic>t</italic>(73) = 3.03, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01, <italic>d </italic>= 0.70, but nonsignificant in the control condition, <italic>t</italic>(76) = 0.10, <italic>p </italic>= .92, <italic>d </italic>= 0.02. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1948550611430552">Figure 2</xref>, participants in the self-focused condition chose fewer unpleasant pictures for their partners when they expected their mood to improve. These results suggest that revenge aims at improving one’s mood only when self-focus was induced. In line with the self-focus literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611430552">Gendolla, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1948550611430552">McFarland, Buehler, von Rüti, Nguyen, &amp; Alvaro, 2007</xref>), hedonic affect regulation is only a salient motivational goal when people reflect upon their mood. When affect regulation can be achieved in other ways, revenge is no longer necessary.</p>

</sup> This replicates our findings from Studies 1 and 2 and lends even more empirical support to the notion that unless self-focus has been induced, victims take revenge irrespective of any mood improvements. One might wonder to what extent self-focus plays a role in real-life contexts where victims have the opportunity to take revenge on their perpetrators. Our reasoning and the present results suggest that victims who are dispositionally high in self-focus are more likely to take revenge in order to improve their mood. Similar effects might be induced by situational factors that increase self-awareness, such as when a salient audience is present (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1948550611430552">Scheier, Fenigstein, &amp; Buss, 1974</xref>). Otherwise, however, we believe that self-focus is not necessarily induced by unfair experiences in situations outside the lab.</p>
<p>We also coded participants’ texts to rule out the possibility that participants in the self-focused/mood-improvement condition “punished” their partners more strongly by blaming them in their texts than participants in the self-focused/no mood-improvement condition. However, this was not the case. In the mood-improvement condition, 6.3% referred to the unjust distribution in their texts, whereas in the no mood-improvement condition, 10.8% did. This difference was nonsignificant, χ<sup>2</sup>(<italic>df </italic>= 1, <italic>N </italic>= 75) = .38, <italic>p </italic>= .54. These results can be interpreted as further evidence that people do not retaliate to improve their mood unless they are prompted to shift their attentional focus inward.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1948550611430552">
<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>This research is the first to test whether people who have been unjustly treated retaliate simply because it tastes “sweet” and they will feel better afterward. If so, then making victims believe that they would <italic>not</italic> feel better by seeking retribution (Study 1), or making them believe that they would <italic>definitely</italic> feel better even if they did not seek retribution (Studies 2 and 3) should decrease the magnitude of retributive punishment. The data contradict this view. Study 1 showed that victims punished the wrongdoer regardless of whether they believed that their mood was frozen. Study 2 showed that victims punished the wrongdoer regardless of whether they expected their mood to improve. Study 3 showed that the prospects of improving one’s mood only reduced retributive punishment when victims were induced to focus on their anger. In contrast, other forms of aggression, such as venting one’s anger against people and inanimate objects, are more likely to be motivated by a desire to improve one’s mood and escape negative affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550611430552">Bushman et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results suggest that retributive punishment is not primarily a self-oriented response. The findings are more consistent with a deservingness approach to retribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611430552">Cropanzano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550611430552">Folger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611430552">Folger &amp; Skarlicki, 2008</xref>), according to which retribution is about giving wrongdoers what they deserve. Our findings are also consistent with research showing that when deciding on appropriate sanctions for violent offenders, information about the moral imbalance caused by the harm (e.g., the degree to which the offender is to blame) is much more important than information about the effectiveness of a sanction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611430552">Carlsmith &amp; Darley, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Affect is undoubtedly connected to retribution, just as it is connected to all kinds of justice-related cognitions and motivations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550611430552">De Cremer, 2007</xref>). Contrary to what philosophers and legal scholars say (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1948550611430552">Nozick, 1981</xref>), retributive justice cannot exist without emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550611430552">Goldberg, Lerner, &amp; Tetlock, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1948550611430552">Solomon, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1948550611430552">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1948550611430552">Vidmar, 2001</xref>), as research on popular opinions about capital punishment clearly demonstrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550611430552">Ellsworth &amp; Gross, 1994</xref>). Anger, for example, is strongly related to punishment and revenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611430552">Darley &amp; Pittman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611430552">Fiske &amp; Tetlock, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611430552">Gollwitzer et al., 2011</xref>). But the present research shows that reducing anger is not what retributive punishment ultimately aims at.</p>
<p>Interestingly, findings from Study 1 suggest that anger is elicited when participants are confronted with an unfavorable outcome—regardless of whether this outcome could be attributed to the harm doer or to chance. In our research, this finding was important for methodological reasons (i.e., if anger had been much weaker in the no blame conditions there would have been no need to “let off steam”). It could be that moralistic anger was predominantly evoked in the blame condition in Study 1, whereas personal anger was predominantly evoked in the no blame condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611430552">Batson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1948550611430552">O’Mara, Jackson, Batson, &amp; Gaertner, 2011</xref>). This would imply that moralistic anger is more strongly connected to a need to reestablish justice, whereas personal anger is more strongly connected to a need to regulate one’s affect. Although this conceptual distinction is an interesting topic for further research, it does not affect our central argument that the specific role affect plays in punishing wrongdoers is complex and should not be oversimplified. Punishing an offender and taking revenge can—under certain conditions—be satisfying for the victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611430552">Gollwitzer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611430552">Gollwitzer &amp; Denzler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1948550611430552">Solomon, 1999</xref>); but to conclude that affect regulation is actually the central goal underlying retributive responses would be a misconception.</p>
<p>We are well aware that the crucial argument we are making in the present article, that mood improvement is not what drives retributive responses, is based on testing a null hypothesis, and this may be problematic for statistical and conceptual reasons (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550611430552">Grant, 1962</xref>). However, we believe that the present research represents one of the cases in which scientific advance is achieved by <italic>rejecting</italic> a theory (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1948550611430552">Greenwald, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1948550611430552">Platt, 1964</xref>). Because the statistical power to detect a medium effect size was sufficiently high in Study 1 (i.e., .796), we believe that our argument that mood improvement is not the central goal underlying retribution is empirically warranted. Nevertheless, future research should test the notion that revenge is about achieving deservingness, rather than about improving one’s mood, more directly.</p>
<p>How can we reconcile our findings with research showing that people expect their mood to improve by punishing an offender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611430552">Carlsmith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611430552">de Quervain et al., 2004</xref>)? Although providing a comprehensive answer is beyond the scope of the present research, we offer a preliminary answer that is not at odds with the deservingness approach. Victims might punish because they want justice; and they might expect feelings of satisfaction when justice has been reestablished. In other words, it might not be the punishment itself that elicits satisfaction, but rather the anticipated state of reestablished justice. One might expect a state of pleasantness, of sweetness, of moral satisfaction from punishing an offender. But the motivation behind punishment can be something entirely different, such as making the offender pay for violating social norms. Sweet emotions are epiphenomena, correlates, or indicators that justice has been reestablished, but experiencing them may not be the goal itself (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550611430552">Gollwitzer, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1948550611430552">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It has often been suggested that reducing negative affect is a universal principle that explains many behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611430552">Baumeister &amp; Bushman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550611430552">Larsen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1948550611430552">Morris &amp; Reilly, 1987</xref>). The present research suggests that although mood-regulation may explain the desire to vent one’s anger, it cannot explain retributive punishment. Mood improvement only plays a role when victims explicitly focus on their affective state. The default, however, is that people seek retribution in order to reestablish justice for justice’s sake, and not for their own emotional welfare.</p>
<p>The present research also has many practical implications. For example, in therapy, counseling, or mediation contexts, people who harbor vengeful desires against a person who has harmed them should not be advised to vent their anger so they will feel better.</p>
<p>In summary, the motivation to seek justice by punishing another person cannot simply be quenched by regulating one’s anger. To use the words of Alfred Hitchcock, revenge may taste sweet, but the sweet taste is not what victims long for.</p>

<p>This reasoning is built on the assumption that all ways to regulate affect are mutually equivalent. Although this assumption can be wrong, we still believe that our mood manipulation, which was basically a distraction, provided a comparable opportunity to escape pain, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550611430552">Frijda (1994</xref>) argues that taking revenge does.

<p>Excluding 40% of our sample went along with a severe reduction in power. Nonetheless, it increased the interpretability of our findings because we only included participants who reported engaging in some sort of “anger-out” behavior when they let off steam. On the other hand, the patterns of results for the entire data set (i.e., without excluding 40%) and for the reduced data set do not differ much: Participants’ desire to vent their anger was—at least marginally—lower in the mood-improvement condition (<italic>M </italic>= .72, <italic>SD </italic>= .81) than in the no mood-improvement condition (<italic>M </italic>= 1.26, <italic>SD </italic>= 1.44), <italic>F</italic>(1,59) = 3.36, <italic>p </italic>= .07, <italic>d </italic>= 0.46.

<p>The dependent variable (number of unpleasant pictures selected for one’s partner) was not normally distributed because 26% of our participants (<italic>n </italic>= 40) selected no picture at all. Therefore, the analysis was repeated (a) with the number of pictures as dependent variable, but without the 40 participants who selected no pictures, and (b) with a binary dependent variable (pictures selected: yes/no).
