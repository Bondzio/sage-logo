<p>63.1664 ABBEY, Ruth; SPINNER-HALEV, Jeff — <bold>Rawls, Mill, and the puzzle of political liberalism.</bold> <italic>Journal of Politics</italic> 75(1), Jan. 2013: 124–136.</p>
<p>This article examines J. Rawls's turn toward a purely political liberalism by comparing and contrasting it with the comprehensive liberalism he imputes to J.S. Mill. We argue that Mill and Rawls have similar views about individual autonomy, despite Rawls's insistence to the contrary. We contend that Rawls accords a much larger role to the state in enforcing justice than does Mill. Whereas Rawls's view of justice rests ultimately on state enforcement, Mill sees justice reaching into many institutions, but accords the state a lesser role in this. Mill's view of justice rests on a view of progress and moral psychology not shared by Rawls. In the service of stability, Rawls demands more agreement from citizens about justice than does Mill, but these demands undermine the stability that Rawls so desires. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.1665 AĜCAN, Muhammed A. — <bold>Immanuel Kant ve uluslararasi: egemen devlet, kozmopolitan siyaset ve evrensellik/farklilik (Immanuel Kant and the international: the sovereign-state, cosmopolitanism and universality/difference).</bold> <italic>Uluslararasi Hukuk ve Politika (Review of International Law and Politics)</italic> 32, 2012: 1–41.</p>
<p>According to the cosmopolitan perspective, Kant envisions a global moral-legal order based on the concept of autonomous moral and rational individual subject. [Another] approach asserts that Kant develops a political ontology defined by the modern conception of sovereignty which understands the sovereign state as a metaphysical and moral subject. This article, however, argues that Kant's political and international thought include both cosmopolitanism and the concept of morally and rationally autonomous sovereign state. Kant's original motivation is to justify the sovereign state as a moral and legal collective subject within a cosmopolitan ethical and political ontology. Critically interrogating Kant's idea of global politics and the international, the article points out the promises, limits and problems of Kant's thought in relation to the ethical-legal conditions of coexistence of multiple socio-political communities and diverse historico-cultural formations.

<p>63.1666 ANILI, Bruno — <bold>Liberal incorporations: Kymlicka, Pettit and the grammar of hegemony.</bold> <italic>Journal of Political Ideologies</italic> 18(1), 2013: 11–33.</p>
<p>A liberal <italic>koine</italic> operates in much of the West today as the dominant political ideology. The incorporation of non-liberal themes into liberal discourse functions primarily at the level of the deep structures of language. Here I examine two texts that appear to conform to the canons of liberal discourse without articulating canonical liberal themes. First, I present W. Kymlicka's reflection on the “right to culture” as a patent illustration of liberalism's ability to co-opt non-liberal themes (communitarian, in this case) into its own framework. Then, I analyze Ph. Pettit's theorization of “neo-republicanism”, and argue that his definition of liberty as non-domination ends up justifying liberalism's conception of the political as merely instrumental to the preservation of individual liberty.

<p>63.1667 ARRUZZA, Cinzia — <bold>“Cleaning the city”: Plato and Popper on political change.</bold> <italic>Polis (Nicosia)</italic> 29(2), 2012: 259–285.</p>
<p>This paper examines an issue that seems particularly overlooked in the debate on Plato and K. Popper — political change. The paper challenges the largely unchallenged assumption that modern liberal democracy can play the role of the general standard, upon which basis we can judge the thinkers of the past. Indeed, in <italic>The Open Society [and Its Enemies</italic>, Routledge, 1945] liberal democracy sets the boundaries of what is considered as a “rational” political change, thus revealing that Popper holds a form of teleological conception of historical development. The paper argues for a different interpretation of Plato's approach to the question of political change, against Popper's claim that the final aim of the utopian city of the Republic is the elimination of change. Plato's utopian construction provides us with better tools than Popper's framework for thinking of change in politics. [R]</p>
<p>63.1668 BARBOSA-FOHRMANN, Ana Paula — <bold>Die Theorie der Menschenrechtsprinzipien von Carlos Santiago Nino (Carlos Santiago Nino's theory of human rights principles).</bold> <italic>Verfassung und Recht in Übersee</italic> 45(3), 2012: 295–304.</p>
<p>By means of a reconstruction of Kantian moral theory, Nino founds human rights and human dignity on a moral procedure. His procedural model is composed of the following stages: discourse, principles, rights and institutions. This paper will focus on the ratio between the first three stages that serve as a basis for the formulation of Nino's three moral principles of human rights: autonomy, inviolability and human dignity. This article proposes an ethical foundation for the legitimation of human rights principles expressly and implicitly written in the Brazilian Constitution of 1988, in particular the one of human dignity, which in Art. 1 III has the status of fundamental constitutional principle.

<p>63.1669 BENDER, Christiane — <bold>Freiheit, Verantwortung, direkte Demokratie: zur Relevanz von Rousseau heute (Freedom, responsibility and direct democracy: the present relevance of Rousseau).</bold> <italic>Aus Politik und Zeitgeschichte</italic> 62(46–47), 12 Nov. 2012: 49–54.</p>
<p>“Man is born free, and is everywhere in chains”. Thus J.-J. Rousseau opened his <italic>Social Contract</italic> (1762). He defined the general will as the unit of popular consent and, beyond, the founding of the Republic, but remains compatible with various forms of government (monarchy, aristocracy and democracy). Can we benefit from his pathos still today?</p>
<p>63.1670 BENTLEY, R. K. — <bold>Civic friendship and thin citizenship.</bold> <italic>Res Publica (Journal of Legal and Social Philosophy)</italic> 19(1), Feb. 2013: 5–19.</p>
<p>Contemporary appeals for a deepening of civic friendship in liberal democracies often draw on Aristotle. This paper warns against attempting to use Aristotle in our own theorizing, namely accounts of civic friendship that characterize it as similar in some way to Aristotelian virtue friendship. The most prominent of these attempts have focused on disinterested mutual regard as a basic ingredient in all Aristotelian forms of friendship. [However,] this inadequately accounts for the idea of a virtue friend as another self, which we find in Aristotle's thought. Civic friendship is different in a fundamental way from virtue friendship because virtue friends are keenly committed to the moral improvement of one another. It is argued that Aristotle does not see civic friendship in the same way.

<p>63.1671 BLACK, Martin — <bold>The Platonic enlightenment.</bold> <italic>Perspectives on Political Science</italic> 42(1), 2013: 2–7.</p>
<p>M. Blitz's analysis of Plato's political philosophy engages with a large proportion of the Platonic corpus. His examination is oriented by Plato's intention of expressing his views in dialogue form, and animated by Plato's principle that political philosophy must emerge from the attentive critique of ordinary or political experience. This article raises the question whether Blitz has done justice to the “poetic” (constructed, historical, etc.) character of ordinary experience or <italic>doxa</italic>, and so of the radical nature of Plato's political thought. [R] [First article of a symposium on “Blitz's <italic>Plato's Political Philosophy</italic> [Baltimore, 2010], introduced by Mark KREMER. See also <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1672, 1700, 1705]</p>
<p>63.1672 BRADIZZA, Luigi — <bold>Plato's political puzzle.</bold> <italic>Perspectives on Political Science</italic> 42(1), 2013: 8–14.</p>
<p>M. Blitz begins <italic>Plato's Political Philosophy</italic> [Baltimore, 2010] by making a strong case for Plato's continuing relevance to us. The book's three parts are centered on three dialogues: the <italic>Laws</italic>, the <italic>Republic</italic>, and the <italic>Statesman</italic>. Blitz lays out the dialogues' intellectual pathways and gives us an important sense of their meaning. He also gives us rich discussions of four key concepts that underlie and are found throughout Plato's works: nature, wonder, perplexity, and laughter. The book lacks a deeper discussion of the view that we should be guided by nature in determining our ends. Also missing is a better appreciation of both the challenge posed to philosophy by piety, and the attraction of institutions of modern republics. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1671]</p>
<p>63.1673 BROWN, Alexander — <bold>Rawls, Buchanan, and the legal doctrine of legitimate expectations.</bold> <italic>Social Theory and Practice</italic> 38(4), Oct. 2012: 617–644.</p>
<p>The article responds to an overlooked objection put by A. Buchanan to J. Rawls's theory of justice: that implementing the Difference Principle over time may require gross and frequent disruptions of people's framing and execution of long-term plans. Having strengthened Buchanan's objection to resolve significant weaknesses in his main counterexample, I argue that the best response to this objection draws on the concept of the rule of law, specifically, the legal doctrine of legitimate expectations, which can be found in English, French, and EU administrative law. I also explore the suitability of incorporating this doctrine into Justice as Fairness, given its absence in US constitutional and administrative law. Finally, I consider the question of what the government owes to agents in whom legitimate expectations are induced and then frustrated. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.1674 CELIKATES, Robin — <bold>Rousseaus philosophischer Anarchismus. Der demokratische Gesellschaftsvertrag und das Problem der politischen Verpflichtung (Rousseau's philosophical anarchism: the democratic social contract and the problem of political obligation).</bold> <italic>Politische Vierteljahresschrift</italic> 53(4), 2012: 668–689.</p>
<p>I first sketch the current discussion of the problem of political obligation and the position of philosophical anarchism. In the second step, Rousseau's answer to this problem is interpreted as a variant of <italic>a posteriori</italic> philosophical anarchism. Third, I show under which conditions, according to Rousseau, the political obligation of citizens cease to exist or become qualified, and finally I raise the question whether a specifically Rousseauian perspective on civil disobedience can be developed against this background.

<p>63.1675 CHERNISS, Joshua L. — <bold>Isaiah Berlin's thought and its legacy: critical reflections on a symposium.</bold> <italic>European Journal of Political Theory</italic> 12(1), Jan. 2013: 5–23.</p>
<p>The papers published [herein] discuss facets of Berlin's work from different perspectives and using varying intellectual approaches. Consideration of their differences and overlap [allows] taking stock of Berlin's work as a whole; and a critical response to the interpretations and criticisms of Berlin presented here afford an opportunity to re-evaluate, criticize and defend central aspects of Berlin's intellectual position. This article presents a critical, interpretive adjudication between the claims of Berlin's work, and the interpretations of that work presented in the other articles in this issue. Drawing on each of these, I present an interpretation of Berlin's contributions to thinking about the Enlightenment, nationalism and cultural pluralism, utopianism and political ethics, liberty, and value pluralism; I also consider the difficulties of interpreting Berlin's work, and applying his ideas today. [R, abr.] [First article of a thematic issue on Isaiah Berlin. See also <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1698, 1720, 1734, 1738]</p>
<p>63.1676 CHURCH, Jeffrey — <bold>The political cultivation of moral character: Kant on public moral feeling as a precondition for right.</bold> <italic>Polity</italic> 45(1), Jan. 2013: 56–81.</p>
<p>Does the liberal state have the legitimate power to shape the moral character of its citizenry? One common liberal answer, which draws on a traditional reading of Kant's distinction between morality and right, is “no”: the scope of state authority extends only to the external actions of individuals, not to their inner, moral lives. This article explores an alternative reading of Kant in which the liberal state defends individual rights yet also has the duty to supply the preconditions for enjoying those rights. One precondition is the moral character of the citizenry. The article thus both challenges a traditional interpretation of Kant's view of the state, and develops a liberal line of reasoning about moral character within a secular, pluralistic regime.

<p>63.1677 ÇIDAM, Çiĝdem — <bold>A politics of love? Antonio Negri on revolution and democracy.</bold> <italic>Contemporary Political Theory</italic> 12(1), Feb. 2013: 26–45.</p>
<p>This article critically analyzes Negri's democratic theory by exploring the theoretical significance of a concept that begins to appear in his writings after the 1990s: the concept of “love”. Negri's turn to love is puzzling, especially given his earlier recourse to notions of antagonistic struggle, direct confrontation and even violence. Using J. Derrida's conception of “the supplement” for interpretive purposes, I argue that the concept of love not only enriches Negri's account of democracy, but also points to a lack within his political thought. During the 1970s, Negri called for a radicalization of antagonism and the use of violence to ensure the political organization of the revolutionary subject. In his recent writings, Negri has supplemented the notion of “love” for his earlier emphasis on antagonism to address autonomist Marxism's unresolved question of political organization.

<p>63.1678 COREY, Elizabeth — <bold>The two great lights: <italic>regnum</italic> and <italic>sacerdotium</italic> in the [medieval] Salerno Ivories.</bold> <italic>History of Political Thought</italic> 34(1), Spring 2012: 1–18.</p>
<p>The largest surviving set of ivories from the Pre-Gothic Middle Ages is the Salerno Ivories, which includes extensive Old and New Testament cycles. Although the monument has been much studied by art historians, its potential symbolic and political meaning has not been investigated. This article takes a particular plaque as a starting point for analysis, making the case that an Old Testament plaque depicting the creation of sun and moon echoes the usage of this metaphor by Gregory VII during the Investiture Controversy, and that the cycle as a whole is a statement of political covenant. [R]</p>
<p>63.1679 CROWDER, George — <bold>Justification and psychology in liberal pluralism: a reply to Zakaras.</bold> <italic>Review of Politics</italic> 75(1), Jan. 2013: 103–110.</p>
<p>It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to respond to A. Zakaras's thoughtful and stimulating article [<italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1739]. Although Zakaras takes my work (together with that of William Galston) as a critical target, much of what he says is common ground between us. That includes his basic understanding of value pluralism, his evident support for that idea, and his broadly liberal approach to politics. He makes a significant contribution by drawing attention to the relation between pluralism and fallibility, and by focusing on Isaiah Berlin's treatment of Mill in that connection. Zakaras is right that Berlin's essay on Mill has not until now been carefully examined as a resource for the debate about the way pluralism relates to liberalism, and his suggestions about what the essay may tell us in that regard are valuable.

<p>63.1680 CZOBOR-LUPP, Mihaela — <bold>Herder on esthetic imagination as a source of post-national democratic solidarity: a contribution to Habermas' constitutional patriotism.</bold> <italic>Contemporary Political Theory</italic> 12(1), Feb. 2013: 46–70.</p>
<p>Constitutional patriotism has been criticized for providing too thin an identity as the ground for common citizenship. Answering this criticism, J. Habermas recently stressed the role of affective attachments in creating constitutional patriotic bonds. Still, an account of the type of imagination that could foster such post-national affective attachments is lacking. Drawing on Herder's conception of political culture, I argue that constitutional patriotism requires a modern form of mythology, [e.g.,] narratives that shape people's imaginative capacity to see their own culture as a vulnerable and fallible part of a plural mankind and as a free and equal contributor to the global advancement toward humanity. Habermas's constitutional patriotism requires supplementing the power of law to create bonds between people. This can be done through the cultivation of imaginative engagements with foreign others.

<p>63.1681 DIJN, Annelien — <bold>Montesquieu's controversial context: <italic>The Spirit of the Laws</italic> as a monarchist tract.</bold> <italic>History of Political Thought</italic> 34(1), Spring 2012: 66–88.</p>
<p>This article draws attention to the importance of early 18th-c. debates about the nature of the French monarchy for our understanding of Montesquieu's masterpiece, <italic>The Spirit of the Laws</italic>. By contrasting and comparing Montesquieu's views with those of, among others, H de Boulainvilliers and G.-Ch. Le Gendre, this article shows that <italic>The Spirit of the Laws</italic> defended an orthodox monarchist position. The evidence presented therefore has important implications for the ongoing debate about Montesquieu's place in the history of ideas, suggesting that <italic>The Spirit of the Laws</italic> was written to bolster rather than to undermine the regime under which he lived. [R]</p>
<p>63.1682 DiLEO, Daniel — <bold>Tragedy against tyranny.</bold> <italic>Journal of Politics</italic> 75(1), Jan. 2013: 254–265.</p>
<p>Aristotle's <italic>Poetics</italic> continues the project of <italic>The Politics</italic> and <italic>The Nicomachean Ethics</italic> by encouraging interrogation of the regimes and the habits they instill. Leading citizens to examine their own habits, tragedy can impede the slide of extreme democracies into tyranny. Aristotle held that tragedies such as <italic>Oedipus the Tyrant</italic> and <italic>Iphigenia among the Taurians</italic> encouraged such inquiry. Those plays spoke to the popular piety of their day. Tensions among contradictory elements of that piety posed thought-provoking puzzles to their audiences. The <italic>Poetics</italic> was directed at encouraging playwrights to actualize the interrogative potential of tragedy. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.1683 DONATH, Christian R. — <bold>Liberal art: art and education for citizenship in Kant's critique of judgment.</bold> <italic>Review of Politics</italic> 75(1), Jan. 2013: 3–23.</p>
<p>While most political theorists focus on the role of reflective judgment in Kant's <italic>Critique of Judgment</italic>, the political dimensions of art itself have been overlooked. Kant's treatment of art suggests a consistent political message: art, as an analogy, can teach basic values for citizenship. I examine his hierarchy of the arts, as well as his treatment of genius and taste, arguing that each is informed by Kant's belief in the heuristic capacity of art. [R]</p>
<p>63.1684 DOWDING, Keith — <bold>The role of political argument in justice as impartiality.</bold> <italic>Political Studies</italic> 61(1), March 2013: 67–81.</p>
<p>I uncover the role of rationality, reasons and reasonable agreement in B. Barry's book <italic>Justice as Impartiality [A Treatise on Social Justice</italic>, Oxford, 1995], in part by looking back at his first book, <italic>Political Argument</italic> [New York, 1990]. I specify in what sense the theory provides a universal account of justice and in what sense it is compatible with weak relativism. I argue that it is a liberal theory in two, very different, senses: (1) because of its universalist structure, even though that structure at certain times and places is compatible with what we would now consider as illiberal social justice; (2) because it now entails what we see as liberal principles of justice.

<p>63.1685 DROLET, Jean-François — <bold>Nietzsche, Kant, the democratic state, and war.</bold> <italic>Review of International Studies</italic> 39(1), Jan. 2013: 25–47.</p>
<p>This article reconstructs Nietzsche's critique of Kant's scheme for perpetual peace distilled from his life-long confrontation with Kant's critical philosophy. Nietzsche considered the ethico-political conclusions Kant drew from the basic premises of his critical philosophical project to be both irrational and nihilistic. From Nietzsche's perspective, Kant's thoughts on politics and IR rest on a fundamental misunderstanding of the phenomena of agency, statehood, and war that elides both the tragic relationship between politics and culture, and the violence which Nietzsche believes to be latent in all attempts at reconciling individual with collective autonomy. According to Nietzsche, Kant's influential association between liberal republicanism, freedom, and peace contributed unwittingly in ushering in the cult of the nation-state, which Nietzsche warned would engulf Europe into a wholly new kind of organized violence in the coming decades.

<p>63.1686 EDVINSSON, Rodney — <bold>Den mänskliga naturens politiska ekonomi. Kropotkins till-lämpning av evolutionsläran på samhället (The political economy of human nature — P. Kropotkin's application of the theory of evolution to society).</bold> <italic>Statsvetenskaplig Tidskrift</italic> 114(4), 2012: 553–574.</p>
<p>This paper presents a rational reconstruction of Kropotkin's view on human nature, institutional change and economic development. Kropotkin shows that mutual aid among animals as well as in human society is far more important than recognized by contemporary individualist interpretation of Darwinism on society. His major contribution to political economy is that he offers an endogenous model of why institutions exist. However, his biological determinism and ethical naturalism imply that he disregard historical context, which leads him to <italic>de facto</italic> apply the perspective of historical idealism. The rise of the modern state, for example, he explains by the spread of the “idea of the state” and not by the economic development. [R]</p>
<p>63.1687 EDYVANE, Derek — <bold>Rejecting society: misanthropy, friendship and Montaigne.</bold> <italic>Res Publica (Journal of Legal and Social Philosophy)</italic> 19(1), Feb. 2013: 53–65.</p>
<p>Once a permanent source of instability and injustice, and yet also a valuable support of cherished liberal practices, such as toleration. We must seek therefore to “civilize” the misanthropic temper. Montaigne provides an instructive case study in this context, for he successfully moderated his misanthropy by his conviviality and friendship. The non-conditional character of Montaignean friendship functions to moderate rational misanthropic antipathy and thereby suggests a striking reinterpretation of civic friendship. Montaigne may seem an unpromising ally for contemporary defenders of civic friendship, but in fact his essays provide a valuable resource for the political theory of community.

<p>63.1688 FARNETI, Roberto — <bold>Paradoxes of normativity: on Carl Schmitt's normative scepticism.</bold> <italic>History of Political Thought</italic> 34(1), Spring 2012: 114–142.</p>
<p>Psychological failure to legislate norms from a state of normative <italic>nil</italic> is the core skeptical case that German philosophy had left unsolved, and that after Kant was handed over to each new generation of philosophers, until it exploded with great force in debates that spanned the 1910s. This article provides a context for C. Schmitt's statement that “nobody could ever describe a single person's intentions as a norm”, and to link this kind of normative skepticism with Schmitt's later notion of “exception”. In the face of several attempts to dismiss Schmitt's theory in light of his personal and professional allegiance to the Nazis, this article appeals to the possibility of <italic>consilium pravorum</italic>, the idea that one can learn from someone whose ideas or actions are despicable.

<p>Although I welcome the opportunity to discuss A. Zakaras's fine essay <italic>[Abstr</italic>. 63.1739], I fear that my response will disappoint him (and perhaps others as well). I find his arguments cogent and plausible, if not altogether persuasive, but many of them are directed against claims that I do not think I made. Two examples will suffice. [R]</p>

<p>E. Gentile credits E. Voegelin with having invented the concept of “political religion”, which the latter would use consistently to describe totalitarian regimes. In his <italic>Autobiographical Reflections</italic>, Voegelin indicates that [what] inspired him to adopt [the term was] a literature that interpreted ideological movements as a variety of religions, e.g., L. Rougier, [probably also] J. Maritain, H. de Lubac, and J. Vialatoux. It may appear surprising that Voegelin does not refer to C. Schmitt's <italic>Political Theology</italic> [1922]. Schmitt had also invented a concept destined for a productive career. Moreover, <italic>Political Theology</italic> and Voegelin's <italic>Political Religions</italic> have similar objectives: to show that all political doctrines involve a relationship between mankind and the sacred in one form or another — even (and perhaps especially) those that claim to have eliminated the religious element entirely.

<p>63.1691 HAMEL, Christopher — <bold>The republicanism of John Milton: natural rights, civic virtue and the dignity of man.</bold> <italic>History of Political Thought</italic> 34(1), Spring 2012: 35–65.</p>
<p>This article considers the connection between Milton's republicanism and his use of natural rights language. Based on Milton's understanding of man's dignity, it claims that natural rights and civic virtue are articulated consistently. Inextricably linked to his being created free, the dignity of man is central both in the description of the birth of political society and in the defense of the inalienable right to liberty against tyrannical government. Thus, while not an end in itself, civic virtue nevertheless has an irreducible moral value, for being a virtuous citizen means first of all exercising one's own freedom in a way that complies with the natural dignity of man. [R]</p>
<p>63.1692 HANCOCK, Ralph — <bold>Responsive reason.</bold> <italic>Perspectives on Political Science</italic> 42(1), 2013: 58–60.</p>
<p>Responding to my generous critics, I clarify my view of reason's responsibility and its limits, and I underline my agreement with Strauss on the insuperability of political thinking and thus the impossibility of any neat separation between theory and practice or of any trans-political doctrine of transcendence. Finally, I resist invitations to overcome tensions between vertical and horizontal transcendence and thus to go beyond responsibility to autonomy. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1693]</p>

<p>Tocqueville's brief evocation of a collapse of “moral analogy”, indicates a fundamental defect of modern rationalism and invites us to consider how reason's responsibility might best be understood in our times. Tocqueville's acute moderation provides a touchstone for a self-reflective and responsible understanding of reason that is both theoretically and practically superior to M. Heidegger's deconstruction of Western reason and to L. Strauss's attempt to restore classical rationalism. Reason's responsibility today, both to itself and to the common good, must be attuned to the truth of the fundamental aporia that is the deep spring of Western dynamism, the insuperable tension between a horizon of knowable goodness above common human concerns and the religious hope for or revolutionary promise of the redemption or regeneration of our common humanity.

<p>It is sometimes held that modern institutionally-focused conceptions of social justice are lacking in one essential respect: they ignore the importance of civic friendship or solidarity. It is also, typically simultaneously, held that Aristotle's thought provides a fertile ground for elucidating an account of civic friendship. I argue, first, that Aristotle is no help on this score: he has no conception of distinctively civic friendship. I then argue that the Kantian distinction between perfect and imperfect duties is more useful than talk of civic friendship in capturing the non-institutional demands of social justice.

<p>This article treats Machiavelli's exploration of the two versions (Herodotean and Xenophontic) of Cyrus in his <italic>Prince</italic> and <italic>Discourses</italic>. This article is novel insofar as most commentators on Machiavelli do not treat the fact that there are two Cyruses and that Machiavelli uses them to make different points about princely and republican leadership. The Xenophontic Cyrus serves as an example of humanity — albeit a complicated example — while the Herodotean Cyrus serves as an example of harshness. This article shows how a combination of the Cyruses' humanity and harshness makes for a better model for republican leaders to imitate, and urges a re-education of a republican leader like Scipio, who was inclined to follow only the humane path of the Xenophontic Cyrus.

<p>This paper addresses the problem of how to make “democratic” elements in Aristotle's political philosophy compatible with his aristocratic framework for distributing political authority. It argues that in Aristotle's framework, the idea of aristocratic governance is justified, because it contributes most greatly to the achievement of the well-being of people in a city <italic>(Politics</italic> III.9), or the common benefit of a wide range of free individuals <italic>(Politics</italic> III.6 and 7), and that Aristotle's argument for the wisdom of the multitude <italic>(Politics</italic> III.11) is actually not democratic, but rather aristocratic to the extent that he proposes integrating the multitude into the deliberative and judicial processes by identifying their “virtuous character” as a group, not by offering an idea that human beings are created equal.

<p>This article first reconstructs the “domestic-international nexus” in M. Foucault's account of police and liberalism, and then recovers aspects of the missing international dimension of his analysis of German neoliberalism with recourse to W. Röpke's writing on IR. The upshot of this recovery effort is threefold. (1) The international remains pivotal to (mid-)20th-c. neoliberal governmentality. (2) (German) neoliberalism's association with multiple “international” governmentalities, including liberal and nonliberal ones, exposes neoliberalism as a “promiscuous” mode of governance. (3) German neoliberalism's promiscuity is underwritten by (though not reducible to) a conservative ethos of moderation. More broadly, this article contributes to efforts to theorize the relationship between domestic and international politics, and to understand neoliberalism as a “variegated” phenomenon.

<p>In “Two Concepts of Liberty”, Berlin wavered between two readings of the concept of positive liberty. In the first, those who advocate liberty in the negative sense and those who advocate it in the positive sense speak about different things. In the second reading, negative and positive liberty are competing interpretations of the same concept, the defenders of negative liberty being involved in a substantive disagreement with the advocates of positive liberty on what “liberty” really means. On this understanding, negative liberty is a genuine value, positive liberty being nothing but the perversion of it. My article uncovers the roots of this ambiguity in unresolved difficulties in Berlin's account of the history of the ideas of negative and positive liberty and, more importantly, in his conception of value pluralism.

<p>It has become increasingly common to interpret Hume as a “skeptic” of practical reason. This means that Hume supposedly contests, not only the ability of reason to provide demonstrable truths, in the conventional rationalist sense, but also reason's ability to guide our practical action. Proponents of this reading include J. Hampton, E. Millgram and Chr. Korsgaard. If this “skeptical reading” of Hume is correct, he would lack the philosophical resources to justify his account of political justice. However, if examined further, this skeptical reading begins with deep-seated Kantian presuppositions about the role and function of practical reason. The paper critiques these presuppositions, arguing that they must be set aside in order to appreciate more fully how Hume does indeed have a proper theory of practical reason. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>It is 100 years since Swedish philosopher A. Hägerström started his research project, demystifying objective values in religion, morals and law. His work dealt eminently with political theory and social critique, being a forerunner of M. Foucault, attacking established society and its legitimation myths. The evaluation of Hägerström has focused too much on his general epistemology/ontology, neglecting his influential social critique of the ideological hegemony of the “bourgeoisie”. One may argue, I dare suggest, that his political theory and social philosophy was more original and coherent than his theoretical philosophy. It is time for a re-evaluation of this major modernization theoretician. [R]</p>

<p>This paper demonstrates the relevance of the Aristotelian notion of civic friendship to contemporary political discussion by arguing that it can function as a social good. Contrary to some dominant interpretations of the ancient conception of friendship according to which it can only be understood as an obligatory reciprocity, I argue that friendship between fellow citizens is important because it contributes to the unity of both state and community by transmitting feelings of intimacy and solidarity. In that sense, it can be understood as an important relationship predicated on affection and generosity, virtues lacking from both contemporary politics and society that seem to be merely dominated by Post-Enlightenment ideals. For Aristotle, friendship is important for society because it generates concord, articulating thus a basis for social unity and political agreement. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1670]</p>

<p>In the recent explosion of literature on L. Strauss, authors have identified or alleged many different kinds of Straussians. This article analyzes a previously unmentioned kind: Christian Straussians. It analyzes the work of R. Hancock to see if Hancock is a Christian friend of Strauss or a Straussian friend of Christianity. The difference is whether his primary anchor is in philosophy with an affinity to Christianity or in theology with an affinity to Strauss. While Hancock avers great differences from Strauss on both the theoretical and practical levels, this essay argues that while Hancock's practical disagreements with Strauss are strong, his theoretical difference is ambiguous.

<p>Employing the theoretical framework of constitutive rhetoric, this paper explores Chinese conceptions of democracy by examining Mao Zedong's speeches and writings. This rhetorical examination shows how democracy is understood, defined, and conceptualized in China. Several themes from Mao's most famous speeches and writings are discussed in the light of his concept of democratic centralism. The rhetorical analysis supports the notion that Chinese communism includes democracy, as purported by Mao; however, this culturally unique form of democracy (i.e., democratic centralism) does not match the representative form of democracy employed in the West. Understanding that democracy is conceptualized distinctly by Chinese communist followers of Mao may provide insight for future international studies and relations. [R]</p>
<p>63.1705 LYNCH, Christopher — <bold>On Plato's political philosophy.</bold> <italic>Perspectives on Political Science</italic> 42(1), 2013: 21–26.</p>
<p>M. Blitz's <italic>Plato's Political Philosophy</italic> [Baltimore, 2010] is reviewed with special attention to two recurring themes: (1) how the knowledge of parts and wholes in general and of political parts and wholes in particular relate to the philosophic attempt to know the whole itself; (2) philosophy's relation to piety and, in particular, how the attempt to know the whole, as understood by Blitz, relates to the fundamental opposition between piety and philosophy. Attention to these themes helps to explain peculiarities of Blitz's approach, especially his greater emphasis on articulating the entire “realm of political philosophy” than on explicating individual dialogues and his tendency to connect and divide Platonic thoughts, themes, and problems rather than to bore into individual Socratic problems.

<p>C. Schmitt (1888–1985), one of the most talked-about legal theorists of the 20th c., argued that a society could survive an existential threat only through the exercise of coercive power by the state.

<p>There is much to be commended in J. Habermas's suggestions for the relaxation of the constraints on public liberalism and the idealized norms of deliberative democratic debate in his proposals to introduce new institutional spaces that will facilitate the engagement between what he calls “religious” and “secular” citizens in his writings on “post-secular” societies. The article examines the parallels between Habermas's proposed democratic innovations, which will facilitate the introduction of “situated knowledges” through proposing what I.M. Young calls “communicative leveling”, within the context of criticisms of secularism, public realism and the critiques of the idealized norms of deliberative democracy. However, there is also a certain convergence between Habermas's theoretical interventions and the “instrumental engagement” of governments with minority religious communities in the post-9/11 [2001] context.

<p>This article focuses on R. Hancock's account of the origins and nature of modernity and his claim that Tocqueville exemplifies the best way to work through the crisis of modernity. It then suggests that Hancock's own reflections on the nature of human existence require a more balanced or even positive assessment of modernity than the one he offers in the book.

<p>This paper argues that the direct, vertical toleration of certain types of citizen by the Rawlsian liberal state is appropriate and required in circumstances in which these types of citizen pose a threat to the stability of the state. By countering the claim that vertical toleration is redundant given a commitment to the Rawlsian version of the liberal democratic ideal, and by articulating a version of that ideal that shows this claim to be false, the paper reaffirms the centrality of vertical toleration in the Rawlsian liberal account of state-citizen relations.

<p>In the controversy over J. Rawls and global justice, cosmopolitans of equality claim that the Standard Case requires a global extension of both domestic original position and demanding political duties to reduce inequality of opportunity and promote material expectations of the worst-off. They are wrong. Their challenge, however, illuminates the central role of certain fundamental interests, ingredients in what Rawls seems to associate with the “true human needs” to which Kant refers in the <italic>Metaphysics of Morals</italic> (1795). Cosmopolitanism of need that does not insist on global egalitarianism but affirms a more demanding political duty could likewise be coherently rejected by a domestic Rawlsian. By relying on specific features of the modern state, such an argument reduces the gap between Rawls's liberal egalitarianism and libertarianism.</p>

<p>The paper investigates the promise of Schmitt's concept of <italic>nomos</italic> for developing new spatial imaginaries apposite to the study of “the border” in contemporary political life, as per the aims of the “Lines in the Sand” research agenda. Schmitt introduced the idea of a <italic>“nomos</italic> of the earth” to refer to the fundamental relation between space and political order. There have been various historical expressions of the <italic>nomos</italic>, from the <italic>Respublica Christiana</italic>, to the <italic>Jus Publicum Europaeum</italic>, to a post-World War II (dis)order yet to be adequately theorized. We explore the relatively overlooked spatial ontology of Schmitt's work and suggest ways in which it might prompt alternative ways of thinking about borders and bordering practices as representative of broader dynamics in the relation between space and political order.

<p>A major debate within libertarian thought concerns the need for a centralized state structure to sustain the norms governing agents' behavior in society. Minarchists support state monopolies over the means of coercion to ensure that society abides by these norms, whereas free-market anarchists consider such monopolies damaging and unnecessary, with norms maintained by agents' natural motivations. This article finds that the libertarian “pre-political” principles which free-market anarchists adopt lack objectivity and plausible independence, creating a fundamental tension between the endorsement of a libertarian morality and anarchist commitments to pluralism of legal and political structures. It suggests that libertarians place a core, shared value on individual agency, but that this value can be universalized only through political processes of discussion and agreement, and sustained only in the presence of institutional sanction and coercion mechanisms.

<p>The author illuminates the nature of sovereignty in Schmitt. The decision precedes metaphysical justifications and is not as a command but as an instantiation of the popular will that always sanctions it, if only indirectly. Subsequently, he turns to the aesthetic theory of J. Dewey, so as to fill in the gaps of Schmitt's idea of the implicit representational character of sovereignty. The interpretation of an artwork as a nexus between the individual and the collective parallels the notion of the decision as a bridge between the deciding agent and the popular will that lends it legitimacy.

<p>In his <italic>Just and Unjust Wars</italic> [New York, 1977], M. Walzer claims that his theory of just war is based on the rights of individuals to life and liberty. This is not the case. Walzer in fact bases his theory of <italic>jus ad bellum</italic> on the supreme rights of supra-individual political communities. According to his theory of <italic>jus ad bellum</italic>, the rights of political communities are of utmost importance, and individuals can be sacrificed for the sake of these communal rights. According to his theory of <italic>jus in bello</italic>, the rights of individuals are of utmost importance, and political communities can never permissibly violate them in war. Thus, Walzer's theory of just war is based on two incompatible theories of justice. This explains why Walzer's theory produces incoherent practical prescriptions in cases of supreme emergencies.

<p>Rather than contrasted exclusively with perfectionism, neutrality should be opposed to a broader range of uses of political power. Instead of treating it as a strict prohibition, it could further be characterized as a significant <italic>pro tanto</italic> constraint. Rather than picking between neutrality of effects and intentions, one should focus on neutrality of treatment. Lastly, a guiding normative idea should be that persons should have a fair opportunity to be self-determining. Thus, a reinterpretation of neutrality is possible that drops each of the four standard framing assumptions and concludes with a view that is more coherent and powerful than the one pictured by critics. It then becomes plausible to think of neutrality as imposing a significant constraint on the policies of the liberal state.</p>

<p>I argue that I. M. Young provides a substantially new model of responsibility that provides a way out of the standard debate regarding whether and the extent to which individuals have responsibilities for justice. This debate, best represented in an exchange of essays between G. A. Cohen and Th. Pogge, hinges on the causal efficacy of the bearers of responsibility for justice. By distinguishing herself from both Cohen's individualism and Pogge's institutionalism, Young provides an enhanced way to conceptualize the responsibilities that individuals have towards justice in a non-ideal world in which they have limited causal impact.

<p>One of the main shortcomings of deliberative democracy is its estrangement from everyday politics.

<p>L. Wittgenstein and M. Oakeshott are often labeled conservative thinkers, and taken to theorize rigid limits to individual agency and criticism. Tracing several modes of affinity between the work of Wittgenstein and Oakeshott, one can recognize the conventionality and rule-governed character of linguistic practices and yet affirm a deeply individualistic account of agency and action. Each thinker respectively characterizes the individual as located within a context of action that is richly structured by intersubjective rules and practices. Yet each also recognizes an ineluctable dimension of individuality and contingency to action that surpasses mere rule following or the reprise of conventional practice. Wittgenstein and Oakeshott thus present a perspective on political agency and criticism that is a salient alternative to both conservative and radical views. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The essay is a “personal impression” of Berlin and his liberalism, beginning with some intellectual biography, and turning to the question of how the way Berlin wrote about political ideas illuminates the liberalism he espoused. The essay discounts Berlin's self-description as a historian of ideas who had abandoned philosophy, and follows Bernard Williams in arguing that the historicity of our political values demands a dialogical approach to their analysis in which we engage with our forebears and contemporaries in an essentially conversational mode. The claim is illustrated with Berlin's engagement with Alexander Herzen and Romanticism. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1675]</p>

<p>With its ascendancy in American political discourse during the past few years, hope has become a watchword of politics, yet the rhetoric has failed to inquire into the actual function of hope in political life. This essay examines <italic>elpis</italic>, the Greek word for “hope”, in Thucydides' <italic>History</italic>, and offers a theoretical account of this concept and its connection to successful political action. I suggest that a complex understanding of hope structures Thucydides' narrative: hope counts as among the most dangerous political delusions, yet it also offers the only possible response to despair. Thucydides' text educates his readers' judgment, chastening hope while showing its importance despite its flaws. The <italic>History</italic> thus offers an alternative for considering the politics of hope, one that challenges hope's ardent proponents today. [R]</p>

<p>R. Hancock has written a superb book — comprehensive in scope, elegant in argument, and animated by a sustained and powerful vision. Each chapter reflects deep and searching reflection on thinkers whose ongoing significance for we liberal democrats can hardly be overstated. The hero of the book is Tocqueville; and not least of the book's charms, a claim to originality, rests on what Hobbes might have called “the magnification” of that hero to a level comparable to that of L. Strauss and M. Heidegger to whom Tocqueville is here compared to his own advantage. Questions posed by this article include: Hancock's exploitation of the term “moral analogy”, the adequacy of his vertical/horizontal metaphor, and whether he does full justice to Strauss's treatment of the moral life.

<p>Hancock distinguishes two “axes of transcendence”, vertical and horizontal, characteristic of ancient and modern philosophy, respectively, and settles for a mixed regime in which both can stake their claim. Praising Tocqueville and Heidegger for their trenchant analyses of the modern problem, Hancock criticizes the effort by L. Strauss and his “High Straussian” disciples to restore classical political philosophy as post-Christian, that is, denying rather than acknowledging Christian insight. Regarding Strauss, I think the criticism misfires, for Strauss's adage to understand authors as they understood themselves allows Christianity, too, to appear as fresh as the classical authors to whom the early Christians responded. To settle the responsibility of reason in our time requires coming to terms with the achievements as well as the limits of modern science, the epitome of reason to most modern men.

<p>This is a contribution to the systematic understanding of Schmittian thinking on the notions of historicity and modernity that have weighed heavily on German historians born between the two world wars. Schmitt's political theory using the friend-enemy pair is based on a particular conception of history and the modern era. Schmitt describes modernity whose meaning determines the clarity and intensity of history itself, as a period of decline, ending in the advent of neutralization and depoliticization carried along by liberalism. To resist this “acceleration” of time spiritually, there is no alternative but to draw from the source of a mythical and theological conceptuality, which only can keep history in movement.

<p>63.1727 STRANGE, Gerard — <bold>Understanding the fundamentals of capital, the crisis and the alternatives: Marx's legacy beyond revolutionary Marxism.</bold> <italic>British Journal of Politics and International Relations</italic> 15(1), Feb. 2013: 107–124.</p>
<p>This article critically engages with P. Burnham's [“Class, capital and crisis: A return to fundamentals”, <italic>Political Studies Review</italic>, 8(1), Jan. 2010: 27–39; <italic>Abstr</italic>. 60.1517], [referring] specifically to Marx as a basis for understanding the global financial crisis and its still unfolding aftermath. It criticizes Burnham's “Open Marxist” account of Marx's capital theory and his reading of the crisis in terms of “depoliticization” and the reassertion of the law of value over the state. It focuses on Schumpeterian and Keynesian theories of crisis and crisis-management as derived from fundamentals. It argues that Keynes, in particular, offered a theory of crisis that, while consistent with Marx's circuit theory of capital, was also distinct in its focus on money. How the current global crisis is ultimately resolved depends crucially on understanding both the limits and possibilities for the repoliticization of money in the post-neoliberal era. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.1728 TSENG, Roy — <bold>Scepticism in politics: a dialogue between Michael Oakeshott and John Dunn.</bold> <italic>History of Political Thought</italic> 34(1), Spring 2012: 143–170.</p>
<p>Although they hold different political positions, Oakeshott and Dunn actually share in common a skeptical reading of the human condition and the nature of politics. There are, however, two skeptical traditions within the British context that they seem, respectively, to have followed: the Humean autonomy of practice and the Lockean quest for guidance. It is hoped that by tracing their sources back to Hume and Locke, Oakeshott's and Dunn's conflicting views on the theory of practical reason, namely the detachment view versus the engagement view, can be well explicated, and that the differentia between the “right” and the “left” can be philosophically reconsidered.

<p>I propose a critical reading of Rousseau's critique of representative politics on new grounds: not in the name of more participatory democracy versus representative democracy, but in that of representation as part of democratic politics rather than an expedient. Rousseau's political view suggests a healthy mistrust in a system of indirectness (representative democracy) that makes opinion and thus judgment central and even more important than will, and in this way opens the door to new forms of political presence (passive rather than active) and of inequality (that of voice and indirect influence). Contemporary plebiscite of the audience and the unbalanced power of the means of opinion-formation are the loci of the kind of “indirect” power that Rousseau's mistrust in representation allows us to see in their perverse potentials.

<p>The aim of this essay is to analyze the concept of power in the “genealogical” moment of Foucault's work in order to highlight some features of what the author understands by politics. The notion of power is outlined by means of a contrast with the traditional perspective in political thought in order to go into the categories used in his analytics of power. Finally, some notes on Foucault's concept of politics are provided [R]</p>
<p>63.1731 VERNON, Richard — <bold>Lockean toleration: dialogical not theological?</bold> <italic>Political Studies</italic> 61(1), March 2013: 215–230.</p>
<p>It is often claimed that the idea of toleration emerged from and depends upon a Protestant context that limits its usefulness today. These claims implicate the political thought of John Locke, clearly a key figure for the history of toleration, and also an emphatically Protestant one. J. Waldron's <italic>God, Locke and Equality</italic> argues that the idea of equality on which Locke based his case cannot be separated from its religious foundations. Taking issue with Waldron's view, I argue that in defending toleration Locke advanced an idea of equality that may be termed “dialogical”, in that it rested on the equality that is necessarily presupposed by argumentative exchange. While that idea of equality is fully consistent with Locke's Protestantism, it does not depend upon it. Rather, it depends on the minimum requirements of shared citizenship. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.1732 VRASTI, Wanda — <bold>Universal but not truly “global”: governmentality, economic liberalism, and the international.</bold> <italic>Review of International Studies</italic> 39(1), Jan. 2013: 49–69.</p>
<p>This article responds to issues raised about global governmentality studies by J. Selby, J. Joseph, and D. Chandler, especially regarding the implications of “scaling up” a concept originally designed to describe the politics of advanced liberal societies to the international realm. In response to these charges, I argue that critics have failed to take full stock of M. Foucault's contribution to the study of global liberalism, which owes more to economic than political liberalism. Taking Foucault's economic liberalism seriously — shifting the focus from questions of natural rights, legitimate rule, and territorial security to matters of government, population management, and human betterment — reveals how liberalism operates as a universal, albeit not yet global, measure of truth, best illustrated by the workings of global capital.

<p>63.1733 WALSH, David — <bold>Theory and practice as responsibility.</bold> <italic>Perspectives on Political Science</italic> 42(1), 2013: 47–50.</p>
<p>R. Hancock's felicitous term “the responsibility of reason” opens a significant revision within political theory. It places primacy in practical reason and reminds us that theory is itself a mode of practice. He finds the deepest affirmation of this insight in Tocqueville's elevation of the art of association into the first principle of the science by which politics is comprehended. There is no science of politics apart from the exercise of responsibility itself. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1693]</p>
<p>63.1734 WALZER, Michael — <bold>Should we reclaim political utopianism?</bold> <italic>European Journal of Political Theory</italic> 12(1), Jan. 2013: 24–30.</p>
<p>Isaiah Berlin welcomed the decline of political utopianism and was eager to help it along. But there are reasons to think that occasional moments of utopian aspiration and enthusiasm are necessary to sustain even moderate liberal regimes. In all such regimes there are “natural” tendencies towards authoritarianism and hierarchy, which have to be resisted. And it is hard to image a successful resistance that isn't fueled by something very like political utopianism. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1675]</p>
<p>63.1735 WATSON, Matthew — <bold>The eighteenth-century historiographic tradition and contemporary “Everyday IPE [international Political Economy]”.</bold> <italic>Review of International Studies</italic> 39(1), Jan. 2013: 1–23.</p>
<p>This article focuses on Adam Smith's largely sympathetic response to the Rousseauian critique of the moral degeneracy of modern “economic man”. It thus emphasizes his philosophical ambivalence towards commercial society over the textbook IPE presentations which ascribe to him an almost wholly unreflexive market advocacy. It provides important methodological lessons for the study of Everyday IPE today. However unwittingly, contemporary Everyday IPE scholars are the spiritual heirs of the 18th c. move from writing public histories of the state to writing private histories of unnamed individuals who embody the most recent phase of human sociability. The 18th c. economic man was conceptualized in relation to evolving forms of economic organization, where the economy in turn was thought to reflect the prevailing system of “manners”. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.1736 WELBURN, Dominic — <bold>Rawls, the well-ordered society and intergenerational justice.</bold> <italic>Politics</italic> 33(1), Feb. 2013: 56–65.</p>
<p>This article outlines the contribution J. Rawls's “well-ordered society” makes to the ongoing discourse of intergenerational justice. Can Rawls's “realistically utopian” vision of a well-ordered society, a society comprising just institutions that embody the goods of liberty and individual self-authorship of the good life, secure justice between the generations? By considering the totality of the Rawlsian project rather than specific sections of his work such as his “just savings principle”, it is possible to assess the ability of ideal liberal theory to guarantee the rights of future citizens while simultaneously addressing pressing environmental crises, the most notable of which being climate change.

<p>63.1737 WILKIN, Peter — <bold>George Orwell: the English dissident as Tory anarchist.</bold> <italic>Political Studies</italic> 61(1), March 2013: 197–214.</p>
<p>This article examines the nature of Orwell's Tory anarchism, a term that he used to describe himself until his experiences in Spain in 1936. I argue that the qualities that made Orwell a Tory anarchist remained with him, even after his commitment to democratic socialism. The article describes Tory anarchism as a practice rather than a coherent political ideology, and examines the relationship between E. Blair, the Tory anarchist, and Orwell, the democratic socialist. It makes the case for his Tory anarchism by drawing out recurring themes in his work that connect him to other Tory anarchist figures such as his contemporary E. Waugh. Thus Tory anarchism is presented as a conservative moral critique of the modern world that can connect figures who hold quite radically different political beliefs. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.1738 YACK, Bernard — <bold>The significance of Isaiah Berlin's Counter Enlightenment.</bold> <italic>European Journal of Political Theory</italic> 12(1), Jan. 2013: 49–60.</p>
<p>This paper [examines] Berlin's claim that the emergence of Counter-Enlightenment pluralism marks a momentous historical watershed. Berlin seriously misinterprets this event's significance. He treats Herder as “the most formidable adversary of the French <italic>philosophes</italic> and their German disciples”, but not because Herder put a stop to the ancient creed of monism on which they relied. For Berlin's monistic interpretation of the French Enlightenment badly misrepresents that intellectual movement and its impact on the world. The great significance of Herder's pluralist critique of the Enlightenment lies, instead, in the way in which it rehabilitates prejudice as a source of human virtue and creativity, a critique that directly attacks the core mission of the philosophes: to remove the obstacles to the gathering, preservation and dissemination of useful knowledge.

<p>63.1739 ZAKARAS, Alex — <bold>A liberal pluralism: Isaiah Berlin and John Stuart Mill.</bold> <italic>Review of Politics</italic> 75(1), Jan. 2013: 69–96.</p>
<p>The essay explores the relationship between value pluralism, as Isaiah Berlin understood it, and liberalism. I first argue that value pluralism does not entail liberalism, and I criticize two philosophers — W. Galston and G. Crowder — who believe that it does. I [then] reconstruct and defend Berlin's own understanding of this relationship, drawing on an essay often neglected by Berlin's interpreters: “John Stuart Mill and the Ends of Life”. Berlin thought that the relationship between value pluralism and liberalism was largely psychological. He believed that those who embraced value pluralism would be more likely to affirm liberal institutions, because they would be more likely to exhibit certain virtues — notably empathy, imagination, and openness to other ways of life — that typically motivate tolerance.
