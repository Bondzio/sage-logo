<p>A major theme running through this issue is the exploration of emotional, moral, and social issues of young ‘gifted’ people. A second theme explores the dichotomy between optimism and pessimism, while a third theme argues for the importance of creativity and problem-solving with the essential components of metacognition, self-esteem, and self-confidence.</p>
<p>The importance of living with an ethical set of values is emphasized by Robert Sternberg. He suggests that many people identified as gifted through traditional means are nevertheless lacking in ethics, partly because current patterns of socialization may not reward them for the development of ethical patterns of behaviour. He suggests that the result of this has been catastrophic for the world, and he cites a number of leaders who have lacked true moral and ethical qualities necessary for wise, humane leadership.</p>
<p>Janet Davidson asks if giftedness is really a gift. She argues that we do not know exactly what giftedness is nor how best to identify it. Moreover, we do not always take care of ‘the gift’, even when we know the potential is there – but there is no user’s manual that tells parents and teachers how to make the most of ‘giftedness’, which often carries the burden of high expectations. Furthermore, not all gifted children want to be identified as ‘gifted’ because of the stigma and isolation that can result from such labelling.</p>
<p>Studies dealing with the effect of optimism and pessimism have found that whereas optimism usually has a positive correlation with academic achievements, pessimism has a negative correlation with achievements in different domains, including academic performance. Shlomo Kaniel outlines the main theories in the field of optimism/pessimism and presents a model that integrates both theories, adding different styles of thought processing and levels of confidence in order to understand the way students evaluate their achievements.</p>
<p>A thorough overview of creativity and its characteristics is presented by Jill Forster, who urges schools and universities to encourage creative thinking and problem-solving as essential characteristics of any curriculum development. Jill examines the concepts of the creative <italic>process </italic>of thinking of ideas; the <italic>product </italic>that is valued in a particular <italic>context</italic>; and the <italic>person</italic> possessing the characteristics of the creative thinker.</p>
