<p><bold>Objective</bold>. This study aimed to compare postoperative pain and surgical outcomes after transumbilical single-port access (SPA) and conventional multiport laparoscopic surgery for adnexal lesions. <bold>Methods</bold>. A retrospective case–control study was conducted matched by age, body mass index, and frequency of previous abdominal surgery. A total of 110 SPA laparoscopy patients (cases) were matched with a cohort of 107 patients who underwent conventional laparoscopy (controls) for benign adnexal lesions. SPA system consisted of a wound retractor, surgical glove, two 5-mm trocars, and one 11-mm trocar. Postoperative pain scores were measured immediately after surgery and at 6, 24, and 48 hours postsurgery using the numerical rating scale. <bold>Results</bold>. Postoperative pain scores did not differ between the 2 groups (<italic>P</italic> = .552). However, higher number of painkiller administrations was observed in the SPA laparoscopy group (median 3 vs 1, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The type of surgery and intraoperative blood loss were the significant factors influencing the number of painkiller administrations after controlling for other parameters by linear regression (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). The SPA laparoscopy group had less intraoperative blood loss (45.3 vs 87.5 mL, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and shorter hospital stay (2.1 ± 0.8 vs 2.7 ± 1.0 days, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) compared with the conventional laparoscopy group. Operative time and perioperative complications did not differ between groups. <bold>Conclusions</bold>. There was no difference in pain intensity between the SPA and conventional laparoscopic group in this study. Future trials are warranted to better define the benefits of SPA surgery in terms of postoperative pain.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Laparoscopy has several advantages over laparotomy, including shorter length of hospital stay, faster return to normal activities, aesthetic enhancements, and reduced pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612439632">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612439632">2</xref></sup> These benefits of laparoscopy have driven efforts to achieve further minimally invasive procedures in an attempt to improve postoperative outcomes by reducing the size and number of incisions. The rationale is that using smaller and/or fewer number of ports may cause less trauma to the abdominal wall and internal organs and, consequently, reduce stress response related to surgical complications and postoperative pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612439632">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this context, single-port access (SPA) laparoscopic surgery as a less invasive access technique has been introduced in the field of gynecology and is consistently improving with advances in surgical instrumentation and technique. Among several advantages of minimally invasive SPA laparoscopic surgery compared with conventional multiport laparoscopy, the most expected benefit may be improved cosmesis, with surgical incision hidden in the umbilicus rather than having multiple abdominal incisions. Also, several studies have demonstrated that less postoperative pain is associated with a reduction in the size or number of ancillary ports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612439632">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612439632"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612439632">6</xref></sup> So far, SPA laparoscopic surgery have been performed for tubal ligation, total and supracervical hysterectomy, adnexectomy, myomectomy, removal of ectopic pregnancies, and pelvic lymph node sampling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612439632">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612439632"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612439632"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612439632"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612439632"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350612439632"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350612439632"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612439632">14</xref></sup> However, previous analyses regarding reduction of postoperative pain are mostly retrospective and limited in the number of cases for adequate evaluation. A recent randomized prospective study conducted by our group on SPA laparoscopic hysterectomy showed that the reduction of postoperative pain is not evident compared with the conventional multiport approach. This finding brought us to question the advantage of SPA laparoscopic surgery in terms of postoperative pain.</p>
<p>Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to evaluate whether SPA laparoscopic adnexal surgery, which is generally considered as a less complex pelvic surgery compared with hysterectomy, improves postoperative pain outcomes compared with conventional multiport adnexal surgery. As a secondary objective, we sought to compare other perioperative outcomes between these two surgical approaches.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Yonsei University College of Medicine. We evaluated 217 patients who underwent SPA laparoscopy (n = 110, cases) or conventional laparoscopy (n = 107, control) for benign adnexal diseases from October 2007 to May 2010 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine in Seoul, Korea. Cases (SPA laparoscopy group) were matched for age, body mass index (BMI), frequency of previous abdominal surgery, and the type of surgery. SPA laparoscopic surgery has been performed for adnexectomy and hysterectomy in our institution since 2008, along with conventional laparoscopic surgeries using 3 or 4 ports.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria of the study were planned adnexectomy for benign lesions, patients with adequate medical conditions for laparoscopic surgery (American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System 1-2), no evidence of gynecologic malignancy on imaging studies, and CA-125 of 150 IU/mL or less. Since this study was conducted primarily to evaluate postoperative pain along with surgical outcomes, patients who underwent additional procedures, such as endometrial curettage, hysteroscopy, or myomectomy at the time of adnexectomy, and SPA cases, who were converted to conventional laparoscopy, were excluded. Also, patients with existing symptomatic gynecological conditions that may have influence on pain intensity, for example, tubo-ovarian abscess, ovarian cyst torsion, ruptured tubal pregnancy, or hemorrhagic cysts with hemoperitoneum, were excluded. Data pertaining to patient characteristics (age, BMI, and general health status), type and duration of surgery, presence of pelvic adhesion, estimated blood loss, adnexal lesion size, postoperative pain scores, perioperative complications, number of time painkillers were administered after surgery, and length of hospital stay were collected. Operative time was defined as the time from umbilical skin incision to completion of skin closure.</p>
<p>All adnexal surgeries were performed by 2-surgeon teams. After general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. A uterine elevator was placed to be manipulated by the second assistant. A single-multichannel port system was made using the Alexis wound retractor (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA) and a surgical glove as described in our previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350612439632">13</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612439632">Figure 1</xref>) Briefly, approximately a 1.2- to 2.0-cm vertical intraumbilical skin incision along with a 1.5- to 2.0-cm rectus fasciotomy were performed to insert the wound retractor into the peritoneal cavity. A size 7½ surgical glove was fixed to the outer ring of the wound retractor and was rolled up with the wrist portion of the surgical glove. Three holes were made, each in the finger tip portions of the glove, to admit two 5-mm and one 11-mm trocars. We used a rigid 30°, 5-mm laparoscope for both the SPA and conventional procedures. Surgical instruments used were bipolar forceps, monopolar scissors or L-hook, atraumatic forceps, toothed grasper, and a suction–irrigation system. The Ligasure system (Covidien, Valleylab, Boulder, CO) was used if needed at the discretion of the surgeon. The procedure and surgical instruments used were similar in 4-port conventional laparoscopic surgery as described in our previous report,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350612439632">13</xref></sup> except for a 10-mm trocar placement in the umbilicus for specimen extraction.</p>

<p>Postoperative pain intensity was rated at rest using a numerical rating scale (NRS). Patients were asked to rate their pain intensity immediately after surgery in the recovery unit and at 6, 24, and 48 hours after surgery on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 represents <italic>no pain</italic> and 10 represents <italic>worst pain possible</italic>, using whole numbers. Intraoperative analgesia consisted of intravenous fentanyl (100 µg) and ketorolac tromethamine (60 mg). Only patients without patient-controlled analgesia were included in the study. After surgery, intravenous analgesia (60 mg ketorolac tromethamine) was given on demand. Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were given 3 times daily during the hospital stay when the patient started diet intake around postoperative day 1. Five-day discharge medication was dispensed. Patients were discharged from the hospital when they were mobile with well-controlled pain, tolerated an oral diet, and resumed normal bowel and urinary functions.</p>
<p>For statistical analysis, Student’s <italic>t</italic> test and Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test were used for parametric and nonparametric variables, respectively. Differences between proportions were compared with the χ<sup>2</sup> test, and categorical data were analyzed by using Fisher’s exact test. A <italic>P</italic> value of less than .05 was regarded as statistically significant. Since pain scores were measured repeatedly in the same patient, the measurements were assumed to be correlated. Therefore, linear mixed model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350612439632">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350612439632">16</xref></sup> was fitted with the pain intensity data to test for the treatment effect and to estimate differences between the two groups across several measurement occasions. The following estimates were considered in this model: age, BMI, estimated blood loss, total operative time, mass size, and treatment method (type of surgical approach). Factors associated with the number of painkiller administrations were analyzed by linear regression analysis. Statistical analysis was performed with PASW statistics 18.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In total, 217 patients were included in this study; 110 in the SPA laparoscopic surgery group and 107 in the conventional laparoscopic adnexal surgery group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350612439632">Table 1</xref>). The most common surgical indication in both groups was ovarian endometriotic cyst. Age, BMI, previous history of abdominal surgery, and operative procedures were matched between the groups. There were higher number of bilateral adnexal lesions in the conventional laparoscopic group (13.6% in SPA vs 19.6% in conventional laparoscopic group; <italic>P</italic> = .014). Surgical outcomes are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1553350612439632">Table 2</xref>. There was no significant difference in the median operative time between the SPA and the conventional laparoscopic group (57.5 and 53.0 minutes, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .159). The majority of tumor size ranged between 5 and 9 cm, and the distribution in lesion size was not significantly different between the two groups. Ovarian cystectomy and cyst enucleation were the most common procedures in both groups. The estimated amount of operative blood loss was greater in patients treated with conventional laparoscopy (median = 100 mL, interquartile range = 50-100 mL) than in those treated with SPA laparoscopy (median = 5 mL, interquartile range = 5-50 mL; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). There was no difference in perioperative complications between the two groups (4/110 [3.6%] in the SPA group vs 3/107 [2.8%] in the conventional laparoscopic group; <italic>P</italic> = .491). There was one case of bladder injury in the conventional laparoscopy group, which was successfully repaired laparoscopically. One patient in the conventional group developed hematoma in one of the ancillary trocar site, which resolved spontaneously with postoperative transfusion. The SPA laparoscopy group had a slightly shorter postoperative hospital stay (2.1 ± 0.8 vs 2.7 ± 1.0 days; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) compared with the conventional laparoscopy group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that SPA laparoscopic approach has no benefit in the reduction of postoperative pain compared with conventional 4-port laparoscopic surgery for adnexal lesions. However, SPA laparoscopy is a feasible approach for adnexectomy with comparable surgical outcomes, including operative time, length of hospital stay, and perioperative complications with reduced intraoperative blood loss.</p>
<p>There have been extensive studies on minilaparoscopic procedures in nongynecologic surgical specialties, such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Several authors have reported that downsizing either all ports or only ancillary instruments resulted in equal or better surgical outcomes, including less postoperative pain, faster recovery, and more desirable cosmetic outcomes than that of conventional procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612439632">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612439632">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612439632">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350612439632">18</xref></sup> In the gynecologic setting, there are only limited publications on the role of microlaparoscopy in advanced pelvic surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350612439632">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350612439632"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1553350612439632"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1553350612439632">22</xref></sup> However, recent trend focuses on SPA laparoscopic surgery as yet another innovation in minimally invasive gynecologic procedure in the similar context as microlaparoscopy by reducing the overall size of abdominal incisions. Since the implementation of SPA laparoscopy in 2008 at our institution, an increasing number of cases have been performed in an attempt to achieve better cosmetic and postoperative pain outcomes. Therefore, these factors were evaluated in this study for several reasons. First, SPA laparoscopic surgery is a feasible approach for the treatment of adnexal lesions as previously reported, and in our experience, it is particularly useful for specimen removal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612439632">9</xref></sup> Second, it seemed rational to evaluate postoperative pain in a less complex pelvic procedure such as adnexectomy rather than hysterectomy. Adnexal surgery theoretically incorporates minimal confounding factors that may affect pain intensity—that is, large transvaginal uterine removal that may cause stretching or injury to the vagina, relatively longer operative times, and increased intraoperative bleeding because of technical difficulties—in the case of hysterectomy.</p>
<p>In this study, the pain intensities measured by NRS were slightly lower in the SPA group at postoperative 6 hours and only minimally higher than that of conventional group after postoperative 24 hours, although this difference had no statistical significance. The overall pain intensity was commonly low or moderate throughout the postoperative period (ranging from mean NRS scores of 1.0 to 3.6) in both groups, and this finding may be related to analgesic administration. Therefore, the frequency and the amount of medication administered on patients’ demand were evaluated as well. To our surprise, the number of intravenous painkiller (60 mg ketorolac tromethamine) administrations was higher in the SPA laparoscopic group despite any statistical difference in the NRS scores at discrete time points. This finding is difficult to explain clinically since pain is a subjective perception that may be influenced by a combination of demographic and psychosocial factors, as well as the patient’s past pain experience and expectations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1553350612439632">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1553350612439632"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1553350612439632">25</xref></sup> In fact, the number of times painkiller was administered ranged from no administration to as much as 10 times during the postoperative period (data not shown). Since incision size is only one of the many factors that may influence the degree of postoperative pain, other factors related to laparoscopic surgery, such as diaphragmatic stretching with phrenic nerve neuropraxia, the type and the temperature of insufflated gas used, the volume of residual carbon dioxide, and direct tissue trauma from electrocoagulation, should be considered to determine how these factors might influence analgesic consumption in patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1553350612439632">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1553350612439632">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite an increasing number of studies that demonstrate the feasibility of benign adnexal disease treatment using SPA approach,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612439632">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1553350612439632">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1553350612439632"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1553350612439632"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1553350612439632">31</xref></sup> there are only 5 publications to date that have compared surgical outcomes between SPA laparoscopic surgery with that of conventional multiport laparoscopic surgery. These studies mostly have small sample size and show various outcomes. Fagotti et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1553350612439632">32</xref></sup> investigated surgical outcomes without postoperative pain assessment data in a case–control study of laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) versus conventional laparoscopy. The authors stressed that the decrease in operative time, estimated blood loss, or length of stay should not be considered as benefits attributable to LESS because the differences between the two surgical approaches were minimal, and the results may be susceptible to change after an adequate patient selection. In this study, Triport (Olympus Winter &amp; Ibe GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) insertion through a 1.5- to 2-cm umbilical incision for LESS and an overall incision size of 25 mm with 4 ports (one 10-mm umbilical port and three 5-mm ports) for conventional laparoscopy were used. Another study by Kavallaris et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1553350612439632">33</xref></sup> showed that LESS for benign adnexal lesions is technically feasible and safe and suggested the possibility as a reproducible alternative to conventional multiport laparoscopy. Triport was used after making a 1.0-cm umbilical incision. Operative time was longer, and the mean hospital stay was shorter in the LESS group compared with the conventional group, although detailed procedural description of the “multiport” laparoscopy regarding port placement was not provided in the article. Fagotti et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1553350612439632">34</xref></sup> then published the most recent prospective randomized trial comparing postoperative pain between SPA and conventional laparoscopy for benign adnexal disease. The surgical technique and port placement were as described in their previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1553350612439632">32</xref></sup> Although detailed information on the type of surgical procedure or postoperative diagnosis were not provided, their results showed that LESS has advantage over conventional multiaccess laparoscopy in terms of postoperative pain with similar perioperative outcomes. Pain intensity in both treatment groups were measured at rest and after valsalva at different time points, and the difference was maximal and statistically significant at 4 hours after the end of surgery (2.8 vs 4.29 at rest, <italic>P</italic> = .004, and 3.96 vs 5.44 after valsalva, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01, for LESS and conventional laparoscopy, respectively). Although this was the first prospective randomized trial, such discrepancy in the results compared with our study might be because of procedural differences between institutions, such as the type of single-port system used, difference in trocar insertion sites, trocar size, and skin closure method. Lee et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350612439632">12</xref></sup> conducted a retrospective case–control study, which has shown comparable results to our report, using similar operative technique incorporating a wound retractor and a glove for SPA system through an umbilical incision of 2.0 cm. For conventional laparoscopy, a 5-mm scope along with one 12-mm and two 5-mm sized ancillary ports were used, which made the overall incision size of 27 mm. Operative outcomes were comparable between the two groups; however, there was a tendency of less intravenous analgesics (7 vs 28 ampules) and NSAIDs use in the SPA laparoscopic group. Postoperative pain intensity was not evaluated in this study. There was a recent prospective study by Im et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1553350612439632">35</xref></sup> on LESS focusing on postoperative pain outcomes in comparison with conventional laparoscopic surgery for adnexal tumors. Although the sample size was small (33 patients), postoperative visual analog scale and analgesic requirements showed no significant differences between the two groups. Operative technique was similar to the previously addressed study by Lee et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350612439632">12</xref></sup> with an overall incision size of 27 mm; however, the 12-mm trocar was placed as an umbilical port instead of an ancillary port.</p>
<p>Likewise, only 2 publications have focused on postoperative pain outcomes, and the results of these studies vary. Such discordance can be explained by the difference in SPA system and laparoscopic port placement between studies. The size of the umbilical incision was different depending on the type of SPA system used, which was either a commercial or a homemade port involving a wound retractor and a glove. For conventional laparoscopy, all the above studies have placed ancillary ports on the lower abdomen, including the suprapubic area. In our study, 2 ancillary 5-mm trocars were placed on the McBurney, counter-McBurney, and 5 cm above the counter-McBurney area. Previous studies have shown that either the size or the number of ports is related to the degree of postoperative pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612439632">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612439632">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1553350612439632">36</xref></sup> Moreover, a study by Chou et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1553350612439632">37</xref></sup> reported a difference in postoperative pain and specimen retrieval time when using the same-sized ports but at different sites on the abdomen. In their study, the patients were randomized to have a 10-mm port placed either at the umbilicus or at the lateral side of the abdomen for benign adnexal laparoscopic surgery. Results showed a significant decrease in immediate postoperative pain and specimen retrieval time in patients with transumbilical port. Therefore, the variation in size, number, as well as the location of trocars may be the factors to cause differences in postoperative pain intensity.</p>
<p>Since each patient had multiple evaluations of pain and these measures were not independent, an analysis of repeated measures using linear mixed model was used. According to this model, pain measurements in each patient are assumed to be correlated, and therefore, results from the fitted model account for the repeated measurement design. Ignoring such clustering structure may produce misleading results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350612439632">15</xref></sup> The results from the linear mixed model showed no significant difference in pain intensity between the two treatment groups and did not vary with time. In addition, we sought to assess the factors associated with the number of painkiller administrations given during the test period. After controlling for factors, including age, BMI, estimated blood loss, total operative time, size of the lesion, and the treatment method altogether, the treatment method (the type of surgical approach) and the amount of blood loss were the associated factors for the administration of painkillers. However, the interpretation of pain scores is not straightforward. Whether the NRS should be considered an interval scale or a ratio scale is related to the clinical circumstances under which it can be properly used. The importance of pain measurement lies in that it is a correlated data by repeated measurements and also carries ordinal information. Therefore, a simple comparison of mean pain ratings, which assumes that each pain measurement is independent, could harbor a risk of inaccurate analysis of correlated measures.</p>
<p>The limitation of this study is that the results are based on retrospective data from review of medical records. However, since timely postoperative pain measurement is a routine practice at our institution, pain score data were collected in a prospective manner. Since there was no significant difference in pain outcomes between the cohorts, power calculation was done, which showed 91.9% power to detect a difference of 0.5 in the mean pain scores that the alternative (SPA) treatment produced. In a clinical setting, a 0.5 difference in pain score seems appropriate to detect variations in pain intensity, and therefore, this study is adequately powered to detect such difference.</p>
<p>Another limitation is the possible measurement bias by obtaining the “overall pain” intensity rather than a site-specific pain after laparoscopy. If this study were to differentiate and characterize pain intensity by site (lower abdomen, umbilicus, shoulder tip, etc), there might have been some differences in pain intensity between the 2 surgical approaches. Also, although improved cosmesis is a suggested benefit of these procedures, evaluating patient satisfaction with the cosmetic appearance of single-port surgeries will be important. Nonetheless, this is the largest study comparing postoperative pain and surgical outcome of patients with benign adnexal disease treated by SPA versus conventional laparoscopy. In this study, we attempted to minimize the potential selection bias by matching patient’s age, BMI, and frequency of previous abdominal surgical history.</p>
<p>In conclusion, as more innovations of surgical instruments occur, it is likely that SPA gynecologic surgery will be adopted even further. With this innovation in progress, questions remain regarding the incidence of wound infections, umbilical herniation, and cost-effectiveness compared with conventional laparoscopy. The current study shows that SPA laparoscopy is a feasible method for adnexectomies with comparable surgical outcomes with respect to operative time, length of hospital stay, perioperative complications, and amount of intraoperative blood loss. However, SPA laparoscopy showed no analgesic advantages over conventional multiport laparoscopy. Postoperative pain may be expected as one of the ultimate patient benefit from a minimally invasive procedure. Therefore, improved understanding of pathogenesis of postoperative pain may enable accurate measurement and novel approaches to analgesia. Future trials are warranted to better define the benefits of SPA surgery in terms of postoperative pain along with other surgical outcomes.</p>
