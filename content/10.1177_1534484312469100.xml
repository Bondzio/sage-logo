<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Emotional intelligence (EI) claims to offer much to businesses of the 21st century with benefits including improved performance and productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1534484312469100">Joseph &amp; Newman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1534484312469100">O’Boyle, Humphrey, Pollack, &amp; Hawver, &amp; Story, 2011</xref>). For instance, EI predicts group performance, organizational citizenship behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534484312469100">Day &amp; Carroll, 2004</xref>) and leader emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1534484312469100">Rubin, Munz, &amp; Bommer, 2005</xref>). Its popularity has influenced workplace opinions on effective management styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1534484312469100">Ross-Smith, Kornberger, Anandakumar, &amp; Cheterman, 2007</xref>) and according to the flourishing management consultancy industry, EI competencies are taking center stage in staff selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534484312469100">Hatcher, 2008</xref>). Calls for EI training can be found in sectors and occupational groups such as medicine, nursing, pharmacy, the legal profession, leaders, managers, executives, and students, to name but a few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534484312469100">Bharwaney, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534484312469100">Clarke, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1534484312469100">Matthews, Zeidner, &amp; Roberts, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1534484312469100">Reilly, 2005</xref>). In this respect, emotion is no longer viewed as an irrational force but something that can be controlled and made functional with the correct training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1534484312469100">Hatcher, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, EI is described as the ability to perceive, use, understand, and manage emotions in one’s self and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534484312469100">Geher &amp; Remstom, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1534484312469100">Mayer &amp; Salovey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1534484312469100">Schutte et al., 1998</xref>). As a set of learnable abilities, EI is attractive to Human Resource Development (HRD) specialists because it provides a framework of skills, previously <italic>hidden</italic> or <italic>immeasurable</italic> in organizational life, but responsible for behaviors considered to help people be successful and effective at work. Measuring EI in test-like and self-report conditions provides a score that can form the basis of competency training, team building, learning and development programs, as well as inform career development planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1534484312469100">McEnrue &amp; Groves, 2006</xref>). For example, EI measures have been used by HRD specialists for executive coaching and management development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534484312469100">Boyatzis, Stubbs, &amp; Taylor, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1534484312469100">Peterson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1534484312469100">Slaski &amp; Cartwright, 2003</xref>). In a review of EI studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1534484312469100">McEnrue and Groves (2006</xref>, pp. 31-32) state that EI models and measures have demonstrable application to organizational development, change management, and learning.</p>
<p>Differences in emotional intelligence between men and women have been discussed in psychological accounts. In psychological studies, women score higher than men on EI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534484312469100">Day &amp; Carroll, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1534484312469100">Joseph &amp; Newman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1534484312469100">Palmer, Gignac, Manocha, &amp; Stough, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1534484312469100">van Rooy, Dilchert, Viswesvaran, &amp; Ones, 2006</xref>). Consistent with this, other studies of emotion and gender using self-report and independent behavioral scorers indicate differences that ascribe to the notion that women have higher EI than men. Women are better at decoding nonverbal cues in the face, body, and voice, are more attentive and aware of emotions, and have more multifaceted emotional knowledge than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534484312469100">Ciarrochi, Hynes, &amp; Crittenden, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534484312469100">Feldman Barrett, Lane, Sechrest, &amp; Schwartz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534484312469100">Gohm &amp; Clore, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1534484312469100">McClure, 2000</xref>). In measurement terms, self-report inventories do have limitations because people tend to revert to gender stereotyping when filling them in (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534484312469100">Feldman Barrett, Robin, Peitromonaco, &amp; Eyssell, 1998</xref>) thus actual behavior may not be in alignment with self-reported behavior. However, based on psychological accounts that view gender as a stable, unitary category, it seems that, overall, women should be encouraged to embrace the concept of EI as it celebrates all that is symbolically feminine—being aware of emotions, reading emotions, understanding complex emotional information, talking about feelings, and nurturing constructive social relationships. Women seem to win in the EI stakes because the concept challenges more masculinized workplaces, dominated by men who have historically determined what is appropriate emotional (in)expression. This growing valuation of feminine skills in the workplace is epitomized by representations in the media of “the future is female” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312469100">Broadbridge &amp; Simpson, 2011</xref>) where “feminine” abilities are said to contribute to effective team working, customer service, and new authentic and transformational forms of leadership.</p>
<p>Yet, because studies of EI have been dominated by a psychological framing, they have missed a more nuanced sociological analysis that would include recognition of structural factors. To date, critiques of EI from a sociological perspective have addressed a number of themes but gender has been underexplored. For instance, accounts have explored the commodification and instrumentalization of EI at work, its scope to be used in more manipulative ways, its elitist position, which undermines people’s subjective experiences and valuations of emotions, its cultural insensitivity, and incursion into identity formation as a form of self-surveillance (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534484312469100">Bolton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534484312469100">Clegg &amp; Baumeler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534484312469100">Fambrough &amp; Hart, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534484312469100">Fineman, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534484312469100">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534484312469100">Hughes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1534484312469100">Illouz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1534484312469100">Lindebaum, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1534484312469100">Lindebaum &amp; Cassell, 2012</xref>). A sociological approach, drawing on a gendered analysis of EI, which explores how these skills are socially constructed and valued, highlights power dynamics and inequalities that are underinvestigated. Though the debate on other forms of “emotion work” from a sociological approach has dealt with issues of gender, such an analysis is conspicuously absent from EI literature. This article seeks to address this gap.</p>
<p>In this article, gender refers to “the socio-cultural constructions of sex differences and the beliefs about what is appropriate for, or typical of, one sex more than the other including feelings, behaviour and interests” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312469100">Broadbridge &amp; Simpson, 2011</xref>, p. 470). This article’s starting point is that, somewhat contradictorily, EI is simultaneously constructed on both male and female gendered norms: empathy but also efficiency; self-control in a market driven workplace but also emotional perceptiveness and sensitivity; thinking with one’s heart but also with measured rationality. In this regard, EI appears replete with emotions that are both gender coded as <italic>masculine</italic> (emotional control, rational, quantified use of emotions for performance) and <italic>feminine</italic> (identifying and understanding emotion in self and others, talking about emotion, empathy, and care). This argument is based on one general EI where different emphases are possible (masculine/feminine), rather than arguing for two different gendered types of EI. Men and women may or may not employ and enact these gender-linked norms but symbolically they are constantly judged against them. Although these differences are portrayed as “complementary” or “different but equal,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1534484312469100">Shields and Warner (2007</xref>, p. 174) note:
<disp-quote>
<p>If we look at the way that “his” and “hers” types of EI are valued, we begin to see the inequities that exist. Specifically, one reason why the playing field is not level is that the types of EI that women are supposedly good at are not valued as much as the types of EI that men are supposedly good at.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Drawing on a structural analysis, this article explores (a) the impact on men and women when they perform EI as feminine and masculine skills and (b) the effects of EI’s assessment and therapeutic methods in training and work-based use where masculine management resides as the dominant normative framework. The structure of the article is as follows. The first section presents a description of emotional intelligence. It then explains a sociological approach to gender, described as “doing” gender. Following this, the article draws on a range of social trends to explore how both men and women are perceived and judged against symbolic representations of masculine and feminine when they perform gendered conceptions of EI. The sections illuminate how women and men may be encouraged to take up feminine and masculine interpretations of EI skills but women fare less well overall. The next section examines the use of EI assessment tools and EI’s therapeutic training practices, arguing they are damaging to individuals when deployed in work environments where masculinized management resides as the dominant framework. Finally, the article discusses the findings in relation to HRD to reveal important theoretical guidelines for practice. Overall, by connecting a gendered analysis of emotional intelligence to HRD, this article contributes to a growing body of published work on EI in this journal (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534484312469100">Clarke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1534484312469100">Opengart, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1534484312469100">Weinberger, 2002</xref>) and explores themes of power, rationality, social structures, and feminist theory also reflected in recent articles in this journal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534484312469100">Bierema, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Emotional Intelligence</title>
<p>As a set of abilities that refer to perceiving, understanding, using, and managing emotions, emotional intelligence is seen as an intelligence that is relatively independent of personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1534484312469100">Mayer &amp; Salovey, 1997</xref>) but is somewhat related to measures of traditional intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534484312469100">Day &amp; Kelloway, 2004</xref>). Perceiving emotions introduces the ability to accurately identify emotions in oneself and others, using cues from facial expressions, voice, or gestures. Using emotions denotes the ability to generate, use, and feel emotion as necessary to communicate feelings or employ them in other cognitive processes. Understanding emotions entails the ability to understand their causes, and consequences and how they change over time. EI also involves the management of emotions in oneself and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534484312469100">Brackett &amp; Salovey, 2004</xref>). Tests that measure EI collect data against expert and consensus opinion in the form of self-report, peer report (for team-based measures of EI) or behaviorally assessed measures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1534484312469100">Jordan, Ashkanasy, Härtel, &amp; Hooper 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1534484312469100">Mayer, Caruso, &amp; Salovey, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1534484312469100">Schutte et al., 1998</xref>). Viewed as a form of intelligence, EI develops with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534484312469100">Ashkanasy &amp; Daus, 2005</xref>) and can be enhanced through training and development in an integrated fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534484312469100">Caruso &amp; Salovey, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite its popularity, a number of concerns have been raised regarding EI’s conceptual and theoretical properties, how it is measured, and its predictive ability. For example, concerns have been voiced over whether EI as genetically based, learned, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534484312469100">Bracket &amp; Salovey, 2004</xref>). In addition, psychologists note a lack of clarity as to whether EI measures “real” abilities, declarative knowledge of emotions, or cultural values and beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1534484312469100">Matthews, Emo, &amp; Roberts, 2006</xref>). Where EI tests use independent raters of behavior, there is a lack of consideration of contextual information in the scenarios given and assumptions that expert scores produce unquestionable right and wrong answers (rather than cultural biases or different, better ways of thinking; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1534484312469100">Matthews, Zeidner &amp; Roberts, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1534484312469100">Murphy, 2006</xref>, p. 348). More recently, empirical studies highlight that emotion perception and expression are influenced by situational (visual scenes, bodies, others’ faces) and cross-cultural factors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534484312469100">Elfenbein, Beaupré, Lévesque, &amp; Hess, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534484312469100">Feldman Barrett, Mesquita, &amp; Gendron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1534484312469100">Karim &amp; Weisz, 2010</xref>). For studies that explore the EI-performance link, commentators note that outcome variables in EI studies are often difficult to measure and operationalize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1534484312469100">van Rooy et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, a full causal model of the potential competing explanations on performance, which would ask what EI adds when other variables are already in the equation (IQ, personality, tacit or procedural knowledge, experience, interests, education, broader sociopolitical context), is rarely conducted. While this is a brief review of the issues in the psychological literature, a gendered, sociological critique of EI endorses general psychological concerns over EI’s lack of social and cultural contextualization. However, this article does not seek to address the psychological concerns with methodological, conceptual, or theoretical recommendations. Instead, through a sociological framework it explores alternative ways of theorizing EI (i.e., how it is formed) by focusing on a sociocultural perspective. Articulating gender as “doing,” which underlines the socialization of EI behaviors and their social construction, enables us to reveal how structural inequalities are at play.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1534484312469100">
<title>Gender as “Doing”</title>
<p>Gender as “doing” denotes gender as a recurring accomplishment to manage behavior in light of normative or idealized practices expected for masculinity or femininity. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1534484312469100">West and Zimmerman (1987)</xref> explain in their seminal account,
<disp-quote>
<p>Doing gender involves a complex of socially guided perceptual, interactional, and micropolitical activities that cast particular pursuits as expressions of masculine and feminine “natures.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1534484312469100">West &amp; Zimmerman, 1987</xref>, p. 126)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Gender-linked actions are constituted through interaction where “we learn to produce and recognise masculine and feminine gender displays” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1534484312469100">West &amp; Zimmerman, 1987</xref>, p. 130). As a consequence gender <italic>work</italic> appears natural and correct. What is produced is “material embodiment” of male and female nature in the form of roles and conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1534484312469100">West &amp; Zimmerman, 1987</xref>, p. 144). Thus a gender perspective enables us to explore how we understand what is historically and culturally ascribed as masculine and feminine appropriate ways of “thinking (knowing), feeling, valuing and acting,” and the consequences of that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312469100">Alvesson &amp; Billing, 2009</xref>, p. 7). For instance, masculinity is typically described in terms of instrumental rational control, quantification (money), reductionism, competitiveness, and analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534484312469100">Hines, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1534484312469100">Marshall, 1993</xref>). Cultural attributes of femininity are described in terms of nurturance, sensitivity, empathy, and compassion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534484312469100">Grant, 1988</xref>). If a woman performs behaviors of subordination by doing gender and a man of dominance they legitimize and maintain a social order. In this way, structural arrangements produce or allow some capacities that have been previously constructed as biological differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1534484312469100">West &amp; Zimmerman, 1987</xref>). In other words, “doing” gender repositions the concept from an ascribed status (noun) to an achieved status (verb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534484312469100">Davies, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1534484312469100">West and Zimmerman, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Framing emotion as a sociocultural resource in the production and reproduction of gender serves as a useful lens through which to examine EI. Emotions are used as resources or gendered norms (specific emotions or emotional engagements) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1534484312469100">Lewis &amp; Simpson, 2007</xref>). Gendered emotion norms refer to men having greater emotional self-control (“inexpressivity”) and women being more emotional (“emotionality”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1534484312469100">Shields, 2002</xref>, pp. 52-54). Men are believed to experience more anger and pride and women more happiness and sadness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534484312469100">Brody &amp; Hall, 2008</xref>). Men and women may or may not draw on and exhibit these gender-linked images. In day-to-day life, being male and female does not necessarily fit either category but symbolically both sexes are constantly judged against them. Thus this is not an exhaustive list of responses and certainly the intention is not to stereotype women and men in particular ways. Nor does it seek to produce “either/or” scenarios or exclude that both feminine and masculine aspects of EI can be embraced simultaneously by either sex. It also acknowledges that men and women may occupy these categories with reservations, misgivings, and uncertainties.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1534484312469100">Lewis and Simpson (2007</xref>, p. 4) note, while not denying gender differences, viewing gendered norms as cultural resources enables an exploration of meanings associated with difference and how differences are made sense of, shaped, evaluated, maintained, or contravened. Because doing gender is an accomplishment, it is also optional, and yet, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1534484312469100">West and Zimmerman (1987</xref>, p. 146) note, “If we fail to do gender appropriately, we as individuals—not the institutional arrangements—may be called into account (for our character, motives, and predispositions).” This highlights the ongoing accountability and assessment made on men and women’s enactments of normative conceptions of manly and womanly behavior. Likewise, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534484312469100">Brody and Hall (2008</xref>, p. 396) note, “Violating stereotypic display rules can lead to negative social consequences, such as social rejection and discrimination.”</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1534484312469100">West and Zimmerman (1987)</xref> highlight, failing to “do” gender appropriately tends to result in individual rather than institutional accountability. Usefully, through a sociocultural analysis, light can be shed on organizational structures and practices that sustain (and challenge) norms of masculine/feminine. Organizational structures refer to power relations, positions, and hierarchies, which are maintained and reinforced through actions, events, and experiences such as managerial decision making and organizational culture. While acknowledging that gendered norms vary across occupations, professions, and sectors, certain propensities pervade in organizational structures. Noteworthy is the way men reside in privileged positions of hierarchical power, which subjugate or marginalize lower levels and minority groups and relatedly, the influence of “masculinity” as a dominant managerial type (hierarchy and control). If men and women adopt appropriate attitudes and activities for their sex, which sustain work-based patriarchal structures, the social order can be interpreted as a normal expression of essential differences between men and women. Thus gender achievement is institutional because its language and conduct is a social product of institutional arrangements where these interactions take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1534484312469100">West &amp; Zimmerman, 2009</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534484312469100">Davies (1996</xref>, p. 664) notes, “culturally constructed gender relations are called forth, overtly or otherwise, and in a variety of different ways, to enable the daily business of the organisation to take place.” As practices and cultural values they become deeply rooted in and around institutions, reflecting societal values and dominant groups more broadly. In this way, power structures are grounded in patriarchy and can be highly resistant to initiatives that attempt to threaten them such as addressing inequality issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534484312469100">Bierema, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>New Social Trends in Gendered Norms</title>
<p>Culturally ascribed values to the male and female are constantly being renegotiated and transformed in their day-to-day production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534484312469100">Davies, 1996</xref>, p. 664; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1534484312469100">Shields, 2002</xref>). In their comprehensive review of 25 years of research on gender and management, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312469100">Broadbridge and Simpson (2011)</xref> highlight how the feminization thesis has been widely perpetuated in the media and scholarly research. Partly influenced by the demand for “feminine” skills in the workplace, it has been driven by a new form of capitalism where managers must learn to display more warmth, connection, openness, and empathy at work; feminine skills especially required in the service sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1534484312469100">Hatcher, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1534484312469100">Swan, 2008</xref>). The notion of compassionate capitalism, postbanking crisis, and the idea that women can reinvent society and business practices through openness, fairness, and social responsibility has also been a dominant narrative in the media (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1534484312469100">Sunderland, 2009</xref>). In leadership and management styles, this approach is embedded in new fields of transformational, authentic, and servant leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534484312469100">Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, &amp; van Engen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1534484312469100">van Dierendonck, 2011</xref>). In management roles, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534484312469100">Francis and Keegan (2006)</xref> note the line manager is now increasingly responsible for absence management, grievance handling, discipline issues, and counseling employees as well as appraisal and selection activities, general motivation, and coaching. These are roles that require EI, particularly in relation to empathy, emotional awareness, and managing emotions. Reinforcing this is the assumption that women’s feminine skills are enhanced in nonwork pursuits where it is currently fashionable to “work on” being a more emotionally literate partner, parent, or friend. EI becomes a resource that can be transferred from intimate relationships to work-based ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1534484312469100">Ilouz, 2009</xref>). This new emphasis on conceptions of femininity helps to explore how women may have a competitive advantage by embracing those aspects of EI socially ascribed as women’s skills. Equally though, there is a growing realization that men are feminizing their skills in accordance with societal and organizational norms and thus can benefit from adopting “feminine” EI attributes, particularly in white collar, professional occupations. This is referred to as “feminised masculinity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534484312469100">Furedi, 2004</xref>) and is epitomized by the “new man”—an increased acceptance of feminine masculinity in society and the workplace (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534484312469100">Furedi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1534484312469100">Illouz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1534484312469100">Shields &amp; Warner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1534484312469100">Swan, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to the feminization of workplaces thesis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312469100">Broadbridge and Simpson (2011)</xref> also point to a body of research that argues that masculinized or macho management practices are becoming more prevalent in workplaces. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312469100">Broadbridge and Simpson (2011</xref>, p. 474) chart a fundamental ascendency of “excessive” and “heroic” masculinity, which paves the way for emphasizing the more masculine attributes of EI (instrumental emotional self-control). This dominance is marked by masculine notions of entrepreneurship, strategic management, and a hegemonic masculinity that seeks to subvert femininities. In addition, they refer to critical management accounts, which explore how management processes and practices, previously coded as feminine, are now being discursively reformulated as masculine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312469100">Broadbridge &amp; Simpson, 2011</xref>, p. 474). This is demonstrable in work activities such as team working, communication, and relationship building where tensions can arise because of increasing emphasis on performativity, outputs, monitoring, and accounting measures (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1534484312469100">Marks &amp; Panzer, 2004</xref>). “Caring” professions such as teaching now carry masculine emotion codes, which speak of practices of control, rationality, and performance and overrule the feminine emotion code of caring (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534484312469100">Davies, 1996</xref>). Similarly, customer service roles are increasingly subject to performance standards, targets, discipline, and controlled emotional performances.</p>

<title>Drawing on Emotional Intelligence as Feminine Skills: “Feminine” and “Feminine Masculinity”</title>
<p>Given one conviction that the “future is female” and gender equality has been achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312469100">Broadbridge &amp; Simpson, 2011</xref>), women can choose to enact a female interpretation of EI. This entails the celebration of “women’s” skills found in EI models as understood as those natural, feminine qualities that are socially ascribed to women. However, this approach appears problematic when a structural analysis is conducted. When women draw on feminized cultural emotional norms (as found in feminine codes of EI), these tend not to be associated with positions of authority and power. That is not to say that there is some evidence that the currently popular “transformational” leadership style, frequently described as an approach that celebrates women’s skills (emphasizing emotional self-awareness, sensitivity toward others’ feelings, and empathy), enables women to more successfully make visible their female attributes when compared to men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534484312469100">Eagly et al., 2003</xref>). In this regard, women in managerial and leadership positions may be rewarded for adopting feminine EI behaviors. For instance, research indicates that when female managers act more cooperatively or are more interpersonally oriented, they are appraised more positively in terms of likability and being influential (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1534484312469100">Shackelford, Wood, &amp; Worchel, 1996</xref>). Unlike men, when female managers fail to attend to others’ emotions, they receive lower satisfaction ratings from subordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534484312469100">Byron, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1534484312469100">Ross-Smith et al.’s (2007)</xref> study of women executives found that women typically tend to adopt transformational leadership styles and these leaders were admired and appreciated by male colleagues. While transformational leadership was appreciated and valued in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1534484312469100">Ross-Smith et al.’s (2007)</xref> study, other accounts note that enhancing feminine qualities typically does not give women the kind of credit or remuneration men’s key strengths offer. This is particularly the case in masculine work environments or in nonmanagement positions. Studies report that these skills are often seen as natural, feminine qualities, which are often unacknowledged, seen as a “gift,” ignored, and unrewarded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534484312469100">Bolton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312469100">Fletcher, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1534484312469100">Taylor &amp; Tyler, 2000</xref>). For example, describing female engineers’ EI acts in a male-dominated engineering firm, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312469100">Fletcher (1999)</xref> accounts for many gestures regularly “getting disappeared,” misunderstood, or exploited. The women in her study describe how a firm that values individualism, competition, and visible outputs did not consider relational behavior as real work, but <italic>just helping out</italic>.</p>
<p>Related to the “female EI advantage,” numerous commentators contend that the new (emotionally literate) male is on the rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534484312469100">Furedi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1534484312469100">Illouz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1534484312469100">Shields &amp; Warner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1534484312469100">Swan, 2008</xref>). This refers to the suggestion that society is more accepting of male emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1534484312469100">Timmers, Fischer, &amp; Manstead, 2003</xref>), termed here as “feminine masculinity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534484312469100">Furedi, 2004</xref>). Drawing on a therapeutic language and ethos, it is argued that middle-class men (in particular) have just as much access to feminized cultural frames enabling them to think, feel, and behave more in alignment with feminine ideals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1534484312469100">Illouz, 2009</xref>). If this is the case, men seem to fare well from this shift in emotion norms. As Michelle Bachelet, Chile’s President, commented after an incident during which her predecessor President Ricardo Lagos was tearful during a speech, “The media said ‘It’s his sensitive side coming out,’ but when I did it, they said: ‘she’s hysterical.’ I’m not whining about it, but come on” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534484312469100">Butler, 2008</xref>; p. 20). Studies corroborate that controlled emotional expression or “weak emotion” (teary eye) is viewed more positively in men than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1534484312469100">Shields, Garner, Di Leone, &amp; Hadley, 2007</xref>). Here it is assumed that emotion is a gentle lapse in otherwise rational behavior and offers just a glimpse of humanity but does not express overall weakness.</p>
<p>In their study of beliefs about male and female emotion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1534484312469100">Timmers et al. (2003)</xref> found that individuals held stronger stereotypical views of women’s emotions than men’s. Whereas attitudes were moving away from the “unemotional man,” they argue the “emotional woman” stereotype still pervades and is viewed as dysfunctional at work. In contrast, men are believed to have more emotional sensitivity than women (as well as displaying more powerful emotional behavior). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1534484312469100">Timmers et al. (2003</xref>, p. 58) reconcile of men, “This makes them suitable for stereotypically female roles, such as nursing, caring for children, <italic>in addition</italic> [emphasis in original] to stereotypical masculine roles and jobs.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534484312469100">Brackett, Rivers, and Shiffman (2006)</xref> found that through real time observations of performance on a task-based measure of EI, only men with higher EI scores were evaluated as more socially competent. One explanation is that when emotion is interpreted in the context of gendered behavior, for men it is associated with ability but for women it is still framed within stereotypes of vulnerability, loss of power, and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1534484312469100">Timmers et al., 2003</xref>, p. 58; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1534484312469100">Shields &amp; Warner, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1534484312469100">Swan (2008</xref>, p. 99) offers a slightly different explanation:
<disp-quote>
<p>it is men’s mobility in relation to gender that provides new workplace capital for them as men to take up femininities in a way that women cannot take up masculinities. And it is this flexibility that is the important workplace resource, rather than emotional subjectivity, <italic>per se</italic> [emphasis in original].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By “softening” masculinity through male expression and occupation of feminine emotions, the male advantage is reinstated while also serving to distance women from their own emancipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1534484312469100">Swan, 2008</xref>, p. 99). Thus men can draw on cultural resources in very exclusive ways not accessible to women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1534484312469100">Swan, 2008</xref>). Despite this, the pressure for men to display more feminine emotion is likely to generate its own stresses and anxieties particularly when male gendered codes are strongly violated. Adopting feminized masculinity in some occupations is clearly not valued, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1534484312469100">Lindebaum and Fielden (2011)</xref> highlight in their study of EI and construction project management. Equally, male figures in the public eye are still vulnerable to derision when they express “non-maleness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534484312469100">Bennett, 2012</xref>). However, in studies of “feminine” professions associations between men, male careerism, and managerial potential lead to positive career opportunities for men (Floge &amp; Merrill, 1986, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1534484312469100">Simpson &amp; Lewis, 2007</xref>, p. 46). Findings such as these indicate that even in caring professions, gendered codes lead to rewards for men.</p>

<title>Drawing on Emotional Intelligence as Masculine Skills: “Manly” and “Feminine Masculinity”</title>
<p>A different set of normative values refers to the way the workplace is becoming more macho and work environment and activities previously viewed as “feminine” are being remasculinized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312469100">Broadbridge &amp; Simpson, 2011</xref>). In accordance with this representation, men may ascribe to gendered display rules that encourage emotional control and inexpressivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1534484312469100">Shields, 2002</xref>), often articulated as silent, strong, and unemotional. Embracing “manly emotion” as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1534484312469100">Shields (2002)</xref> describes it, in the form of EI, serves men well as masculine-gendered codes of emotion carry power and influence and attract positive value judgments.</p>
<p>Equally though, women may perform EI abilities in line with male-gendered codes of emotional control, performance, and competitiveness. This approach accords with the argument that the feminine has been colonized by the masculine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312469100">Broadbridge &amp; Simpson, 2011</xref>). However, when women seek to inhabit socially ascribed “masculine” categories at work, they are judged more harshly, treated with a lack of credibility, or viewed as deficient (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1534484312469100">Kumra &amp; Vinnicombe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1534484312469100">Rudman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1534484312469100">Sheppard, 1989</xref>). For example, research indicates that when women adopt an authoritarian approach they are perceived more negatively than men and are viewed as domineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534484312469100">Eagly, Makhijani, &amp; Knonsky, 1992</xref>). Numerous accounts note that assertiveness (stereotypically viewed as a male attribute) tends to be judged positively in men and negatively in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534484312469100">Grugulis, 2007a</xref>) and the display of initiative is perceived as valuable in male job applicants but viewed as forceful and unwanted in female applicants (Collinson et al., 1990 as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534484312469100">Edwards &amp; Wajcman, 2005</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534484312469100">Grugulis (2007b</xref>, p. 85) notes, “Women who seek to develop and adopt the corporate persona may be marked down because such behaviour is ‘inappropriate’ for women.”</p>
<p>In the same vein, EI models offer a prescriptive and “scientific” formula to nurturing the social fabric of work life. This is largely achieved by elevating discourses that promise to “crack the code” of emotions and highlight EI’s quantifiable nature. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534484312469100">Caruso and Salovey (2004)</xref> make the point that emotional intelligence does not threaten reason or logic, strengthening the case for its rationalization:
<disp-quote>
<p>At first, learning to identify and use the data in feelings might be somewhat awkward and mechanical. It might seem like following a difficult schematic diagram or a set of instructions for assembling a complex machine . . . The good news we offer all managers is that we have developed a schematic diagram for emotions—a set of detailed, how-to instructions. (p. 24)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Emphasizing these explicitly planned steps, they conclude that “emotions provide data that assist us in making rational decisions and behaving in adaptive ways” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534484312469100">Caruso &amp; Salovey, 2004</xref>, p. 211). Elsewhere, emotional intelligence is marketed as a construct that can be measured and quantified as “a precise metric” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534484312469100">Goleman, 1998</xref>, p. 5). With these types of messages, the complex, qualitative, and instinctive realm of feelings, care, connection, and relationship management appear translated into a “how to” set of procedural instructions, perhaps with men in mind. The result is a “‘controlled’ production of the heart” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534484312469100">Hatcher, 2008</xref>, p. 161) with emphasis on performance, quantification, and outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1534484312469100">Lewis &amp; Simpson, 2007</xref>, p. 7). In this way, EI’s agenda clearly has the bottom line in mind with a strong emphasis on a calculative, emotionally controlled interpretation of the construct.</p>
<p>Drawing on an analysis of sociocultural resources, this section helps to explain how “doing” or “performing” gender serves to disadvantage women in the workplace when they embody or transgress male and female conceptions of emotional intelligence. Through articulation of how gender is being renegotiated as the “female advantage” and relatedly the “emotionally literate man,” then the “remasculinization of management” or “macho management,” women seem to fare less well overall. This is because gendered emotion norms are imposed more forcefully on women; negative consequences of violating these norms are more salient, particularly in relation to performance recognition and career development. Given this analysis, women may be overlooked for promotion or selection for management development, deemed too “male” if they perform a masculine EI profile. It is also possible they may find it difficult to locate a mentor with sufficient empathy and insight to understand these tensions. Yet, if they are excelling as transformational leaders or managers in “feminine” sectors, they may be concerned that they cannot evade the feminine managerial style without repercussions on performance evaluations. Equally, they may be out-competed by men who successfully adopt “feminine masculinity” styles. Yet, if they adopt a feminine EI profile in nonmanagement roles or in masculinized work environments, these skills are likely to be overlooked and undervalued, as studies indicate.</p>

<title>The Masculinization of Management: Implications for EI Assessment and Therapeutic Training Methods</title>
<p>This section discusses the effects of EI’s assessment and therapeutic methods in training and work-based use where masculine management resides as the dominant normative framework. Compatible with the masculinized paradigm, numerous writers sensitize us to the fact that employees’ narrow responses to EI are requisite in the way they must control their own emotions and social behavior, thus “inhibiting personal needs, desires and emotions in service of organisational needs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1534484312469100">Matthews et al., 2002</xref>, p. 472; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534484312469100">Fineman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534484312469100">Hatcher, 2008</xref>). In this way, EI is consistent with and reinforces “masculinity” as a dominant managerial type (emotional control, rational, quantified use of emotions for performance). This raises two key concerns. First, when individual assessments of EI are made during training, how are low EI scores viewed and valued performatively by the organization and what is done with this information? Second, what is the individual impact when EI adopts therapeutic training methods that intrude into sometimes uncomfortable and complex emotions?</p>
<p>Turning to the first concern, while HRD practitioners and consultants are, no doubt, trained to deal with candidates who come out low on emotional self-awareness and self-control in a highly sensitive and nondiscriminatory manner, EI assessments makes respondents vulnerable to organizations that seek to equate low EI scores with masculinized norms of underperformance, inefficiency, and a lack of competitiveness. Just as important, the extent to which any emotional deficiency identified in an EI assessment may be caused by the organization in the first place is assumedly glossed over and remains unchallenged. If EI scores are used inappropriately and people are “labeled” in ways which convey dysfunctionality (irrational, lacking in self-control, emotional), it could be seen more as a device that impedes personal development, has negative effects on well-being, career advancement, and self-esteem and undermines constructive social relationships at work. This is not to assume that EI cannot be used as a positive development tool but the recent trend of practitioner-oriented literature, which attributes management incompetence not just to skill and attitude deficiencies but also mental stability and “personality disorders,” provokes well-founded fears and concerns over the power that consultants and managers have over diagnosis and prognosis of individuals’ EI “deficiencies.” Where trends for workplace incompetence are increasingly described in terms of psychiatric disorders such as narcissism, paranoid, passive-aggressive and sociopathic behavior (Babiak &amp; Hare, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312469100">Cavaiola &amp; Lavender, 2000</xref>), personal apprehension over what happens with an EI classification and the power and responsibility of those making such assessments becomes a key concern.</p>
<p>The second concern refers to the individual consequences when EI training adopts therapeutic methods that intrude into sometimes uncomfortable and complex emotions. In practitioner and critical writings, developing one’s emotional intelligence is frequently paralleled with psychoanalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1534484312469100">Kets de Vries, 2006</xref>), cognitive behavioral therapy or counseling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534484312469100">Fineman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1534484312469100">Illouz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1534484312469100">McBride &amp; Maitland, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1534484312469100">Stein &amp; Book, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1534484312469100">Swan, 2010</xref>). While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534484312469100">Bagshaw (2000)</xref> notes that EI is not meant to operate as a counseling methodology, there is scope for this to happen in practitioner contexts where trainers have free rein to draw on therapeutic techniques to enhance EI. It is not difficult to see how individuals may be encouraged to engage in EI’s therapeutic practices to make sense of themselves, explore past feelings in relation to current thinking and behavior, and how EI may instantiate a sense of vulnerability and the need for support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1534484312469100">Illouz, 2008</xref>). A core aspect of EI is emotional self-awareness and understanding. In effect, one cannot control one’s emotions until those emotions are better understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1534484312469100">Matthews et al., 2002</xref>). To facilitate this awareness, EI training requests that people talk openly about their emotions, experiences, attitudes, and beliefs in a public arena, whereby the individual becomes the topic. Illustratively, in their comprehensive theory-based approach to EI training, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1534484312469100">Kornacki and Caruso (2007)</xref> describe self-assessment exercises to explore how a person processes, experiences, or stays open to strong emotions. Recommended activities encourage individuals to reflect on how aware they are of their emotions, the causes of them, ask them to think about uncomfortable feelings and consequential actions or think about the range and depth of feelings they experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1534484312469100">Kornacki &amp; Caruso, 2007</xref>). This is premised on the basis that EI training enables people to become more productive and effective at work. However, while it is acknowledged that some employees will be receptive to understanding and discussing themselves more, others may find this instrumental and threatening, wishing to keep such private aspects of their emotional lives separate from organizational surveillance (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1534484312469100">Martin, Knopoff, &amp; Beckman, 1998</xref>). This is most problematic when assessment and training is mandatory (e.g., “in-house”) or culturally normalized rather than a voluntary (internal or external) endeavor.</p>
<p>Given emotional intelligence training exercises have the potential to release difficult and complex emotions, there are further issues at stake. While a qualified therapist engages in a mid- or long-term contractual counseling commitment to help a client understand and come to terms with his or her emotions, a management consultant is contracted in as a fleeting presence for a one-day workshop or week’s development program. If he or she “unlocks” any personal issues in a training delegate, there is no obligation or financial incentive to support or counsel the individual beyond the training period. Perhaps more importantly, EI trainers are more likely to be management consultants who do not have the requisite counseling or psychotherapy training to help people delve into and heal their own emotional landscapes, particularly if this raises deep-seated personal traumas and “presenting pasts.” More conveniently, practitioners encourage participants to talk to their doctor or attend an employee assistance program (EAP) if the situation warrants a referral. Yet, this practice locates EI training within a performative model because outsourcing support implies these emotions are unwanted and surplus to organizational demand. Attending an EI course could be more damaging than beneficial to an individual, particularly if difficult emotions generate discomfort and confusion, are viewed as unmanageable or professional help is unwanted, not provided or unaffordable.</p>
<p>In addition, by ascribing value to organizationally appropriated emotion (understanding and labeling emotions in prescribed ways to achieve emotional control), EI undermines the complexity of emotions. We often do not know what emotions are driving us because we employ defense mechanisms, displacement and screening strategies that enrich our emotional lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534484312469100">Fineman, 2000</xref>) as well as complicate our understanding of our feelings. Indeed, feelings are often mixed or ambiguous, changing, contradictory, subjective, subconscious and thus difficult to know, elucidate, convey, or read in oneself and others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534484312469100">Craib, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534484312469100">Fineman, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534484312469100">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534484312469100">Höpfl &amp; Linstead, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1534484312469100">Matthews et al., 2002</xref>). EI training contexts ignore this because assessment measures ascribe to “correct” answers and “expert” scoring, which assume complete transparency and uniformity of people’s emotional terrain. In addition, engaging with this complexity promises no immediate financial gains. Relatedly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534484312469100">Craib (1994)</xref> notes that it can take a long time for people to talk about their feelings unreservedly in therapy and organizational contexts can be considerably more hostile. In contrast, EI training courses or workshops prescribe individuals to swiftly and expediently understand and control their own (and others’ emotions) over a short period of time. Once emotions have been controlled this then enables an easy adoption of more positive emotional states to boost optimum levels of performance. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1534484312469100">Mayer and Salovey (1997)</xref> note, EI is concerned with moderating negative emotions and enhancing positive ones. Such an emphasis on “positivity” has been widely critiqued as part of a positive organizational scholarship movement (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534484312469100">Fineman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534484312469100">Hackhman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1534484312469100">Warren, 2010</xref>). Ultimately, emotional intelligence’s affiliation with the positive psychology movement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534484312469100">Boniwell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1534484312469100">Salovey, Mayer, &amp; Caruso, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1534484312469100">Seligman, 2002</xref>) promotes an agenda that favors positivity over negativity for organizational gain.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, EI has been accused of adopting a positive discourse where “the good life appears locked into a deterministic, totalizing picture of the positive person” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534484312469100">Fineman, 2006</xref>, p. 274). This narrative manifests itself in training speak such as “self-talk,” “controlling negative feelings,” and “challenging or disputing your internal critic.” The goal is a controlled and competent emotional performance where “what is or is not an emotional competence is identified by those who have the power to do so,” and emotion is viewed in “very narrow managerially defined terms” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534484312469100">Bolton, 2005</xref>, p. 36). Frequently, this power lies with consultants and trainers who ascribe value and meaning to emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534484312469100">Fineman, 2004</xref>). Ultimately, when masculinized normative values preside in the workplace, EI training and assessment processes generate a number of concerns for HRD practitioners and consultants.</p>

<title>Implications for HRD</title>
<p>Drawing on a structural analysis, this article explores the impact on men and women when they perform EI as feminine and masculine skills and the effects of EI’s assessment and therapeutic methods in training and work-based use where masculine management resides as the dominant normative framework. This final section asks, in light of the discussion of EI and women’s disadvantages, how can HRD better serve women? And how can HRD better support EI training in workplaces where masculinized rationality presides?</p>
<p>HRD research appears heavily dominated by performative, measurement, legal, and financial concerns. This performance model of HRD is based on masculinized management practices consistent with those discussed in this article, which tend to favor efficiency, objectivity, and rationality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534484312469100">Bierema, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534484312469100">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1534484312469100">Lyotard, 1984</xref>). These are evident in productivity enhancing systems and HRD’s increasingly measurable and competitive outlook. Alternative theoretical approaches and discussion points inform HRD practice to better contest the nature of power relations and can promote and support alternative organizational models. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1534484312469100">Korte (2012</xref>, p. 22) notes, “While not discarding the important insights of natural science or individualistic psychologies, there might be compelling value in studying and practicing HRD from a predominately social and relational perspective.” For example, using sociological theories and frameworks we can start to see beyond gender differences in EI described by psychologists as “different but complementary.”</p>
<p>However, in HRD studies topics of gender, equality, patriarchy, and power have been poorly addressed to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534484312469100">Bierema, 2009</xref>). Likewise, a lack of critical address in the training and development literature means issues of gender and power within organizations have been overlooked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534484312469100">Devos, 1996</xref>). As part of this, HRD theory and research tends to be deficient in alternative conceptual frameworks, which would help to analyze and understand social structures, power dynamics, and structural inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534484312469100">Bierema, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1534484312469100">Korte, 2012</xref>). Thus, adopting a sociological perspective offers new perspectives for HRD research engaged with analyzing gender effects for emotional intelligence in the workplace. Adopting the framework of gender as “doing” informs practices to better serve women through various HRD initiatives. Recommendations include diversity training and mentoring. Equally, highlighting social trends such as the (re)masculinization of management practices also facilitates ways for HRD to better support organizations and individuals undergoing EI training and assessment.</p>
<sec id="section9-1534484312469100">
<title>Valuing Women and Their Skills Through Diversity Training and Mentoring</title>
<p>Diversity training emphasizes the value of difference and a heterogeneous workforce and refers to diversity in relation to gender, age, ethnicity, sexuality, and class. It is an area of growing interest within organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1534484312469100">McGuire &amp; Patteron, 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1534484312469100">Taylor, Powell, and Wrench (2001)</xref> suggest there are three types of diversity training: providing information, changing attitudes, and changing behaviors. Diversity training for managers includes avoiding discrimination in recruitment and promotion, and general diversity training for all staff focuses on the theme of inclusion for all groups at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534484312469100">Dobbin, Kim, &amp; Kalev, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1534484312469100">McGuire and Bagher (2010)</xref> highlight a detailed set of priorities of diversity training at individual, group, and organizational levels. At the individual level they suggest diversity education, promoting an understanding of the effects of power and privilege, harnessing positive attitudes, and assisting individuals in overcoming inequality barriers. At the group level they note priorities such as support for inclusive teamwork practices, nurturing respect and tolerance for diversity, reviewing group values, improved access and support and evaluating selection, recruitment, and promotion practices. At the organizational level they highlight the role of mentoring and coaching, diversity champions and workshops, corporate climate, and company policies on diversity.</p>
<p>In the context of this article, diversity training offers opportunities for attitudinal and behavioral change toward unfair advantages, sexism, gender stereotyping, and patriarchy. HRD professionals can engage in sustained consciousness raising to help challenge and alleviate discrimination against women. Gender bias training in assessment, performance appraisal, and career development may be one method. Approaches that reframe gender as “doing” in the context of diversity and equality training is another approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1534484312469100">Kelan &amp; Nentwich, 2009</xref>). Challenging assumptions, policies, and informal practices that undermine the valuation of women (and their skills) is critical to addressing these issues.</p>
<p>While many of the practices highlighted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1534484312469100">McGuire and Bagher (2010)</xref> would help to address EI and women’s disadvantages explored in this article, the practice of mentoring for women is deemed integral to this approach. Mentoring provides opportunities for social support, advice, learning and development, visibility, exposure, and enhanced self-efficacy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1534484312469100">Kram, 1985</xref>) and is seen as a valuable career development tool for women. A thriving mentoring relationship requires openness, honesty, trust, respect, and equality. Mentors should be chosen who are both self-aware (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534484312469100">Clutterbuck, 2004</xref>) and politically astute to invisible hierarchical power structures and gender biases to support their mentees in constructive ways. Clearly, the nature, type, and context of a mentoring relationship requires reflective consideration. Given the focus of this piece, women are best advised to seek mentoring relationships outwith their organization if they feel their own institutional culture promotes masculinized practices of competition, which may be endorsed by senior mentors and negatively influence one’s mentoring relationship.</p>

<sec id="section10-1534484312469100">
<title>HRD’s Role in EI Training</title>
<p>In organizations where a masculine performance bias dominates, it is recommended that EI training provides opportunities for participants to challenge the masculine performance bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534484312469100">Bierema, 2009</xref>). As part of this, it is recommended that HRD professionals encourage and support the development of emotional competence through reflective practice and experiential learning that is more representative of society. Such an approach can be achieved through a subjective, contextualized exploration of emotion intelligence, which is meaningful and significant to managers and employees and the work they do, in their own terms.</p>
<p>In the case of EI assessments, concerns were raised over how low EI scores are viewed and valued (i.e., emotional, irrational, no self-control) and the impact negative valuations may have on well-being, career development, and promotional opportunities. It is HRD practitioners’ responsibility to work purposefully with management to avoid this type of labeling and sense making. Participants attending EI training should also be able to determine the degree to which they are happy to engage with EI’s approaches of personal disclosure in work contexts, given that EI training consultants and professionals may be ill equipped to support and validate people’s genuinely complex and uncomfortable emotions. Relatedly, it is advisable for organizations to vet professional qualifications and credentials of EI trainers to ensure they are capable of managing difficult emotional situations.</p>
<p>Overall though, many of the recommendations made here require systemic and cultural changes to shift masculinized norms and values toward those that are more representative of society. At worst, patriarchal structures remain impervious to change and, at best, take time, energy, and skill to challenge and transform. Much of this work must commence through greater discussion of power structures in scholarly research, which can be filtered through to HRD educational programs. Currently, inadequate frameworks for analyzing and understanding power and structural inequalities in HRD research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534484312469100">Bierema, 2010</xref>) makes it equally challenging to contest the nature of power relations in HRD practice. Core to this approach is introducing HRD/HRM students to more critical topics in HRD university programs. If HRD graduates working as professionals cannot themselves identify and articulate deeper, invisible issues of power dynamics and patriarchy, then it is foolish to assume they can skillfully develop this type of awareness in the workplace.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In a recent publication, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1534484312469100">Korte (2012)</xref> asks the question, “For example, what would a human resource intervention look like if it started as an attempt to better understand the larger sociocultural structures of the organization and society rather than the needs of individuals as resources in the organization?” (p. 23). Using gender as “doing” as an analytical framework, we can start to see beyond gender differences in EI described by psychologists as “different but complementary.” This article encourages HRD specialists to be mindful of systemic and cultural changes required to effect changes in masculinized work cultures and management practices, which impact on how women and their skills are valued in the workplace and how EI is used in assessment and training contexts. This necessitates an understanding of organizational sociocultural structures and how they mirror wider societal values and dominant groups. When we start to view the work of HRD professionals and the employees they serve “as grounded in the social realm,” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1534484312469100">Korte, 2012</xref>, p. 24), future avenues open up for new research projects. Based on the analysis in this article, it is strongly argued that more empirical research be conducted on EI, gendered skills, and the role and impact on HRD using alternative analytical tools, exploring a variety of organizational and sector contexts.</p>
