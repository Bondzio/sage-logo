<title>Background</title>
<p>Outcome Competences for Practitioners in Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) were published in February 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177413486736">Burnett, 2011</xref>). The competences are aligned with the NHS Knowledge and Skills Framework (KSF) and also to the National Occupational Standards (NOS) and designed to be used by individuals, teams, employers and educators to, for example, guide education programmes and the professional development of specialist expertise in IPC and also for service planning and development.</p>
<p>In 2006 the Audit and Surveillance Forum (ASF) was formed as a special interest group of the society. In 2007 a widening of the Infection Prevention Society (IPS) membership categories to include all healthcare practitioners making a substantive contribution to IPC enabled those involved in audit and surveillance, but not employed as IPC practitioners, to become involved in the forum.</p>

<p>Many of those working within audit and surveillance are also IPC practitioners with a responsibility for the collection and analysis of local data to inform activity directed at reducing healthcare associated infection and providing information for the trust/health board, chief executive and board. Others have a general nursing, scientific or administrative background. A survey undertaken by the ASF suggested that specific competences for audit and surveillance staff would be helpful and work was begun in 2008. This was suspended while the Outcome Competences for Practitioners in Infection Prevention and Control were developed and published. In the last 12 months the forum has realigned the draft AS competences with the outcome framework.</p>
<sec id="section2-1757177413486736">
<title>How the competences can be used</title>
<p>The specific audit and surveillance competences are an expansion of Domain A: Clinical practice, Competency Statement 2, ‘Collate, analyse and communicate data relating to preventing and controlling infection for surveillance purposes’, of the Outcome Competences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177413486736">Burnett, 2011</xref>). They are focused on specific aspects of the collation, analysis and communication of data and are relevant to practitioners working in substantive audit and surveillance roles but also to those with a limited audit and surveillance component to their job.</p>
<p>The AS competences may be used as a self-assessment tool or as part of the personal development planning process in collaboration with line managers for those healthcare workers who are operating in audit and surveillance supporting roles. Specialist practitioners may choose to use the competences to plan further development in specific areas of audit and surveillance as part of the outcome framework.</p>
