<abstract>
<p>The objective of this study was to replicate the associations between the serotonin transporter genotypes and smoking cessation and between these genotypes and long-term smoking cessation success (for 2 years or more). Two case–control designs were used in this study. The first case–control design consisted of 47 ex-smokers (cases) and 94 smokers (controls). The second case–control design consisted of the 12 ex-smokers who had succeeded in long-term smoking cessation (cases) and the 24 smokers (controls). In the first design, there was no significant difference in allele frequency and genotype distribution between cases and controls. In the second design, the S/S genotype frequency was higher in cases than in controls, but the difference did not reach slightly statistical significance. The present study suggests that individuals with the S/S genotype are more inclined to achieve long-term smoking cessation than others.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Smoking is one of the most important risk factors for serious diseases, including cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, it has been shown that tobacco smoking moderately increases the risk (by approximately 1.5 times) of total cancers in the Japanese population compared with the nonsmoking Japanese population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510377652">1</xref></sup> However, smoking behavior persists in the Japanese population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539510377652">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510377652">4</xref></sup> In Japan, the incidence of smoking is 39.5% among males, and the incidence of smoking among females (20-30 years old) has increased recently.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510377652">4</xref></sup> It is strongly recommended that smokers should cease smoking for good health. However, there are reasons as to why smokers are unable to quit smoking. It is now recognized that cigarette smoking is primarily a manifestation of nicotine addiction and that smokers have individual tendencies in their level of nicotine intake. Smokers control the way they puff and inhale to achieve their desired nicotine dose. Therefore, to conduct an effective smoking cessation program we need to adapt the cessation program to each individual.</p>
<p>Studies on twins indicated that genetic factors were more significant than environmental factors in influencing smoking habits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539510377652">5</xref></sup> Carmelli et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539510377652">6</xref></sup> reported that the concordance rate was significantly higher among monozygotic than dizygotic twins for smoking, not smoking, and quitting smoking. Therefore, to conduct a smoking cessation program effectively it may be beneficial to personalize the program based on the individual’s genetic background. It will, therefore, be useful to clarify the genetic polymorphisms associated with smoking cessation and smoking behavior. Smoking has been associated with the serotonin transporter–linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), which influences serotonin transporter (5-HTT) function.</p>
<p>An association between 5-HTTLPR genotype and smoking cessation has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510377652">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539510377652">9</xref></sup> The 5-HTT gene is located on human chromosome 17q11.1-17q12.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539510377652">10</xref></sup> In the 5-HTTLPR, there are 2 common alleles, a 44-bp insertion (L allele) or deletion (S allele). Compared with the L allele, the S allele is associated with reduced transcription.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539510377652">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510377652">12</xref></sup> 5-HTT activity was shown to be decreased in vivo in the S/S genotype in comparison with those with the S/L and L/L genotypes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510377652">12</xref></sup> After smoking cessation, diminished serotoninergic transmission may mediate mood disturbances associated with nicotine withdrawal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539510377652">13</xref></sup> Furthermore, preliminary clinical data suggested that serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine hydrochloride, may facilitate smoking cessation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510377652">14</xref></sup> Therefore, we predicted that individuals with the S/S genotype or the S allele could easily stop smoking than others.</p>
<p>Japanese individuals with the S/S genotype were less inclined to smoking and/or could quit more easily smoking than others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539510377652">8</xref></sup> Conversely, there is a report suggesting that American individuals with either the S/S or the S/L genotype and a high level of neuroticism experienced difficulty in quitting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539510377652">9</xref></sup> However, Lerman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510377652">7</xref></sup> were unable to report any association between 5-HTTLPR genotype and a 12-month posttreatment quit rate following a minimal-contact smoking cessation program among Caucasian or African American smokers. A recent study found no association between the 5-HTTLPR genotype and smoking behavior in Caucasians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539510377652">15</xref></sup> Moreover, no work has focused on the association of the 5-HTTLPR genotypes with long-term smoking cessation success.</p>
<p>The objective of this study was to replicate the association between the 5-HTTLPR genotypes and smoking cessation and that between these genotypes and long-term smoking cessation success; that is, cessation for 2 years or more. Considering the gender difference in the prevalence of smoking, only male subjects were examined.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>The subjects included 363 male smokers recruited during 1999. We followed them until 2003. They were a group of employees aged between 25 and 50 years, working in Yamanashi. Their smoking habits were assessed annually by questionnaire, for example, “Do you currently smoke?” and “Did you smoke in the past?” At the last assessment in 2003, there were 47 ex-smokers (ie, those who had stopped smoking) and 316 others, who had continued smoking. Among the 47 ex-smokers, 12 ex-smokers had succeeded in long-term smoking cessation for 2 years or more.</p>
<p>In this study, we used 2 case–control designs. In these designs, each case was matched with a control for age and number of cigarettes smoked per day. The first case–control design consisted of the 47 ex-smokers (cases) and the 94 smokers (controls). The ratio of controls to cases was 1:2. The second case–control design consisted of the 12 ex-smokers who had succeeded in long-term smoking cessation (cases) and the 24 smokers (controls). In addition, the ratio of controls to cases was 1:2.</p>
<p>We obtained informed consent from all the subjects. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Yamanashi, Faculty of Medicine.</p>

<sec id="section4-1010539510377652">
<title>Genotyping</title>
<p>Genomic DNA was extracted from whole-blood samples by standard procedures using the FlexiGene DNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Genotyping was carried out according to a method reported previously, with a minor modification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510377652">12</xref></sup> In brief, the fragment including the polymorphism was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotide primers 5′-GGC GTT GCC GCT CTG AAT GC-3′ and 5′-GAG GGA CTG AGC TGG ACA ACC A-3′ in a final volume of 15 µL containing approximately 50 ng genomic DNA, 3 pmol of each primer, 3 µL 5× AccuPrime (GC-Rich Buffer, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), which contains 300 mM Tris–HCl (pH 9.2), 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM dGTP, 1 mM dATP, 1 mM dTTP, 1 mM dCTP, thermostable AccuPrime proteins and enhancers, and 0.6 units GC-Rich DNA Polymerase (AccuPrime) with a thermocycler (GeneAmp PCR System 9700; PE Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). PCR was performed with an initial step at 95°C for 3 minutes, followed by 30 cycles at 95°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 61°C for 30 seconds, and an extension at 72°C for 1 minute with a final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes. To distinguish the alleles, all the amplicons were separated using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide.</p>

<sec id="section5-1010539510377652">
<title>Statistical Procedures</title>
<p>Deviations of genotype distribution from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium were assessed using χ<sup>2</sup> test. The relationships between the 5-HTTLPR genotypes and smoking status were analyzed using the conditional logistic regression model. The relationships between 5-HTTLPR allele frequency and smoking status were analyzed using unconditional logistic regression model. Genotypes were divided into S/S and S/L + L/L genotypes because whole-blood serotonin levels were significantly lower in individuals with the S/S genotype than in those with other genotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539510377652">16</xref></sup> and the L/L genotype being uncommon among the Japanese. A <italic>P</italic> value of .05 was considered to be significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In the first case–control design, there were 47 cases and 94 controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539510377652">Table 1</xref>). In the 47 cases, the average age was 35.3 years and the average number of cigarettes smoked per day was 17.7. In the 94 controls, the average age was 35.4 years and the average number of cigarettes smoked per day was 18.1. A χ<sup>2</sup> test by the calculated genotypes on observed alleles and the observed genotypes showed that the observed genotypes both in cases (<italic>P</italic> = .95) and controls (<italic>P</italic> = .45) were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. There was no significant difference in allele frequency and genotype distribution between the 47 cases and the 94 controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1010539510377652">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The 5-HTTLPR genotype frequencies in the subjects included in this study who experienced smoking (ie, ex-smokers and smokers) were similar to those in previously reported subjects who experienced smoking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510377652">7</xref></sup> The frequencies of the S/S, S/L, and L/L genotypes in this study were 61.7%, 35.5%, and 2.8%, respectively, and 67.9%, 28.2%, and 3.9% in the previous study subjects.</p>
<p>The uncommon allele, XL, was found in 2 of the 188 alleles in the smokers, whereas no XL allele was found in the 47 ex-smokers.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study suggests that the 5-HTTLPR genotype is associated with long-term smoking cessation success; that is, cessation of smoking for 2 years or more. The S/S genotype frequency was higher in ex-smokers who had succeeded in long-term smoking cessation than in controls but the difference did not reach slightly statistical significance (hazard ratio = 8.3, 95% confidence interval = 0.98-71.00). This finding indicates that having the S/S genotype may be an important factor for success in long-term smoking cessation. However, no association between the 5-HTTLPR genotype and smoking cessation was observed.</p>
<p>We considered a neurochemical mechanism for the association. Nicotine increases serotonin secretion in the brain, whereas nicotine withdrawal has the opposite effect, suggesting that the appetite and mood disturbances associated with nicotine withdrawal may be mediated by diminished serotoninergic transmission. Treatment with fluoxetine, a 5-HT uptake inhibitor, effectively prevents the increased food intake and weight gain in smokers who reduce their nicotine intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539510377652">17</xref></sup> The S allele is associated with lower transcriptional activity, resulting in decreased 5-HTT expression and serotonin uptake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510377652">12</xref></sup> In addition, Narita et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539510377652">18</xref></sup> have suggested that reuptake activity of 5-HTT in the brains of individuals with the L allele may be higher and that the 5-HT concentration in the extracellular space may be maintained at a lower level in individuals with the L allele compared with those with the S allele. Therefore, individuals with the S allele or S/S genotype may easily stop smoking than others. However, the results of the present study do not support this hypothesis.</p>
<p>We found no association between the 5-HTTLPR genotype and smoking cessation. On the other hand, the S/S genotype may be associated with long-term smoking cessation success for 2 years or more. A possible reason for this difference is the greater contribution of the 5-HTTLPR genotype to long-term smoking cessation success than to temporary smoking cessation. Dependence on tobacco smoking is a complex behavior, and both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the variance. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1010539510377652">Table 2</xref> shows that the frequencies of the S/L + L/L genotypes were almost the same in the ex-smokers and in controls. This result may indicate that other factors, such as peer influence, rather than the 5-HTTLPR genotype contribute more strongly to the difficulty of quitting. On the other hand, as shown <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1010539510377652">Table 4</xref>, the frequency of the S/S genotypes differed widely between the ex-smokers who had succeeded in long-term smoking cessation and their controls. This result may indicate that the L allele is associated with the difficulty of successful long-term smoking cessation. This result is consistent with a previous Japanese study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539510377652">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>We cannot compare the present study with previous research because of the differences in recruitment methods and genotype grouping. For example, Lerman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510377652">7</xref></sup> reported no association between 5-HTT genotypes and a 12-month posttreatment quit rate among Caucasian or African American smokers. However, these smokers, more than half of whom were females, were recruited through media advertisement for a smoking cessation program; these smokers may be eager to quit smoking but were unable to quit on their own. On the other hand, the subjects in the present study were male employees whose smoking behavior was assessed annually. Furthermore, the L allele frequency is known to be lower in Japanese (0.19) than in European Americans (0.60) and African Americans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539510377652">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>It should be noted that a previous study in which subjects were randomly selected Japanese men has suggested that 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the 5-HTT gene may influence the difficulty of quitting among Japanese men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539510377652">20</xref></sup> Furthermore, a 17-bp variable number of tandem repeats at the second intron in the 5-HTT gene also seems to modulate the transcription of this gene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539510377652">21</xref></sup> Therefore, further studies are needed with regard to these polymorphisms to confirm whether 5-HTT gene polymorphisms influence smoking cessation.s</p>
<p>Our study has several limitations. The subjects were followed for 5 years to assess self-reports of smoking behavior; therefore, their precise smoking behavior was not known after the assessment. It is possible that some of them may get back into the habit of smoking. It should also be noted that we used self-reports of smoking behavior for the 5 years; therefore, an accurate assessment of their smoking cessation was not possible. However, to minimize this inaccuracy we conducted a yearly survey through questionnaires. The other limitation was that we were unable to obtain objective measurements indicating the amount of nicotine intake and the nicotine dependence level among the subjects. However, to minimize this problem we evaluated the mean number of cigarettes smoked per day, which indicated the subjects’ nicotine dependence level.</p>
<p>Our study indicated an association between the S/S genotype and long-term smoking cessation success for 2 years or more. In other words, we showed that individuals with the S/L or L/L genotype may experience more difficulty in quitting than individuals with the S/S genotype. Therefore, smokers with the S/L or L/L genotype require a more rigorous smoking cessation program. Further studies are required to clarify the extent to which the ease of smoking cessation is attributable to the effect of the 5-HTTLPR genotype, to establish an appropriate smoking cessation program.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study suggests that individuals with the S/S genotype are more likely to continue smoking cessation than others.</p>
