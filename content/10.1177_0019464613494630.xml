<p><italic>The Flaming Feet</italic> by D.R. Nagaraj (1954–98) provides original insight into the history and practices of the Dalit movement, the relationship between Dalit and vernacular literature and the Ambedkar–Gandhi relationship. Nagaraj is imaginative, radical and yet attentive to local level challenges to Dalit struggles that may also contest the orthodoxies of Dalit movement. This is the first book that (<italic>a</italic>) offers a conceptual framework to Dalit studies by locating the precise moment in the rise of Dalit subjects as historical actors, (<italic>b</italic>) offers a conceptual framework to understand the emergence of the Dalit movement in modern India and (<italic>c</italic>) offers a comprehensive reinterpretation of Gandhi–Ambedkar agendas on caste and untouchability. Equally relevant are Nagaraj’s reflections on the relationship between caste, census and Dalit agendas.</p>
<p>Before I proceed, I want to register the significance of this edition that is a testimony to the new times in Indian academia, including the emergence of Dalit studies. The first edition of <italic>The Flaming Feet</italic> published by a Bangalore based organisation in 1993 was not reviewed by any major journal in the field. I will let the readers draw their respective judicious judgement about the priorities of the 1980s and the 1990s, but today Dalit studies has emerged as the new radical subject and one that you cannot afford to ignore. Prithvi Datta, Chandra Shobi and Permanent Black have done the academic community an outstanding service by publishing a revised edition of the book that consists of four sections and sixteen essays (the first edition had two sections and six chapters).</p>
<p>First, Nagaraj offers the most compelling explanation, to date, to explain the rise of new Dalit consciousness in modern Indian history. He dates the birth of the radical Dalit subject to the events around Gandhian fast in May 1933. The Harijan youth, as Mahadev Desai describes him, was supposed to have returned on 29 May 1933 to offer Gandhi an orange to break the fast. The Harijan youth had come to meet Gandhi earlier, on 8 May, for assistance to secure a scholarship. When Gandhi invited him, the youth failed to show up and told the press, to the dismay of Gandhians in the camp, that he was denied entry to the ashram. He later admitted to having lied. Desai explained the disappointment of Gandhians in the camp to the ‘feeling of undue self-abasement’ (p. 55) fostered by the caste Hindu’s practice of untouchability and the lack of strength on the part of youth. According to Nagaraj, the irony of the invitation was not lost on the Dalit youth, who was aware of the historical significance of his position in offering Gandhi an orange. As he writes, ‘[m]etaphorically speaking, the Harijan boy who took a decision not to keep the appointment with Gandhiji was reborn as a Dalit youth’ (p. 55).</p>
<p>Once we recognise the birth of the Dalit subject in 1933, we can also understand Nagaraj’s typology of the Dalit movement consisting of (<italic>a</italic>) the proto-Dalit activism (1900–30), (<italic>b</italic>) the emergence and consolidation of Ambedkarite paradigm and (<italic>c</italic>) the birth of the Dalit panthers movement in Maharashtra, 1972 (p. 95, also Chapters 5 and 8). The proto-Dalit activism stage combined several different elements, the gradual-constitutionalist mode, generosity of ruling regimes and its reliance on continued Indic social and cultural traditions. We can group three broad practices adopted by Shudra and Dalit groups in this phase. First, the social and religious movements in the nineteenth and twentieth century, often described as a period of ferment in Indian society, sought to fundamentally question the hierarchy justified by the caste system. According to Nagaraj, the cultural and political encounter with the West enabled the non-Brahman movement in western India led by Joti Rao Phule, the Nadars in Tamil Nadu, the Satnami movement in Chattisgarh (central India), the Mahima movement in Orissa (eastern India), and the lower caste and Dalit Christian converts in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, to question the legitimacy of Brahmanic power and caste hierarchy. Many of the movements like the Satnami and Mahima, led by indigenous radicals, were motivated by the ‘spiritual requirements of their tradition’ (p. 25) to resist caste hierarchies. Second, is the ‘pragmatist mode represented by M.C. Raja [<italic>sic</italic>] and other constitutionalists, who were basically indifferent to questions of cultural symbolism and memory’ (p. 149). The non-Brahman movement was opposed to Brahman’s domination in the political and economic levels but ideologically it had internalised the brahmanical value system. The third kind of proto-Dalit activism, best represented by Adi-Hindu movements, created an alternative historical memory by utilising colonial and Hindu sources. In building a modern political community through a social religious collectivity, they appealed to a new historical and ancient past that is pre-Aryan but also occupationally pure. Yet, by engaging with mainstream Hinduism and the spiritual Bhakti tradition, the Ad-Dharm adopted the radical poet Ravi Dass, a living tradition, to build a new ‘magisterial past which they had never before experienced’ (p. 152). The most important achievement of these proto-Dalit movements was to offer dignity to the lives of Dalits. Nagaraj dates the rise of Ambedkar movement to the year 1933, when ‘the Harjian boy who took a decision not to keep the appointment with Gandhiji was reborn as a Dalit Youth’ (p. 55). He argues that Ambedkar’s achievement was to create ‘an alternative memory’ by refusing to accept the possibilities of ‘liberating elements in the living experience of Dalits’ (p. 158). A key element of Ambedkarite movement is rage, against caste Hindu religious and social ethos and the denial of self-respect.</p>
<p>Third, the 1932–33 events, claims Nagaraj, had a fundamental impact in informing Gandhi and Ambekar’s understanding of untouchability, the former recognising the role of economic policies in the lives of Dalits and the latter recognising the role of religion and culture. The position of Ambedkar and Gandhi on untouchability shifted quite radically. Prior to 1933, Gandhi had considered the problem of untouchability purely as a religious and spiritual problem, and his understanding was typical of Indic religious models of dealing with critiques of caste inequities. In particular, Gandhi repeatedly and consistently forced the Hindus to deal with it at a personal and collective level. After the encounter with Ambedkar, Gandhi recognised the larger holistic understanding of the problem of untouchability: the primacy of economic uplift, especially in the villages. Similarly, prior to 1933, Ambedkar had refused to recognise the problem of untouchability as a religious one. Indeed, Ambedkar treated the question of untouchability as ‘a civil rights issue’ (p. 43) by supporting Mahad and temple entry struggles. After this encounter, Ambedkar sought to create an ‘alternative memory’ denying the possibility of ‘liberating elements in the living experience of Dalits’ to create a new ‘present in cultural terms’ (p. 158). Ambedkar’s 1935 Yeola declaration, that he would not die a Hindu, recognised the importance of religion for rebuilding a new Dalit memory. Dalit sensibility has been shaped by Ambedkar’s complete rejection of existing tradition because ‘caste ethos is at the core of all institutions’ (p. 158) that had evolved over the centuries in India. Thus, the historical past, located in the Hindu texts, came to embody tales of shame and cruelty, becoming an important framework to build a Dalit political community.</p>
<p>The Dalit struggles over the last two centuries represent a response to the Brahmanical texts and orthodox Hindus who have denied dignity to Dalits, denied their alternative religious traditions that have critiqued hierarchy in Hindu religion and have denied them their rights. Nagaraj cautions against the recent postcolonial historiographical position, including the recent writings on the subject, that tend to reduce Dalit struggles as a product of the practices of colonial governmentality, a perception that may remove culture from the Dalit’s lives (p. 201). Instead, he draws insights from historical and personal experiences of Dalit movements in Karnataka (the localities) to emphasise the role of literary and lived experiences. One example of this is the crucial role of Dalit struggles against dominant literary forms in the vernacular languages which Nagaraj demonstrates through the 1970s <italic>Bhusa</italic> (rice husk) controversy in the Kannada language. Localised Dalit struggles in different regions of India may offer new possibilities to the present day movement. Nagaraj argues that the Karnataka Dalit Sangharsh Samiti (DSS) strategy to celebrate Indian Independence-day through a programme of ‘drink some water from our hands’ in villages and small towns of the state forced the issue of untouchability on the caste Hindus. According to him, DSS combined the elements of militant Ambedkarite movement in a Gandhian way to force the villagers to address the question of inequity. Engaging with historical, literary and political themes in Indian history, these essays offer new theoretical insights into the rise of Dalit movement and to the study of modern India.</p>
