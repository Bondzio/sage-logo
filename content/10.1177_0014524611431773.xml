<abstract>
<p>The long standing debate over how to interpret Galatians 3:28 gets bogged down in two main ways. The first is disagreement over whether it only applies to our justification with God, or if it also has implications for our relationships with each other. In other words, is this passage just about our vertical relationship with God – soteriology - or does it also include the horizontal relationship we have with others – ecclesiology? The second problem hovers around an associated question: the nature of ‘equality in being’ but ‘difference in function’. Can a person be inherently equal if they are disqualified from certain roles they are capable of doing, and that disqualification is entirely based on their gender? This paper argues that the full context of Galatians demonstrates that Galatians 3:28 is in fact relevant for egalitarian social interaction as well as equality with God through justification. It then demonstrates how ‘equality in being’ but a ‘different function imposed on some people because of their essential being’, is self-contradictory and unsustainable. This discussion is critical for a more confident acceptance of the egalitarian position in church life today.</p>

<p>‘There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.’</p>
<p>Gordon Fee rightly sums up the major controversy about this passage when he writes: ‘Is the equity, or the oneness, of the three pairs – Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female – to be limited to the justifying work of Christ alone, or does it include other aspects of life in the believing community as well?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0014524611431773">1</xref></sup> These two key options are clearly at loggerheads: it is either talking about a wide application including both salvation and social relationships, or it is limited to a narrow theological application that restricts itself to our salvation alone. Every reader has to make a decision which ‘school’ they will choose to belong to.</p>
<p>The first school of opinion that comes from this text is the one that sees the text as a liberating passage: one of the most foundational and liberating texts in the New Testament in fact. It is liberating for women especially, in our day and age. In the first century it was particularly relevant to Gentiles, and in the 19<sup>th</sup> century it was particularly relevant to slaves, but the context we find ourselves in these days makes the passage a most significant contribution to the liberation of women in the church. This first school sees the passage as stating foundational principles that underscore the rest of the New Testament regarding interpersonal relationships between men and women, (and between those from different ethnicities, and those of different social standings). Women can be leaders, preachers, or do anything that they are gifted for. If they have a sense of call and the ability, they can not be hindered from any role in church life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0014524611431773">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second school says that this passage is taken from its context when such a broad application is made. This alternate school goes on to say that the passage must be limited in application. It is about everyone’s justification by faith, and that is the great statement of equality: that all can be saved through faith, by the grace of God. It is not about interpersonal relationships here and now. In other words, it is only about soteriology, and not about ecclesiology. It is about each individual’s equal access to God through faith – and from that point of view, there is equality between Jews and Gentiles, slaves and free, and men and women. Women can not assume this passage gives them equality in role at a social or human relationship level. It only gives equality in status in the sight of God. Roles are determined by other texts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0014524611431773">3</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section1-0014524611431773">
<title>Considering context</title>
<p>Advocates for the ‘narrow’ application (‘just’ justification) appeal to the immediate context. Advocates for the broader application appeal to context as well, but not just the immediate pericope. They appeal to ‘whole letter’ context.</p>
<p><italic>All</italic> levels of context <italic>have</italic> to be considered. With no other text do we limit our examination of a passage to just the surrounding paragraph or two. Of course we start with immediate sentence and paragraph context, but we know we can not stay there. We have to also consider the next layer of context (whole letter or document). They are both critical to a full understanding of why something is being said to those people, in that document, at that time. Contextual considerations do not stop there either of course, and one should also engage in the next level (other writings of the same author) and then the next (the whole Testament perspective) and finally the last (the whole Bible story on the topic).</p>
<p>For our text, then, we have to ask: Where does the context begin and end? My concern is that the proponents of the ‘narrow’ application of Gal. 3:28 limit their investigation to the immediate context, thereby missing some significant ‘whole letter’ considerations that have a bearing on the text.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the immediate context is about becoming a part of Abraham’s family; becoming a part of Christ’s body, the church. The immediate material right before the verse in question <italic>is</italic> about justification.</p>
<p>If we leave context at that level, however, we will never understand the complete picture. We have to go to the second level of contextual examination. And here is where the narrow interpretation suffers. It is stopping the hermeneutical examination short to just talk about the ‘justification by faith context’. The very discussion of justification by faith, is raised by Paul <italic>because of a very real problem that arose in the church in Antioch</italic>.</p>
<p>The wider context begins at Galatans 2:11: ‘When Cephas came to Antioch I opposed him to his face because he stood condemned. For before certain people came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group. The other Jews joined in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy, even Barnabas was led astray’ (2:11-13).</p>
<p>The next verse is critical: ‘When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of them all…[you are a hypocrite]’ (v.14).</p>
<p>This <italic>immediately</italic> begins the lengthy discussion on justification by faith. ‘We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles know that a person is not justified by observing the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we too have put our faith in Christ Jesus so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law because by observing the law no one will be justified’ (vs. 15,16).</p>
<p>The discussion on justification continues now right up to our focus verse (3:28). The entire reflection on justification by Paul is birthed from a social setting: where human ‘horizontal’ relationships were not reflecting the ‘vertical’ equality we all have in Christ with God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0014524611431773">4</xref></sup> An ecclesiological problem of discrimination was the cause of Paul’s soteriological discussion.</p>
<p>Lewis Johnson tries to ignore this contextual bombshell, by acknowledging it briefly and then explaining it away without thorough examination. Johnson cites (and disagrees with) another writer, Jewett. Jewett points out the social implications of the story about Peter in Antioch. He wrote that Paul did not say ‘Jews and Greeks are one in Christ, but in other respects, such as in the table fellowship traditions, they are different and must follow the discriminatory traditions. We may enjoy spiritual fellowship with the Gentiles but the social traditions still remain’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0014524611431773">5</xref></sup> As soon as this Jewett quote is given by Johnson, Johnson works quickly to dismiss it: ‘This is not quite the point of the apostle. … he does not rebuke Peter because he has failed to see the social implications of the oneness in Christ, but because he had seen them and was now returning to the weak and worthless elemental things (cf. 4:9). As Paul saw it Peter’s actions were a clear attack on the doctrine of justification by faith alone. To observe the Jewish food laws was simply a step along the way to circumcision as necessary to salvation, a step along the way to the view that if Gentile believers were not able to have table fellowship with Jewish believers as Gentile believers, then their Christianity was second class.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0014524611431773">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Contrary to Johnson here, Paul <italic>does</italic> rebuke Peter for failing to see the social implications of the oneness in Christ. Consider 2:14 more closely (a verse that is noticeable by its absence in Johnson’s analysis): ‘I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel…’</p>
<p>The main things to note are (1) the word oρθoπoδoυσιν, (walking or acting out in your life) and (2) the significance that Paul uses the word ευαγγελιoυ in this immediate comment and (3) the link between lifestyle and theology: <italic>walking</italic> and αληθειν – <italic>truth</italic>.</p>
<p>Combining the metaphor oρθoπoδoυσιν, (‘to walk in a straight course, to be straightforward’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0014524611431773">7</xref></sup>) with ευαγγελιoυ here, we see the cause of Paul’s distress. The very ευαγγελιoυ – the very <italic>gospel</italic> – the message of salvation: saved by grace, received by faith, not by works – that message is not leading to the straightforward application of its socially radical repercussions. Peter should have known better. He had had the whole ‘animals-in-the-sheet’ vision and the Cornelius event. He was a reluctant convert to Gentile equality. But he <italic>knew</italic>. And yet he did not apply the <italic>truth</italic> of the <italic>gospel</italic> message of justification by faith, to daily social interaction with others. He wanted to leave people equal in the sight of God but unequal in day to day life and behaviour towards one another.</p>
<p>The whole discussion on justification by faith is birthed by inequality and divisions actually happening socially in the Christian community.</p>

<title>A different attempt to avoid the wider implications of 3:28</title>
<p>Ed L. Miller offers a different way to dismiss the implications of this passage in its full context.</p>
<p>Miller makes the astonishing claim that not only does this passage only refer to ‘the soteriological level’, but he goes on to say: ‘the bad news is that there is another level presupposed by the passage, and it turns out that at this other level such distinctions, far from being abrogated, are actually reinforced. This is the ordinary, everyday level of practical social life’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0014524611431773">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>He offers reasons (discussed below) why the passage actually reinforces social distinctions, and then concludes: ‘Paul is not in fact denying absolutely and in every respect the difference between Jew and Greek, etc. … if something of the male/female difference (biological constitution) is sustained in spite of the new faith-perspective, then presumably it is also in the Jew/Greek and slave/free differences. But what could these continuing differences consist of if not social status?… at some level Paul is advocating a social <italic>status quo.’</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0014524611431773">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Miller attempts to justify this claim. He works on the assumption that Paul’s use of ‘ouk/oude; ouk/oude;’ and then ‘ouk/kai’ means that we should not read the three phrases as ‘neither/nor’ but rather as ‘not/and’. Verse 28 does not any longer read as:</p>
<p>There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, neither male nor female, for you are all one in Jesus Christ (TNIV).</p>
<p>Rather Miller believes it should be read as:</p>
<p>There is not Jew and Greek, there is not slave and free, and there is not male and female, for you are all one in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>How does this altered rendering change the meaning so as to reinforce social distinctions?</p>
<p>Miller continues: ‘There is of course a world of difference between ‘neither x nor y’ and ‘not x and y’. The former excludes both x and y, where as the latter allows x, and it allows y, but not both’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0014524611431773">10</xref></sup> And from this narrow logic, he develops his thesis that the passage wants to keep men and women, and slaves and free, and Jews and Greeks, distinct on a social level. Both can’t exist together in a soteriological sense, but the one and the other <italic>must</italic> be separated on a social level. ‘Paul is operating with the standard Jewish model according to which the legitimate heir is a Jew, a free person, and a male. Thus, there is a sense in which those who are in Christ… are all Jews, all free and all males. … If so, Paul is presupposing and thus reinforcing a conception of the social order in which these distinctions are not only real but are in fact to be pressed into the service of explaining how God makes good his salvific promise. The explanation presupposes not only the differences, but more importantly, the practical and social superiority of the position of the Jew, the free person and the male!’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0014524611431773">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The x and y logic used by Miller is inherently flawed. ‘Neither/nor’ of course means you cannot have either. But ‘not/and’ does not have only one possible way of being understood. It does not have to <italic>only</italic> mean you can have either x or y, but you cannot have both (as Miller argues). It could alternatively mean you can <italic>not</italic> have either. That is, ‘not x and y’ can as an option, mean ‘You can’t have x and you can’t have y either’. To assume it must be understood as ‘you can have either x or y but not both of them’ is not offering the full range of logical options that are, in the end, dependent on the context for understanding. And the alternative possibility here undermines Miller’s argument.</p>
<p>There is, however, an even bigger issue that dismantles Miller’s thesis. Note Paul’s use of the phrases he employs here. Technically, if one was being completely literal in translation, the verse would read:</p>
<p>‘There is <italic>neither</italic> Jew <italic>nor</italic> Greek, there is <italic>neither</italic> slave <italic>nor</italic> free, there is <italic>not</italic> male <italic>and</italic> female, for you are all one in Jesus Christ.’</p>
<p>Miller, however, argues that Paul means all 3 phrases to be not/and, because of the last one. He has to admit (and then ignore) the fact that not/and with male and female was a very common construction based on the Septuagint version of Genesis 1:27c, and <italic>that</italic> would explain Paul’s slip from the pattern he used for the other two. Paul does not want us to treat all three as not/and, but rather all three are actually neither/nor.</p>

<title>Imperfect social settings and Christian life</title>
<p>Paul in various letters, exhorts people to work within the common social structures they find themselves in. This does <italic>not</italic>, however, mean that Paul is focused on <italic>maintaining</italic> social structures and hierarchical distinctions. It does not mean that God <italic>desires</italic> those particular social structures.</p>
<p>Paul and all the early Christians were living in a society that was imperfect and full of divisions. He wanted to give advice on how to live as a Christian in those social realities, in an imperfect world. He told slaves and masters how to live, and husbands and wives, and parents and children. But he did not see the social distinctions and structures as God-ordained. They were the way things were… and Christians have to live today, and each day, in the midst of the unjust world. So here is advice on how to do it at a higher level. Masters, treat your slaves well, remembering that you too have a master in heaven. Slaves work hard for your masters as if to Christ, and not just when they are watching you. Husbands love your wives like Jesus loved the church and gave himself for her. And so on. Paul’s advice lifts the individual Christian to a higher level of experience in the midst of unjust and imperfect human structures that he could not change in his day. Paul accepts that real world social divisions exist: but he does not want Christians, who belong to a new created order, to put any <italic>significance</italic> in those worldly structures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0014524611431773">12</xref></sup> We will live in the midst of them, yes, but we will live to a higher call. We will not use existing social inequalities and structures to dictate how we live in relationship to one another.</p>
<p>Paul did not have the opportunities to do what Wilberforce would later do. Nevertheless, he did what he could do: he instructed Christians how to rise above the imperfect structures and demonstrate Christ-likeness in the situations they found themselves in. For Paul to acknowledge the realities of social distinctions around him is <italic>not</italic> Paul endorsing them or promoting them. It is Paul <italic>working within them and calling Christ-followers to live to a higher ethic</italic>.</p>

<sec id="section4-0014524611431773">
<title>Equal in being but still having different functions?</title>
<p>A recurring question that needs to be addressed is: Is it not true that we can be equal but not have the same function?</p>
<p>Of course this is true. Not everyone has the same function. If they did then lots of things would never get done. We all have different gifts and talents and callings, and we do what we do as a part of the diverse body of Christ.</p>
<p>So: does that mean that we can be equal – and then women (or slaves or non-Jews) – can then be told that they have different functions – ordained by God? And some functions are forbidden them – also ordained by God? This is often said. It is, however, a smoke screen to divert the discussion off women and ministry, and to preserve the status quo.</p>
<p>Consider the glaring problem with that proposition. Women, supposedly are equal in being, but they are ordained by God to be barred from some functions (that many of them are qualified and capable of performing). Why are they not permitted to do those functions? Because of their essential <italic>being</italic>. They are female. So they are supposedly equal in <italic>being</italic>, but their essential <italic>being</italic> restricts them from doing specific things that they are competent to do. This is double talk.</p>
<p>Groothuis puts it well: ‘Because a woman’s traditionally inferior status follows necessarily from the single fact of her essential female nature, her status is itself a function of her ‘being’; it is determined by what she is, not by what she can do. … Regardless of how hierarchalists try to explain the situation, the idea that women are equal <italic>in</italic> their being, yet unequal <italic>by virtue</italic> of their being, is contradictory and ultimately nonsensical. … A permanent and comprehensive subordination based on a person’s essence is an essential (not merely a functional) subordination. In the final analysis, gender hierarchy allows for no meaningful distinction between the person and the position.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0014524611431773">13</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section5-0014524611431773">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>By only considering verses immediately around Galatians 3:28, a focus can certainly be made on ‘justification by faith’. But by allowing earlier material in Paul’s letter to inform us, we see that the whole discussion on ‘justification by faith’ was birthed by an act of social discrimination. The perpetrators of the discrimination were not ‘acting in line with the truth of the gospel’. They were failing to apply the great truth that all are justified equally by God – and hence it must impact the way we treat each other socially and in community.</p>
