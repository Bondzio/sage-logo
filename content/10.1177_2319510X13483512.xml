<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this article is to investigate the impact of intellectual capital (IC) and its components on the financial performance and market valuation of Information Technology industry in India over the period of 2003–2011. The Value Added Intellectual Coefficient (VAIC) method is used for evaluation of intellectual capital of 22 Information Technology (IT) companies listed in BSE 500. The required data are obtained from the Prowess, a Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) database, empirical analysis is conducted using correlation and regression models are constructed to test the hypotheses. The results showed that the relationships between the performance of a company IC’s and conventional performance indicators are varied and indicate that profitability and intellectual capital are positively associated, whereas no significant relationship is observed between intellectual capital with productivity and market valuation but capital employed efficiency (CEE) which is one of the component of VAIC found significant positive association with productivity and market valuation. The study may serve as a useful input for academician and managers, so that they make proper utilisation of the IC resources in enhancing the value creation capabilities of the companies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The last two decades have witnessed a major transformation in the world economy. The transformation is driven by knowledge related intangible assets. The paradigm of business shifts from an asset centric environment to a knowledge-based environment. It has become more important and decisive than any other physical asset and can be used for survival in a highly competitive business environment in which business firms and other groups are competing for exceptionally limited resources. Intellectual capital describes the knowledge assets that are available to the organisations and is a large part of intangible value. Intellectual capital is a key driver of innovation and core value in a new economy, which enables companies to understand the value creation process as well as to incubate competence to combat uncertainty surrounding the future success of R&amp;D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2319510X13483512">Kim &amp; Kumar, 2009</xref>). Intellectual capital includes human capital and structural capital wrapped up in customers, processes, databases, brands and systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2319510X13483512">Edvinsson &amp; Malone, 1997</xref>) and has been playing an increasingly important role in creating corporate sustainable competitive advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2319510X13483512">Kaplan &amp; Norton, 2004</xref>, p. 4). ‘If knowledge economy is a huge tree, innovation will be the flourishing branches and intellectual capital will be the indispensible nutrition provider—roots.’ Therefore, more and more theorists and practitioners have moved their attention from physical capital to intellectual capital. Business enterprises have also increased their emphasis on knowledge economy management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2319510X13483512">Cheng &amp; Xie, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2319510X13483512">Fu, 2003</xref>). However, despite the increasing recognition of intellectual capital in driving firm value and competitive advantages, an appropriate measure of firms’ intellectual capital is still in infancy. Instead of directly measuring firms’ intellectual capital, Pulic (2000a, b) proposed a measure of the efficiency of value added by corporate intellectual ability (VAIC). The major components of VAIC can be viewed from a firm’s resource base—physical capital, human capital and structural capital. VAIC is being increasingly used in business (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2319510X13483512">Pulic, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2319510X13483512">2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2319510X13483512">b</xref>) and academic applications (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2319510X13483512">Firer and Williams, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article an attempt has been made to measure and investigate the impact of intellectual capital (IC) and its components on the financial performance and market valuation of Information Technology firms being listed in BSE 500 using cross sectional data. Further, the article is structured as follows: the second section briefly describes the review of theoretical and empirical literature and outlines the research gap. The third section develops the theoretical framework for our research hypotheses and depicts empirical procedures. The fourth section describes the methodology used and the results of the data analysis are detailed in the fifth section. The final section summarises and concludes with suggestions for future research.</p>

<title>Review of Literature and Research Gap</title>
<sec id="section3-2319510X13483512">
<title>Intellectual Capital</title>
<p>Intellectual capital is generally intangible in nature; it has become widely accepted as a major corporate strategic asset capable of generating sustainable competitive advantage and superior financial performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2319510X13483512">Barney, 1991</xref>). Edvinsson and Malone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2319510X13483512">1997</xref>), define the difference between a firm’s market value and book value as the value of intellectual capital. Stewart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2319510X13483512">1997</xref>) argued that intellectual resources such as knowledge, information and experience, are the tools for creating wealth and defined intellectual capital as the new wealth of organisations. Sullivan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2319510X13483512">2000</xref>) defined intellectual capital as ‘knowledge that can be converted into profits’. Bontis et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2319510X13483512">2000</xref>) explain IC as individual workers’ and organisational knowledge that contributes to sustainable competitive advantage and further elaborates that IC in broad sense consists of human capital and structural capital.</p>
<p>Although there is a variety of IC definitions, mostly due to the fact that both knowledge-based and economic-based approaches exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2319510X13483512">Walsh et al., 2008</xref>), a considerable number of scholars and practitioners identify three basic components of IC; human capital, structural capital and customer (relational) capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2319510X13483512">Ruta, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2319510X13483512">Walsh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2319510X13483512">Yang &amp; Lin, 2009</xref>). Tovsiga and Tulugurova (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2319510X13483512">2009</xref>) assumed that company IC constitutes the internal and external determinants.</p>
<p>The intellectual capital includes the pioneering work of Pulic (2000a, b) who argued that the market value of organisations is created by capital employed and intellectual capital, while the latter consisting of human and structural capital. Teece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2319510X13483512">2000</xref>), states that intangible assets of the firm and its intellectual capital are the keys to achieving sustainable competitive advantage and drive economic growth. Reeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2319510X13483512">2000</xref>), finds that intellectual capital is a strong predictor of a company’s performance. Correspondingly, Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2319510X13483512">2005</xref>) concluded that intellectual capital is indeed a significant strategic asset, since it is positively related to the firm’s market value and financial performance.</p>

<title>Value Added Intellectual Coefficient (VAIC)</title>
<p>The VAIC is a new management and control tool that is designed to enable the organisation to monitor and measure the intellectual capital performance and potential of the firm. The VAIC method is used by many researchers because of its simple and easy approach to study different aspects of IC efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2319510X13483512">Bornemann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2319510X13483512">Cabrita &amp; Vaz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2319510X13483512">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2319510X13483512">Firer &amp; Williams, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2319510X13483512">Goh, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2319510X13483512">Kujansivu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2319510X13483512">Mavridis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2319510X13483512">Tseng &amp; Goo, 2005</xref>). The VAIC method uses values from the income and position statement. However, the utility and capability of VAIC also suffer from inherent limitations of financial accounting, for example, historical cost and subjectivity. Modern techniques such as current value costing or exit pricing have not been able to provide an alternative accounting method. For example balance sheet figures are used and claimed as true representation of IC performance and the balance sheet itself is acknowledged as a snapshot of financial position at one point of time. Researchers like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2319510X13483512">Goh, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2319510X13483512">Tseng &amp; Goo, 2005</xref>) proposed a number of advantages which can be summarised as follows:
<list id="list1-2319510X13483512" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>There is no restriction so far as the size of the firm is concerned. This means that the model can be used for both small as well as large capitalised firms.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The results from this method can easily be quantified and there is no need to further elaborate its results.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Working with this method is quite easy and understandable.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It enhances the utility of final accounts by incorporating measures of IC performance.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The end results under this methodology can be used to make a comparative analysis of different entities of different sizes and industries.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The definition of IC and the treatment of HC under this method are consistent with each other, which makes this method as the most appropriate method to measure IC performance of any organisation.</p></list-item>

<title>Prior Studies Using the VAIC Methodology</title>
<p>Several studies in the field of intellectual capital have utilised the VAIC model to analyse value creation efficiency of intellectual capital. For example, Bornemann (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2319510X13483512">1999</xref>) found a correlation between intellectual potential and economic performance within Austrian industries. Riahi Belkaoui (2002), concluded that intellectual capital is associated with firm’s performance as measured by a net value added or total wealth created based indicator which is in support of both the resource based and stakeholders’ views in U.S. multinational firms. Firer and Williams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2319510X13483512">2003</xref>) found that IC is negatively related with traditional measures of corporate performance, while the association between these measures of performance and capital employed (physical and financial) is positive. Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2319510X13483512">2005</xref>) found that in Taiwanese listed firms’ intellectual capital had positive impact on both market value and financial performance. Further, Goh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2319510X13483512">2005</xref>), measured the Intellectual Capital performance of Commercial Banks in Malaysia and found that the banks in Malaysia have relatively high HCE in comparison to CEE and SCE and Foreign Banks have higher levels of efficiency as compared to domestic banks but in terms of value created, domestic banks created more Value Added than Foreign Banks. In addition using a sample of Hong Kong Stock Exchange companies Chu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2319510X13483512">2011</xref>) explained that IC as measured by VAIC was positively associated with profitability of businesses and also indicated that the components of VAIC were strong predictors of corporate financial performance.</p>
<p>In India, Kamath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2319510X13483512">2007</xref>), concluded that the observed vast differences in performance of different segments of Indian banks are mainly due to the underlying differences in human capital. Ghosh and Mondal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2319510X13483512">2009</xref>), suggested that the performance of a company’s intellectual capital can explain profitability but not productivity and market valuation in India. Murale and Ashrafali (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2319510X13483512">2010</xref>), showed that there is significant positive relationship between market value to book value and corporate intellectual capital. Pal and Soriya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2319510X13483512">2012</xref>), concluded that profitability (measured by ROA) of companies is reflected through IC performance but no impact of IC performance on the productivity and market valuation was observed in both pharmaceutical and textile industry in India.</p>
<p>The aforesaid discussion makes it clear that development of intellectual capital (IC) concepts in emerging economies is still in its infant stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2319510X13483512">Firer and Williams, 2003</xref>), an insignificant work on the subject has been documented in the Indian setting. In India few studies have been conducted so far however there is a need to make a thorough investigation. Therefore this article attempts to address empirically the relationship between intellectual capital, market to book value and financial performance of Indian Information Technology sector so as to draw the broader conclusions.</p>

<title>Data and Sample Selection</title>
<p>The data for the present research have been taken from prowess a Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) database, for Information Technology (IT) companies listed in BSE 500 for the period of nine years from 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2011, the reason for choosing this period was that the data required for the study were available for these years. Previously, it was decided to select all the 33 IT companies listed on BSE 500 but due to discrepancies in data set 11 companies removed and the final sample of 22 companies have been selected.</p>

<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>The independent variables chosen for the study are VAIC and CEE, HCE and SCE. VAIC is used as a measure for corporate intellectual ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2319510X13483512">Pulic, 2000b</xref>). Firer and Williams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2319510X13483512">2003</xref>) pointed out two benefits of VAIC. Firstly, VAIC provides an easy-to-calculate, standardised and consistent basis of measure, enabling effective comparative analyses across firms and countries; and secondly, the data used in the calculation of VAIC are based on financial statements, which are usually audited by professional public accountants. The steps involved in calculating VAIC are as follows:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula7-2319510X13483512">
Calculate value added (VA):
VA = OUTPUT – INPUT:
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Consistent with Riahi-Belkaoui (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2319510X13483512">2003</xref>), the calculation of value added can be expressed as equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-2319510X13483512">1</xref>):
<disp-formula id="disp-formula8-2319510X13483512">
<label>1</label>
R = S – B – DP – W – I – DD – T
</disp-formula></p>
<p>where: R is changes in retained earnings; S is net sales revenues; B is bought-in materials and services (costs of goods sold); DP is depreciation; W is wages (employee salaries); DD is dividends; and T is taxes.</p>
<p>Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-2319510X13483512">1</xref>) can be re-arranged as equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-2319510X13483512">2</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-2319510X13483512">3</xref>):
<disp-formula id="disp-formula9-2319510X13483512">
<label>2</label>
S – B = DP +W + I + DD + T + R
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="disp-formula10-2319510X13483512">
<label>3</label>
S – B – DP = W + I + DD + T + R
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-2319510X13483512">2</xref>) is the gross value added approach, whereas equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-2319510X13483512">3</xref>) is the net value added approach. The left-hand side of the equations calculates the gross (or net) value added and the right-hand side of the equations represents the distribution of the value created by firms, including employees, debt-holders, stockholders and governments. VA is defined as the net value created by firms during the year and because DD plus R is equal to net income under the clean surplus assumption, equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-2319510X13483512">4</xref>) can be expressed as follows:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula11-2319510X13483512">
<label>4</label>
VA = S – B – DP = W + I + T + NI
</disp-formula></p>
<p>where: NI is after-tax income.</p>
<p>According to Pulic (2000a, b) and Firer and Williams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2319510X13483512">2003</xref>), the three major components of firm resources viz., CE (capital employed), HU (human capital) and SC (structural capital) are, by definition, as follows:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula12-2319510X13483512">
CE = physical capital + financial assets
HC = wages and salaries
SC = VA – HU:
</disp-formula></p>
<p>We calculate VAIC and its three components. By definition, the three components of VAIC are calculated as follows:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula13-2319510X13483512">
CEE = VA/CE
HCE = VA/HU
SCE = SC/VA
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Where: CEE is indicator of VA efficiency of capital employed; HCE is indicator of VA efficiency of human capital; SCE: indicator of VA efficiency of structural capital.</p>
<p>CEE and HCE can be viewed as the value-added input of physical assets and human capital, respectively. SCE represents the proportion of total VA accounted for by structural capital. Finally, VAIC is the sum of the three components of VA efficiency indicators.</p>

<p>To understand the numeric data, the basic descriptive statistics has been applied. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2319510X13483512">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2319510X13483512">2</xref> show minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation and correlation of all dependent and independent variables. The mean M/B is about 2.835 indicating that investors generally valued the sample companies in excess of the book value of net assets as reported in financial statements. The study reveals that approximately 80 per cent of the firms’ market value is not reflected on financial statements and there exist an increasing gap between market and book value of companies. This study is corroborated with that of Lev (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2319510X13483512">2001</xref>) where he conducted a longitudinal study in the US market (1977 to 2001) and concluded that about 80 per cent of corporate market value is omitted from the financial statements.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article uses VAIC model to measure the IC of the Information Technology Sector companies in three dimensions that is Capital Employed Efficiency (CEE) Human Capital Efficiency (HCE) and Structural Capital Efficiency (SCE). In addition ROA, ATO and M/B ratio are used as a financial performance and market valuation indicator and the data set is related to the Information Technology sector companies covering a period of nine years from 2003 to 2011. Overall empirical findings indicates that intellectual capital has a positive association with the profitability measured by ROA of Information Technology companies but not with productivity measured by ATO and market valuation measured by M/B ratio. Subsequently, when the VAIC is segregated into its three major components, we found that profitability measured by ROA is positively associated with capital employed efficiency and human capital efficiency, but negatively with structural capital efficiency whereas it also found that CEE has significant positive association with ATO and M/B ratio but not with other components of VAIC.</p>
<p>However, the empirical researches which have used VAIC approach to evaluate the impact of IC on various business variables have found contradictory outcomes. For example Gan and Saleh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2319510X13483512">2008</xref>) concluded that VAIC can explain profitability and productivity but fails to clarify market valuation in Malaysia whereas Kamath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2319510X13483512">2008</xref>) found no positive significant relationship of profitability, productivity and market valuation with any of the independent variables in pharmaceutical industry in India. The results of this study are in line with the results of the some previous studies as discussed above and there is also need to investigate the matter further in which the sample size, time period can be extended and different types of knowledge intensive industries can be studied that may give better results in future.</p>
