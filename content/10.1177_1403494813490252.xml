<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The 30-plus years of the One Child Policy has brought about a new “childless” elderly phenomenon in China and this group is expanding rapidly. In 2011 the number of families who lost their only child across China rose to over one million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813490252">1</xref>]. It is expected that this figure will reach 10 million by 2035 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813490252">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Traditionally, in China, children provide not only a continuation of the bloodline but also spiritual sustenance for parents. The old mottos of “bringing up sons to support parents in old age” and “carrying on the family line” have been preserved by Chinese parents from generation to generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813490252">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813490252">4</xref>]. Elderly parents who lose their only child are forced to endure psychological suffering and cope with health problems alone, as they are often ignored by society. Although numerous aging and demographic specialists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813490252">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813490252"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813490252"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813490252"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813490252">8</xref>] have stressed the importance of studying the aging issues, very few studies focus on this new vulnerable group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1403494813490252" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The study was conducted in three districts in Beijing. In total, 34 in-depth interviews were conducted with childless older people. The snowball approach to sampling and the access by means of neighbourhood committees were utilised. Ethical approval was received before commencement of the study. Data analysis was informed by a grounded-theory approach, which emphasises discovery and the conceptual understanding emerging from an examination of material guided by and constructed from participants’ accounts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813490252">9</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1403494813490252" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>There are two main reasons for the emergence of these childless elderly. The first is the One-Child family planning policy, which is practiced in urban China and aims at curbing the country’s growing population. And the second reason is social risks and accidents, such as illnesses or traffic accidents, or suicide.</p>
<p>As suggested by Jaffe, Segal and Dumke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813490252">10</xref>], psychological trauma can result from such occurrences as an accident, the breakup of a significant relationship, a deeply disappointing experience, or other similar situations. When the only child dies at a time when parents are unable to reproduce, this causes an unbearable psychological trauma for elderly parents, who display prominent clusters of symptoms. The first symptoms include long-term grief, depression, anxiety and nervousness which greatly increase the risk to their health. As found by this study, following the death of their only child, some elderly parents either suffer from or die of serious illnesses (potentially as a result of deep grief), some try to commit suicide. Other symptoms found among the participants are displayed alongside this grief, such as amnesia and serious sleep disturbance, which severely deprive those traumatised a good quality of life.</p>
<p>The childless elderly may also try to avoid social life and normal communication with others because they do not want to be reminded of their painful memories in public. They live in shadows and their social circles become very limited. This, in turn, causes further deterioration of their symptoms as they have no outlet for grieving and they lose their interest in life.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>(Participant): I never talked about children with other people after losing my only daughter, as that would remind me of the sad memories. My wife had hypertension, but after our daughter died, she suffered severe depression and has been taking anti-depressants for more than four years. We no longer take part in family reunions with our extended families, the sight of other parents together with their adult children is too much. We can no longer bear to eat dumplings and other foods we once liked.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many of them gradually fall into autistic patterns. Their poor psychological conditions are also linked to their concerns and worries about a lonely old age with a limited pension and proper health care. The childless older people have difficulties when getting ill and entering a rest home. When having operations, there is no one to sign the agreement letter. In emergencies, there is no one to take care of them. When checking into rest homes, it is hard to find a guarantee. They even worry that when they die and are cremated, no one will claim the casket. Few housewives suffer not only loneliness but also economic difficulties when their husbands abandon them after their only child dies. From the findings of this study, five couples had broken up after their child died, because men can have a baby with young women even if they are old.</p>
<p>Moreover, the childless elderly frequently encounter discrimination in their lives, which seriously stings their broken hearts and worsens their psychological and mental conditions. Such discrimination stems from the superstition and ignorance that prevailed in the past and remains to this day within China. For example, a group of childless elderly was refused entrance to a restaurant’s New Year dinner as the owner thought that they could bring bad luck to the business of that restaurant throughout the coming year.</p>
<p>Recently, more and more of these childless elderly have turned to the internet to share their woes. In this study, most participants set up the childless elderly group on the QQ (the biggest online messaging service in China) as a method of seeking emotional comfort from others in similar situations. However, they feel neglected by the government and society.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1403494813490252" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The family planning policy in China should not merely focus on population control, but should also include substantial content for providing support and services to elderly parents who abide by the One-Child policy but lose their only child. Support from the government is essential in relieving the difficulties currently faced by the childless elderly and the difficulties they face in the future.</p>
<p>This includes two major aspects. The first is health and life care, including provision of policies to support family care services, promoting the construction of nursing homes at different levels, equipping nursing homes and communities with necessary rehabilitation facilities, improving nursing homes’ admission, and supervision systems to ensure quality services and the creation of a variety of community healthcare services. The shortage of governmental financing is the main obstacle when developing community medical services for childless older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813490252">4</xref>]. So market competition can be introduced, with sector monopoly and ownership limitation reformed. Existing medical institutions need to improve their usefulness in serving childless older people, and the number of staff and the level of technology at community medical institutions need to be increased.</p>
<p>The second aspect is that of spiritual comfort. The government should increase cooperation with and fund support to the NGOs in setting up community service centres, which can provide door-to-door services for the childless elderly, providing them with psychological care and emotional comfort. Another approach that can be considered by the government is the encouragement of volunteers and training of social workers to offer free psychological consultation and mental interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813490252">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813490252">12</xref>]. Although the Chinese government has begun to schedule plans for providing support to the elderly who have lost their only child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813490252">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813490252">14</xref>], detailed regulations and practical enforcement at the grass-roots level, such as the implementation of full coverage of medical insurance – including psychological treatment are urgently required.</p>
<p>Moreover, a general perception is expected to establish that the legitimate rights and needs of childless older people should be respected and protected, and specific legislation is needed to be established.</p>
