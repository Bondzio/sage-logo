<abstract>
<p>Men’s interest in the contraceptive and reproductive spheres is often considered to be minimal, with management of these domains traditionally constructed as “feminine.” Despite this, some men, who have no interest in having children, choose to take a higher degree of control over their reproductive bodies, voluntarily seeking a “preemptive” vasectomy. This article reports on interview data with twelve men who had preemptive vasectomies, describing the shared meaning making (and subject positions) many of these men took up in relation to the operation. The subject positions can be identified by (1) descriptions of themselves and/or their lifestyles as “selfish,” and (2) descriptions of themselves and/or their lifestyles as “unconventional.” While these self-descriptors might be construed negatively, an indication of marginalization, the authors would argue that the men were able to put a positive spin on these features using neoliberal discourses of choice and personal responsibility. Access to such discourses might be seen as an indication of the men’s privileged rather than marginalized status, allowing them to make such a decision “easier” than it might be for many women. The authors would also suggest that having a preemptive vasectomy might be seen as a rejection of contemporary modes of involved fatherhood.</p>

<p>Men are largely absent in research on reproduction, making only brief appearances in reference to their impact on women’s lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1097184X11430126">Gutmann 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1097184X11430126">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1097184X11430126">Inhorn et al. 2009</xref>). While there are some (very recent) indications of change in this regard (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1097184X11430126">Gutmann 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1097184X11430126">Inhorn et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1097184X11430126">Terry and Braun 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1097184X11430126">2011b</xref>), historically there has been a strong assumption, both in research and in family planning education programmes, that heterosexual men do not readily involve themselves in the reproductive/contraceptive process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1097184X11430126">Inhorn et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This culturally inscribed orthodoxy portrays men as <italic>sexually</italic> driven and uninterested in issues of fertility/reproduction. It has been argued that responsibility for reproduction is not primary to the formulation of masculine identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1097184X11430126">Connell 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1097184X11430126">Mundigo 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1097184X11430126">Thomson 2008</xref>) and where it has been a consideration, it is usually so in reference to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1097184X11430126">Giddens (1992)</xref> has referred to as “plastic” sexuality: the “silencing” of the reproductive or risky aspects of sexual activity in order to highlight the pleasure and relationship-orientated elements. Even when individual men might show some interest in involvement in the reproductive share, many of the social structures that shape, constrain, and enable greater reproductive health are focused almost exclusively on women and women’s bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1097184X11430126">Gutmann 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1097184X11430126">Thomson 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>However, New Zealand’s rates of male involvement in contraception through vasectomy are extremely high. Approximately 18 percent of adult men, and over 25 percent of married men, opt to have the operation, a rate suggested to be the highest rate in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1097184X11430126">Clifton, Kaneda, and Ashford 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1097184X11430126">Sneyd et al. 2001</xref>). Rates are extremely high in the forty to forty-nine age bracket, with over 57 percent of men taking up vasectomy at this point in their lives. In comparison, prevalence in the United States ranges between 11 percent and 13 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1097184X11430126">Holden et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1097184X11430126">Sandlow et al. 2001</xref>), with similar rates found in Great Britain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1097184X11430126">Pile and Barone 2009</xref>). While Australia appears to be nearing New Zealand’s rate of overall uptake, relatively recent reporting suggests that the forty to forty-nine cohort still has some ground to gain with 31 percent of men of this age having vasectomies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1097184X11430126">Holden et al. 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>When the choice not to have children intersects with sterilization, it becomes a marked indicator of the seriousness of a person’s choice not to have children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1097184X11430126">Baum 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1097184X11430126">Cameron 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1097184X11430126">Magarick and Brown 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1097184X11430126">Somers 1993</xref>). As many as 1 percent of men in Australasia have purportedly had vasectomies “preemptively” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1097184X11430126">Holden et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1097184X11430126">Sneyd et al. 2001</xref>). Men without children who chose to have vasectomies are seemingly less likely to undergo a vasectomy reversal than male parents who have the operation, showing strong commitment to their decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1097184X11430126">Potts et al. 1999</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1097184X11430126">
<title>Vasectomy, Masculinity, Fatherhood, and Health</title>
<p>Men in “typical” circumstances (i.e., in a long-term relationship with children) have been shown to rely on fairly conventional expressions of masculinity to explain or account for their vasectomies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1097184X11430126">Amor et al. (2008)</xref>, for instance, found men in their sample treated their vasectomies as a “trial” that affirmed their masculine identities within their peer groups and to their families. These men also demonstrated investment in the subject position of being “family men.” Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1097184X11430126">Terry and Braun (2011b)</xref> have highlighted the way the men they interviewed relied on almost “heroic” language to describe the act of “taking responsibility” for contraception through their vasectomy. However, the authors of these articles suggest that their research demonstrates important hints of men “shifting” toward reliance on egalitarian discourse when discussing the reproductive/contraceptive decision making within their relationships (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1097184X11430126">Terry and Braun 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>Research on fatherhood has demonstrated similar “shifting” within the expectations of men and the masculinities with which they identify. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1097184X11430126">Henwood and Proctor (2003)</xref> comment:<disp-quote>
<p>Considerable enthusiasm is being expressed about the benefits to individuals and families of rejecting the idea of the father as a detached, distant, largely disinterested figure and turning towards a new, attentive, caring or nurturing father who begins by being present at antenatal classes and at the birth … continues by actively participating in the raising of his children, and generally shares with his domestic partner commitment to and responsibility for maintaining family life and the home. (p. 337)</p>
</disp-quote>While this “shift” in fatherhood masculinities has come under critical scrutiny (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1097184X11430126">Everingham and Bowers 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1097184X11430126">Johansson and Klinth 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1097184X11430126">McGowan 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1097184X11430126">Nentwich 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1097184X11430126">Ranson 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1097184X11430126">Wall and Arnold 2007</xref>), the <italic>rhetoric</italic> of equality and share appears to be becoming dominant (at least ideologically) for men in heterosexual partnerships.</p>
<p>Another issue for consideration in terms of shifting masculinities is the increasing literature that suggests men investment in health decisions is not always as negative or as ambivalent as had been previously theorized (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1097184X11430126">Gough and Robertson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1097184X11430126">Noone and Stephens 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1097184X11430126">Robertson 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1097184X11430126">Sloan, Gough, and Conner 2010</xref>). Instead, there is the suggestion that as long as there is a sense of control and autonomy within their health decision making, men will often demonstrate interest and investment in avoiding ill-health (however that might be defined; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1097184X11430126">Robertson 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>How the accounts of men invested in fatherhood and family might be similar to and/or differ from those of men who have preemptive vasectomies is an area in need of further research. Analysis of the accounts of men who have preemptive vasectomies, and examining their choices and decisions in more detail, can help more fully understand the intersection of male investment in reproductive health and contemporary forms of masculinity.</p>

<title>Child freedom and Vasectomy</title>
<p>There has been ongoing trend of “subreplacement” fertility<sup>

</sup> in many Western countries for decades, a pattern reproduced more recently in developing contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1097184X11430126">Coleman and Rowthorn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1097184X11430126">Goldstein, Lutz, and Testa 2003</xref>).

<p>Despite this, those who are voluntarily childless or “childfree”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1097184X11430126">

</xref>
</sup>—especially when there are no biological or genetic concerns about a potential child—are still considered a somewhat unusual phenomenon in the West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1097184X11430126">Campbell 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1097184X11430126">Lunneborg 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1097184X11430126">Mawson 2006</xref>). Indeed “parenthood” is often constructed as a key feature of the normative (and inevitable) heterosexual life course; a consequence of evolutionary pressures to reproduce that needs (and justifies) medical intervention if a couple is unable to reproduce “naturally” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1097184X11430126">Baker 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1097184X11430126">Baker (2005)</xref> has commented that “procreation is considered intrinsic to heterosexual marriage, gender identity and a ‘normal’ life […] most parents see pregnancy and childbirth as a natural outcome of adulthood and marriage rather than a conscious choice” (p. 524). Such <italic>pronatalist</italic> discourse is not restricted to more conservative notions of “marriage.” Most heterosexual (and many gay/lesbian) men and women both expect and are expected to be parents at some stage in their lives.</p>
<p>Perhaps as a consequence of the “pressure” to have children, much existing research has tended to focus upon the marginalized status and sense of stigma that the childfree often experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1097184X11430126">Callan and Que Hee, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1097184X11430126">Campbell 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1097184X11430126">Gillespie 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1097184X11430126">Halford 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1097184X11430126">Lunneborg 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1097184X11430126">Mawson 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1097184X11430126">Park 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1097184X11430126">Rowlands and Lee 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1097184X11430126">Somers 1993</xref>). Much of this research has focused upon the experiences and accounts of women and couples, with many of these not having been sterilized. What research exists on men having preemptive vasectomies has tended toward assessments of their social or personal “pathology” (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1097184X11430126">Magarick and Brown 1981</xref>), looking for indicators of marginalization or “difference.” Despite expectations, the men in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1097184X11430126">Magarick and Brown’s (1981)</xref> study were found to be “typical” in many ways, and showing greater levels of egalitarianism, independence of thought, and resistance to tradition when compared to vasectomized <italic>fathers</italic>. While further research has been needed to develop a clearer picture, the reasons, choices made, and experiences of men who have preemptive vasectomies has remained underresearched and many questions remain.</p>

<sec id="section3-1097184X11430126" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This article reports on data produced from interviews with twelve men who had vasectomies “preemptively.” Men were interviewed as part of a wider study on vasectomy (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1097184X11430126">Terry and Braun 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1097184X11430126">2011b</xref>) which conformed to New Zealand’s ethical requirements and was approved by The University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics Committee. Participants ranged in age from twenty-nine to sixty-two (mean age 45). The men were almost all in “professional” forms of employment, identified as heterosexual (except one who had recently entered his first same sex relationship), and identified as Pākehā or of other European ethnicity (one identified as New Zealand Chinese, one as European/Japanese).</p>
<p>A variety of recruitment methods were used in the larger study; almost all of these participants responded after a press release led to news pieces in several key national newspapers (print and online), several interviews on national radio stations, and a television prime-time news report. Of the over 300 responses that were received in the first three days after the news items, twelve men responded who had had preemptive vasectomy. All were selected for interview, and all participated. Interviews were conducted at the University of Auckland, the participant’s home or via phone for men who lived outside two main centers (approximately one-third were via telephone).</p>
<p>The relative homogeneity and self-selection aspects of the sample have some impact on the findings presented. Naturally, a sample of men willing and engaged in talking about vasectomy is not random or representative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1097184X11430126">Boynton 2003</xref>), and we have no idea how typical the accounts they provided are of men having preemptive vasectomies in general. The data produced were extremely rich and experiential due to the participants' apparent enthusiasm for the topic.</p>
<p>Interviews were semistructured and lasted between forty-five minutes and an hour and a half. No differences were noted between the information provided during telephone or face-to-face interviews. The interviews covered a range of topics, from reasons for having a vasectomy to descriptions of experiences of sex and relationships before and after the operation. They asked for specific, detailed descriptions about the experiences of having had a vasectomy, including the man’s motivations for choosing this option, difficulties they may have experienced and benefits they felt they may have gained. Reasons for not having children were also discussed. All of the men’s narratives were extremely rich; men provided a great deal of detail about their process of deciding to have a vasectomy and, where relevant, that of their partners and friends/family.</p>
<p>All men were interviewed by Gareth Terry. Both authors have chosen not to have children, with one making this decision permanent through sterilization and the other still in the process of finalizing the decision. While these features of the authors' lives share some common ground with the men interviewed in this part of the project, we did not want to assume similarity during the interview process. To manage this, an active effort was made to continuously probe self-evident responses (e.g., you know), and producing an interview culture where participants were treated as expert informants (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1097184X11430126">Schwalbe and Wolkomir 2003</xref>). Coding and analysis were performed following each interview in order to evaluate and improve this process.</p>
<p>Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim to include hesitations, speech repetitions, and overlapping talk, but not the finer-grained features of speech and interactional style. Data selected for this analysis were occasionally restructured slightly (i.e., through deletion of text) in order to create ease of reading without altering the meaning or suggestions of extracts. The annotation […] indicates that part of the transcript not relevant to the analysis has been removed. In order to protect the privacy of the interview participants, names and other significant identifying features were replaced in the transcript.</p>
<p>The discourse analysis presented within this article is informed by feminist poststructuralizm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1097184X11430126">Gavey 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1097184X11430126">2005</xref>). Data were initially coded and analyzed thematically using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1097184X11430126">Braun and Clarke’s (2006)</xref> six-stage approach to thematic analysis. Subsequent discourse analysis focused upon the shared systems of meaning making and cultural resources used by the men to make sense of their choices. Within the analysis, we were particularly interested in the power of <italic>discourse</italic> to make certain “ways-of-being” or <italic>subject positions</italic> available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1097184X11430126">Davies and Harré 2001</xref>) Subject positions are those configurations of particular discourses that constitute a person’s “self-hood” or experience of the world; they are the way in which the social becomes “individual.” Subject positions refer to a limited number of “self-expressions” that people have available to them at a particular time and place, and they may be “taken up” or “resisted” depending on a number of factors (including exposure to alternative discourses and subject positions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1097184X11430126">Davies and Harré 2001</xref>). As discourse legitimates existing power relations and structures by defining what is “normal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1097184X11430126">Gavey 2005</xref>), the most viable subject positions are usually the most “conformist” to contemporary culturally dominant meanings; “alternative” or “oppositional” subject positions are not usually perceived as desirable or even possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1097184X11430126">Davies and Harré 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The analysis reported here focuses on two subject positions the men relied on to explain their preemptive vasectomies, being selfish and being “unconventional.”</p>
<sec id="section4-1097184X11430126">
<title>Men Talking about Preemptive Vasectomy: Selfishness and Unconventionality</title>
<p>Among men who had preemptive vasectomies, two broad and often repeated patterns of self-description were noted. These positionings often coexisted and sometimes occurred in concert, however, they drew from a different set of masculine discourses that demonstrated their distinctiveness. The positions identified were:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>A willingness to identify themselves as being either selfish or somehow lacking the “character” to have children—a “deficit identity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1097184X11430126">Reynolds and Taylor 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1097184X11430126">Reynolds, Wetherell, and Taylor 2007</xref>). This was expressed in a variety of ways, with some presenting traits such as selfishness in a positive light, others treating it as a flaw.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Identification with a lifestyle that is unconventional or quite different from what is considered a normative life-trajectory by “society.”</p>
</list-item>

Broadly, our discussion will focus on the intersection and relationships between pronatalism, neoliberalism, and masculinities, and the possibilities for subjectivity that ensue. Some attention will be drawn to the relationship between having a preemptive vasectomy and the (becoming) dominant masculine subject position of the “new father.” The discourses and subject positions described are cultural resources that inform masculine sense making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1097184X11430126">Wetherell and Edley 1999</xref>) and produce certain forms of masculine identity. As such, they will be drawn upon by some men and not by others and in different ways. They do not represent all that might be said of the masculinities invested in and experienced by men who have preemptive vasectomies.</p>

<title>Selfishness and Sterilization</title>
<p>One of the most common self-descriptors the men used was of being selfish or “self-centered.” They typically placed emphasis on “flaws” in their own character as the basis for them not wanting to become fathers. In what limited research exists on the childfree, this has been portrayed as a common criticism made by those who have, or want children (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1097184X11430126">Gillespie 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1097184X11430126">Halford 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1097184X11430126">Lunneborg 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1097184X11430126">Rowlands and Lee 2006</xref>). In this case, however, it was the men themselves making this sort of attribution about themselves. Stan, who had a vasectomy in his thirties while single, exemplified this pattern. He responded to a question which asked:</p>

</def-list> Deficit identities are positions of selfhood within a person’s narrative that can be recognised by what they are <italic>not</italic> rather what they <italic>are</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1097184X11430126">Reynolds and Taylor 2005</xref>). The taking up of deficit identities like this one is relatively common in situations where identities are formed in resistance to dominant discourses. In this particular case, pronatalism appears to be the dominant discourse, with the men situating themselves within its logic, and as almost apologetic for their flaws in relation to it. Rather than problematizing social pressures <italic>to</italic> have children (this only happened occasionally), men like Stan often seemed to simply reiterate the descriptors <italic>stereotypically</italic> used to describe the childfree, although they appeared to use them in an almost preemptive fashion.</p>
<p>Stan’s account drew the focus onto this “weaknesses” in his character and portrayed the difficulties and stress of having children as beyond his personal resources. This was not a recent shift, he commented earlier in his interview that he “always” felt this way. The framing of his relationship to children in this way is particularly interesting when analyzed in relation to the “new father” subject position this position has developed over the last two to three decades (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1097184X11430126">Ranson 2001</xref>) and challenges the formerly dominant “breadwinner” position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1097184X11430126">Ranson 2001</xref>). This traditional model of fatherhood<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1097184X11430126">
3
</xref>
</sup> was of an emotionally distant provider, whose career advancement through hard work, long hours and loyalty was considered integral to the well-being of his children. While this sort of subject position still underlies many men’s experiences of being a father (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1097184X11430126">Johansson and Klinth 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1097184X11430126">Ranson 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1097184X11430126">Wall and Arnold 2007</xref>), the new father position has the potential to significantly shift the way men experience and enact being fathers—engaged fathers—to more align with the social expectations constructing women as carers and nurturers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1097184X11430126">Gillespie 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The new father position has a high degree of imaginative power in shaping the qualities of “fatherhood” that are expected of men contemporarily. What seemed to be at stake in Stan’s case is not so much reproduction or biological fatherhood, but the way he would be expected to father any child he had. The role of engaged parent was what Stan seemed to be resisting, as it would draw him away from activities he enjoyed. Many of the accounts of men who had preemptive vasectomies worked like this, highlighting the huge impact a child would have upon their lives and their interest in avoiding that impact.</p>
<p>The taking up of a selfish position has some potential to denaturalize parenthood by offering an “alternative” to the normal adult trajectory. However, as a viable discursive position, it is a highly gendered one—men’s choices to be childfree do not seem to evoke the same sorts of “challenge” to pronatalism, as women’s do. In Stan’s account, it seemed relatively easy for him to identify with a lack of ability or with having the wrong temperament. However, research has suggested that for many childfree women this is harder to do when explicating their choices (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1097184X11430126">Gillespie 2003</xref>). Nurture and care for others are often constructed as feminine attributes, as is an investment in eventual motherhood, which is “still considered to be a primary role for women and women who do not mother either biologically or socially are often stereotyped as desperate or selfish” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1097184X11430126">Letherby 2002</xref>, 7). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1097184X11430126">Letherby (2002)</xref> goes on to argue that men are not subject to the same discursive pressure that women are, with fatherhood unlikely to be as key to a man’s identity as motherhood is to a woman’s (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1097184X11430126">Parry 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1097184X11430126">Ulrich and Weatherall 2000</xref>). Stan could work within a framework of “I’m just not good at that kind of thing” because this sort of discursive resource is much more available to men (fathers or not) than women, when it comes to the issue of childrearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1097184X11430126">Sunderland 2002</xref>). This discourse showed some similarity with the gendered nature of the “singleness” subject positions of the “swinging bachelor” and the “sad spinster” of previous generations, and also to similar arguments used by men to justify imbalances in domestic share (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1097184X11430126">Sunderland 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Difficulty, Change, and Loss</title>

</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>In this account, Geoff contrasted marriage, a change that does not involve “loss of self” with having children, which, by contrast, implicitly does.</p>
<p>Almost all the men referred to themselves as selfish at some point to “explain away” why they were not interested in (or perceived themselves as not capable of) dealing with the “difficulties” of parenting. Their accounts often stressed the “mundane” nature of raising children (all noise and dirty nappies), and defined their own lifestyles and sense of self as superior to that of parents. Men spoke of their “breeder friends” (Don) having “baby brain” (Karl), being “different” (Neill) after the birth of a child, or having their lives “dramatically changed” (Stan), and wanted to avoid this. Karl, who described his leisure time as defined by computer gaming (time he jealously guarded) commented:<def-list>

Choosing “gaming,” freedom from “hassle,” and a “full and busy life” over children was portrayed as selfish, but a selfishness that was thoughtful and to be reveled in. Some men characterized an “unthinking” selfishness of those <italic>with</italic> children which contrasted with their own thoughtful selfishness.</p>

<title>Reversing the Discourse</title>
<p>Rather than being able to simply state the positive values of not having children, or even a degree of indifference to expectations of “society,” some men appeared to need to “attack” those who <italic>do</italic> have children. In doing so, they deployed the same discursive resources as statements typically used to “vilify” the childfree. For instance, some men reversed common discourse about the childfree (e.g., selfish; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1097184X11430126">Campbell 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1097184X11430126">Gillespie 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1097184X11430126">Lunneborg 1999</xref>) and used these to describe those <italic>with</italic> children or the choice to have children: <def-list>
<def-item>
<term>Jeremy:</term>

<term>Neill:</term>

<p>they’d always go, but what if you change your mind and you want to have children?

</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>Both these reversals of the dominant discursive constructions around parenting and children (that people with children are <italic>more</italic> selfish than those without, and that people may regret <italic>having</italic> children) speak of the frustration of those who are childfree under pronatalism and challenge the dominant nature of pronatalism. But they do more than this; through the articulation of a “counternormative” view, they highlight the self-positioning of these men as <italic>different</italic> from the norm. Resistance to normative pressure to have children is thus associated with difference from the mainstream in this case, those people who have children, want children or have never questioned that they will have children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1097184X11430126">
<title>Unconventionality as “Positive”</title>
<p>Another way many men framed their choice to have a preemptive vasectomy was by situating themselves as generally different from the “masses.” Reference to themselves as “unconventional,” “different,” or “outside the norm” was common throughout the interviews. This explanation, relying on a discourse of unconventionality and individualism, offers a different subject position—of the “unusual bloke.” For instance, when asked to describe the type of person that has a preemptive vasectomy, Jeremy commented on the ways in which he differed from the “average kiwi bloke.”</p>
<p>
<def-list>
<def-item>
<term>Jeremy:</term>
<def>
<p>you know I’m just in lots of ways I’m not really into um sport and stuff like that […] I’m not really a sort of New Zealand blokey sort of guy, I’m more into sort of um, I don’t know mental pursuits and um you know more into thinking about life and that rather than just getting pissed and watching the rugby and shagging you know it seems to me there’s more to life than that, so I definitely don’t fit into the into the male stereotype (laughs) […] yeah I think I’m probably pretty unconventional maybe a bit strange you know but that’s cool. (38, “Euro”, single)</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>The kiwi bloke is a common-sense identity that New Zealand men can align with, articulate as a point of departure, or both align with and depart from (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1097184X11430126">Terry and Braun 2009</xref>). It is New Zealand’s expression of “traditional” or “retributive” masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1097184X11430126">Rutherford 1988</xref>), an investment in times when “men were really men.” In this extract, it provides Jeremy with a point of comparison for his account of his (masculine) identity and situates his choice to have a vasectomy within a discourse of unconventionality.</p>
<p>When explaining why he was a more proactive “promoter” of vasectomies to men who have <italic>had</italic> children than to those without, Neill argued this was because only a very small number of people could make the same decision he had: “I think you have to have a unique (.) way of … understanding of yourself to go that way.” He late suggested that many men who have children have vasectomies because they are pressured to (“nagged at for three or four years”), a marked difference from his own self-motivated and directed choice.</p>
<p>Many of the men also made reference to the “conventional” people around them, which marked out their own <italic>difference</italic>. Some men, like Geoff, simply noted that no one else in his office was like him: “most are married, most have children, the ones that aren’t married are either young [or] single and have decided not to settle down yet.” Andrew referred to a “conventionality” around him that was in stark contrast to his own “lifestyle choices” and described what was particularly unconventional about his choices: <def-list>
<def-item>
<term>Andrew:</term>
<def>
<p>well maybe because I like to <italic>think</italic>, I suppose (laughs) I retired at forty five, um, I chose to live remotely out of the way to, um, living a semi self-sufficient life. Although we’re not fanatical about it, um, there’s a little bit of survivalism there I would think […] but we’re not Greens um, I think the Green ethos is one or two children full stop [Int: mmn] but I wonder about that replace yourself and leave it at that, but there are more and more people replacing. (55, Caucasian, married)</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>
 Andrew contrasted his own lifestyle choices with those of the “conventional, married with children” group, and, like Jeremy, situated these as conscious decision, through “thinking about life” and his choices. Andrew and his partner lived outside the mainstream in many ways, a point that was highlighted when he lost power during his (telephone) interview, an occurrence he described as “not unusual.” He argued that his lifestyle was only possible because of the choice not to have children, as he and his wife were able to retire young. Other men commented along similar lines: <def-list>
<def-item>
<term>Jeremy:</term>
<def>
<p>the other thing is I’ve done a lot of investing and that sort of thing, so for a couple of years I haven’t actually worked, I’ve just been kind of retired so people find that really odd as well so I’m totally out of the mainstream really recently I’ve got back into work again but um yeah no I’m not your average sort of person I think. (38, “Euro”, single)</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list> While only a few of the men were able to retire early, like Andrew and Jeremy, or had the capacity to do so, many of them described their lifestyles as vastly different in comparison with “the rest” of society who could not make the same sorts of choices as them. In Jeremy’s case, he was able to invest with funds he suggested would have been tied up in the child-rearing process or require more conservative investing options had he chosen to be a father. Through periods of hard work, long hours and a lifestyle that was not “child-rearing friendly,” he was able to have longer periods where he could focus on his <italic>personal</italic> project of self-improvement. Jeremy emphasized the financial difficulties that can occur with reduced incomes (though parenting), and perceived that many people just “fall into” the process of having children (implicitly suggesting they have not made a logical [financial] choice). Deploying neoliberal rhetoric, he commented:<def-list>
<def-item>
<term>Jeremy:</term>
<def>
<p>you know people have the power to create their own lives and do what they want with it and [Int: mmn] and you know if you find yourself in a crappy situation then you- you’re able to get yourself out of it, you know. People aren’t just victims.</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list> In contrast to Andrew, Jeremy and others, Tony framed his choice to not have children as arising <italic>from</italic> his lifestyle rather than vice versa. He described a situation where there was little room for children in the way of life he had chosen (and the like-minded, like-acting individuals he was with): <def-list>
<def-item>
<term>Tony:</term>
<def>
<p>My collection of friends was, was, was kind of more the educated, uh, people, people who were artistic, people who were, ah, unconventional and, um, a lot of those people actually, um, didn’t, didn’t have kids […] they’ve always been really well educated (.) people, or, you know, super adventurous types. I basically (.) moved onto a sailboat when I was in my late thirties and cruised around the world for seventeen years on a boat and, um, you know, most of the people that I met on boats, they didn’t have kids or if they did, they, the kids were grown up.</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>Tony, like Andrew, emphasized actually living on the <italic>physical</italic> fringes of “mainstream” society, initially in a rural community, later among people who chose to live on sailboats. In contrast to Andrew’s description of a much more personal (and isolated) unconventionality, Tony talked about being on the fringe within the context of communities of like-minded people. The types of people who lived within this type of community, people Tony depicted as his friends, were not only unconventional but also “really well educated, or … super adventurous types.” He implied that these people (and clearly himself) chose this life of unconventionality because of their education and adventurousness. Several times throughout the interview, Tony emphasized that children would undermine the enjoyment of this lifestyle and were, in fact, contraindicative of a certain level of education. This group was framed as being among the “cream” of society, but marginal because of their lack of interest in “settling down” and having children in a similar fashion to a majority of heterosexual couples.</p>
<p>Indeed, across the interviews, unconventionality was almost always framed positively. Men’s descriptions evoked a capacity to extend themselves <italic>beyond</italic> the normal or average person, and made much of being childfree as a desired and chosen state, which allowed for freedom, the expression of unconventionality, and growth within that. In contrast, in the interviews, the “average” person was described as simply following the norms and factors that result in the normative “way things are.” Men positioned themselves as having resisted such (implicit) pressures. In Andrew’s case, this was expressed as resisting biological imperatives:<def-list>
<def-item>
<term>Andrew:</term>
<def>
<p>(laughs) I can, how can I best put this, yeah, it was (outbreath) in a sense, me, sticking my finger up at evolution, no, not evolution, ah (outbreath) at life […] as I’ve grown older, I’ve become much more aware […] of the sex drive as a (outbreath) as a manipulation. It’s, you know, if you like, in quotes, life doing its thing but it’s, using evolution, using organisms as a tool, that kind of thing, I’ve always vaguely resented that and I was aware it, when I had the vasectomy I was, you know (.) it’s p-putting the fingers up at the gears of evolution (laughs) […] me saying you know “take that!” [laughs] evolution, you’re not manipulating me anymore (laughs)(.) It’s my revenge. (55, Caucasian, married)</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list>Andrew portrayed evolution as a machine that uses humankind as a vehicle for the continuation of life.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1097184X11430126">4</xref>
</sup> He used machine imagery to describe the way life forces itself upon humankind while simultaneously anthropomorphizing it as something that can be resisted, challenged and even mocked (take that!). Andrew’s account suggested that he and his wife, through the act of having a vasectomy, were finally able to step outside what has largely become understood as the “natural order” (or at least get enough distance to give evolution the finger). This offers a quite extreme example of the general pattern of men situating themselves as unconventional—Andrew was different from the majority of humanity by being able to <italic>resist</italic> a global, powerful, and natural force (the machine of evolution). In not being seduced by evolution’s “manipulation” (e.g., through his sexual drive), Andrew had to control and manage his “unruly” body, which had the potential to be “used” by evolution (his sex drive might unwittingly result in children) through the vasectomy. It is an extremely masculinist account, the triumph of rationality, and mind, traditionally associated with men, over matter and nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1097184X11430126">Connell 2005</xref>)</p>
<p>All of the men’s accounts of difference and unconventionality relied heavily on a neoliberal (individualized) discourse of choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1097184X11430126">Budgeon 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1097184X11430126">Rose 1996</xref>), heavily emphasizing the man’s own unique capacities as enabling this choice to occur. The vasectomy was constructed as both enabling, and being enabled by, choices that the majority of people were not in the same position to make, or even comprehend.</p>

<title>Masculinity, Neoliberalism, Resistance, and Complicity</title>
<p>A key idea in Foucault’s work was the suggestion that where power exists, where discourses are dominant, there is always the potential for resistance, usually found within the dominant discourses themselves. He noted that “it’s always possible to modify its hold, in determined conditions following a precise strategy” (Foucault 1980, 13). At face value, the men’s accounts seemed to be working to present them as challenging (or at least resisting) pronatalist discourse, which dominates within Western societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1097184X11430126">Baker 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1097184X11430126">Gillespie 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1097184X11430126">Parry 2005</xref>). Having a preemptive vasectomy is still a nonnormative choice in New Zealand, and the men who have had this operation indicated that their experience of marking their bodies with a relatively permanent<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1097184X11430126">5</xref>
</sup> “solution” was one which often caused consternation among others or at the very least had to be justified or explained. These men argued that resisting intense pressure of pronatalism was only possible through personal traits such as unconventionality, a degree of “selfishness” or a capacity to see past the expectations of society and/or culture (or even evolution!).</p>
<p>In explaining their “resistance,” a majority of the men interviewed appeared to use these sorts of descriptions as a precise strategy (Foucault’s 1980). The cultural resources men tapped into to justify their choice were often discourses of neoliberalism, and they articulated many of the values of hegemonic masculinity that continue to perpetuate the imbalance of power that favors men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1097184X11430126">Connell 2005</xref>). Neoliberalism, the current taken-for-granted explanation for the way the West operates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1097184X11430126">Davies et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1097184X11430126">Hodgetts, Masters, and Robertson 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1097184X11430126">Walkerdine 2003</xref>) is a philosophy that has been responsible for the formation of subjectivities within an economically rationalized climate, producing a neoliberal actor: rational, guided by choice, taking personal responsibility for both the successes and the failures of those choices (Brown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1097184X11430126">2003</xref>) (unsurprisingly this shows some significant overlap with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1097184X11430126">Wetherell and Edley’s 1999</xref> theorizing of masculine sense making—or the formation of masculinities of ordinary men). Notions of control, autonomy, personal responsibility, and transcendence were commonly drawn upon by the men, facilitating accounts that called attention to what made them <italic>different</italic> to others, rather than highlighting commonalities. In this, their accounts were ultimately individualist and individualizing.</p>
<p>References were made to monolithic constructs men resisted—such as “society,” “instinct,” and “evolution,” presenting a sense of perpetual and irresistible motion or pressure. Yet, these men constructed themselves as resisting these things as <italic>individuals</italic>, constructing themselves as freer from social constraints than other people. This sort of structuring seemed to construct these men as privileged, rather than reporting the sense of stigmatization that much of the previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1097184X11430126">Gillespie 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1097184X11430126">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1097184X11430126">Halford 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1097184X11430126">Magarick and Brown 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1097184X11430126">Mawson 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1097184X11430126">Park 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1097184X11430126">Rowlands and Lee 2006</xref>) has presented as salient for many who choose not to have children.</p>
<p>Where <italic>anti</italic>natalist discourse exists, it is usually in relation to “preventing teen pregnancy … [and] also discourages low income earners, lesbians and gay men, and physically and mentally disabled individuals from becoming parents” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1097184X11430126">Park 2002</xref>, 23). As such, the heterosexual (mostly) Pākehā men interviewed appear to benefit from both the neoliberal climate and the current gender order, which benefits men in general, but particularly men such as themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1097184X11430126">Connell 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the apparently negative self-descriptions of selfishness, this trait functioned to enable (both discursively <italic>and</italic> materially) a greater choice of lifestyle options and volitional freedom. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1097184X11430126">Walkerdine (2003)</xref> has noted, the neoliberal subject is constructed as self-supporting, self-defining and someone “who has to understand their position in essentially personal and psychological terms” (p. 241). When called upon to explain the reasons for the vasectomy, it was done almost exclusively in terms of individual agency and the limits children place on that agency. Being childfree and choosing to have a vasectomy was framed primarily about <italic>their</italic> decision making.</p>
<p>However, there was one exception. One man had had a preemptive vasectomy reversed. He spoke of his original vasectomy as being driven more by his partner’s lack of interest in children than his own absolute certainty to be childfree. When this relationship dissolved, he commented that he found himself wondering whether he did in fact want children, a concern that became more salient when he entered into a relationship with a woman who <italic>did</italic> want children: <def-list>
<def-item>
<term>Peter:</term>
<def>
<p>in terms of being able to realise something that was very important to my new wife and I’ve and um I guess became very important to me because I didn’t (.) um as much as we were in love with each other I didn’t want her to I didn’t want to be the one … compromising (.) it’s not quite what I’m trying to say [Int: mmn] but um that as much as we have discussed what would happen if the vasectomy reversal hadn’t worked um I know that it would’ve brought considerable pressures on the relationship as strong as it is.</p>
</def>
</def-item>
</def-list> Intrinsic to Peter’s story was the premise that the relational context shaped the way in which Peter made both his first decision to have a vasectomy and the later one to have it reversed. Peter referred not to his own individuality and a construction of rational choice as primary, but instead the situatedness of his self within relationships, with choice being made as a couple, not as singular entities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1097184X11430126">Terry and Braun 2009</xref> for similar accounts). In this way, his account was framed completely differently to men who emphasized the <italic>individual</italic> nature of their vasectomy “decision.” Many of the men treated the permanent status of “infertility” as the most important reason for choosing vasectomy over other options (e.g., condoms, noncoital sex, less permanent female controlled methods of contraception), irrespective of changes that might occur in present or future relationships. Peter’s account portrayed vasectomy decision making as more complex than a “simple” desire to not have children. It offered a counterpoint that draws attention to some of the consequences of highly individualized decision-making processes, such as relationship disruption.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The subject positions that men took up in relation to having a preemptive vasectomy were framed less in terms of stigma, and more as an act of <italic>rebellion</italic> against societal norms and expectations. However, there seemed to be a great deal of reliance on particular (neoliberal) forms of masculine sense making that to all intents and purposes continue to perpetuate the notion of idealized masculinity, as defined by unrestrained, autonomous choice. Despite the “rhetoric of rebellion,” very few of the men seemed willing to “push back” against other traditionally masculine ideals/subject positions, such as “breadwinning,” protection, provision (both for themselves and others), and control. This might suggest that as with other forms of “rebellion” against traditional expectations of masculinity, complicity with and resistance of hegemonic masculinity are intermingled (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1097184X11430126">Wetherell and Edley 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1097184X11430126">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1097184X11430126">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1097184X11430126">Wetherell and Edley (1999)</xref> have commented that hegemonic forms of masculine sense making that enable and maintain male privilege are often those that ostensibly appear to be challenging historical stereotypes of masculinity:<disp-quote>
<p>sometimes one of the most effective ways of being hegemonic, or being a “man,” may be to demonstrate one’s distance from hegemonic masculinity. Perhaps what is most hegemonic is to be nonhegemonic!—An independent man who knows his own mind and who can ‘see through’ social expectations. (p. 351)</p>
</disp-quote>This certainly seems to describe the men in this study, with “agency” being key to the decision-making process concerning having a preemptive vasectomy and the <italic>capacity</italic> to choose this option often presented as a consequence of their willingness to defy expectations and social convention. This “rebellion” was almost always a highly individualized and depoliticized one.</p>
<p>If these men are resisting a dominant expression of masculinity, it is the current ideal of fatherhood: the “new” father (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1097184X11430126">Everingham and Bowers 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1097184X11430126">Johansson and Klinth 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1097184X11430126">McGowan 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1097184X11430126">Nentwich 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1097184X11430126">Ranson 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1097184X11430126">Wall and Arnold 2007</xref>). Fathers as fully involved in the “parenting” process, devoting significant amounts of their time and energy to the raising of children is steadily becoming the accepted (and expected) norm, and likely forms the context for contemporary New Zealand men considering parenthood. Although many men can still retreat to the position of “breadwinner” to some extent, it no longer provides an adequate excuse for distant and uninvolved fatherhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1097184X11430126">Johansson and Klinth 2008</xref>). While concerns about the impact of children on finances <italic>were</italic> readily drawn upon, they were not as prevalent among participants as accounts of the impact on lifestyle, time, choice, and personal growth, perhaps indicating the issue for many of the men was less about provision and more about a loss of “self.” This loss of self motif only really makes sense in light of the growing influence of the new father subject position. The men presented the key elements of their current lifestyles as immediately lost through a change of status to parent, and suggested that these were too precious to give up lightly. In fact, many of the men seemed less focused on the issue of not having children, and more on the possibility of losing their current lifestyle. Being “selfish,” being unconventional, meant that being an engaged, involved parent would be far too difficult for the majority of these men and for some of them, impossible.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Poststructuralist analysis has highlighted the discursive resources men drew upon and the subject positions they had taken up as reflective of their social location (i.e., male, affluent Westerners) and their privileged status in being able to make such decisions “easily.” The accounts provided in this article differ from those presented elsewhere, and in particular those from women who choose to be sterilized who spoke of stigma (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1097184X11430126">Campbell 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1097184X11430126">Gillespie 2003</xref>). The men in this study, despite often using negative attributors, framed their accounts in a positive fashion that indicated (for the most part) subject positions they took up willingly and comfortably. Further, although their accounts shared some characteristics with men in “typical” circumstances (i.e., reliance on neoliberal discourses of choice and responsibility; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1097184X11430126">Terry and Braun 2011b</xref>) these men worked to distance themselves from the “conventional” decision making that men with children might engage in and a rejection of contemporary modes of fatherhood within the West.</p>
<p>These accounts provoke some questions about the assumptions often made about men and their investment in managing the reproductive aspects of their sexuality (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1097184X11430126">Gutmann 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1097184X11430126">Oudshoorn 2003</xref> for similar assertions) or indeed other areas of health. They therefore have some wider value for critical studies of men’s health (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1097184X11430126">Gough and Robertson 2010</xref>). Men’s positive engagement with health-focused decision making (reproductive or otherwise) has had little coverage to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1097184X11430126">Sloan, Gough, and Conner 2010</xref>), and agentic accounts such as the ones presented in this article provide valuable insight into the resources men may draw from and take up.</p>
<p>Of course these accounts do not represent all there is to say about men who take up vasectomy preemptively, and this study was limited by its context, sample size and a preponderance of professionals within that sample (as discussed in the method section). Ongoing work needs to continue in this area as one among many possible expressions of male engagement with their reproductive bodies.</p>

<p>While there is some suggestion that a couple deciding to call themselves childfree is potentially insulting to those that have children, this group is considerably more marginalized (and in many cases stigmatized) than those that have children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1097184X11430126">Gillespie 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1097184X11430126">Mawson 2006</xref>).
