<abstract>
<p>Using multivariate techniques, the authors investigate how age, family type, and race/ethnicity affect grandmother-headed families’ economic resources. The authors examine four grandmother-headed family types that are classified on the basis of two features: parents’ presence and the caregiving relationship of the grandmother and grandchild. Using data from the 2000 census (Public Use Microdata Sample 5%) to predict grandmother-headed families’ official and relative poverty statuses, analyses indicate that age, race/ethnicity, and family configuration are major explanations for poverty differences. The effects of race/ethnicity on official and relative poverty are greater among older cohorts than among the youngest cohorts. Additionally, the effects of age on poverty vary by family type: the lower chances of poverty that are associated with older cohorts are not as great among two-generation families as they are among three-generation grandmother-headed families. The authors interpret these findings using a life-course perspective and cumulative disadvantage theory and discuss the implications for grandmother-headed families’ economic security.</p>

<p>Scholars interested in studying care work, intergenerational solidarity, and family relationships recognize formal and informal grandparent care for grandchildren as one of the core issues in social gerontology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0164027511423383">Smith, Beltran, Butts, &amp; Kingson, 2000</xref>), partly prompted by the rise in grandparent-headed households over the past three decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0164027511423383">Thomas, Sperry, &amp; Yarbrough, 2000</xref>). Historically, grandparents have been important caregivers in families, and recent social and political trends have increased scholars’ and policy makers’ awareness of their challenges. Paradigm shifts in child welfare practices that favored placing children with kin, along with social crises such as drug use and incarceration, partly account for the dramatic rise in formal and informal custodial grandparent arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0164027511423383">Minkler, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0164027511423383">Smith et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Grandparent-headed families, those that include grandparents and grandchildren in which the children’s parents may or may not be present, have been increasing in number and percentage since the 1970s; in 1970, 3.2% of children lived in a grandparent’s home compared with 5.5% in 1997 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0164027511423383">Casper &amp; Bryson, 1998</xref>). Recent data from the American Community Survey showed that in 2008, 6.5 million grandparents lived with their grandchildren who were under 18 years of age, and of these, 40.7% claimed primary responsibility for their grandchildren. Furthermore, 15% of grandparent caregivers had been responsible for their grandchildren for 5 years or more, while 9.5% had taken primary responsibility for less than 1 year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0164027511423383">U.S. Census Bureau, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the increasing prevalence of grandparent-headed families in the United States, sociologists must begin to ask direct questions about these families’ economic security and how economic resources vary across a range of family forms. The majority of research in this area has been descriptive, providing demographic information as well as qualitative narratives of some grandparent caregivers’ experiences. Yet our understanding of these families’ economic situations is incomplete. The political and social context surrounding these trends has favored shifting caregiving responsibilities from the state to the private sphere, specifically to families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0164027511423383">Dwyer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027511423383">Folbre, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0164027511423383">Hooyman, 1990</xref>). Indeed, care provided by families relieves the formal welfare system of substantial social and economic burdens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511423383">Himes, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0164027511423383">Rice et al., 1993</xref>), burdens that families undertake and manage privately. It is within these contexts that we must consider how various types of grandmother-headed families fare economically.</p>
<p>The gendered character of grandparent caregiving means that women perform the majority of care and therefore suffer the private economic consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0164027511423383">Casper &amp; Bryson, 1998</xref>). Just as women experience an economic penalty related to caring for their own children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0164027511423383">Budig &amp; England, 2001</xref>), they also appear to experience an economic penalty for coresidential grandparenting. Grandmothers who are still active in the labor market may face dim economic prospects if they alter their employment schedules and trajectories to care for grandchildren. Thus, the age at which grandmothers raise their own children and the age at which they undertake care for grandchildren may influence their economic security, because the work they do to care for children is not rewarded in the market economy.</p>
<p>In this study, we focus on grandmother-headed families and draw on a life-course perspective to address how age, race/ethnicity, and family structure are related to grandmother-headed family types and economic circumstances, specifically their chances of being in official and relative poverty. We perform a multivariate analysis using 2000 census data (Public Use Microdata Sample 5%) to address this question and explore how the life-course perspective helps explain younger grandmother caregivers’ economic disadvantage relative to older grandmother caregivers. We also draw on the life-course concept of cumulative disadvantage to explain why young minority grandmother-headed families have a higher risk for poverty than other grandmother-headed families. Because previous research about grandparenting and poverty has tended to be descriptive, our theoretically driven, multivariate study adds critical depth to this literature.</p>
<p>Below we summarize the research on grandparent-headed families in the United States, including their economic circumstances. We review studies on all grandparent-headed families, not only those headed by grandmothers, because of the limited research using multivariate methods to study coresident grandparenting and poverty. We begin with a brief description of the situation and configuration of grandparent-headed families in the United States to contextualize our research question that is specific to grandmother-headed families. We then summarize research about grandparent-headed families’ economic circumstances. Next we highlight the importance of a life-course perspective and gender in examinations of poverty among grandmother-headed families. Throughout our review, we address racial/ethnic variation among grandparent-headed families and their economic situations.</p>

<title>Grandparent-Headed Families in the United States</title>
<p>What do grandparent-headed families look like? Among all grandparent-headed families, the largest category is multigenerational and includes both grandparents and at least one parent (34%). Grandmother-only families with a parent present are also a large group, constituting another 29% of all coresident grandparents. Grandparent-headed families without parents present in the household are less prevalent: Only 17% of these families have both grandparents present, and 14% have a grandmother only, while a small fraction have only a grandfather present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0164027511423383">Casper &amp; Bryson, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The conceptualization of grandparent-headed family types and configurations varies across studies. The common thread is the recognition that grandparent-headed families are complex and dynamic, and, as we argue, some family configurations will be associated with greater economic disadvantage than others. Research distinguishes between grandparent-headed families with an adult child present (often called middle generation) and “skipped-generation” families in which the grandchild lives with the grandparent and has no parent present. Research using the 1997 Current Population Survey distinguished among five different types of grandparent-headed families: both grandparents, some parents present; both grandparents, no parents present; grandmother only, some parents present; grandmother only, no parents present; and grandfather only present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0164027511423383">Casper &amp; Bryson, 1998</xref>). In other research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0164027511423383">Bryson and Casper (1999)</xref> distinguished between even finer categories of grandparent-headed families and identified nine family types on the basis of three features: grandparent presence, who maintains the family, and parent presence. For all families, the researchers differentiated among those with both grandparents present, a grandmother only present, or a grandfather only present. For the current project, we are consistent with previous studies and distinguish between grandmother family types on two features (resulting in four categories): parent presence in the family and the caregiving relationship of the grandparent and grandchild (grandmother as primary caregiver or not). We include fewer categories of grandparent-headed families than previous research primarily because we only focus on grandmother-headed households.</p>
<p>Research indicates that racial and ethnic variation exists across grandparent family forms and is an important consideration when studying poverty in this population. Data from the 2000 census Public Use Microdata Sample 5% that compared households with the middle generation present with skipped-generation households showed that Asian grandparents were the least likely to live in skipped-generation households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0164027511423383">Mutchler, Lee, &amp; Baker, 2006</xref>). Seventy-four percent of Asian grandparents who lived with their grandchildren also had the middle generation present, while the other 26% were in skipped-generation households. In contrast, 57% of African American grandparents who lived with grandchildren also resided in skipped-generation households, followed by Native Americans (55%), Whites (51%), and Hispanics (44%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0164027511423383">Mutchler et al., 2006</xref>). Importantly, for all coresident grandparent caregivers, those with a middle generation present were less likely to be poor than those in skipped-generation households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0164027511423383">Mutchler et al., 2006</xref>). Scholarship has been particularly focused on the situations of African American grandparent-headed families. Many of these families are “downward extended,” as young mothers and their children need the assistance of the grandparent for child care, housing, and financial reasons (in contrast to coresidence that is motivated by the parent or grandparent’s health or financial needs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0164027511423383">Kamo, 2000</xref>). Indeed, high rates of single motherhood among African American women and low income among African American men are directly linked to higher rates of multigenerational coresidence and specifically grandmother-headed families among African Americans compared with Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0164027511423383">Fuller-Thomson, Minkler, &amp; Driver, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0164027511423383">Kamo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0164027511423383">Swartz, 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-0164027511423383">
<title>Grandparent-Headed Families’ Economic Circumstances</title>
<p>Grandparent-headed families are also more likely to experience economic hardship than grandparents who do not live with their grandchildren, an unsurprising trend given that the majority of grandparent caregivers are women and that African Americans and Hispanics are disproportionately represented among these families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0164027511423383">Fuller-Thomson et al., 1997</xref>). The economic disadvantages that women and people of color experience in the labor market over the life course help ensure that these families will be at the bottom of the income distribution. Indeed, even among African Americans, grandmother caregivers are the poorest of the poor, such that African American grandmother caregivers have higher rates of poverty than grandfather caregivers or other African American women over age 45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0164027511423383">Minkler &amp; Fuller-Thomson, 2005</xref>). The selection into and composition of grandparent-headed family households has implications for their economic resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0164027511423383">Bryson &amp; Casper, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0164027511423383">Park, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A central factor influencing economic resources in grandparent-headed families is the presence of the middle generation in the household, and its presence or absence differentiates among families’ chances of poverty. Two-generation households are more likely to be poor than three-generation households regardless of race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0164027511423383">Mutchler et al., 2006</xref>). As of 1998, 61% of grandparent caregivers had the middle generation present, while 39% did not have the middle generation present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0164027511423383">Casper &amp; Bryson, 1998</xref>). The middle generation’s presence may signal that grandparent caregiving is temporary (and potentially less financially and logistically taxing), and the middle generation may bring income into the household (Bryson &amp; Casper, 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0164027511423383">Mutchler et al., 2006</xref>). On the other hand, grandparent caregivers who claim primary caregiving responsibility for their grandchildren despite the presence of adult children may find the middle generation to be a drain on the family’s economic resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0164027511423383">Jurkowski, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The transition to grandparent caregiving is linked to grandparent-headed families’ economic situations. Parents’ drug addiction, AIDS, teen pregnancy, divorce, single-parent families, mental and physical illness, child abuse and neglect, and incarceration are the most common explanations for the formation of grandparent-headed families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0164027511423383">Burton, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0164027511423383">Casper &amp; Bryson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0164027511423383">Minkler, 1999</xref>), many of which are associated with poverty, racism, and other mechanisms of social stratification. Even more recently, welfare reform legislation has instituted rules requiring that teenage mothers live with a parent or guardian in order to receive benefits, which has also furthered the creation of three-generation households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0164027511423383">Bianchi, Hotz, McGarry, &amp; Seltzer, 2007</xref>). “Three-strikes” laws and their consequent rising rates of incarceration have also helped increase the number of grandparent-headed families, especially among African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0164027511423383">Reed &amp; Reed, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>For grandparents, the shift to caregiving for grandchildren may also be accompanied by financial strain because of the demand for basic necessities for the additional family members or out-of-pocket health care costs for the grandchild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0164027511423383">Bachman &amp; Chase-Lansdale, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0164027511423383">Waldrop &amp; Weber, 2001</xref>). This issue may be complicated by the formal custodial arrangements for the child. Some research has demonstrated that the determinants of custodial versus coresidential grandparenting are different. Specifically, grandparents who undertake custodial care often do so because the parents are unable or unwilling to care for their own children, whereas coresident grandparenting is more often related to the middle generations’ problems with living independently or experiencing a transition between roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0164027511423383">Pebley &amp; Rudkin, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Few studies have systematically examined predictors of poverty among grandparent-headed families using multivariate methods. One exception is a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0164027511423383">Fuller-Thompson et al. (1997)</xref> that used data from the National Survey of Families and Households and examined how social and economic factors predict the likelihood of being a custodial versus a noncustodial grandparent. Custodial grandparents had lower mean incomes and were more likely to report incomes below the poverty line than noncustodial grandparents, but poverty level was not a significant predictor of grandparent caregiver status, controlling for marital status, age, race, gender, geographic region, urban or rural status, number of children in the household, total number of grandchildren, and whether the grandparent had a child die in the past 5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0164027511423383">Fuller-Thomson et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Research has found patterns of inequality by race and ethnicity among coresident grandparent caregivers in general. As of 2000, 32% of African American and Native American coresident grandparent caregivers and 27% of Hispanic coresident grandparent caregivers were in poverty, while White and Asian grandparent-headed families had lower percentages in poverty, 13% and 12%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0164027511423383">Mutchler et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies focused on grandmother-headed families suggest that they are particularly economically vulnerable. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0164027511423383">Park (2006)</xref> demonstrated that grandmother-headed families (with no parents present) are most likely to suffer extreme poverty. Multivariate research has shown consistent results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0164027511423383">Casper and Bryson (1998)</xref> used data from the March 1997 Current Population Survey and analyzed five types of grandparent-headed families’ economic situations using logistic regression to predict three measures of economic disadvantage. The results showed that grandmother-only families with no middle generation present were more likely to be poor than grandchildren in families with both grandparents and at least one parent. Additionally, grandmother-only families with no parents present were more likely to receive public assistance, while families with both grandparents but no parents present were the most likely to be uninsured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0164027511423383">Casper &amp; Bryson, 1998</xref>). Another study that used multivariate methods compared a small sample of custodial grandmothers (<italic>n</italic> = 90) with biological mothers (<italic>n</italic> = 1,462) who were from low-income neighborhoods and found that younger grandmothers and those who sought out more social support reported higher financial strain and higher levels of physical disability than biological mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0164027511423383">Bachman &amp; Chase-Lansdale, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Our contribution to the research about grandparent-headed families’ economic security is to use a life-course perspective to understand the significance of age, race/ethnicity, and family structure in explaining the risk for poverty among grandmother-headed families. We also use important lessons from previous studies about family formation and apply them to grandparent-headed families. The life-course perspective is especially relevant for grandparent-headed families, who may be experiencing multiple life-course transitions concurrently (such as retirement and widowhood). Although these questions are relevant to grandfathers and grandmothers alike, our focus is on grandmother-headed families.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0164027511423383">
<title>Gender, the Life Course, and Caregiving</title>
<p>The strong connection between women and caregiving is culturally and structurally embedded in our social institutions, so it is no surprise that women are disproportionally represented among those housing and caring for grandchildren (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0164027511423383">Fuller-Thomson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0164027511423383">Simmons &amp; Dye, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0164027511423383">U.S. Census Bureau, 2008</xref>). Grandmother-headed families’ lower economic positions are thus related to women’s lower economic status in society, which works to the detriment of both women and the families for whom they care. Caring for children and grandchildren has implications for women’s work trajectories and earnings, and these in turn affect the economic situations of families that depend on women’s earnings.</p>
<p>The timing of events in women’s lives, particularly the timing of child rearing, affects their economic situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0164027511423383">Taniguchi, 1999</xref>). For instance, we know that women suffer a “motherhood penalty” on their earnings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0164027511423383">Budig &amp; England, 2001</xref>). Women who have children relatively early in life bear a higher wage penalty than women who delay, perhaps because those who delay childbirth are able to build more work experience over their life courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0164027511423383">Taniguchi, 1999</xref>). Furthermore, the theory of cumulative disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0164027511423383">O’Rand, 1996</xref>) would suggest that women never recover from the economic detriment of the motherhood penalty and that the penalty is compounded over time. The theory of cumulative disadvantage is premised on the idea that those who start life with greater resources accumulate more opportunities to increase their resources, while those who start off with less have fewer opportunities for acquiring additional resources and fall further behind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0164027511423383">O’Rand, 1996</xref>). Often posited to explain race and ethnic differences over the life course, cumulative disadvantage also has implications for women and emphasizes racial and ethnic variation among women. Thus, for women whose labor market experiences are interrupted by child rearing and by grandparenting, the economic consequences may be substantial. In addition, racial and ethnic inequality over the life course may put some minority racial/ethnic groups of grandmother caregivers at a disadvantage relative to Whites as they take on the caregiving role.</p>
<p>From a life-course perspective, it stands to reason that the timing of grandmother-headed family formation also influences women’s economic opportunities. For example, housing and caring for a grandchild as a young grandmother (such as 40 years old) may disrupt women’s employment in their prime earnings years, while taking on the responsibility in retirement may not have the same negative economic effect on earnings. We would expect that continued interruptions or diminutions in earnings will have long-term consequences for women’s economic stability, consequences lasting into retirement and old age. Furthermore, women who become mothers when young are likely to become grandmothers earlier than women who delay childbearing. Thus, young grandmothers in the position of caring for grandchildren are likely doubly disadvantaged by their trajectory: by the timing of their own children as well as the timing of their grandchildren, who come when they are still active in the labor force. Older grandmothers, conversely, who may have benefited economically from having their own children later, may also benefit from the resulting later timing of their grandchildren.</p>
<p>The timing of life events may not affect all groups of women identically, and in particular, race/ethnicity may influence the ways in which family formation and structure affect women. Burton’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0164027511423383">Burton &amp; Bengtson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0164027511423383">Burton &amp; Dilworth-Anderson, 1991</xref>) early research on the effects of early childbearing on family structure and the roles of aging African American women suggested that the verticalization of family forms (such that more generations were alive at the same time because of early childbearing and increasing life expectancy) meant that mothers became grandmothers at younger ages with each generation. Thus, they were increasingly likely to become relatively young great-grandmothers, and these simultaneous trends increase older African American women’s workloads within families. Early transitions to grandmotherhood were often unwelcome, and therefore young grandmothers would often refuse to take on the surrogate parent role to their grandchildren, so it was great-grandmothers who often undertook the grandparent caregiver role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0164027511423383">Burton &amp; Bengtson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0164027511423383">Burton &amp; Dilworth-Anderson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0164027511423383">Elder, Caspi, &amp; Burton, 1988</xref>).</p>

<p>Using a life-course perspective, the demographic literature about grandparent-headed family composition, and research predicting income and poverty status among grandparent-headed families, we propose five relationships regarding grandmother-headed families. The first three pertain to the relationships between poverty and family form, grandmother’s age, and race/ethnicity, respectively. The last two posit contingent relationships between race/ethnicity and age as well as between family form and grandmother’s age as predictors of poverty.</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Three-generation families in which the grandmother does not provide primary care will have the lowest chances of poverty of all grandmother-headed family types. These families are the most “traditional” multigenerational families and therefore most likely to be transitional in nature. Furthermore, by design, three-generation families have more care providers present and also more potential workers to contribute to the family than two-generation families.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Younger grandmother-headed families will be more disadvantaged than older ones and therefore more likely to be poor. We expect this to be the case because younger and middle-aged women are more likely to be combining their caregiving with paid work (rather than retirement income), which may negatively affect their earnings ability. In addition, they likely had children earlier in their lives, which is associated with women’s lower earnings.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Non-White grandmother-headed families will be more likely to be in poverty than non-Hispanic White grandmother-headed families. This prediction is based on research about labor force stratification and other institutionalized forms of ethnoracial inequality, as well as the descriptive studies of minority grandmother-headed households.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: We expect that the difference in the poverty rates of non-Hispanic White and non-White grandmothers will be greater among older cohorts than younger cohorts. The prior research demonstrating cumulative disadvantage over the life course suggests this would be the case because the gap between racial minorities and Whites is expected to widen as cohorts age.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 5</italic>: We expect that the effect of grandmothers’ age on poverty will depend on family form. Specifically, we predict that the disadvantage of being in a young grandmother-headed family will be greater among two generation families than three-generation families. We expect this because younger, two-generation families have fewer potential caregivers that might allow them to be more flexible as they negotiate work and family responsibilities.</p></list-item>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>To address our research question and test our hypotheses, we use the U.S. census 2000 Public Use Microdata Sample 5%, a nationally representative sample of U.S. housing units that contains household, family, and individual data. The data are gathered as part of the decennial U.S. census and sample 5% of U.S. housing units from all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. Our analytic sample draws from the full data set and consists of grandmother-headed households who live with at least one grandchild of their own under 18 years old. We are focused on families that share a household and draw on both household and individual data for our measures. To construct our sample, we combined data into household records with household heads, their spouses or partners (if present), and the first two listed grandchildren (only records with grandchildren of the householder in the house were included, thus limiting the sample to grandmothers who were household heads and who had at least one coresiding grandchild under 18). Including the data for the first two listed grandchildren allowed us to determine whether at least one of those children’s parents was also present in the household (indicating a three-generation household), although we note that this does not preclude the possibility of coresidence with other members of a middle generation, because other adults related to the first two children could be present, such as an aunt or uncle.</p>
<p>We compare the chances of official and relative poverty for four types of grandmother-headed families. The first group consists of three-generation grandmother-headed families in which grandmothers do not report primary care of the grandchild (<italic>n</italic> = 28,184). Second are three-generation grandmother-headed families in which the grandmother claims primary responsibility for child care (<italic>n</italic> = 17,485). Third are skipped-generation grandmother-headed families (with no parent present) in which the grandmother claims primary responsibility for child care (<italic>n</italic> = 19,779). Last are skipped-generation grandmother-headed families in which the grandmother does not claim responsibility for the primary care of the child (<italic>n</italic> = 7,473). To create these family types, we used data about household structure and a variable that indicated whether householders reported if the grandparent was “currently responsible for most of the basic needs of any grandchild(ren) under the age of 18 who live(s) in this house or apartment.”</p>
<sec id="section6-0164027511423383">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>The analyses use two dependent variables, official and relative poverty status, to measure slightly different types of economic resources. Official poverty status is a dummy variable (1 = below the threshold) and indicates the extent to which families (as opposed to households) are at risk for extreme disadvantage. We use the variable from the householder, and this measure is identical for every member of the coresident family. We use the census threshold for poverty status (which varies by family size) as the cutoff point for each family size. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget defines this as the official measure for use in statistical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0164027511423383">U.S. Census Bureau, 2003</xref>). This measure is often criticized for being too low, so that it does not capture many householders and families that struggle to get by on near-poverty incomes. For example, in 1999, the year the data represent, the official threshold for a family with two adults and two children was $16,895, far less than half of the median family income for a family of that size that year ($50,046) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0164027511423383">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>To address the limits of the official poverty measure, we also measure relative poverty, again represented by a dummy variable (1 = in relative poverty). Relative poverty is intended to capture grandmother-headed families that are disadvantaged relative to other U.S. families. We define relative poverty as half of the median income adjusted for family size. This measure allows us to capture how the economic resources of these grandmother-headed families compare with the economic resources of families in the general population. To calculate the threshold, we divided the median U.S. family income in 1999 by the square root of family size. We coded each family as “in relative poverty” if their family income divided by the square root of the number of people in their family was below the overall threshold. In this sample, the proportion of families in relative poverty (46%) is substantially greater than those in official poverty (28%), although both numbers are considerably higher than overall rate of family poverty in the same year, which was 12.4% in 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0164027511423383">Bishaw &amp; Iceland, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Independent and Control Variables</title>
<sec id="section8-0164027511423383">
<title>Family type</title>
<p>We distinguish between grandmother-headed family types on the basis of two features: coresidence with a middle generation and whether a grandparent reports primary caregiving responsibility. Primary responsibility does not denote grandmothers’ legal custody of a child, only caregiving responsibility. We defined family types using both household structure data and the question from the census questionnaire asking householders who reported that a grandchild lived with them, “Is this grandparent currently responsible for most of the basic needs of any grandchild(ren) under the age of 18 who live(s) in this house or apartment?” We include four groups of grandmothers: those with primary responsibility and no parent present, those with primary responsibility and a parent present, those who with a parent present who do not report primary care (for brevity we refer to this as “shared care,” although we acknowledge that the actual sharing of care is a problematic assumption and we explore this issue in the discussion), and those who are not primarily responsible for the grandchild and in whose household there is no parent present. This final group is complicated and poses challenges as we interpret our findings, which we consider specifically in the “Discussion” section. The census-provided variable called “subfamily relationship” enabled us to determine whether the parent of either of the two listed grandchildren was present in the household. Most commonly, a grandchild was a “child in a mother-child subfamily.” We coded children in any kind of subfamily that included a parent as “three-generation families.” When data for one of the first two listed children in the house indicated that the child was either not in a subfamily, was a husband or wife in a subfamily, or was a parent in a one-parent subfamily, we coded these families as “skipped generation.”</p>

<sec id="section9-0164027511423383">
<title>Family demographic characteristics</title>
<p>Age of the grandmother family head is broken into four categories: young (30 to 54 years), middle (55 to 64 years), old (65 to 74 years), and very old (75 and over), with “young” as the omitted category in regression equations. Using a categorical measure of age allows us to consider nonlinear effects as well as the way that social policies affect some age groups differently than others, an issue we return to in the “Discussion” section. A dummy variable indicates the presence of a spouse or unmarried partner (1 = present). Race/ethnicity is indicated by a series of dummy variables coded 1 if the grandmother head of the family is non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic African American, non-Hispanic other race, and Hispanic (non-Hispanic White is the reference category in regression models). We include a variable for the actual number of grandchildren in the household, as well as a dummy variable indicating whether any of the grandchildren are under 6 years of age (1 = yes).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0164027511423383">
<title>Education and employment</title>
<p>We include indicators of employment status and education level of both the head of the household and the spouse or partner, if present. Education is an interval variable ranging from 0 to 16, and employment status is a dummy variable coded 1 if the person was employed at the time of the survey. Spousal education and employment are coded 0 if no spouse or partner are present, so in the regression analysis, the effects for those variables apply only to grandmothers with a spouse or partner present.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0164027511423383">
<title>Analysis Plan</title>
<p>Our primary goal is to examine how race/ethnicity, family type, and age influence official and relative poverty status among grandmother-headed families. For each hypothesis, we test how key factors influence the odds of both types of poverty, using logistic regression. Recall that the first three hypotheses are foundational in nature and address how family type, age cohort, and race/ethnicity relate to the chances of poverty. To address the remaining two hypotheses, we rely on interaction effects added to our regression models, which allow us to examine the contingent effects of age on race/ethnicity and on grandmother-headed family type. Finally, to ease interpretation, we present predicted probabilities created from regression results.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0164027511423383">Table 1</xref> presents descriptive statistics. These data indicate that some grandmother-headed family configurations are associated with greater economic resources than others. Specifically, three-generation families that share care responsibilities have the lowest percentage of households in poverty as well as in relative poverty (16% and 31%, respectively). This is followed by three-generation families with a grandmother who does primary care (26% in official poverty). Skipped-generation households do not fare as well, particularly among those with grandmothers who provide primary care for grandchildren, 43% of whom are in poverty (and 64% of whom are in relative poverty). The fourth category of grandmother-headed families merits slightly more consideration. We should note that although their specific household situation is ambiguous because it is unclear who is caring for the minors in these families, they are generally similar in most measurable ways to the other two-generation families. We consider these families in more depth in the discussion section. We now turn to the multivariate results.</p>

The table presents logistic regression coefficients predicting both official and relative poverty and includes baseline models and models with interaction effects. In support of Hypothesis 1, families that share care have lower odds of being in both official and relative poverty than the other three family types. In Model 1, the odds of all three other family types being in official poverty are 2 to 5 times greater than for families that share care. Model 3 shows very similar results for the effect of family type on relative poverty: The odds of being in relative poverty are also about 2 to 5 times greater for the other family types than they are for shared-care families.</p>

<p>Hypothesis 2 suggested that younger grandmother-headed families would be at a greater economic disadvantage than older ones. The significant effects for the age cohort variables in Models 1 and 3 (which are all less than 1) support Hypothesis 2 and demonstrate that every age cohort has lower odds of being in official and relative poverty than the youngest grandmother-headed families (aged 30 to 54 years), which are the most likely to be poor.</p>
<p>Turning to Hypothesis 3, regarding racial/ethnic differences in the likelihood of being in poverty, we find that in general, non-Hispanic White grandmother-headed families are less likely to be in either type of poverty than non-White grandmother-headed families, although the findings are somewhat mixed. Model 1 indicates that Hispanic, non-Hispanic African American, and grandmothers of other non-Hispanic racial/ethnic categories are all more likely to be in official poverty than non-Hispanic White grandmothers. Specifically, the odds of Hispanic grandmothers’ poverty, relative to non-Hispanic Whites, are 1.19 to 1. For non-Hispanic African Americans, the odds are even greater, at 1.69 to 1. And for grandmothers of other races and ethnicities, the odds are 1.16 to 1. Model 3 shows that this pattern of racial/ethnic differences holds for relative poverty as well. These effects of race/ethnicity are contingent on age, however, a point we return to shortly.</p>
<p>Hypotheses 4 and 5 examine how age moderates the relationships between race/ethnicity and poverty (Hypothesis 4) and between family type and poverty (Hypothesis 5). These hypotheses require regressions with interaction terms, which are provided in Models 2 and 4 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0164027511423383">Table 2</xref>. The significant age–by–race/ethnicity interactions in the second panel of the table provide mixed support for Hypothesis 4, which posited an interaction between age and race/ethnicity on poverty. Overall, the addition of these interactions to the models was statistically significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 (also when race/ethnicity interactions were added separately; results not shown), indicating that age moderates the relationship between race/ethnicity and poverty. Specifically, regarding official poverty, four interaction effects were significant. Hispanic grandmothers between 55 and 64 years of age have lower odds of being in official poverty relative to non-Hispanic White grandmothers than younger Hispanic grandmothers (aged 30 to 54 years). For both Hispanic and non-Hispanic African Americans, the odds of being in official poverty (relative to their non-Hispanic White counterparts) are greater for those aged 65 to 74 than among younger grandmothers (those aged 30 to 54). However, the odds of official poverty are greater neither for grandmothers of other racial/ethnic origins nor for grandmothers who are over 75 of any racial/ethnic minority group.</p>
<p>The patterns are very similar when we consider relative poverty, with one notable difference: old Hispanic grandmothers are no more likely than old non-Hispanic White grandmothers to be in relative poverty compared with their younger counterparts. Therefore, these findings are only somewhat consistent with a cumulative disadvantage perspective that predicts that racial/ethnic disadvantages would be larger among older cohorts of grandmothers, regardless of their family type and form, because the oldest group of grandmother-headed families does not show the greatest disadvantage in terms of official poverty. The finding that the odds of relative poverty among old African American grandmothers (relative to their young counterparts) are higher than White grandmothers is consistent with a cumulative disadvantage perspective.</p>
<p>To illustrate these findings, we present predicted probabilities showing the chances of being in absolute poverty for non-Hispanic White and non-White grandmother-headed families by age group in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0164027511423383">Table 3</xref>. The probabilities are based on the results from Models 2 and 4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0164027511423383">Table 2</xref> and calculated with control variables set to their means (simultaneously controlling for family type and family type–by–age interactions). The predicted probabilities show the overall advantage associated with being White, because the probability for being poor is lower for non-Hispanic White grandmothers in almost every case. The table also illustrates the lower chances of poverty among older grandmothers, in general, indicated by the low probabilities for poverty associated with the oldest age group. In all cases but two, age group differences are statistically significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. The exceptions are the difference between the old and very old Hispanic and grandmothers of other non-Hispanic races. In general, the relative advantage of the older age groups differs by race/ethnicity. For example, the chances of being poor for non-Hispanic White grandmothers who are between 65 and 74 years of age (a 10% chance) is about 60% lower than the probability for young, non-Hispanic White grandmothers (who have a probability of .27; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). (We report percentage differences in effects relative to comparison groups rather than raw probability differences to give a sense of the scale of the differences between groups). Although older non-White grandmothers also fare better than their younger counterparts, the proportional difference is not as great as it is for non-Hispanic White women. Old Hispanic grandmothers (those aged 65 to 74) still have a 14% chance of official poverty, but this is only about half the probability for young, Hispanic grandmothers. A similar pattern holds among non-Hispanic African American grandmothers. Notably, however, what appear to be racial/ethnic differences in the chances of official poverty among the very old reflect baseline racial/ethnic differences, and the effects of race do not consistently differ by age: The proportional difference in the probability of official poverty for the very old and the young is the same across racial/ethnic groups (indicated by the significance tests for the interaction effects in Model 2).</p>

<p>Differences between all racial/ethnic categories within age groups are all statistically significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 except the following, which are not statistically significant: young Hispanic and non-Hispanic other race; middle-aged non-Hispanic White and Hispanic; middle-aged non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic other race, middle-aged Hispanic and non-Hispanic other race; old non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic other race; old Hispanic and non-Hispanic other race; very old non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic other race; and very old Hispanic and non-Hispanic other race.</p>

<p>The pattern differs slightly for relative poverty, although we continue to find that the effects of age group on relative poverty are contingent on racial/ethnic group. Again, the probability of relative poverty among non-Hispanic White grandmothers is substantially lower among the oldest age group than the youngest (24% vs. 49%) and is significantly lower for each age group than their younger cohorts. A different pattern emerges among Hispanic grandmothers. The difference in the probability of relative poverty between middle-aged and young Hispanic grandmothers is larger than it is among Whites (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). However, the overall chance of poverty among the middle-aged group is statistically the same for Hispanic and non-Hispanic Whites. Additionally, the slight differences in probabilities between middle-aged, old, and very old Hispanic grandmothers are not statistically significant (although the differences between the middle age group and very old are). Thus, although the pattern across age group differs between Hispanic and non-Hispanic Whites, the overall differences between the young and the old and very old are similar among Hispanic and non-Hispanic White grandmothers.</p>
<p>The other notable trends about relative poverty and race/ethnicity apply to African Americans. First, the greater chance of poverty among all age groups of African American grandmothers is striking, and these differences are consistently significantly higher than all other racial/ethnic groups. For example, the probability of relative poverty among middle-aged non- Hispanic African Americans is .46, whereas it is only .35, .36, and .37 among non-Hispanic other-race grandmothers, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White grandmothers, respectively. Second, the differences between the young and the old African Americans are not as great as they are among non-Hispanic White grandmothers. Among non-Hispanic White grandmothers, there is a 45% difference ([49 – 27]/49), while the difference among African Americans is only 31% ([59 – 41]/59). We see similar trends among the other non-Hispanic race group.</p>
<p>In sum, the proportional differences across most race categories are larger in the older age groups than the younger age groups. Overall, for both official and relative poverty, in many cases, being older does not offer the same pay-off for all racial/ethnic minorities as for non-Hispanic White grandmothers in terms of official poverty, but older minorities are still better off than younger ones.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 5 posited that the effect of grandmothers’ age cohort on the chances of poverty would depend on family form. Turning to the age–by–family type interaction effects in Models 2 and 4, we see that, in fact, several contingent relationships exist between age cohort and family form, and some but not all of these interactions are significant in the equations for both official and relative poverty. To illustrate these complex interactions, we present predicted probabilities for each family type and age cohort in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0164027511423383">Table 4</xref> on the basis of the fully saturated model with appropriate interactions included and control variables set to their means.</p>

<p>The table illustrates differences in the chances of poverty comparing family types across age cohorts. The data again show younger grandmother-headed families’ economic disadvantage compared with their older counterparts: In all family types, the youngest grandmother-headed families have higher probabilities of poverty than older grandmothers (differences between young grandmothers and all older groups are statistically significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The only age differences that are not statistically significant are between the old and the very old grandmothers in both kinds of three- generation families and in two-generation families in which grandmothers provide primary care. Even with the apparent benefit of being in a shared-care three-generation family, younger shared-care families have greater chances of poverty than older ones. For example, the chance of official poverty among shared-care three-generation families is 20% in the youngest cohort, while it is only 6% among both the old and very old cohorts. Likewise, the chance of relative poverty for the youngest grandmother-headed families in this group is 41% but only 16% for the oldest cohort. This pattern holds for three-generation families in which the grandmother provides primary care. Although the chances of poverty (both official and relative) are higher in each age cohort, the differences in the effect of age for the two different types of three-generation families are not significant (as the interaction effects in the regression results indicate).</p>
<p>In contrast, the lower chance of poverty associated with older age cohorts is less pronounced among two-generation families, particularly those in which grandmothers provide primary care. For example, the difference in the chances of official poverty among the oldest two-generation families in which grandmothers provide primary care is 46% less than the youngest (a reduction from 48% to 26%). In contrast, the difference between the oldest and the youngest three-generation families in which grandmothers provide primary care is 68% (a reduction from 31% to 10%), a much larger difference. We observe similar trends in relative poverty. Comparing the oldest and youngest of these same family forms shows a 25% difference among two-generation families (grandmothers doing primary care) and 52% among three-generation families. In sum, the effects of age are contingent on family type: Although older age cohorts are associated with lower poverty across all family types, the effect is not as strong among two-generation families as it is among three-generation families.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our goal was to examine economic variation across four types of grandmother-headed families to determine whether family type and race/ethnicity related differently to economic resources depending on grandmothers’ age. Our findings suggest that three-generation families that share child care are at a distinct economic advantage relative to other family types. In addition, the economic disadvantage associated with being a grandmother residing with grandchildren and being non-White, measured as both official and relative poverty, is proportionally greater among older cohorts. Below, we discuss the implications of the variations in the effects of family type followed by those of the race/ethnicity results, using life-course theory to help us make sense of the patterns we found.</p>
<p>The influence of a grandmother’s age on economic circumstances proved to be particularly salient. In all cases, youth was associated with poorer economic conditions, although this effect varied across family types and other stratifying variables. This age effect makes sense in light of life-course theories and cumulative disadvantage. Although we do not have longitudinal data to draw on, we suggest that it is likely that young grandparents started their own families as young parents, and in turn their children began families as young parents. Young grandparents, who are in their late 30s to early 50s, would otherwise be in their prime earning years. Responsibility for caring for a second generation of children further interrupts potential career progressions and stifles earnings. Another explanation for the lower poverty rates of the old and very old grandmother-headed families is that these women are in the age groups who typically already use their Social Security incomes and any private pensions they may have. Not only do they benefit directly in terms of income, but they are likely also already familiar with the Social Security system and thus may be in a better position than younger grandmothers to have a sense of whether their grandchildren would also qualify for Social Security benefits (which they may well be eligible for under specific circumstances) and therefore seek out that support. Yet possible familiarity with the Social Security system does not explain poverty differences across family types or race/ethnicity.</p>
<p>One explanation for the findings about the apparent economic advantage enjoyed by three-generation grandmother-headed families with shared parenting concerns the avenues through which multigenerational families are formed. Previous research indicates that three-generation situations typically arise when the middle generation experiences difficulty during a transitional phase in their life (such as divorce or unemployment). In contrast, both informal and legal grandparent custodial arrangements often take place as a result of a crisis in the nuclear family that necessitates a grandparent stepping in and assuming caregiving responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0164027511423383">Casper &amp; Bryson, 1998</xref>). Our findings are consistent with these trends inasmuch as three- generation shared-care grandmother-headed families of all ages and races have the lowest chances of being in poverty of any other family form. It is possible that all the adults in these families are contributing to child care in some way and are in more flexible or better employment positions relative to other grandmother-headed families. It is feasible that these families have to make fewer cutbacks at work and have more possibilities and resources for child care. Furthermore, especially among older grandmothers, it is possible that they coreside because of the grandmothers’ need for assistance rather than the parents’ need for help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0164027511423383">Pittman &amp; Boswell, 2008</xref>). In contrast, three-generation families in which grandmothers provide primary care, or either type of skipped-generation families, are more likely to have been formed out of a crisis, such as parent’s drug addiction or incarceration. Thus, selection into different family configurations may be related to prior or lifelong economic circumstances. In this analysis, we cannot determine to what extent economic circumstances precipitate family forms or are caused by them, but it is clear that they are intertwined. Our economic findings are consistent with what researchers would expect to find if custodial and skipped-generation families were indeed formed out of circumstances that we would consider crisis situations. These crisis situations are also likely linked to greater disadvantage that accrues over the life course and have longer term consequences for the family’s economic resources.</p>
<p>Although older grandmother-headed families are at a lower risk for both official and relative poverty, our findings are still consistent with theories of cumulative disadvantage among racial and ethnic minorities. The “cushion” against poverty that older age groups seem to experience relative to younger cohorts is not as great for minority women, and this is particularly true among African American grandmothers, even when controlling for family type and size. The unmeasured factors that bolster the economic well-being of non-Hispanic White grandmother-headed families do not operate the same for all groups of coresident grandmothers.</p>
<p>We should also note several limitations of this research. First, the structure of the census data and the questions it includes does not allow us to assess how three-generation grandmother-headed families divide child care labor. We do not know how much care parents versus grandparents provide in any of these situations. It is possible that the division of child care will vary tremendously within three-generation families and among those who report providing primary care and those who do not. Indeed, we only know that grandmothers self-report primary care or no primary care, but we do not know how they themselves define primary care. It is possible that those who do not report primary care are indeed helping tremendously with care and those who report primary care in essence do very little. Second, researchers who study poverty and inequality argue vehemently that we need better measures of poverty status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0164027511423383">Brady, 2003</xref>). The current measures underestimate how many people and families are living in extremely and moderately poor situations. We have added one measure of relative poverty as a starting point for addressing this problematic omission, but this addition has not destabilized the current understanding of need in the United States.</p>
<p>A third, and likely the most important, limitation of our research is related to the implications of the complex structure of the census data, which means that we must be very careful in generalizing only to grandmother-headed families. The data set construction means that we overlook several types of families in which grandmothers provide care and resources, and we do not account for all of the possible grandchildren and adult caregivers in the household. In particular, our findings do not apply to families with another adult reporting to be the household head (such as a spouse or adult child). This likely excludes a large number of married grandmothers who coreside and care for grandchildren. We are unable to address whether there are differences between families in which grandmothers report being the household head and those in which another household member reports being the head. In addition, it is possible that we overestimate the number of skipped-generation households and, in particular, skipped-generation families in which grandmothers do not report primary care. This is because using only the information about the first two listed grandchildren in the home creates the possibility that we missed other family members (such as aunts or uncles) who may have been caregivers. The existence of this unique category of family, in which neither the grandparent nor parent appears to be primarily responsible for the care of the children, generates many questions about who cares for these children, or whether they engage in self-care. Although we cannot address these concerns in this study, we suggest that they point to fruitful avenues for future research in distinguishing between the factors that are linked to poverty and economic resources among families that include grandparents and grandchildren. Previous research has found differences between these families and those in which adult children reported being head of household, and suggests that grandparents who are the ones maintaining their homes are “younger, in better health, better educated, and more likely to be working outside of the home” than those who are living with adult children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0164027511423383">Bryson &amp; Casper, 1999</xref>, p. 3).</p>
<p>A central concern when using cross-sectional data to examine issues about the effects of age is the conflation of age, period, and cohort effects. Specifically, the results concerning the differential effects among the oldest grandmothers in our sample may be associated not with the aging process but with the cohort to which they belong and the period in which they experienced various life events. For example, the difference between non-White and White grandmothers in the effect of age could also be related to the very different experiences of these women when first beginning their own family and work lives. Women who were aged 75 years and older in 2000 were born in 1925 and earlier and began forming families in the 1940s, during the era of overt and legal discrimination against non-Whites. Labor market and family experiences were likely different for White and non-White women of this generation, in ways that shifted for subsequent generations of women. The dramatic differences in women’s experiences are likely related to the timing of the events in their lives, the timing of child rearing in particular. Although it is important to consider how historical context may have influenced different cohorts of women as they age, it is not possible with cross-sectional data to disentangle these issues, and we leave this to other scholars with the suggestion that it is an important area for future research to address.</p>
<p>In addition to the social-gerontological work on grandparenting and family research on multigenerational households, this article fits into the broader feminist political economy literature that conceptualizes care as work that has been systematically undervalued as the work it really is. Research in this area has emphasized the unpaid work that mothers do and the low value placed on paid work when it is related to any type of care. The unpaid work of caring for children has often been framed as a “mother’s issue” (increasingly sometimes as a father’s issue), but we know that this work has been and is done by other women and is likely more often being done by grandmothers as mothers increase their participation in the labor force. The bottom line is that grandparents, grandmothers in particular, are increasingly performing unpaid work, which has broader implications for their wage labor and their economic circumstances. Families that have more people to do this work have an advantage in the paid labor market, which in turn cushions them and allows a relatively easier job in performing informal child care.</p>
