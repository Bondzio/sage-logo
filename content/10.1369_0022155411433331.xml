<abstract>
<p>The secreted glycoprotein YKL-40 participates in cell differentiation, inflammation, and cancer progression. High YKL-40 expression is reported during early human development, but its functions are unknown. Six human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines were cultured in an atmosphere of low or high oxygen tension, in culture medium with or without basic fibroblast growth factor, and on feeder layers comprising mouse embryonic fibroblasts or human foreskin fibroblasts to evaluate whether hESCs and their progeny produced YKL-40 and to characterize YKL-40 expression during differentiation. Secreted YKL-40 protein and <italic>YKL-40</italic> mRNA expression were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative RT-PCR. Serial-sectioned colonies were stained for YKL-40 protein and for pluripotent hESC (OCT4, NANOG) and germ layer (HNF-3β, PDX1, CD34, p63, nestin, PAX6) markers. Double-labeling showed YKL-40 expression in OCT4-positive hESCs, PAX6-positive neuroectodermal cells, and HNF-3β-positive endodermal cells. The differentiating progeny showed strong YKL-40 expression. Abrupt transition between YKL-40 and OCT4-positive hESCs and YKL-40-positive ecto- and neuroectodermal lineages was observed within the same epithelial-like layer. YKL-40-positive cells within deeper layers lacked contact with OCT4-positive cells. YKL-40 may be important in initial cell differentiation from hESCs toward ectoderm and neuroectoderm, with retained epithelial morphology, whereas later differentiation into endoderm and mesoderm involves a transition into the deeper layers of the colony.</p>

<p>The successful derivation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in 1998 by Thomson and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022155411433331">Thomson et al. 1998</xref>) has led to promising insights into early human development. Further stem cell research is of paramount importance for developmental biology, generation of stem cell therapies, drug development, and regenerative medicine. Many factors influence the early differentiation as cells move from one stage of commitment to the next. Differentiation in vitro is affected by culture conditions such as the presence or the absence of feeder cells, certain growth factors, and oxygen tension in the culture medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022155411433331">Ezashi et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022155411433331">Eiselleova et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022155411433331">Millman et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022155411433331">Forristal et al. 2010</xref>). Recent studies have shown heterogeneity in hESC colonies from one culture dish and even within one colony showing cell populations simultaneously expressing markers of both pluripotency and germ layers even prior to formation of embryoid bodies, illustrating the complex network of signal transduction pathways involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022155411433331">Itskovitz-Eldor et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022155411433331">Reubinoff et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022155411433331">Laursen et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155411433331">Hough et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022155411433331">Brøchner et al. 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>During the past decade, a growing interest has evolved around the glycoprotein YKL-40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155411433331">Johansen et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022155411433331">Lee et al. 2011</xref>), also known as chitinase 3–like 1 (CHI3L1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022155411433331">Rehli et al. 1997</xref>) and as human cartilage glycoprotein–39 (HC-gp39) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022155411433331">Hakala et al. 1993</xref>). YKL-40 is a highly conserved protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022155411433331">Bussink et al. 2007</xref>), a chi-lectin, and a member of mammalian chitinase-like proteins and family 18 glycosyl hydrolases with heparin-, chitin- and collagen-binding properties but without chitinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022155411433331">Hakala et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022155411433331">Shackelton et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022155411433331">Rehli et al. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022155411433331">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022155411433331">Renkema et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022155411433331">Bigg et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022155411433331">Johansen 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022155411433331">Bussink et al. 2007</xref>). The gene encoding human YKL-40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022155411433331">Rehli et al. 1997</xref>) is localized on chromosome 1q32.1, and the crystal structure of YKL-40 is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022155411433331">Fusetti et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155411433331">Houston et al. 2003</xref>). The detailed functions of YKL-40 have, however, not yet been determined, but earlier studies suggested that YKL-40 was involved in angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022155411433331">Malinda et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022155411433331">Nishikawa and Millis 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022155411433331">Saidi et al. 2008</xref>). This has recently been confirmed in a study demonstrating that YKL-40 upregulates vascular endothelial growth factor expression in a glioblastoma cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022155411433331">Francescone et al. 2011</xref>). Interestingly, blockade of YKL-40 activity or expression decreases tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in xenografted SCID mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022155411433331">Faibish et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022155411433331">Francescone et al. 2011</xref>). Furthermore, studies suggest that YKL-40 plays a role in cell proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022155411433331">Shackelton et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022155411433331">Rehli et al. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022155411433331">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022155411433331">Recklies et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022155411433331">Johansen et al. 2007</xref>), the innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022155411433331">Dickey 2007</xref>), and inflammation and tissue remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022155411433331">Baeten et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022155411433331">Recklies et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022155411433331">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022155411433331">Ling and Recklies 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022155411433331">Johansen 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022155411433331">Chupp et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022155411433331">Lee et al. 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>We have recently demonstrated a strong YKL-40 expression in each of the three germ layers of human embryos. In early human fetal tissues, YKL-40 exists in two different isoforms, and YKL-40 expression is high in tissues characterized by rapid proliferation and marked differentiation, as well as in tissues undergoing morphogenetic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022155411433331">Johansen et al. 2007</xref>). The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether YKL-40 is produced by undifferentiated hESCs and by their progeny and to characterize the relative YKL-40 expression during the process of cell differentiation. We examined six different hESC lines and studied expression of both isoforms of YKL-40 from day 0 with entirely undifferentiated hESCs to day 28 with almost totally differentiated cells using different growth conditions over time—that is, low oxygen tension (7%) versus high oxygen tension (18%), absence or presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and feeder layers comprising either mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or human foreskin fibroblasts (hFFs). We used real-time quantitative RT-PCR (QPCR) to evaluate YKL-40 expression. The secretion of YKL-40 protein into the culture medium was monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A special paraffin embedding technique was applied, allowing for entire colony embedding, which made it possible to generate a survey of the topography for each specific colony by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using different markers on neighboring serial sections.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The hESC lines LRB01, LRB02, LRB03, LRB010, LRB016, and LRB017 used in the present study were established in our laboratory from surplus human embryos obtained from couples undergoing assisted reproduction after informed consent and cultured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022155411433331">Brøchner et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022155411433331">Laursen et al. 2007</xref>). Validation of the derived hESC lines was performed by QPCR measurements of the six consensus markers (NANOG, POU5F1, GABRB3, TDGF1, GDF3, and DNMT3B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022155411433331">Adewumi et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022155411433331">Awan et al. 2010</xref>). All six markers were present simultaneously in morphological undifferentiated cells from all the used cell lines. In addition, the ability to differentiate into the three germ layers was monitored by the IHC expression of layer-specific antigens (e.g., p63, nestin, PAX6, and CD34 and HNF-3β) in all cell lines. The cell lines were found to be chromosomal normal shortly after derivation. The study was approved by the regional ethical committee of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg Municipalities (permission no. KF 01-188/03).</p>
<sec id="section2-0022155411433331">
<title>Derivation and Culture of hESC Lines</title>
<p>Embryos were grown to the blastocyst stage and the inner cell masses isolated by digesting the zona pellucida with 1 mg/ml pronase (Sigma no. P8811; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The trophectodermal cells were then lysed by immunosurgery by incubation in rabbit anti-whole-serum antibody (Sigma no. H8765) diluted 1/3 in KnockOut Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (KO-DMEM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After 30 min, the cells were washed three times in KO-DMEM and incubated in guinea pig serum (State Serum Institute; Copenhagen, Denmark) diluted 1/5 in KO-DMEM. Lysis of the trophectodermal cells was evaluated by microscopy. Alternatively, the inner cell mass was isolated by manual dissection using 27-G needles attached to 1-ml syringes. The resulting inner cell masses were plated out in culture dishes precoated with 0.1% gelatin solution and either mitotically inactivated MEFs or hFFs in hESC medium. Cells were maintained in an incubator at 37C with a humidified atmosphere consisting of either 6% CO<sub>2</sub>, 87% N<sub>2</sub>, and 7% O<sub>2</sub> (i.e., low oxygen) or 18% O<sub>2</sub> (i.e., high oxygen). The hESC culture medium consisted of KO-DMEM, 15% KnockOut serum replacement, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 1× non-essential amino acids, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 µg/ml streptomycin, and 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen); 5 mg/ml human serum albumin (State Serum Institute); and either 4 ng/ml bFGF (“proliferation medium”) or no bFGF (“differentiation medium”) (RD Systems, Minneapolis, MN).</p>
<p>Colonies of outgrowing hESCs were passaged on either fresh MEFs or hFFs once every 7 to 10 days. Areas with just a single confluent layer of cells that displayed the typical appearance of undifferentiated hESCs as determined under the inverted microscope were selected for passage. Then, 1-ml syringes attached with 27-G needles were used to cut out clumps of cells containing approximately 100 to 200 cells. Four to eight clumps of cells were normally passaged from one culture dish to a new dish. The day of transfer was designated “the starting point” or “day 0” for that particular culture.</p>

<title>Analysis of YKL-40 mRNA Expression</title>
<p>Ten culture dishes from each cell line were cultured in parallel. At the desired time points, individual colonies were carefully divided into approximately equally sized halves; half of the colony was transferred to RNAlater for mRNA analysis, whereas the other half of the colony was paraffin embedded to be used for IHC analysis (see the next section). Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript II (RNase H-) reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. QPCR analysis was performed using an ABI 7500 Fast real-time PCR system and with a LightCycler FastStart DNA MasterPLUS SYBR GreenI kit (Roche, Hvidovre, Denmark). The expression level was determined by the comparative threshold cycle (C<sub>T</sub>) method using beta-actin (<italic>B-ACT</italic>) as an endogenous reference gene to calculate a normalized target gene value. All samples were run in duplicates. The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The primer sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022155411433331">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Analysis of Secreted YKL-40 by ELISA</title>
<p>The colonies were grown in a culture chamber containing an atmosphere of either a low (7%) or high (18%) oxygen tension for up to 28 days. The culture medium without or with bFGF (4 ng/ml) was changed three times per week and the used medium stored at −80C until YKL-40 analysis. YKL-40 concentrations in conditioned medium were determined by a commercial two-site, sandwich-type ELISA (Quidel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA) using streptavidin-coated microplate wells, a biotinylated-Fab monoclonal capture antibody, and an alkaline phosphatase–labeled polyclonal detection antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022155411433331">Harvey et al. 1998</xref>).

<title>Immunohistochemical Analysis of hESCs Grown for 0 to 42 Days</title>
<p>Colonies of the six hESC lines were cultured under conditions as described above for 0, 4, 7, 10, 17, 21, 28, 32, and 42 days. To obtain a fully differentiated stage, cell line LRB01 was followed until day 42. Following the final culture medium change, colonies were paraffin embedded employing cells from culture dishes used for either QPCR or ELISA and others that were used only for IHC.</p>
<p>To preserve the two-dimensional structure of flattened colonies and the three-dimensional structure of the more differentiated—and thus bulging—colonies, individual samples were fixed and embedded using two different strategies according to their appearance. Flat colonies were fixed in Bouin’s fixative in situ in the culture dish. After 1 to 2 hr of fixation, the fixative was replaced with 70% ethanol, and 24 to 48 hr later, the 70% ethanol was replaced with 90% ethanol. Following overnight dehydration in 90% ethanol, the samples were exposed to 99% ethanol for 12 hr. Then the colonies were gently dissected free from the bottom using a Cell Scraper (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) starting from the periphery. Colonies were then lifted carefully from the bottom of the culture dish to the small metal embedding mold into which xylene was pipetted. After 1 hr of exposure to xylene, paraffin was gently added to the embedding mold. The more differentiated bulging colonies were, prior to fixation, carefully dissected free and lifted from the bottom of the culture dish using hypodermic needles. Individual colonies were placed between two cover-glasses and fixed in Bouin’s fixative for 1 to 2 hr followed by dehydration in graded alcohols. Finally, the colonies were cleared for 1 hr in xylene and embedded in paraffin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022155411433331">Brøchner et al. 2010</xref>). Specimens from both embedding techniques were then cut in 3- to 5-µm-thick serial horizontal sections, strictly in parallel to the bottom of the cultures.</p>
<p>The mouse monoclonal YKL-40 antibody was generated toward human YKL-40 purified from serum-free, conditioned medium from monolayer cultures of the YKL-40-producing human osteosarcoma cell line MG63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022155411433331">Johansen et al. 1992</xref>) and subsequently purified with high-pressure liquid chromatography.

<title>Results</title>
<p>Colonies grown on MEF or hFF feeders in medium with or without bFGF and at low (7%) or high (18%) oxygen tension developed well, with cells showing undifferentiated stem cell morphology—that is, single large nucleated cells with prominent nucleoli and scanty cytoplasm interspersed with cells of more differentiated morphology depending on culture age. Following mRNA analysis by QPCR, there was no significant change of expression of the short or long isoform of YKL-40 in relation to culture age. Analysis of the culture medium using ELISA revealed an inverse expression of YKL-40 protein and OCT4, and the embedding techniques applied made it possible to perform IHC on serial sections of the entire cultures for YKL-40, pluripotent stem cell markers, and germ layer markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022155411433331">Brøchner et al. 2010</xref>). The IHC findings correlated well with the QPCR and ELISA results of YKL-40 expression. Parallel studies were carried out on all LRB cell lines used in the present study, and similar data were obtained with the different cell lines. For simplicity, the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155411433331">Figure 1</xref>, obtained by parallel investigations of QPCR, ELISA, and IHC over culture time, are derived from cell line LRB03.</p>

(A) Concentration of YKL-40 secreted into the culture medium during 28 days of culture, determined by ELISA. Oxygen tension alterations show no difference in amount of YKL-40 measured, whereas absence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) leads to earlier secretion of YKL-40 into the medium already after 10 days in culture. (B) Relative expression of mRNA for <italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>YKL-40</italic> short and long isoforms in relation to culture medium composition with absence (“differentiation medium”) or presence (“proliferation medium”) of 4 ng/ml bFGF, after 28 days of culture. Upregulation of <italic>YKL-40</italic> mRNA expression in the human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) cultured without bFGF was 172-fold and 62-fold for the long and short isoforms, respectively, whereas <italic>OCT4</italic> was only high when grown with bFGF added. (C) Measurements of <italic>OCT4</italic> and both isoforms of <italic>YKL-40</italic> by QPCR from culture days 0 to 15 grown without bFGF. <italic>YKL-40</italic> isoforms follow each other, leaving no significant change in expression throughout culture age.

<title>YKL-40 and OCT4 mRNA Expression and Protein Secretion in hESC Cultures</title>
<p>In a series of experiments, hESC cultures were grown for 28 days in either proliferation medium (with bFGF) or differentiation medium (without bFGF) in either 7% O<sub>2</sub> or 18% O<sub>2</sub>. The expressions of two isoforms of <italic>YKL-40</italic> mRNA were analyzed by QPCR, and YKL-40 protein secretion was determined by ELISA. All colonies from the six different hESC lines showed expression of <italic>YKL-40</italic> mRNA, and all secreted YKL-40 to the medium. The YKL-40 concentration in the medium from hESC line LRB03 was analyzed at different time points from culture days 0 to 28. When cells were cultured without bFGF, YKL-40 was detectable already at day 9, and the production rate increased up to day 28. In the more undifferentiated cell colonies cultured with 4 ng/ml bFGF, the secretion of YKL-40 to the medium was first detectable after 27 days. Irrespective of oxygen tension, there was no difference of YKL-40 protein concentration in the medium or of <italic>YKL-40</italic> mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155411433331">Fig. 1A</xref>). At culture day 28, a significant upregulation of <italic>YKL-40</italic> mRNA expression was observed in the hESC cultures grown without bFGF, compared to the cultures grown in the presence of bFGF (172-fold and 62-fold for the long and short <italic>YKL-40</italic> mRNA isoform, respectively), whereas <italic>OCT4</italic> mRNA expression remained high only in the presence of bFGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155411433331">Fig. 1B</xref>, same experiment as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155411433331">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>The upregulation of <italic>YKL-40</italic> mRNA expression in differentiating hESCs was studied further by analyzing the expression of <italic>YKL-40</italic> and <italic>OCT4</italic> at different time points during differentiation of hESC cultures, from culture days 0 to 15. The relative expression of mRNA of the short and long isoforms of <italic>YKL-40</italic> showed no significant change in expression. QPCR analysis of the expression of <italic>OCT4</italic> was clearly negatively associated with the expression of both <italic>YKL-40</italic> isoforms, with upregulation of <italic>YKL-40</italic> from around day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155411433331">Fig. 1C</xref>).

<p>The hESC cultures were well preserved and exhibited either good or excellent morphology. Immunostaining for YKL-40 resulted in a well-defined staining pattern, which could be a combination of uniformly or granular cytoplasmic staining and/or membrane-associated staining. The pattern of reactivity was similar following the two entirely different staining protocols for bright-field microscopy and confocal microscopy. In late cultures (28–32 days and 42 days) grown in the presence of bFGF, IHC analysis demonstrated that less than 2% of the cells expressed OCT4 and showed morphology in toluidine blue–stained sections compatible with undifferentiated hESCs (i.e., large nuclei with 1–3 reticulated dense nucleoli in a scanty cytoplasm).</p>
<p>Control sections incubated with mouse IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and irrelevant goat or rabbit antibodies, as well as subjected to omission of primary or secondary antibodies, showed no reactivity.

<p>In another series of adjacent sections from LRB01 grown for 42 days, IHC analysis was performed using antibodies against OCT4, the neuroectodermal marker PAX6, the endoderm markers HNF-3β and PDX1, and YKL-40. Well-defined areas consisting of pluripotent OCT4-positive cells at the outermost epithelial-like stratum—an embryonic stem cell layer—were in direct continuation with a layer of p63-positive ectodermal (not shown) and PAX6-positive neuroectodermal cells, whereas cells positive for endoderm markers were situated below this area (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0022155411433331">Fig. 7A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0022155411433331">D</xref>). YKL-40-positive staining co-localized in corresponding areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0022155411433331">Fig. 7E</xref>). From the same series, sections double labeled for PAX6 and YKL-40 showed a similar pattern of reactivity as that seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0022155411433331">Figure 7B</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0022155411433331">E</xref> (bright-field microscopy), with PAX6-positive neuroectodermal cell nuclei surrounded by a fine granular YKL-40-positive cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0022155411433331">Fig. 7F</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0022155411433331">H</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>High YKL-40 protein expression is reported in cell populations relevant for morphogenesis during early human development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022155411433331">Johansen et al. 2007</xref>). In the present study, we examined the expression of YKL-40 in six different hESC lines from the day of transfer (day 0) with entirely undifferentiated hESCs to days 28 to 32 and, in the case of LRB01, to day 42 with more or less totally differentiated cells. The expression of YKL-40 was related to the cellular differentiation and the initial morphogenesis in the individual colonies. The used monoclonal YKL-40 antibody has been demonstrated by epitope mapping to bind the epitope GAWRGTTGHHS corresponding to amino acids 210 to 220 of the human YKL-40 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022155411433331">Johansen et al. 2007</xref>). This antibody has previously shown YKL-40 immunoreactivity in different types of cancer cells, embryonic carcinoma cells, and fetal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022155411433331">Schultz and Johansen 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Our studies demonstrate that YKL-40 is consistently expressed in both undifferentiated and early differentiating hESCs in all cell lines investigated. YKL-40 is abundant in both OCT4-positive pluripotent cells and in the more differentiated progenitor cells positive for all germ layer markers used. Interestingly, OCT4/YKL-40-positive cells change expression pattern as differentiation takes place. Within the same hESC colony, different areas show OCT4/YKL-40-positive cells separated from areas containing only YKL-40-positive cells. However, as differentiation progresses, OCT4 expression diminishes, whereas YKL-40 expression increases in cells lacking basic morphological criteria for hESCs and confirmed with IHC. At later stages of differentiation, the subcellular distribution of YKL-40 expression is associated with the differentiation stage of the cell, with a more membrane-associated immunopositive staining in the undifferentiated cells and a more cytoplasmic YKL-40 protein expression in the differentiated cells. A marked coarse granular reactivity characterizes the endodermal HNF-3β-positive cells in contrast to a fine cytoplasmic YKL-40 reactivity in the neuroectodermal PAX6-positive cells. A varying intensity of the YKL-40 staining is noticeable in particular when comparing the very strong reactivity in the ectoderm with the weaker reactivity of the neuroectoderm and the mesoderm.</p>
<p>Furthermore, YKL-40 protein is secreted extracellularly into the culture medium with increasing concentrations as the colony grows older and becomes more differentiated. Specific culture conditions such as alteration of oxygen tension and source of feeder cells have no impact on YKL-40 synthesis and secretion. Neither are significant changes of expression of the short or long isoform of YKL-40 in relation to days of culture observed. The use of differentiation medium compared to proliferation medium leads to early differentiation of the cells with subsequent rapid increases of YKL-40 secreted to the cell culture medium.</p>
<p>YKL-40 was first described in 1992 as being secreted in large amounts in serum-free conditioned media of the human MG-63 osteosarcoma cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022155411433331">Johansen et al. 1992</xref>). Recently, it has been reported that stem-like cells can be isolated from the MG-63 osteosarcoma cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022155411433331">Lou et al. 2010</xref>). High YKL-40 expression is associated with organ fibrosis and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155411433331">Johansen et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022155411433331">Schultz and Johansen 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022155411433331">Lee et al. 2011</xref>). Tissue biopsies from patients with cancer have demonstrated that YKL-40 is produced by different types of cancer cells, including embryonic carcinoma, different types of adeno- and squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell cancer, small cell lung cancer, melanoma, and glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022155411433331">Schultz and Johansen 2010</xref>). Highest plasma concentrations of YKL-40 are found in patients with metastatic diseases and with the poorest prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022155411433331">Johansen 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155411433331">Johansen et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022155411433331">Schultz and Johansen 2010</xref>). Cancer stem cells have several similarities with hESCs, and cancer stem cells play an important role in cancer development, different cancer phenotypes, and cancer cell metastasis potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022155411433331">Chaffer and Weinberg 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022155411433331">Visvader 2011</xref>). Little is known whether cancer stem cells produce YKL-40. Mesenchymal stem cells derived from human glioblastoma express YKL-40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022155411433331">Lang et al. 2008</xref>), and CD133+ glioblastoma stem cells express YKL-40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022155411433331">Liu et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the present study does not identify a specific function of YKL-40, its wide distribution and expression in hESCs and their progeny suggest that YKL-40 is involved in a change of commitment and thereby in directing further differentiation of pluripotent hESCs toward more differentiated germ layer lineages. In a previous study of regional differences in the expression of markers during in vitro differentiation of hESC lines (LRB01-04), a direct change of expression from undifferentiated OCT4-positive hESCs to SSEA1-positive fully differentiated epithelial cells was noticed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022155411433331">Laursen et al. 2007</xref>). Very recently, early colonies from one of the LRB cell lines included in the present study (LRB010) were investigated using markers such as E-cadherin, β-catenin, vimentin, and N-cadherin, known to be involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and shown to contain a central compartment characterized by hESC-like cells of typical undifferentiated morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022155411433331">Jacobsen et al. 2011</xref>). In older colonies, a gradual change of differentiation was noted from the central compartment toward both apical and basal compartments, indicating a direct shift from hESCs to columnar epithelial cells and to nestin-positive neuroectodermal cells in the basal compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022155411433331">Jacobsen et al. 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>During in vivo embryogenesis and organ development, the process initially termed <italic>epithelial-mesenchymal transformation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022155411433331">Hay 2005</xref>), now referred to as <italic>epithelial-mesenchymal transition</italic> (EMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022155411433331">Kalluri and Weinberg 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022155411433331">Thiery et al. 2009</xref>), is a key event. EMT is a biological process that allows an epithelial cell to undergo multiple biochemical changes that enable it to assume a mesenchymal cell phenotype, which includes enhanced migratory capacity, invasiveness, elevated resistance to apoptosis, and increased production of extracellular matrix components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022155411433331">Kalluri and Weinberg 2009</xref>). There seems to be a direct transformation, with the term reflecting the presumed irreversibility of this process, of pluripotent hESCs into ecto- and neuroectodermal germ layer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022155411433331">Thiery et al. 2009</xref>). In contrast, the transition, with the term reflecting a presumed reversibility of the process, of pluripotent cells into meso- and endoderm requires an EMT, known from the gastrulation during early human embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022155411433331">Eastham et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022155411433331">Thiery et al. 2009</xref>). Early in the third week of human embryonic development, epiblast cells lateral to the primitive streak begin to move into the streak, where they undergo an EMT. The epithelial epiblast cells elongate and detach from their neighbors and then migrate away below the primitive streak as individual, loosely organized mesendodermal progenitors. This process of gastrulation represents the first EMT after implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022155411433331">Thiery et al. 2009</xref>). However, what has not really been emphasized so far is the lack of EMT in the initial differentiation of epiblast cells to the remaining ecto- and neuroectodermal germ layer—a process of epiblast-ectodermal transformation (EET).</p>
<p>During the in vitro differentiation of hESCs, we observed an ESC-ectodermal transformation from undifferentiated hESCs toward ectodermal p63-positive cells and to neuroectodermal nestin-positive cells. Meso- and endodermal marker–positive cells were consistently found in deeper layers within the colony. These findings suggest that a direct epithelial transformation from OCT4-positive hESCs into ecto- and neuroectodermal lineages and an epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like process from hESCs to meso- and endoderm progenitors take place in cell culture. A direct role of YKL-40 in ESC-ectodermal transformation and in the transition from hESCs to meso- and endodermal cells is yet to be fully elucidated, but YKL-40 seems to be important in both of these processes. Further studies involving both an EMT setup and in vitro and in vivo functional experiments with, for example, siRNA or blocking antibodies are necessary to obtain further insights into the function of YKL-40.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our studies suggest that YKL-40 plays an important role during early differentiation, both in the observed direct epithelial transformation of hESCs to ecto- and neuroectoderm and in the transition from undifferentiated pluripotent hESCs toward multipotent progenitor cells in endo- and mesoderm. The already known roles of YKL-40 in the adult organism and its distribution during in vivo differentiation in human embryonic development, in concert with the present results, relating YKL-40 to early differentiation and initial morphogenesis in individual hESC colonies, indicate that YKL-40 has pleiotropic effects in different cell systems.</p>
