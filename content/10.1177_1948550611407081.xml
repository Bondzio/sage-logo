<abstract>
<p>A fundamental question of social psychology centers on the nature and definition of social groups. The authors address this question by examining preconditions of psychological group membership. Participants were either socially categorized into minimal groups or had their personal identities made salient. They then responded to a series of measures designed to generate a perceived 2 × 2 outcome matrix. Following Thibaut and Kelley’s interdependence theory, participants' outcome matrices were decomposed to identify potential patterns of independence, dependence, and interdependence. Perceived interdependence emerged under social categorization but not personal identity salience conditions. These data demonstrate that <italic>perceived</italic> interdependence can be an outcome of social categorization. Social categorization can, thus, be understood to be the minimal requirement for psychological group formation, even if one sees interdependence as the essential defining feature of social groups.</p>

<body>
<p>One of the most fundamental theoretical and empirical questions of social psychology centers on the nature and definition of social groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611407081">Cartwright &amp; Zander, 1968</xref>). In one intellectual tradition, interpersonal interdependence is the essential defining feature of groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611407081">Rabbie &amp; Horwitz, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550611407081">Thibaut &amp; Kelley, 1959</xref>). In another intellectual tradition, based upon social identity theory (SIT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611407081">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986</xref>) and self-categorization theory (SCT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611407081">Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, &amp; Wetherell, 1987</xref>), the reverse is claimed, with social categorization (SC) being the essential defining feature of groups. When they do not approach the topic in such a polarized manner, group dynamics researchers are likely to concede only (a) a role for one or the other process within group life, while retaining the contrasting process at the core of their definition of social groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550611407081">Forsyth, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611407081">Turner et al. 1987</xref>), or, at best, (b) the presence of qualitatively different types of social relations, some based upon SC and others based upon interdependence (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550611407081">Postmes, Baray, Haslam, Morton, &amp; Swaab, 2006</xref>). Perhaps, as a consequence of this propensity toward dichotomy, little empirical work has been directed toward reconciliation or integration of these erstwhile opposing perspectives (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611407081">Stroebe, Lodedwijkx, &amp; Spears, 2005</xref>). Currently, we use research methods and theoretical frameworks of <italic>both</italic> the social interdependence and the SC traditions to present an empirical study examining the proposition that <italic>social self-categorization can produce perceived interdependence</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section1-1948550611407081">
<title>Interdependence and Social Categorization as Bases for Group Formation</title>
<p>We focus on the effect of SC on perceived interdependence because the reverse causal order is not contested. Authors working within the SIT and SCT traditions, for example, recognize that perceived interdependence is one of many potential antecedents to social and self-categorization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550611407081">Turner, 1985</xref>). However, what has never been demonstrated empirically is another claim from authors working within the SCT tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550611407081">Turner &amp; Bourhis, 1996</xref>, p. 39), that:
<disp-quote>
<p>… people forming a collective identity … begin to develop shared goals and interests reflecting their collective self-definition. Hence perceived interdependence would also develop.</p></disp-quote>
To find evidence for this proposition would be of both practical and theoretical importance. Practically, it would unite two literatures that are often treated as distinct and unrelated (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611407081">Kerr &amp; Tindale, 2004</xref>). Theoretically, it would address the concern that social categories are somehow not real groups precisely because of the (hitherto assumed) absence social interdependence between the members (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611407081">Rabbie &amp; Horwitz, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Of course, a body of empirical literature already demonstrates how SC <italic>affects</italic> perceived interdependence, at least as it plays itself out in people’s actual behaviors. This literature examines how SC influences game-play in existing interdependent relationships. In an early experiment, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550611407081">Wilson, Chun, and Kayatani (1965)</xref> observed higher levels of intragroup cooperation than intergroup cooperation. Following their lead, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611407081">Kramer and Brewer (1984)</xref> observed higher levels of cooperation in a depleting commons dilemma under conditions in which a shared, superordinate identity was made salient than not. Other authors have made similar observations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611407081">Dawes, van de Kragt, &amp; Orbell, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Although several processes may be at work in these situations, both sides of the theoretical debate agree that SC, and concomitant identification, affect perceptions of the existing outcome interdependence. Originally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611407081">Turner et al. (1987)</xref> observed that “the general process underlying mutually cooperative intentions and expectations is the extent to which players come to see themselves as a collective” (p. 34), so that “the perception of identity between oneself and in-group members leads to a perceived identity of interests” (p. 65). And more recently, writing from an interdependence perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611407081">Kelley et al. (2003</xref>, p. 420) observed that, “with stronger identification with one’s group comes a blurring of the distinction between personal and collective welfare…. [so that] one begins to transform the social dilemma situation.” The issue at hand, however, is not merely whether SC can affect perceptions of interdependence <italic>in light of an already existing interdependence structure</italic>, but whether it can <italic>create</italic> perceptions of interdependence when none existed previously.</p>
<p>To answer this question, we employed a method Kelley (1979) used to measure the perceived interdependence structure among a sample of heterosexual couples. By asking focused questions (e.g., How satisfied would you be if “you go alone to the movie you want to see and [your partner] goes alone to [another] movie?”), Kelley was able to construct a 2 × 2 outcome matrix that was then amenable to deconstruction along the theoretical lines outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550611407081">Thibaut and Kelley’s (1959)</xref> social interdependence analysis. Because this analysis provides the basis of our operationalization of interdependence, we describe it in detail below.</p>

<title>Modeling Interdependence and Non-Interdependence</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550611407081">Thibaut and Kelley’s (1959)</xref> analysis of interpersonal outcome interdependence is based on the model of a 2 × 2 game matrix, wherein two actors (typically self and “other”) each face two behavioral options. The conjunction of their independent behavioral choices yields specific outcomes to each. Actors in this context are interdependent when the outcomes to self and other are jointly determined by <italic>both</italic> own and other’s behaviors. Two theoretical forms of interdependence identified by Thibaut and Kelley are presented <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550611407081">Figure 1</xref>. In each matrix, self and other can independently choose either Option A or Option B, with the cell at the point of intersection of each actor’s choice displaying the resulting outcomes. Self’s outcomes are presented above the diagonal within each cell, and other’s below; larger numerical values represent more favorable outcomes.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1948550611407081-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The pattern in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550611407081">Figure 1A</xref> depicts a theoretical interdependent situation referred to as <italic>mutual partner control</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1948550611407081">1</xref></sup> and is most easily described as a situation of interpersonal exchange. In this situation, each actor’s outcomes are controlled entirely by the behavior of his or her partner. Regardless of self’s choice, if other makes Choice B, self gets nothing. The symmetrical nature of the matrix means that self has identical control over other’s outcomes. The exchange characterization of this matrix is a recognition that both actors are better off by “giving” each other (hence, exchanging) an outcome value of 10 by making Choice A. A situation such as this in which the partner control is <italic>mutual</italic> (i.e., in which actors are mutually dependent) is one of clear interdependence and represents what actors can do for each other.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550611407081">Figure 1B</xref> represents a second theoretical pattern of interdependence, referred to as <italic>mutual actor-by-partner control</italic>, and, as currently depicted, can be best understood as a situation of coordination. Here, neither actor has complete control over own or other’s outcomes. One’s choice does not guarantee a specific outcome to self or other; there is a contingency in the outcomes. Again, it is the mutual nature of the actor-by-partner control that makes this an interdependent situation, representing a relationship of what actors can do with each other.</p>
<p>Importantly, not every outcome pattern modeled in a 2 × 2 matrix is one of interdependence. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1948550611407081">Figure 2A</xref>, for example, depicts a theoretical pattern referred to as <italic>bilateral actor control</italic>. This is a relationship of independence, as each actor can provide outcomes to him or herself completely independently of the other. In this example, if self chooses A, self will receive an outcome value of 10, <italic>regardless of the other’s behavior</italic>. Similarly, if other chooses A, he or she too will receive an outcome value of 10, <italic>regardless of self’s behavior</italic>.</p>
<fig id="fig2-1948550611407081" position="float">
<label>Figure 2.</label>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1948550611407081-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Each of the above three theoretical forms of control can also be combined in their unilateral forms (i.e., present for one actor but not the other) to yield other 2 × 2 outcome matrices that also do not model interdependent relationships. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1948550611407081">Figure 2B</xref>, for example, self has total control over both own and other’s outcomes; self is independent and other is dependent, so the actors cannot accurately be described as interdependent. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1948550611407081">Figure 2C</xref> also depicts a situation of other’s dependence and self-independence (since there is no difference between own outcomes). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1948550611407081">Figure 2D</xref>, self remains independent of other, despite other’s outcomes being contingent on both actors' behaviors. This latter situation, too, cannot fully be considered one of interdependence because both own and other’s outcomes are not jointly determined by own and other’s behaviors, despite the contingency for other’s outcomes.</p>
<p>The value of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611407081">Kelley’s (1979)</xref> research method is that researchers are able to obtain subjective outcome values in the form of satisfaction ratings for each cell of a 2 × 2 matrix; these ratings are assumed to reflect <italic>perceived</italic> own and other’s outcomes that compose an <italic>effective</italic> (i.e., subjective) matrix. Importantly, the manner in which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550611407081">Thibaut and Kelley (1959)</xref> theoretically decomposed the three theoretical forms of control described above map directly on to an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. Both actor and partner control can be assessed as statistical main effects, and actor-by-partner control can be assessed as a statistical interaction. Together, this theory and concomitant method provide a simple yet powerful means to measure actors' perceptions of both social interdependence and non-interdependence.</p>

<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>Currently, we placed participants in a minimal social category using the minimal group paradigm (MGP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611407081">Tajfel, Billig, Bundy, &amp; Flament, 1971</xref>) and derived <italic>effective</italic> matrices for each category member using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611407081">Kelley’s (1979)</xref> procedure. In a separate control condition, participants' personal identities were made salient, and effective matrices were again derived. Patterns of interdependence and non-interdependence were assessed via ANOVA to decompose satisfaction ratings within constructed 2 × 2 matrices. We predicted that perceived interdependence would be a consequence of minimal SC but would not emerge in the control condition. Minimal SC was essential to testing our hypothesis, as anything beyond that (e.g., face-to-face laboratory groups) was likely to confound both SC per se and a priori interdependence. Critiques of the MGP based on presumed <italic>inter</italic>group interdependence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611407081">Platow, McClintock, &amp; Liebrand, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550611407081">Rabbie, Schot &amp; Visser, 1989</xref>) are not currently relevant because we measured intragroup interdependence.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-1948550611407081">
<title>Participants and Design</title>
<p>Eighty-two first-year psychology students (median age = 20 years; 55 females), participating in partial fulfillment of course requirements, were each assigned to either a minimal <italic>SC</italic> condition or a <italic>personal identity</italic> (<italic>PI</italic>) salient condition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1948550611407081">
<title>Materials and Procedure</title>
<p>All participants first completed the painting-preference procedure from previous MGP studies by indicating on eight trials which of a pair of Klee and Kandinsky paintings they preferred. In the <italic>SC</italic> condition, the experimenter pretended to score the preferences and returned saying, “about half of you here today prefer the painter Klee and half of you prefer the painter Kandinsky.” One half of the participants in the <italic>SC</italic> condition was then (randomly) informed that they were in the “Klee-liking group” and the other half was informed that they were in the “Kandinsky-liking group.” In the <italic>PI</italic> condition, no social categories were created and no further mention of the preferences was made.</p>
<p>Participants in the <italic>SC</italic> condition were then presented with a questionnaire entitled either “Klee Group Member” or “Kandinsky Group Member” depending on each participant’s own supposed social category membership. This questionnaire began with:
<disp-quote>
<p>You have now been divided into two groups based on your painter preferences–a “Kandinsky” group and a “Klee” group. You are a member of the “Kandinsky” [“Klee”] group. These different groups are important.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants in the <italic>PI</italic> condition were presented with a questionnaire, entitled “Individual Research Exercise,” that began with:
<disp-quote>
<p>…each person is actually a unique individual. Everyone has important differences from others, and his or her own unique qualities. This individuality is important.</p>
</disp-quote>
All participants then read the following, with differences between the <italic>SC</italic> and <italic>PI</italic> conditions in square brackets; in the <italic>SC</italic> condition, “Klee group” and “Kandinsky group” were used (counterbalanced) instead of <italic>in-group</italic> and <italic>out-group</italic>.
<disp-quote>
<p>For this research exercise, there will be a series of different tasks that you will do. Each [individual/<italic>in-group</italic> member] will be doing a minimum of four tasks [(<italic>out-group</italic> members have their own set of different tasks)]. However, there is an <italic>additional</italic> task that some [individuals/<italic>in-group</italic> members], but not necessarily all, will have to do [(and, of course, there will be an additional task that some <italic>out-group</italic> members will have to do)]. Before you do the tasks, however, we want to get your views about doing the <italic>additional</italic> one.</p>
</disp-quote>
All participants then rated their own and (expected) others' satisfaction with four different situations in which self and others may do or not do the <italic>additional</italic> task mentioned above (all participants were told that they would be doing at least some tasks). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611407081">Kelley (1979)</xref>, satisfaction ratings were made on a scale from −10 (<italic>very dissatisfied</italic>) to +10 (<italic>very satisfied</italic>), with 0 labeled “neither dissatisfied nor satisfied.” Each satisfaction item in the <italic>SC</italic> condition was prefaced with “as a ‘Kandinsky’ [‘Klee’] group member,” whereas it was prefaced with “as an individual” in the <italic>PI</italic> condition.</p>
<p>The 4 items (counterbalanced in a Latin-square design) were: (1) “…you do <italic>not</italic> complete the additional task, but other individuals [<italic>in-group</italic> members] do complete the additional task,” (2) “…you do <italic>not</italic> complete the additional nor do any other individuals [<italic>in-group</italic> members] either,” (3) “…you do complete the additional task, and the other individuals [<italic>in-group</italic> members] complete the additional task too,” and (4) “…you do complete the additional task, but the other individuals [<italic>in-group</italic> members] do not complete it.” In the <italic>PI</italic> condition, participants were asked to indicate for each item, “My own individual satisfaction” and “The satisfaction of the other individuals.” In the <italic>SC</italic> condition, participants were asked to indicate for each item, “My satisfaction as a ‘Kandinsky’ [‘Klee’] group member” and “The satisfaction of other ‘Kandinsky’ [‘Klee’] group members.” As noted above, because the current theoretical question was whether minimal SC would create perceived interdependence <italic>within</italic> that social category, all judgments in the <italic>SC</italic> condition were intragroup in nature.</p>
<p>Next, participants completed a 5-item scale measuring collective orientation (α = .81). Each item was prefaced with “when thinking about completing the additional tasks (on the previous page), I’d say that….” The items in the <italic>PI</italic> conditions were: (1) “I thought it would be best to coordinate my behaviours with the other individuals,” (2) “I thought it would be best to ensure that all individuals collectively did well,” (3) “I feel committed to the other individuals,” (4) “I am similar to the other individuals,” and (5) “the other individuals and I are ‘in this together.’” In the <italic>SC</italic> condition, “individuals” were replaced with either “Klee group members” or “Kandinsky group members,” whichever was the relevant in-group.</p>
<p>Finally, participants completed demographic questions, and a two-part manipulation check question that stated: (a) “Without looking back, were the research participants divided into two different groups for today’s exercise” (yes/no) and (b) “If you answered “yes” above, what was the name of your group?” (open-ended).</p>

<title>Manipulation Checks</title>
<p>All participants correctly answered the two-part group-membership manipulation check. A mean of the 5 items measuring collective orientation was calculated for each participant. Participants in the <italic>SC</italic> condition reported having a higher collective orientation (<italic>M</italic> = 4.23, SEM = .16) than participants in the <italic>PI</italic> condition (<italic>M</italic> = 3.63, SEM = .27), <italic>t</italic>(71) = 2.01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Perceived Interdependence</title>
<p>Satisfaction ratings were analyzed in a 2 (Categorization Condition: SC/PI) × 2 (Outcome Satisfaction: own/others') × 2 (Actor Control: own/others) × 2 (Partner Control: own/others) mixed ANOVA, with the first factor between participants, and the remaining three within participants. In this analysis, own actor control is represented by the simple main effect for self doing versus not doing the additional task for own satisfaction ratings (i.e., own control over own outcomes); others' actor control is represented by the simple main effect for others' doing versus not doing the additional task for their satisfaction ratings. Own partner control is represented by the simple main effect for self doing versus not doing the additional task for <italic>others'</italic> satisfaction ratings (i.e., own control over others' outcomes); whereas others' partner control is represented by the simple main effect for others' doing versus not doing the additional task for <italic>own</italic> satisfaction ratings. Own and others' actor-by-partner control is represented by the simple interaction between own and others' behaviors (i.e., doing vs. not doing the additional task) for own and others' satisfaction, respectively.</p>
<p>This analysis yielded 10 statistically significant effects (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1948550611407081">Table 1</xref>). The main effect for categorization condition was significant; participants reported greater overall satisfaction (both self and others) in the <italic>SC</italic> condition (<italic>M</italic> = 1.83, SEM = .30) than the <italic>PI</italic> condition (<italic>M</italic> = 0.48, SEM = .44). The main effect for actor control was also significant, with participants believing that own and others' satisfaction would be greater when actors did the extra task (<italic>M</italic> = 2.64, SEM = .41) than when they did not do it (<italic>M</italic> = −0.34, SEM = .44). A similar finding is reflected in the significant main effect for partner control; participants believed that own and others' satisfaction would be greater when actors did the extra task (<italic>M</italic> = 1.61, SEM = .29) than when they did not do it (<italic>M</italic> = 0.69, SEM = .39). Finally, the significant interaction between actor and partner control revealed the presence of overall actor-by-partner control. All of these, and the remaining effects, however, were qualified by the full four-way interaction. To examine this higher-order interaction, separate three-way within-participant ANOVAs were conducted within each of the categorization conditions.</p>

<title>PI condition</title>
<p>Within the <italic>PI</italic> condition, four effects were statistically significant. First, a significant main effect for actor control, <italic>F</italic>(1,21) = 22.98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .52, indicated that participants perceived greater satisfaction accruing to all actors (i.e., both self and others) when actors themselves completed the extra task (<italic>M</italic> = 2.50, SEM = .53) than when they did not do so (<italic>M</italic> = −1.55, SEM = .55). This was qualified by an interaction with own/others' satisfaction, <italic>F</italic>(1,21) = 13.54, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .39. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1948550611407081">Figure 3A</xref> presents the means of this interaction in matrix form to facilitate theoretical interpretation. As can be seen, this effect reflects the egocentric perception that self had a greater level of actor control than other individuals (i.e., the difference in self’s outcomes is greater than the difference in other’s outcomes). A two-way interaction also occurred between partner control and own/others' satisfaction, <italic>F</italic>(1,21) = 8.18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .28. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1948550611407081">Figure 3B</xref> presents the means of this interaction, again in matrix form. This effect reflects an egocentric perception of greater own partner control than others' partner control. Indeed, the pairwise comparison for the latter (i.e., between .34 and .98) was not statistically significant, <italic>t</italic>(21) = −1.02, <italic>p</italic> = .32, while it was for the former (i.e., between 1.07 and −.48; <italic>t</italic>(21) = 2.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), making this matrix comparable to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1948550611407081">Figure 2C</xref>.</p>

For others' satisfaction, the significant actor control (<italic>F</italic>(1,21) = 6.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .23) and partner control (<italic>F</italic>(1,21) = 4.42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .17) main effects were qualified by a significant interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1,21) = 4.54, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .18. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1948550611407081">Figure 3C</xref>, participants perceived a greater degree of own partner control if the others did the extra task than if the others did not do the extra task.</p>
<p>Overall, none of the statistically significant effects within the <italic>PI</italic> condition indicated the presence of perceived social interdependence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1948550611407081">
<title>SC condition</title>
<p>Within the <italic>SC</italic> condition, four effects were statistically significant. First, a significant main effect for actor control (<italic>F</italic>(1,48) = 5.73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .11) indicated that participants perceived greater satisfaction accruing to all actors (again, both self and others) when actors themselves completed the extra task (<italic>M</italic> = 2.78, SEM = .49) than when they did not do so (<italic>M</italic> = 0.87, SEM = .53). As above, this was qualified by an interaction with own/others' satisfaction, <italic>F</italic>(1,48) = 9.91, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .17). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1948550611407081">Figure 4A</xref> shows that this interaction reflects the egocentric perception that self had a greater level of actor control than other category members did (i.e., the difference between 3.27 and .41 is greater than the difference between 2.30 and 1.34). The third significant effect, depicted in matrix form in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1948550611407081">Figure 4B</xref>, was the main effect for partner control, <italic>F</italic>(1,48) = 6.69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .12. This effect reflects the perception that actors in general had partner control by providing the other (either self or others) with greater satisfaction by doing the extra task than not doing the extra task.</p>

<p>The final statistically significant effect, depicted in matrix form in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1948550611407081">Figure 4C</xref>, was the interaction between actor control and partner control, <italic>F</italic>(1,48) = 29.81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = .38. This effect reflects the perception that outcomes in general (both own and others') would be the greatest when both self and others did the extra task, followed by when both self and others did not do the extra task. Lower levels of outcomes for self and others occurred when self and others did different behaviors, either self doing the extra tasks and others not doing them or (especially) others doing the extra tasks and self not doing them. There clearly remained, however, under this minimal SC, an egocentric view that self doing the extra task results in better outcomes for everyone.</p>
<p>Overall, the statistically significant effects within the <italic>SC</italic> condition revealed the clear presence of perceived social interdependence. Both mutual partner control (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1948550611407081">Figure 4B</xref> observed matrix with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550611407081">Figure 1B</xref> theoretical matrix) and mutual actor-by-partner control (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1948550611407081">Figure 4C</xref> observed matrix with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550611407081">Figure 1B</xref> theoretical matrix) were found.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results provide evidence consistent with the proposal that social self-categorization can produce perceived interdependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550611407081">Turner &amp; Bourhis, 1996</xref>). Statistically significant levels of perceived <italic>mutual</italic> actor-by-partner control were found in the categorization condition; critically, this actor by partner interaction was not qualified by own/others' satisfaction. Had it been so qualified, we may well have observed a pattern in which there was, for example, other contingency and self-independence (as observed in the <italic>PI</italic> condition and depicted theoretically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1948550611407081">Figure 2D</xref>). Had this happened, it would have been insufficient for us to conclude that outcome interdependence was present. However, the currently observed perceived satisfaction to self and others were contingent on <italic>both</italic> own and others’ behavior, fulfilling our criterion for outcome interdependence. Critically, our failure to observe an interaction with own/others' satisfaction cannot easily be attributable to low statistical power, as twice as many participants were in the <italic>SC</italic> condition (because of our balancing of category labels) than in the <italic>PI</italic> condition (in which we <italic>did</italic> observe such an interaction).</p>
<p>In contrast to the <italic>SC</italic> condition, perceived interdependence was not observed in the <italic>PI</italic> condition. There did appear to be a nascent form of mutual partner control in the interaction between partner control and own/others' satisfaction. However, the pattern of significant and nonsignificant simple effects suggests that, while self was perceived as controlling others' satisfaction, others were perceived as having no effective control over self’s satisfaction. Moreover, the observed actor-by-partner control occurred only for others' satisfaction, suggesting contingency rather than actual interdependence.</p>
<p>Our findings are theoretically important because they bear directly on the debate over the ontologically primary characteristics of groups. We recognize, of course, that these finding do <italic>not</italic> provide a definitive answer the question of whether social categories are social groups because, in one manner, the answer simply depends on one’s chosen theoretical definition. However, if one argues that groups do not exist unless there is social interdependence between the members (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611407081">Rabbie &amp; Horwitz, 1988</xref>), then we have evidence to support the claim that a social category (at least a social self-category) is a social group, because minimal categorization does lead to perceived interdependence.</p>
<p>An important component of the debate that needs to be considered at this point is the distinction between psychological and sociological groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611407081">Deutsch, 1949</xref>). We currently examined psychological groups, to the degree that we measured <italic>subjective</italic> SC (e.g., our collective orientation measure) and <italic>perceived</italic> interdependence. Our data have no bearing on analyses of sociological groups, groups that are characterized by <italic>real</italic> (i.e., objective, material) interdependence (among other things like roles and structure). We are, thus, not claiming that externally imposed social categories are isomorphic with sociological groups (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550611407081">Turner &amp; Bourhis, 1996</xref>). However, analyses of psychological groups remain important. Indeed, one of the major contributions of social psychology is that subjective representations of the contexts in which people find themselves are strongly related to actual behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550611407081">Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611407081">Lewin, 1951</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611407081">Kelley and Thibaut (1978</xref>, p. 14) note that, in the domain of outcome interdependence, “behaviour itself can … be predicted from knowledge of the <italic>effective</italic> matrix” (emphasis in original). Clearly, then, the next empirical step is to examine the relationship between perceived intragroup interdependence that emerges from social self-categorization and actual behavior.</p>
<p>More directly arising from the current research, however, is the need for further work to understand how perceived interdependence emerges from SC. As noted above, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611407081">Kelley et al. (2003</xref>, p. 420) proposed one mechanism, that of “blurring … the distinction between personal and collective welfare.” We concur, as social self-categorization is known to lead to depersonalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611407081">Onorato &amp; Turner, 2004</xref>), self-stereotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550611407081">Moons, Leonard, Mackie, &amp; Smith, 2009</xref>), group cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611407081">Hogg, 1993</xref>), and, as noted earlier, cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611407081">Kramer &amp; Brewer, 1984</xref>). Depersonalization is likely to reduce egocentric perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550611407081">Turner, Oakes, Haslam, &amp; McGarty, 1994</xref>) and enhance a correspondence of outcomes, both of which we currently observed. Although egocentric perceptions were observed in the <italic>SC</italic> condition, the magnitude of these was less than those in the <italic>PI</italic> condition. Moreover, the failure of the observed actor-by-partner control interaction to be qualified by self-other satisfaction only in the <italic>SC</italic> condition demonstrates perceived correspondence of outcomes. The next theoretical and empirical step is the examination of the social–cognitive mechanism by which these all lead to perceived interdependence of outcomes.</p>
<p>Before concluding, we consider two potential caveats in this study. First, items measuring satisfaction levels were written in a manner to allow for the construction of a 2 × 2 matrix. Asking such targeted questions may have enhanced our chances of actually measuring interdependence. This concern, however, is substantially minimized by our failure to observe any perceived interdependence in our <italic>PI</italic>, control condition. Second, the specific pattern of results may well be contingent upon participants' understandings of the nature of the extra task that they and others were to complete. Systematically varying the nature of the choices available to participants thus remains a valuable way forward in future work evaluating the parameters of our findings.</p>
<p>In concluding, we offer, for the first time, clear, measurable evidence that social self-categorization per se is sufficient to produce perceived interpersonal outcome interdependence where none has existed previously. These data bear directly on the long-standing debate over the defining feature of social groups, and pave the way for a more integrated understanding of group processes. If one adopts the position that interdependence is the essential defining feature, one must now also recognize that at least <italic>perceived</italic> interdependence can be an outcome of SC. In this way, minimal social categorization can be understood to be the minimal requirement for psychological group formation.</p>
