<abstract>
<p>Nation-building and the tasks of encouraging a sense of national identity and political community pose an immense challenge in Papua New Guinea (PNG). With over 830 languages, it is one of the most linguistically and ethnically diverse countries in the world. Since independence in 1975, PNG has experienced high levels of political instability with frequent changes of government and allegations of corruption. Local and traditional obligations to extended family and language groups frequently supersede allegiances to the nation-state. This paper examines the attitudes of tertiary students from the University of PNG to national identity and key issues of nation-building. These students are highly likely to feature strongly among the next generation of leaders. Findings highlight the importance of family, religion and maintaining traditional customs. They also illustrate the importance of geographical region and gender in explaining differences in key attitudes towards national identity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Political instability and weak governance are often cited as the major constraints to the development of Papua New Guinea (PNG), a nation that has experienced frequent changes of government, a civil war, high levels of corruption, severe law-and-order problems, a poorly performing economy and a growing HIV/AIDS problem. PNG is the largest developing country in the South Pacific, with a population of approximately six and a half million. It is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world, with over 830 languages spoken. While approximately 85 per cent of the PNG population lives in rural areas, dependent on agriculture on communally owned land, mineral deposits (including copper, gold and oil) account for nearly two-thirds of export earnings, with faster growth limited by the mountainous terrain of much of the mainland. Port Moresby is the capital city, but unlike virtually all other national capitals the terrain means it is not connected to any other major city of the country by road.</p>
<p>Since independence from Australia in 1975, the development record of PNG has fallen well below expectations. Despite being rich in natural resources and receiving extensive external assistance, in recent decades the incidence of basic needs poverty has increased and the country is unlikely to achieve any of the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals by 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0032318712466762">AusAID, 2009</xref>). State-building activities in PNG have been a focus of the international community, with the country being labelled a ‘fragile state’. In 2004, concerns over governance led to Australia, the largest donor of aid to PNG, placing its own civil servants in a number of PNG government departments to help restore law and order and strengthen public sector management.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0032318712466762">1</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Attempts at state and nation-building in post-independent PNG are often undermined by the country’s political instability. A plethora of political parties compete for PNG’s 109-seat national parliament, implying that politicians are often elected to government with very low levels of support. It is internationally unusual in a non-proportional system that no single party has formed a government in its own right, and until recently no PNG government has lasted a full parliamentary term.</p>
<p>Clearly, nation-building − the task of building a cohesive sense of national identity and of a national political community − poses an immense challenge due to the ethnic diversity and geographic fragmentation of PNG. As is widely noted in the literature, regional loyalties to clan, tribe and <italic>wantoks</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0032318712466762">2</xref></sup> have hampered efforts to establish a strong sense of national identity since independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0032318712466762">Foster, 1995</xref>). While fragments of a genuine sense of national consciousness can be found in urban centres, most loyalties remain kin-based. This is reinforced by the prevalence of largely subsistence and cash cropping economies outside the few urban enclaves, leading to a high degree of autonomy not only from the nation-state, but also from the ‘indirect mechanisms behind the creation of a national culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0032318712466762">Jacobsen, 1997</xref>: 228), such as integration into a national economy of commodity production and exchange and a functional modern national legal system. As well as the prevalence of local <italic>kastom</italic>, lack of development tends to maintain the integrity of traditional culture and local communities outside urban enclaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0032318712466762">Jacobsen, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Rather than revisit the extensive qualitative work done in this field, this paper engages with these debates by examining the attitudes of a current cohort of tertiary students from the University of Papua New Guinea (UPNG). The UPNG was established in 1965 and has seen its graduates become PNG prime ministers, government ministers and bureaucrats, doctors, entrepreneurs, judges and scientists, as well as leaders of neighbouring Pacific Island countries. Alumni include four of the nation’s seven prime ministers: Sir Rabbie Namaliu, Paias Wingti, Sir Mekere Morauta and Peter O’Neill. Inevitably, the UPNG will continue to play a major role in training the leaders of PNG. It is by far the largest university in the country, with in excess of 15,000 students educated annually in undergraduate and graduate degrees as well as diploma and certificate programmes.</p>
<p>This paper presents the findings of a medium scale (<italic>N</italic> = 308) survey investigating PNG tertiary students’ attitudes to national identity, conducted at the Port Moresby campus of UPNG in October 2009, along with a follow-up focus group. The survey tool is a modified version of the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) ‘national identity’ module. It focuses on key issues of nation-building and attitudes towards national identity. One focus group was also conducted with 12 tertiary students at the National Research Institute in Port Moresby. An equal number of males and females attended from a wide variety of university departments. Focus group questions helped provide additional insights into attitudes towards national identity and complemented the largely quantitative data from the survey. The key research question that the paper seeks to address is: what determines a sense of strong national identity among Papua New Guinean tertiary students? We proceed by providing a brief historical summary of the main issues and challenges relating to nation-building in PNG, and follow with an overview of the survey tool and an analysis of the findings.</p>

<title>Issues of nation-building and national identity in Papua New Guinea</title>
<sec id="section3-0032318712466762">
<title>History and geography</title>
<p>The territory of PNG had no prior history of centralized administration before the colonial era. As a colonial entity, the island of New Guinea was divided into three administrative zones, mediated by artificial borders between the Netherlands in the west, German New Guinea in the north-east, and the British territory of Papua in the south-east. The territories of Papua and New Guinea were administered jointly by Australia following the Second World War. PNG acquired its present name four years before independence in 1975 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0032318712466762">Nelson, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>From its inception, the new state faced regional separatist movements in Bougainville (or North Solomons) province, Manus Island, Madang and the Gazelle Peninsula of East New Britain (home to the former colonial administrative centre of Rabaul) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0032318712466762">Sundhaussen, 1977</xref>). While Bougainville later achieved substantial autonomy after a protracted insurgency, other pressures for greater autonomy, if not actual independence, persist in a number of regions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0032318712466762">3</xref></sup> In addition to the existing 20 provinces, two new provinces will be created in 2012, one from the Southern Highlands Province (Hela) and one from the Western Highlands Province (Jiwaka).</p>
<p>At least one author has suggested that Australia’s ‘indifferent’ or benign colonialism contributed to a relatively weak sense of anti-colonial nationalism in Papua New Guinea, as no coordinated national movement was required to achieve independence in 1975 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0032318712466762">Sundhaussen, 1977</xref>: 311). Accordingly, for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0032318712466762">Kavanamur et al. (2003</xref>), no popular nationalist movements or ideologies were formed. When, for example, the University of Papua New Guinea was established in 1966, some Australian administrators pejoratively dubbed it the ‘Mau Mau factory’ (referring both to the Kenyan anti-colonial movement and to the propensity of national universities to become breeding grounds of radical nationalism). However, such ‘fears’ were ultimately not realized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0032318712466762">Nelson, 2000</xref>: 270). Independence was granted without a national referendum, and most members of the House of Assembly were elected without independence being a primary theme or factor in their campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0032318712466762">Nelson, 2000</xref>). Indeed, as Sundhaussen points out, in 1972 the United Party became the strongest party by running on a platform of ‘no early self government, no early independence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0032318712466762">Sundhaussen, 1977</xref>: 312).</p>
<p>However, a nationalist spirit was not totally absent during this era. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0032318712466762">May (1975</xref>) coined the term ‘micronationalism’ to describe the large number of local movements arising in the 1960s and 1970s which all had the broad objective of improving development outside of the formal political and economic systems. Moreover, there were strong nationalist visions contained in the 1974 Constitutional Planning Committee Report and PNG’s constitution.</p>
<p>Despite a variety of attempts since independence to cultivate or invoke a sense of a shared national culture and identity, highly localized loyalties to <italic>ples</italic>, that is to family, village and ethno-linguistic group, have prevailed. Indeed, senior figures within the government itself believe that a single national identity is unrealistic, and that broader regional identities are the best that could be hoped for in the short term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0032318712466762">Fukuyama, 2007</xref>). Even when proponents of PNG nationalism invoke a generic PNG village as symbolic of the nation, it is often in fact with a representation of their own ethnic grouping (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0032318712466762">Narokobi, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0032318712466762">Neumann, 1997</xref>). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0032318712466762">Jacobsen (1997</xref>) this invocation of the traditional and local in the ideological realm of nationalism – evident in constructs such as ‘Papua New Guinean ways’ or the ‘Melanesian way’ – masks the constitutional exclusion of traditional societies from the formal political and administrative mechanisms of the state.</p>
<p>In addition to these ethnic differences, there is widespread recognition of important social, cultural and economic differences both across and within the different geographic regions of PNG. The country has four distinct regions: the Highlands region is the most populous, followed by the Momase and Papua region, with the Islands hosting a much smaller proportion of PNG’s population. The Momase region is the poorest (across a number of different indicators) followed by the Highlands, while the Papua region has the lowest level of poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0032318712466762">Feeny, 2003</xref>). The Southern Highlands is particularly resource rich, and this has been seen as a factor contributing to high rates of conflict in the region. According to Reilly, the Southern and Eastern Highlands also have the highest ethnic fragmentation and the most intense clan rivalries. Such rivalries are further exacerbated by electoral politics and competition for resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0032318712466762">Reilly, 2008</xref>). It has been claimed that there is a strong linkage between ethnic fragmentation and development, with areas with the highest fragmentation (and arguably lower social capital) suffering from the lowest development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0032318712466762">Reilly and Phillpot, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0032318712466762">
<title>Language</title>
<p>More than 830 languages are spoken in PNG and over 40 language groups can be found in each of its 20 provinces, including the National Capital District. These language groups can themselves be even further divided into distinct clans and tribes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0032318712466762">Reilly, 2008</xref>). In a country of exceptional linguistic diversity, official language policy became a critical element of national identity and nation-building projects after independence. Alongside English (adopted at independence as the official language of government and the education system), the co-official language of Tok Pisin is widely used and accepted as a lingua franca. This contrasts with, for example, the neighbouring Solomon Islands, where Pidgin has only relatively recently been accepted by elites as a common language. Language policy in PNG has nonetheless been highly contested in certain areas. There has been considerable debate, for example, over the use of English or local languages in early education. Some have even argued that the use of English in schools effectively meant that students leave school without becoming literate in any language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0032318712466762">Moody, 1992</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0032318712466762">
<title>Politics</title>
<p>One of the most fundamental elements of ‘nation making’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0032318712466762">Foster, 1995</xref>) lies in building popular confidence in state institutions and fostering state legitimacy. There are serious challenges to this in PNG. The primary challenge is undoubtedly the diverse and segmented nature of Papua New Guinean society, with communities constituted at sub-national and traditional levels having primacy in popular understandings of political order, and even of service delivery. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0032318712466762">Scott (2005</xref>) notes, taking better account of the reality of traditional modes of local governance is the central challenge of building, from the ground up, the state and nation. However, PNG’s poor record of governance cannot be solely attributed to geography and ethno-lingusitic diversity. A lack of political will by successive governments to undertake necessary reforms has equally hampered measures to build confidence in public institutions and enhance state legitimacy.</p>
<p>Traditional clan-based social structures have had particular impact on political representation. Every national government since independence has been a coalition, with none lasting a full parliamentary term, until Sir Michael Somare’s 2002−7 government. The electoral system means members of parliament (MPs) are often elected to government with very low levels of support: the 1997 election, for example, saw 15 MPs elected with less than 10 per cent of the vote each, including three candidates who won their seats with less than 7 per cent of the vote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0032318712466762">Reilly, 2002</xref>). There are few, if any, policy differences between candidates and parties, with elections fought along the lines of personalities, local issues, and of course patronage. The ‘purchase’ of votes through electoral development funds contributes greatly to localism over nationalism. At provincial and local levels independents dominate, reducing the scope for ‘national’ programmes to be mediated and coordinated through national party mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0032318712466762">Jacobsen, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The Organic Law on the Integrity of Political Parties and Candidates (OLIPPAC) (2001) contained measures deterring MPs from switching party allegiance after elections and required the Governor General to give the largest party first opportunity to form a government. Further, a limited preferential vote system (LPV) was adopted nationally for the 2007 elections. These have the potential to reduce the fragmented nature of the political system. However, while there was some continuity under the uncontested term of Michael Somare from 2002 to 2007 there was, arguably, little corresponding stability in politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0032318712466762">Ladley and Williams, 2007</xref>). The PNG Supreme Court ruling in July 2010 that some sections of the OLIPPAC were inconsistent with the constitution and the constitutional crisis in 2011−12 reinforced this assessment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0032318712466762">Fraenkel (2004</xref>) outlines a number of reasons why LPV is unlikely to make a significant impact on politics and political campaigning in PNG.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, fragmentation offers some advantages, as no single group can gain dominance over the political system. Equally, many have noted that unlike many governments in the region, PNG has had almost 40 years of continuous democratic elections at the national level, and numerous peaceful changes of executive power. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0032318712466762">Standish (2007</xref>) notes, however, democracy means much more than the regular holding of free and fair elections. Governmental instability is a major impediment to development, continuity and planning in PNG. With narrow bases of support and typically insecure tenure (at every election since independence, slightly more than half the MPs have lost their seats) parties tend to focus on short-term strategies and the fulfilment of patronage obligations to their power base in their clans and <italic>wantoks </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0032318712466762">May, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0032318712466762">
<title>Government effectiveness</title>
<p>Lack of government effectiveness has been reflected in declining levels of economic development and service delivery in many areas, including health and education. Service delivery has been in steady decline since the late 1980s and in many rural areas it has all but collapsed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0032318712466762">World Bank, 2009</xref>), with churches, rather than the state, assuming responsibility for services such as health and education (although they are often funded by the state). Lack of an effective state presence in many areas undermines nation-building agendas. As Jacobsen argues, ideologies alone do not make the nation-state: ‘The actual implementation and entrenchment of governmental institutions, both political and administrative, have to be taken into account. They must be the primary bearers of the national framework, if the nation is to have any continuity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0032318712466762">Jacobsen, 1997</xref>: 227).</p>
<p>The absence of effective formal government can also have the effect of reinforcing traditional social structures and patronage networks as effective means of securing the delivery of services, resulting in what one author described as a process of ‘re-tribalization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0032318712466762">Scott, 2005</xref>: 48). This is particularly the case with access to resource royalties, where traditional landowning groups have formed incorporated land groups to negotiate with resource companies. Often this has had the effect of entrenching tribal boundaries and fuelling inter-tribal conflict. If the state cannot distribute wealth equally, then kinship and <italic>wantok </italic>networks become the best form of social security.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is reinforced by the focus group findings of this study. A number of participants claimed that lack of government effectiveness has generated a self-help culture: ‘people are forming their own associations and saying, well, if the government is not helping us, let us help ourselves … people are losing confidence and trust and coming up with their own solutions’.</p>
<p>Focus group participants also asserted that this lack of effectiveness was leading to a re-emphasis on regionalism and a strengthening of demands for autonomy. As one said, ‘Morobe province will be the next one to demand autonomy as resource owners want a greater share from the government … Morobe is a country on its own; we have the resources and we have the academics; we have our own culture and identity’ (focus group, National Research Institute, Port Moresby, 2 October 2009).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0032318712466762">
<title>Law and order</title>
<p>Another area where a declining state presence has necessitated a renewed recourse to traditional forms of organization is justice and security. Crime has become a major problem in the capital, Port Moresby, and increasingly in regional centres such as Lae and Mt Hagen. One 2007 study of the National Capital District found that, since 2004, the number of households to have experienced at least one crime remained at an alarming constant level of between 57 per cent to 67 per cent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0032318712466762">Justice Advisory Group, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>For a variety of reasons, including poor resources, staffing, lack of training and good management, formal policing and justice services are largely inaccessible to most people, who continue to resolve issues through traditional, customary means of dispute resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0032318712466762">Dinnen, 2004</xref>). Below, we examine tertiary students’ attitudes to their preferred forum for different types of dispute resolution. In the context of the tensions between traditional and modern modes, these ‘popular’ perceptions are critical indicators of where a ‘practical’ sense of political community actually lies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0032318712466762">
<title>Religion</title>
<p>Another important social institution to fill the gaps left by the state is the church. While not established as an official or state religion, a pledge to Christian principles is inscribed in the Papua New Guinean Constitution. Through a diverse array of denominations churches play an integral and fundamental role in the lives of many. Services such as schools and health clinics, normally provided by governments, continue to be supplied by church missions. According to one source, churches provide some 49 per cent of rural health services, for example, and all community health worker training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0032318712466762">Leke, 2003</xref>). The role of churches in education is also critical. Churches operate almost the same number of schools as the government, in addition to two universities and a multitude of theological colleges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0032318712466762">Leke, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Survey and methodology</title>
<p>This paper utilizes a unique dataset based on tertiary student survey responses. Surveys were conducted on the campuses of the University of Papua New Guinea (UPNG) in Port Moresby in September 2009. The survey tool uses some questions from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0032318712466762">4</xref></sup> module on national identity (with permission), modified for use under local conditions, in combination with additional questions reflecting the local conditions, customs and geographies of PNG. Surveys were conducted in English (the teaching language of UPNG) and all respondents were surveyed anonymously. All respondents (<italic>n</italic> = 308) were tertiary students at UPNG and 18 years old or over. Questions fell into three broad categories: those addressing the respondents’ gender, age, province of origin and self-identified language proficiencies; the (modified) core questions from the ISSP examining attitudes towards the relative importance of particular indicators of national identity, strength of affiliations to different levels of political community, national pride and group loyalty indicators; and, third, additional questions addressing issues of media preferences for language and preferences for agents of dispute resolution in differing circumstances. Together, these survey questions seek to provide insight into the attitudes of a (likely) future PNG elite.</p>

<title>Gender, region and language proficiency breakdowns </title>
<p>This paper examines whether views of national identity differ across certain groups within PNG. How different social groups can have different attitudes towards national identity is best understood through social identity theory (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0032318712466762">Billig and Tajfel, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0032318712466762">Taifel and Turner, 1986</xref>). In essence, social identity is the identity an individual acquires as a member of a particular social group. Social identity can be used to explain intergroup behaviour. Attitudes towards national identity can therefore be influenced through common experiences of language, gender and of place (for example). There appears to be surprising little research that explicitly links group and national identity. Exceptions include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0032318712466762">Bloom (1990</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0032318712466762">Robinson (2011)</xref>.</p>
<p>Survey responses were analysed to examine any significant associations with gender, region of origin or language proficiency. All could potentially be important in explaining variation in attitudes towards national identity in PNG. It is postulated that the marginalization of and discrimination against women in PNG society might lead to them having a weaker sense of national identity. Further, geographical region might impact on attitudes towards national identity although it is not always clear how. For example, the PNG islands have had a history of secessionist sentiment and therefore might have a correspondingly weaker sense of nationalism. Further, the lower human development indicators prevailing in the Highlands and Momase regions are likely to reflect poorer access to infrastructure and service delivery: factors which may hamper the development of strong identifications with the nation sense of national identity. Moreover, the major mining developments in some regions have often led to land disputes, accentuated ethnic divisions and strengthened calls for separatism (factors in both the Bougainville conflict and the emergence of Hela and Jiwaka as two new provinces). It is also postulated that Papua New Guineans who are proficient in Tok Pisin might possess a greater sense of national identity. Despite the Australian administration’s desire for English to become the lingua franca of PNG, the closure of some local language schools following the Second World War led to the widespread adoption of Tok Pisin, potentially promoting a sense of national identity among those who speak it.</p>
<p>Survey responses were therefore cross-tabulated with these variables and Pearson’s chi-squared statistic was used to identify any statistically significant differences across respondent categories. The small number of respondents from some individual provinces meant provinces were aggregated into the four distinct geographical regions of PNG: Papua, Highlands, Momase and the Islands.</p>
<p>Among other things, the national identity indicators indicators allow the researcher to assess relative degrees of affiliation to traditional and modern political communities; and to local, sub-national or national communities. As noted, findings can be correlated with subject information to assess the way gender, province of origin, or language proficiency impacts on these responses. Equally, this methodology allows the researcher to investigate the extent to which institutionalized policies, collective mythologies and public discourses about national identity are reflected in the attitudes and beliefs of ‘ordinary people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0032318712466762">Jones and Smith, 2001</xref>). Some multivariate analysis is also conducted to complement this methodology.</p>

<title>Analysis and discussion</title>
<p>Surveyors obtained a broadly representative sample of tertiary student respondents: 60 per cent were male, approximately three-quarters were under 25, the vast majority were undergraduates and their home provinces included all 20 provinces of PNG (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0032318712466762">Appendix Table A1</xref> for details).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0032318712466762">Table 1</xref> provides the self-identified language proficiencies of the respondents. Respondents are more likely to be fluent in Tok Pisin than the other official languages of PNG, although the vast majority of respondents are either ‘fluent’ or have ‘moderate’ proficiency in both Tok Pisin and English. Most respondents do not speak Hiri Motu, reflecting the localized nature of the language. Speakers of Hiri Motu are concentrated in the Papua provinces of Gulf and Central, as well as the National Capital District.</p>

<title>Responses to political community questions</title>
<p>The survey asked respondents to identify how close they feel to various levels of sub-national, national and supranational political community. Responses in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0032318712466762">Table 2</xref> indicate the relative strength of village and national affiliations, when compared with other sub-national and supranational affiliations. Almost 90 per cent of respondents felt ‘very close’ or ‘close’ to PNG, and 87 per cent felt the same towards their home settlement or village, with considerably lower levels of affiliation reported for intervening sub-national categories. Supranational affiliations among PNG students were understandably lower again. The findings also demonstrate the relative strength of pan-Melanesian identification: while 69 per cent of respondents felt ‘very close’ or ‘close’ to Melanesia, just 55 per cent felt the same way towards the ‘Pacific region’ more broadly. This suggests that cultural ideologies of the ‘Melanesian way’ articulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0032318712466762">Narokobi (1983</xref>) and others enjoy some considerable popular support among future elites.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0032318712466762">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>Strong differences in attitudes towards national identity are found across the geographic regions of PNG. One critical finding related to feelings of closeness to PNG, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0032318712466762">Table 3</xref>, where 70 per cent of respondents from Papua, Momase and the Highlands reported feeling ‘very close’ to PNG. This figure dropped substantially for respondents from the Islands region (56.4 per cent ‘very close’). As well as bearing out well-known separatist trends in parts of the Islands region, this finding perhaps reaffirms Hawksley’s claim that acceptance of the state in Papua New Guinea is heavily influenced by length of exposure to European rule, with the most fractious regions such as the Islands having the longest exposure and the Highlands having the least (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0032318712466762">Hawksley, 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>There was also a significant gender difference in respondents' feelings of closeness to their village, with 69 per cent of men feeling ‘very close’ to their village compared with 56 per cent for women. There is a range of possible reasons for this: one could certainly be women’s exclusion from traditional power structures and decision making. One of the women in the focus group remarked that in her village women are forbidden to speak at public gatherings, which she felt was a situation experienced by women in many other parts of PNG. Widespread domestic violence could also be a factor in women feeling less close to their family base.</p>
<p>The finding on pan-Melanesian affilition, above, was further supported by PNG students’ feelings of closeness to other countries, presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0032318712466762">Table 4</xref>. Respondents reported a comparatively high degree of closeness to the most proximate Melanesian countries and regions of West Papua (Irian Jaya) and the Solomon Islands, with lower responses for Vanuatu, Fiji and New Caledonia. In general, respondents did not feel close to other countries in Asia and the Pacific, with the exception of Australia and New Zealand, rated first and third respectively in terms of feeling ‘very close’. Interestingly, survey respondents feel closer to Australia than they do to other Melanesian countries. Two-thirds of respondents felt ‘very close’ or ‘close’ to Australia and 46 per cent felt the same towards New Zealand, a proportion comparable to feelings of closeness to the Solomon Islands.</p>

<p>Findings reveal the comparable strength of importance of ‘modern’ indicators − such as respect for political institutions and law (78.1 per cent believed this was ‘very important’ to being ‘truly’ Papua New Guinean) − and more ‘traditional’ notions of political community, such as respect for <italic>kastom</italic> (79.8 per cent). This finding suggests student attitudes to national identity broadly support the characterization of contemporary Melanesian nationalism as a ‘neo-traditionalist’ model − one that seeks to ideologically wed ‘essentialist’ views of traditional indigenous life to a Western model of the ‘modern’ nation-state, under the ideological rubric of ‘PNG ways’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0032318712466762">Jacobsen, 1997</xref>: 234−5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0032318712466762">Geertz, 1973</xref>). This theme is reinforced by students’ preferences for agents of dispute resolution, discussed below. It is also consistent with research suggesting that people are able to maintain and navigate multiple identities simultaneously rather than having to choose one over another (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0032318712466762">Knauft, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0032318712466762">Ewing, 1998</xref>)</p>
<p>‘Being a Christian’ was also found to be very important to being ‘truly Papua New Guinean’ (74.8 per cent), reflecting the influence of long-term and intensive missionary activity but also the integral role of the church in service delivery, particularly in the vital areas of education and health. The 2000 census indicated that 96 per cent of the population were members of a Christian church and combined Christianity with their indigenous beliefs. The most prevalent denominations are Roman Catholic and Evangelical Lutheran. Focus group respondents reported membership of a multitude of minor churches, reflecting the increasing penetration of small evangelist Pentecostal and other Christian sects throughout the Pacific over the last decade (Focus Group, Port Moresby, 2009).</p>
<p>Despite the evident importance of Christianity to perceptions of national identity, it is revealing that ‘respect for tradition and <italic>kastom</italic>’ exceeded this indicator by some 5 per cent as a perceived attribute of being ‘truly’ Papua New Guinean (79.8 per cent). As one focus group participant said, while traditional culture remains strong, Christianity is popularly taken to reinforce traditional belief systems, rather than supplant them. ‘Christianity is like a string that is tying all that; you love your brother like you love yourself, just like the <italic>wantok </italic>system’ (Focus Group, Port Moresby, 2009).</p>
<p>Of the three official languages, ‘being able to speak Hiri Motu’ was viewed as substantially less important to being ‘truly’ Papua New Guinean than speaking Tok Pisin or English. Further, and perhaps reflecting the position of English as the language of formal education, a clear preference for the importance of being able to speak English (70.7 per cent very important) over Tok Pisin (56.7 per cent) was evident among tertiary students, despite reporting greater overall proficiency in the latter.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, respondents’ language <italic>proficiency</italic> in Tok Pisin was a positively associated predictor of their attitude to the <italic>importance</italic> of speaking Tok Pisin as a measure of being ‘truly’ Papua New Guinean. By contrast, attitudes to the ‘importance’ of English bore no significant relationship to reported English language proficiency. Accordingly, less fluent English speakers were just as likely to regard English as important, perhaps indicating its role as a status language in education and formal sector employment.</p>

<sec id="section14-0032318712466762">
<title>Responses to dispute resolution questions</title>
<p>The complex relationship between traditional and modern understandings of political community is also evident in the set of questions concerning preferences for dispute resolution. Depending on the nature of the conflict, students’ responses varied between traditional and modern domains. Reflecting the customary nature of land tenure in most of PNG, responses to the question of ‘who should resolve disputes over land’ revealed that 59 per cent favoured customary leaders and chiefs, whereas 20 per cent felt the national government should resolve land disputes, and 15 per cent favoured local government. This, perhaps, reflects the continued currency of land courts, employing a hybrid of informal and formal law (although their efficiency and authority varies from province to province) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0032318712466762">Cooter, 1991</xref>). Village courts provide another source of hybrid justice. Introduced at the end of the colonial period in 1973, they are still widely used, and despite some drawbacks provide an important bridge to what many see as a corrupt and inaccessible formal legal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0032318712466762">Dinnen, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In the case of ‘disputes between neighbours’, responses were more evenly divided, with 45 per cent of respondents selecting national police, as opposed to 40 per cent favouring customary leaders and chiefs, with a smaller but significant minority (15 per cent) favouring the church as the preferred agent of dispute resolution.</p>
<p>Finally, in the case of both crimes against the person and crimes against property, large majorities favoured the national police as the preferred means of dispute resolution (95 per cent and 93 per cent respectively). While the record of the inefficient and under-resourced PNG constabulary is much derided, it is perhaps preferable to customary authorities who may be compromised, for example, through involvement in inter-clan fighting. However, there have certainly been many cases where the police themselves are involved in clan fighting and violent crime. This finding clearly suggests that the formal idea of ‘crimes’ against individuals is associated with the modern state and legal system, where more traditional domains are considered the appropriate means of negotiating collective issues that affect and disrupt kinship groups. Certainly the findings demonstrate the notion of a ‘hybridized’ and flexible conception of political community, with overlapping spheres, depending on the circumstance.</p>

<sec id="section15-0032318712466762">
<title>Responses to group identification question</title>
<p>Respondents were asked to rank the top three groups with which they identified most strongly. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0032318712466762">Table 6</xref> rank-orders the first-preference responses as ‘most important’. The table demonstrates the importance, in order, of family, religion and occupation (as students) to Papua New Guinean tertiary students. These responses demonstrate the relative weakness of ‘nationalist’ as a primary category of self-identity among tertiary students. Government pressure and a new generation of less socially conscious students have reduced interest in national affairs or activism. Focus group participants reported that there had once been nationalist groups, like the ‘Kumul Foundation’, and student discussion groups, but they were no longer active (Focus Group, Port Moresby, 2009).</p>

<title>National pride indicators</title>
<p>A further set of survey questions asked respondents about their level of national pride in relation to various aspects of PNG politics, history and culture. Responses are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0032318712466762">Table 7</xref>. PNG’s distinctive culture was revealed to be the most important object of national pride, with 82 per cent of respondents ‘very proud’. Papua New Guinea’s history is also an important source of national pride. It is instructive to compare these two results to Timor-Leste, a nation with a popular independence movement, which saw tertiary students give stronger priority to pride in national history, over culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0032318712466762">Leach, 2008</xref>). In the case of PNG, the findings reflect the focus of nation-builders on national culture as the most unifying theme of PNG nationalism, and help explain the emphasis of political elites on related concepts such as the ‘Papua New Guinean ways’ or the ‘Melanesian way’. As is evident below, however, the priority of culture is a double-edged sword in the context of PNG’s profound cultural diversity, with culture remaining strongly associated with sub-national and local – rather than national – political communities. Strikingly, only about half of the respondents were ‘very proud’ or ‘fairly proud’ of the way PNG’s democracy works, or of PNG’s fair and equal treatment of all groups in society.</p>

<p>A regional breakdown, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0032318712466762">Tables 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0032318712466762">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0032318712466762">10</xref> above, produces some interesting results: respondents from the Papua region, for example, were far less proud of ‘the way democracy works’ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0032318712466762">Table 8</xref>) and PNG’s ‘fair and equal treatment of all groups in society’ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0032318712466762">Table 10</xref>), particularly relative to respondents from the Highlands. This interesting finding suggests that popular disaffection with modern democracy in PNG is most evident in the region dominated by key institutions of the state and the capital city. Moreover, Port Moresby is dominant as the country’s ethnic melting pot and gateway to the outside world. Alternatively, this may be a reflection of the numerical domination of parliament by the more highly populated Highlands and Sepik regions. However, respondents from Papuan provinces expressed higher degrees of pride in PNG’s history (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0032318712466762">Table 9</xref>), perhaps suggesting that the Papua region may also be the home of a pan-regional or ‘national’ sense of PNG identity.</p>

<p>Female students were significantly less proud of PNG’s ‘fair and equal treatment of all groups in society’, at 39 per cent, relative to male respondents at 47 per cent. This is perhaps unsurprising, considering the subordinate role of women in PNG society. Apart from alarmingly high levels of gender-based violence, women also face discrimination at nearly all levels of political and social life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0032318712466762">AusAID, 2008</xref>). One female focus group respondent complained, ‘Although there are some regional variations, in my culture, women can’t speak at public functions and gatherings’ (Focus Group, Port Moresby, 2009). As the 2006 Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) report on PNG’s compliance with CEDAW provisions states, ‘Women in PNG do not enjoy equality in relation to the ownership, administration, enjoyment and disposition of property since land tenure is based on custom, leaving men in control of many aspects of land and property’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0032318712466762">UNIFEM, 2007</xref>: 282). In recent years there have been a number of attempts to reserve seats for women in PNG’s parliament. Although these attempts have been unsuccessful, a record three women won seats in the 2012 election.</p>
<p>While culture was found to be the key object of national pride, the idea of culture nonetheless remains firmly associated with local, rather than national, communities, with 71.5 per cent of respondents saying it is better if groups maintain their distinct languages, customs and traditions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0032318712466762">Table 11</xref>). Reflecting a view widely noted in the qualitative literature, the findings suggest the theme of culture is a popular one for PNG leaders, but mixed in its impact, with a tendency to reinforce the integrity of local cultures rather than promote a nation-building agenda.<xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0032318712466762"/>

</table-wrap> Nearly three-quarters of the sample felt this way, which reinforces the view that localized understandings of culture represent a prime constraint on building a ‘national’ identity in PNG. It is certainly clear that culture is not particularly amenable to expression as a ‘national’ category of identity in PNG.</p>
<p>While this pattern does not preclude a ‘unity in diversity’ model of cultural nationalism at the ideological level, the failure to incorporate highly resilient local political communities at the level of sub-national governance structures can lead to other dysfunctions in nation-building. Cultural ‘pluralism without representation’ may lead to communities becoming ‘elusive, inward looking and disaffected’, or to the creation of a range of ‘institutional hybrids’ which undermine nation-building, or even to a slow process of ‘national disintegration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0032318712466762">Jacobsen, 1997</xref>: 242).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0032318712466762">7</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Regional breakdown of these results, shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0032318712466762">Table 12</xref>, also reveals distinct differences across PNG: the Papua region is the bastion of such ‘integrationist’ sentiment as does exist, with 37 per cent of respondents agreeing it is better if different ethnic groups ‘adapt and blend into one society’ (compared with Highlands: 32 per cent; Islands: 27 per cent; and Momase: 17 per cent). This indicates the relative presence in the ‘capital’ region of a national-integrative sentiment, compared to the three more outlying regions. Promoting a greater sense of national identity might, therefore, prove an easier task in the southern part of PNG, relative to other regions.</p>

<p>Despite these findings, responses in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table13-0032318712466762">Table 13</xref> indicate that 73 per cent of respondents strongly agreed that ‘people should put the national interest ahead of their <italic>wantoks</italic>’. Cross-tab analysis revealed some interesting insights. For example, the responses provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table14-0032318712466762">Table 14</xref> indicate that there is a clear gender division in attitudes towards whether ‘people should put their national interest ahead of their <italic>wantoks</italic>’. Men were more likely than women to indicate that national interest should take precedence. Over 80 per cent of male students strongly agreed with the statement, compared to 62 per cent of female respondents. One possible reason for this is that women in PNG face considerable discrimination in the formal sector, hindering them from obtaining credit and loans, which may be more easily accessed through <italic>wantok</italic> networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0032318712466762">UNIFEM, 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>In recent years there have been increasing rates of crime and law-and-order problems in the major urban centres of Port Moresby, Lae and Mount Hagen. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table13-0032318712466762">Table 13</xref> indicates that a high 60 per cent of respondents strongly agree with the statement that ‘people moving to cities and towns causes social problems’. However, support for the statement, ‘people should stay in the area in which they grew up’, is far weaker, suggesting that while respondents may view such social problems as serious, they nonetheless regard freedom of movement as a prevailing liberty for citizens, particularly in their search for employment and/or education.</p>
<p>The data also allows for some exploratory multivariate analysis to be undertaken concerning some of the key questions on attitudes towards national identity. These questions and statements included: (i) How close do you feel to Papua New Guinea?; and (ii) People should put the national interest ahead of their <italic>wantoks</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0032318712466762">8</xref></sup> This mode of analysis is able to isolate the impact of particular variables while controlling for other factors.</p>
<p>Given the ordinal nature of the responses to these questions, an ordered probit is used to estimate the model. Explanatory variables include the region of the country that the respondent is from, Tok Pisin and English language proficiency, and the gender and age of the respondent. Given the ordinal nature of all the variables in the model, results should be taken as indicative. Results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table15-0032318712466762">Table 15</xref>. Column 1 provides the results from using the response to the question on how close respondents feel to PNG. They indicate that tertiary students from Papua, Momase and the Highlands all feel closer to PNG than respondents from the Islands (the omitted region category). Other findings indicate that respondents who are more proficient in Tok Pisin are more likely to feel closer to PNG, as are younger respondents.</p>

<title>Conclusion and implications for nation-building</title>
<p>One of the primary tasks of nation-building elites is to ‘create a collective “we”, a national identity … to coordinate an otherwise culturally heterogeneous national hinterland’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0032318712466762">Jacobsen, 1997</xref>: 234) to prevent the emergence of other competing nationalisms. Clearly, in PNG, as the continuing history of regional autonomy and separatist movements demonstrates, this task remains a major challenge. Importantly, the ongoing strength of kin and traditional loyalties militate against these ‘nation-making’ tasks in both the ideological and political/administrative realms. This pattern is reinforced by the ongoing dominance of subsistence economies with a high degree of autonomy in rural areas.</p>
<p>Nation-building in PNG poses therefore considerable challenges. Where national sentiment is more prominent, it is generally considered to be restricted to urban enclaves. For this reason, tertiary students in the national capital represent an important test case: they are more likely than the general population to represent an ‘advance guard’ of these ‘national’ identities, and equally to exhibit a higher degree of integration into the political, economic (and formal educational-linguistic) life of the nation-state. It is also true that this group offers an important guide to attitudes of a young educated elite, likely to feature strongly in the next generation of leaders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0032318712466762">9</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>It is therefore especially significant that responses from PNG tertiary students confirmed the strong importance of maintaining local identities and languages and respecting tradition and <italic>kastom </italic>in their visions of national identity and political community. The continued strength of traditional beliefs, languages and the primacy of family networks can be viewed in a positive light, demonstrating strong social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0032318712466762">De Renzio, 2000</xref>) within local groups, an important source of ‘resilience’ in times of crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0032318712466762">Brown, 2007</xref>). Of course, as others note, extreme ethnic fragmentation militates against the development of national cohesion and development outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0032318712466762">Reilly and Phillpot, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Of particular significance in the findings is the importance of region of origin in determining key attitudes to national identity. Compared with the other regions, respondents from the Islands region were significantly less likely to report feelings of ‘closeness’ to PNG. Significantly, the survey also found that respondents from the Papua region were significantly less proud of ‘the way democracy works’, and less proud of PNG’s ‘fair and equal treatment of all groups in society’, while respondents from the Highlands expressed higher degrees of pride in these factors.</p>
<p>While culture was found to be the key object of national pride among respondents, the idea of culture nonetheless remains firmly associated with local, rather than national, communities, with 71 per cent believing that ‘it is better if groups maintain their distinct languages, customs and traditions’. Significantly, the Papua region was the largest bastion of ‘integrationist’ sentiment (37 per cent agreeing ‘groups should adapt/blend into one society’), and similarly reported the highest degrees of pride in national history. This finding suggests that the Papua region is more integrated around a ‘national’ concept of political community than other regions.</p>
<p>Gender also emerged as an important factor, with women feeling significantly less close to their village, and reporting lower degrees of pride in the ‘fair and equal treatment of all groups in society’. It was also notable that significantly fewer women agreed with the idea that people should put the national interest ahead of their <italic>wantoks</italic>. Taken together, these findings suggest strongly that women feel more disaffection with, and discrimination under, the formal mechanisms of national state power and traditional governance at the local level.</p>
<p>Yet despite strong family affiliations, survey findings also highlighted an aversion to ‘wantokism’ and the manner in which it distorts the distribution of resources at the formal level of the state. These findings were highlighted in focus group discussions, with students expressing strong disapproval of politicians and bureaucrats serving their <italic>wantoks</italic> before the national community as a whole. As a consequence, they spoke of increased reliance on traditional groupings for access to scarce resources, perhaps confirming Scott’s (2005) contention that the weakness of the state is a cause, rather than an effect, of the comparative weakness of national sentiment. Focus group participants also stated that ethnic group was an irrelevant consideration in their preferences for leaders, with impartiality, capability and pragmatism the key markers of good leadership. However, in the absence of such leadership (and, for women, the serious barriers to participation in the formal sector), the family was considered the only viable alternative source of securing social support. As one participant put it: ‘My family is my strength, but my weakness as a nation’.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note that technology is now having an important impact in PNG and the roles that civil society and politicians play in nation-building. In recent years there has been a large increase in the use of mobile phones, the internet and social media platforms which has facilitated political protests and campaigns from civil society. This was particularly evident during the 2011−12 constitutional crisis and the disputes between Peter O’Neill and Michael Somare. Outside criticism of PNG often led to online nationalist overtures in defence of PNG. Moreover, in the 2012 elections numerous political parties used websites and social media to engage with PNG’s rapidly increasing internet population. Technology is likely to play an increasingly important role in forming attitudes towards national identity in PNG.</p>

<p>This extreme and controversial initiative, referred to as the Enhanced Cooperation Programme (ECP), included the deployment of Australian Federal Police (AFP). Despite the PNG Supreme Court ruling in 2005 that immunities for AFP were in conflict with the PNG Constitution, Australian civil servants continue to be placed in PNG government ministries under the Strongim Gavman Programme (SGP), which means ‘strengthening’ or ‘empowering government’ in Tok Pisin. The SGP programme differs from the ECP by not including AFP personnel and by having a stronger capacity development focus.</p>

<p>A comparison of the findings for PNG with other countries is difficult due to (i) other studies often disaggregating their results by ethnic or migrant groups; (ii) the targeting of tertiary students in PNG rather than a random sample; (iii) the use of different measurement scales; and (iv) the tailoring of the ISSP’s questions to the PNG context. However, ISSP is open source and links to other studies can be found on their website (www.issp.org).</p>

<p>Responses to the first question are measured using a Likert scale with a value of 1 being ‘very close’ and 4 being ‘not close at all’. Responses to the second question are measured using a Likert scale with a value of 1 being ‘strongly agree’ and 4 being ‘strongly disagree’. A multivariate analysis of responses to ‘I would rather be a citizen of Papua New Guinea than any other’ failed to provide any statistically significant results.</p>

<p>Future research, including a follow-up survey of another cohort of students in five years' time, will be important in gauging any change in the attitudes to nation-building and national identity among potential leaders in PNG.</p>
