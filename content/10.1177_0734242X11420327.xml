<abstract>
<p>Metallurgical wastes – oxygen converter sludge, dust from cast iron production, lead matte, and slag from recycling of used lead batteries – were treated with <italic>Acidithiobacillus</italic> bacteria. Bacterial activity and adaptability on waste and some waste mixtures were investigated. <italic>Acidithiobacillus</italic> bacteria may easily attack oxygen converter sludge, lead matte and slag and affect the mobility of metals. Cast iron dust is not a suitable substrate for applied bacteria due to the absence of reduced sulfur and reduced iron in its mineralogical composition. Nevertheless, the pure culture was able to adapt to the mixture of this waste with slag. Disposal of these metallurgical wastes deserves special attention due to potential attack by microorganisms and consequent pH changes. According to subsequent release of hazardous substances to the environment, this phenomenon can lead to evident environmental risks.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Iron and non-ferrous metals production is closely associated with the output of solid metallurgical wastes (MW). These waste products, primarily dusts, fall into the ‘hazardous waste’ group due to high content of the potential toxic metals and because of the presence of low-melting metals which cannot be entirely reused in the metallurgical recycling. MW represents valuable metal concentrates, and micro-organisms may be applied for recycling and biorecovery of metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11420327">Bosecker, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11420327">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11420327">Brandl et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X11420327">Krebs et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X11420327">Seidel et al., 2001</xref>; Yang et al., 2008). Electrobioleaching or sonobioleaching are methods that may enhance the process kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11420327">Kumari et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734242X11420327">Swamy et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Thionic bacteria are mostly chemolithoautotrophic species, which oxidise elemental sulfur and reduced sulfur compounds to more soluble metal sulfates. The acidophilic species <italic>Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans</italic> (<italic>At. ferrooxidans</italic>) and <italic>Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans</italic> (<italic>At. thiooxidans</italic>) are of crucial importance. <italic>Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans</italic> also promotes the oxidation of ferrous to ferric iron. Bioleaching mechanisms and physiology of micro-organisms have been described in detail in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11420327">Hansford and Vargas, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X11420327">Kinzler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11420327">Lizama et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11420327">Luo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X11420327">Sand et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734242X11420327">Tributsch, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The presence of toxic metals (e.g. from mining) in sediments, soils and sludge samples presents an environmental problem resulting from the possibility of their transfer into aquatic media and absorption by vegetation. This is specifically true in regions with metallurgical activities with ponds for storage of waste matter from ore processing. Furthermore, waste dumps and mine tailings chemistry are to a large extent determined by microbial populations that propagate a vast array of biochemical reactions in the life-sustaining processes of respiration and metabolism. There are complex interactions between pollutants and microbes. In principle, microbial transformation of heavy metal salts, induced by a change of environmental conditions such as redox potential, may cause the so called ‘chemical time bombs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734242X11420327">Stigliani, 1991</xref>). From this point of view, evaluation of waste toxicity and/or stability on the basis of short-time leaching tests appears inadequate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11420327">Knight et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11420327">Nyombolo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X11420327">Seidlerova et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study experiments involving bacterial activity observation on selected MW types and their mixtures were performed. It has already been shown that a pure culture of acidophilic bacteria can be applied without acidification to lead and slag from the recycling of lead batteries (Fecko et al., 2004 Fecko et al, 2004 here BUT year is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11420327">2005</xref> in refs list - which is correct?; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11420327">Kristofova et al., 2001</xref>), but the bioleaching of these wastes in mixtures with another MW has not yet been performed.</p>
<p>In addition to the long-term bioleaching experiments (more than 50 days of exposure), two different tests were conducted on these MW samples: a simple batch test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11420327">EN 12457-2 (2002)</xref> and the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP; US EPA 1311; US EPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734242X11420327">1986</xref>)). These procedures are designed to determine the mobility of both organic and inorganic analytes present in liquid, solid, and multiphase wastes. The metal leachate concentrations were determined by means of atomic emission spectroscopy with inductively coupled plasma (AES-ICP).</p>

<title>Bacterial cultures and seed</title>
<p>The bacterial cultures of <italic>At. ferrooxidans</italic> (CCM 3973 ) and <italic>At. thiooxidans</italic> (CCM 3854) were obtained from the Czech Collection of Micro-organisms (Masaryk University, Czech Republic) and grown in standard conditions in 9K media by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X11420327">Silverman and Lundgren (1959)</xref> (<italic>At. ferrooxidans</italic>) and media by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734242X11420327">Waksman and Joffe (1922)</xref> (<italic>At. thiooxidans</italic>).</p>
<p>The inoculum of both strains was incubated in a rotary shaker at 180 rpm and 32 ± 0.5 °C. Bacterial growth was monitored by cell counts (Neubauer counting chamber) and pH measurement (titration measurement with standard NaOH using methyl orange indicator). As an inoculum for leaching tests, a 2 week bacterial culture in a late logarithmic phase of development with 6.1–7.8 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells mL<sup>−1</sup> for <italic>At. ferrooxidans</italic> (6.6–7.4 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells m L<sup>−1</sup> for <italic>At. thiooxidans</italic> resp.) was applied.</p>

<sec id="section4-0734242X11420327">
<title>MW samples</title>
<p>The following MW were chosen for the experimental study of bacterial adaptation: oxygen converter sludge (OCS; sample from Vitkovice a.s., Ostrava, Czech Republic), dust from the cast iron production (CID; Slezsky kamen a.s., Jesenik), lead matte (LM), and slag (LS) from recycling of used lead batteries (both samples from Kovohute Pribram, a. s., Pribram, Czech Republic).</p>
<p>The OCS is oxidic waste from a filter press in a gas purification plant of an oxygen converter. The CID results from cast iron production as waste dust from electrostatic filters and also has an oxidic character. LM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11420327">Kusnierova et al., 2009</xref>) and LS originate from the shaft furnace for recasting of used batteries’ waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11420327">Fecko et al., 2011</xref>). LM has an oxidic and LS sulfidic character (for detail sample composition see also XRD data in Online Resource 1).</p>
<p>The OCS sample was dried due to its higher humidity and pulverized, while LM and LS samples were crushed and ground (to fraction of particles smaller than 0.071 mm). CID is a fine-grained sample and was used without further adjustment. MW samples were not neutralized before the leaching experiments.</p>
<p>The chemical composition of MW samples was obtained by standard AES-ICP (JY-24, Jobin Yvon, France) and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRFS; Spectro Xepos, SPECTRO Analytical Instruments GmbH, Germany) methods in the certified laboratory of the Nanotechnology Centre (VŠB–Technical University in Ostrava, Czech Republic) and is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X11420327">Table 1</xref>.

<p>The quantity of metallic and bivalent iron forms in the MW was determined by volumetric bichromatometric (K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) titration of Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions (acid environment, diphenylamine sulfonate indicator) and ferric iron was calculated with respect to the total content of iron. Sulfate sulfur was determined according to Czech Standard CSN 72 0117. Sulfide sulfur was calculated with regard to the total sulfur content (total sulfur was measured by means of XRFS). The content of carbonates was also analysed using <italic>ASTM D4373 – Standard Test Method for Rapid Determination of Carbonate Content of Soils</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11420327">ASTM, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Bioleaching tests</title>
<p>The pure cultures of <italic>At. ferrooxidans</italic> and <italic>At. thiooxidans</italic> were applied for initial bioleaching tests of MWs. From individual MW samples the following mixtures were prepared with the ratio of 1 : 1: OCS+CID, LM+CID, and LS+CID (70 g + 70 g of dry mass). OCS was also leached separately (140 g of dry mass).</p>
<p>Growth media without FeSO<sub>4</sub> and/or S<sup>0</sup> were used in the bioleaching experiments supposing that bacteria will utilize the reduced iron and sulfur form from the leached MW.</p>
<p>Bioleaching tests and abiotic control (with the same composition, but without bacterial culture) experiments were performed batch-wise in 2000 mL sterilized aerated glass flasks (140 g of MW sample, 250 mL of bacterial culture, 1200 mL of liquid media, distilled water to 2000 mL volume) placed in a water- circulating bath with a temperature kept in the range from 28 to 32 °C. The pH of the suspensions was maintained in the interval of 1.8–2.2 (5 mol L<sup>−1</sup> sulfuric acid). The duration time of all leaching tests was 50 days.</p>
<p>Mixtures OCS+CID, and LS+CID were leached with pure culture of <italic>At. ferrooxidans</italic> (250 mL). The mixed culture of <italic>At. ferrooxidans</italic> and <italic>At. thiooxidans</italic> (1 : 1; 125 mL + 125 mL) was applied to the mixture LM+CID.</p>

<p>The purpose of the simple batch test is to provide acceptance criteria for waste materials in a controlled site. In the present study, the European simple batch leaching test EN 12457-2 was conducted. It consisted of a single extraction with a liquid-to-solid ratio of 10 dm<sup>3</sup> kg<sup>−1</sup>. Contact leaching time was 24 h. The samples were stirred using a rotary shaker.</p>
<p>The toxicity characteristic leaching procedure of MW samples in extraction reagents (with lower pH) takes 24 h. After 18 h of dynamic leaching (with stirring) the suspension was kept idle for 6 h. The liquid-to-solid ratio was 20 dm<sup>3</sup> kg<sup>−1</sup>. For leachates separation, membrane filters with 0.45 µm pore size was used. The analysis of the metal concentrations in the leachates was carried out by means of AES-ICP.</p>

<p>According to analyte concentrations in the water extracts, CID, LM and LS were classified into the group ‘hazardous waste material’ whereas OCS was classified as the leachability class II.b. OCS originates from the wet cleaning of the flue gases and a substantial amount of the pollutants were mobilized into the waste water, which reflects the low metals leachability from the OCS in the leaching test. The results of TCLP show that OCS was classified in the group ‘hazardous waste’ as well.</p>

<p>To estimate the capability of <italic>Acidithiobacilli</italic> adaptation to particular MW, it is important to quantify sulfur forms in the waste material. It was confirmed that in the OCS and CID samples the sulfate content was equal to the total sulfur, whereas in LM and LS sulfur is bound predominantly in the sulfides.</p>
<p>Carbonate content in the MW may increase the pH in the environment which influences the activity of acidophiles, thus in order to keep in line with the physiological requirements of the bacteria, sulfuric acid should be added. Therefore, the total content of carbonates was analysed with the following results: 10% w/w in the OCS and 0.32% w/w in the CID. In the case of LM and LS, it was not possible to analyse carbonates by the method used above, due to the presence of sulfides. It was assumed that in the case of the OCS bioleaching, increasing pH will be a probable consequence of the high carbonates content.</p>

<p><italic>Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans</italic> became well adapted to the OCS (titration analyses results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11420327">Figure 2</xref>). The major part of ferrous iron was oxidized in the leach suspension after 15 days of a bioleaching experiment. In the case of the control experiment, a substantial decrease of Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions due to chemical oxidation in the leachate was observed 5 days later. An adaptation of the pure bacterial culture of <italic>At. ferrooxidans</italic> to the LS+CID MW mixture also occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X11420327">Figure 3</xref>). In the bacterial suspension ferrous iron concentration decreased after the 11th day of the experiment, and in the abiotic control 10 days later.</p>

<p>The Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions concentration in the OCS+CID mixture bioleachate increasd throughout the entire experiment.

<p>In the case of the LM+CID mixture (leached with mixed culture), the characteristic trend of the Fe<sup>2+</sup> biochemical oxidation kinetic curve was not obvious when compared with the abiotic control. This may indicate (as well as in the case of the OCS+CID mixture bioleaching) a problem with bacteria adaptation, probably as a consequence of the harsh environment in the leach suspension (redox-potential, toxic metals, organic components).</p>

The pure bacterial culture of <italic>At. ferrooxidans</italic> adapted easily during certain experimental conditions to the OCS sample and mixture of the LS+CID (10<sup>10</sup> cells mL<sup>−1</sup> after 50 days of leaching). Moreover, the MPN method indicated that in the OCS+CID suspension bacterial adaptation occurred after the 41st day of leaching (~ 8 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells mL<sup>−1</sup> were identified in the suspension). At the end of the experiment the number of cells had increased to ~ 17.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> in 1 mL of the leach suspension. As the experiments were terminated, the MPN results also revealed the active bacterial cells of <italic>At. ferrooxidans</italic> in the LM+CID leach suspension (35 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells mL<sup>−1</sup> in the leach suspension).</p>
<p>Bacterial adaptation in the leach suspension OCS+CID and LM+CID was verified by complementary experiment of complete growth media inoculation. Bacterial leach suspensions were filtered to eliminate contamination with Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions or other oxidizers before the inoculation. After 14 days of incubation the colour change due to bacterial oxidation of ferrous to ferric iron occurred in both leach suspensions.</p>

<p>Interestingly, a significant decrease of wustite and metallic iron occurred in the leaching residues of the OCS. In addition, secondary mineral phases of jarosite were precipitated. Jarosite precipitated during the leaching of the OCS, most likely as a mixture of hydronium and potassium jarosite. Basic compounds were solubilized and gypsum was formed during the leaching process.</p>
<p>In the case of the mixtures leaching, mineral phases with the ferrous iron content and/or sulfides were solubilized predominantly. However, an intensity decrease of primary mineral iron phases of the CID sample was also observed on the diffractograms. When comparing zinc yields and intensity of franklinite diffraction lines of this mineral after leaching with the input data, it may be assumed that there are some other forms of Zn present in the CID (probably ZnO).</p>
<p>The LM leaching led to the decomposition of sulfidic minerals troilite and galena. Elemental lead content decreased and its transformation to the stable lead sulfate phase was observed. In the leaching residues of the mixtures OCS+CID, and LM+CID the intensity of jarosite diffraction lines are lower when compared to OCS, and LS–CID (where the bacteria became well adapted). New mineral phases such as gypsum, lead sulfate, and jarosite were also detected from the comparison of the input and output morphology of the MW samples (complete RTG diffractograms are in Online Resource 2 for this article).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Experiment results show the apparent adaptation of the pure bacterial culture of <italic>At. ferrooxidans</italic> to the OCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11420327">Figure 2</xref>) and mixture LS+CID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X11420327">Figure 3</xref>). Although some of MW components may have a negative influence on the applied bacterial culture in higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11420327">Brandl et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11420327">Picher et al., 2002</xref>), any remarkable inhibition of the metabolic bacterial activity did not occur in the OCS and LS+CID bacterial suspensions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the CID in the mixture with the OCS or LM does not generate an appropriate environment for pure bacterial culture growth and reproduction during the leaching. Toxicants present in these MW samples or rather interactions between them (synergism) resulted in the inhibition of metabolic bacterial activity.</p>
<p>In the course of the bioleaching experiment with the OCS+CID, the concentration of the Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions was continually increasing; this fact may indicate a problem with bacterial cells adaptation to this MW mixture. Total iron content (ICP-AES) in this sample was similar to the ferrous iron content in the leachates. Interestingly, the difference of the Fe<sup>2+</sup> concentration between the bioleachate and abiotic control was detected from the 10th day of experiment (in the bioleachate solution it was approximately 2 g dm<sup>−3</sup> lower). This may indicate bacterial participation (and Fe<sup>3+</sup> production) at the beginning of the experiment.</p>
<p>The efficiency of bioleaching with pure bacterial strain <italic>At. ferrooxidans</italic> or with a mixed culture (<italic>At. ferrooxidans</italic> and <italic>At. thiooxidans</italic>) was roughly comparable with the leaching efficiency in the environment of sulfuric acid and culture media. It can be assumed that chemical processes were predominant and bacteria play a key role as their ‘catalyst’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11420327">Fecko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11420327">Lu et al., 2010</xref>). For instance, bacteria can participate in the regeneration of leaching agents (e.g. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, Fe<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>) and/or degrade chemically produced sulfur in the bioleachate solution.</p>
<p>It can be assumed from Fe<sup>2+</sup> titration results, that biological oxidation is not the only reaction that occurs during the bioleaching experiments. Iron auto-oxidation due to abiotic conditions should be taken into account. However, the influence of bacteria during the leaching can easily be distinguished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11420327">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X11420327">3</xref>).</p>
<p>The MPN method confirmed the results of the titration experiments. Moreover, it reported adaptation of bacteria to the mixtures of the CID+LM and CID+OCS, which occurred at the end of bioleaching experiments. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that these types of MW and their mixtures may became more suitable for bacterial adaptation during the waste disposal (due to time, weathering, acid rain: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X11420327">Ettler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0734242X11420327">Welham et al., 2000</xref>). On the other hand, the MPN method did not provide appreciable and accurate results, probably due to the particular kinds of MW as a substrate. That may cause related interactions, i.e. absorption of cells to the substrate surface. However, we decided to use MPN as a confirmative method with indicative results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X11420327">Solisio et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Mixing of different wastes seems to be worthwhile for the potential metal recycling of the metallurgical waste materials studied when one part serves as a substrate for applied micro-organisms and the second contains the recovered metals. The treatment with adapted bacterial strains to enhance metals yields from the MW is proposed for the future experimental run.</p>
<p><italic>In situ</italic> changes of deposited industrial wastes during their deposition are caused by exogenous and biogenous factors and initiated by common weathering processes that are significantly catalysed by biogenic parts of landfill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X11420327">Cui and Zhang, 2008</xref>). The experimental results permit the definition of bioleaching methods to be used (1) for the extraction of elements from waste, (2) elemental composition correction, (3) prediction of changes of deposited MW and its monitoring, and (4) pollutant risk assessment. Leaching yields of specific elements are remarkably different according to the leaching method and conditions used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X11420327">Table 2</xref>). The data also revealed a lack of arguments in favour of short-term leaching tests (especially water extract) due to their unnatural conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11420327">Knight et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11420327">Nyombolo et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In the course of the last 12 years, the Czech (later European) legislation for risk assessment of wastes has changed four times. Therefore, the classification of discussed wastes was different due to the particular law. The regulation from the year 2001 did not define the limit concentration for antimony in leachability group III. Therefore, sample LS could be classified into this group. According to the actual regulation valid since 2005 (and further amended in 2010), the limit concentration for antimony has already been stated and LS has been reclassified into the category ‘hazardous waste material’.</p>
<p>With regard to the sulfides and ferrous iron content (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X11420327">Table 1</xref>), samples LS and LM may be attacked (contaminated) by <italic>Acidithiobacilli</italic> during waste disposal. Although the OCS contains basic leachable compounds, it may become a suitable substrate for <italic>At. ferrooxidans</italic> over the course of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11420327">Schippers et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is potentially hazardous due to the high content of zinc and cadmium.</p>
<p>Generally, these waste materials should be evaluated not only with regard to the effect of exogenous factors. It is necessary to take into account the contamination of wastes by microbes, which may significantly affect the mobility of potentially toxic components. Special attention should be focused on landfills containing different waste mixtures and undefined unknown mining soils and dumps.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In the present study an adaptation capability of <italic>Acidithiobacillus</italic> bacterial strains for tested MW types and their mixtures was observed and confirmed. Experiments also included the successful performance of waste mixture usage, potentially promising for secondary raw metals recovery.</p>
<p>A comparison between different leaching procedures and long-term bioleaching experiments was performed and it was also shown that short-term leaching procedures are unsuitable and inaccurate for risk assessment of these MW types.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the present results warn against long-term landfill of different MW types and their mixtures due to the possibility of attack (contamination) of any micro-organisms that may be present and the subsequent release of hazardous substances to the environment.</p>
<p>Last but not least, an adaptation of <italic>Acidithiobacilli</italic> cells to the CID+OCS, CID+LM mixtures was observed towards the end of long-term bioleaching experiments.</p>
