<p>How else can we study religion in the twenty-first century? Ann Taves’ award-winning work meticulously offers tools for both the reconceptualization of categories and the implementation of methods for students and scholars in the academic study of religion. Nurturing scholarly inquiry across the natural sciences and humanities, her suggestions for further study demand interdisciplinary approaches by scholars as well as collaboration between them.</p>
<p>Why investigate experience? While religion has been studied by scholars in the natural sciences, experience per se has been largely neglected. Within religious studies, she claims, “religious experience” has been a misunderstood noun focused on Western subjects. Turning our gaze away from religious experience, Taves urges readers to approach experience with a wider lens, whereby experiences considered “religious” are treated alongside, not in isolation from, “psychobiological, social and cultural-linguistic” dimensions, which in turn would facilitate cross-cultural and cross-temporal research.</p>
<p>By focusing on the characteristics that people assign to phenomena, rather than the phenomena themselves, she contends that experience is a nexus through which scholars can study “religious” and non-religious phenomena, and therefore facilitate links between religious studies and other disciplines. Taves draws upon, but sets her<italic>ascription theory</italic> apart from,<italic>attribution theory</italic>, which takes as its object of study the ways in which people explain events.<italic>Singularization</italic>, as she uses it, describes the process whereby humans imbue phenomena as “special” and set them apart from other phenomena.<italic>Simple ascriptions</italic>, arising from the process of singularization, are the building blocks from which humans generate<italic>composite ascriptions</italic>, those composites which scholars have often labeled as “religions” and “spiritualities.”</p>
<p>Chapters 1 through 4 deal with the categories of religion, experience, explanation and comparison, respectively. Offering an alternative to the ways in which religion is studied, in Chapter 1, Taves suggests how we can utilize the ascription model for gauging what people deem special and how; for identifying characteristics of specialness; and for probing how simple ascriptions are integrated into composites. Focusing on ascriptions rather than phenomena themselves, she claims, allows for comparison between religious and non-religious phenomena that share those ascriptions. Chapter 2 features a conceptual dissection of “experience” as category. Drawing on scholarship in embodiment and theory of mind, Taves offers means by which scholars can navigate relationships between experience and representation. In the third chapter, Taves modifies existing frameworks to offer four levels of analysis to scholars investigating how and why people explain human behavior. Here, as throughout the book, she offers, by way of meta-cognitive description, diagrams and descriptive tables that act like templates, concrete means by which scholars can begin utilizing these analytical frameworks. Comparative methods used in experimental research design, she asserts in Chapter 4, can be extended for use in historical and ethnographic research to compare religious and non-religious ascriptions.</p>
<p>Conceptualizing “religion” as a composite of building blocks and highlighting how experience is only a subset of that composite, promises a framework applicable beyond the study of experience per se to other aspects (e.g. efficacious rituals, canonized texts, sacred institutions or exchanges with supernatural beings) in the broader study of religion. Moreover, Taves’ naturalistic focus on the “specialness” of phenomena invites possibilities beyond scholars’ preconceived notions about what does or does not constitute the objects of “religious” inquiry. Asking in what ways religion is a subset of things to which people imbue “specialness,” Taves asks us to redraw the ways we have collectively delimited our discipline.</p>
<p>By sharing her preliminary findings with regard to the marks of specialness and kinds of phenomena likely to be deemed special, Taves urges students and scholars to continue testing and refining her framework. The clarity with which she lays out, and supplements with concrete examples, the diversity of theoretical concepts here, along with the inclusion of detailed appendices and a glossary, may mitigate possible hesitations experienced by those unfamiliar with the jargon and diagrams from the natural sciences. While readers may find it necessary, for comprehension, to revisit some of its sections, the book offers a rich analytical and methodological toolbox for students and scholars exploring the diverse facets of what we call religion.</p>
