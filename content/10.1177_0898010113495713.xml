<abstract>
<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Spirituality is a mechanism that supports coping with chronic illnesses such as cancer, and has been frequently used in the African American (AA) population. Measures of spirituality are needed, which are culturally sensitive, appropriate, and psychometrically sound. <bold>Design:</bold> A critical literature review was performed to identify instruments measuring spirituality as a response to illness. <bold>Method:</bold> Whittemore and Knafl’s method was used to search pertinent databases for instrumentation assessing spirituality and its applicability in AA cancer survivors. <bold>Findings:</bold> In all, 13 research articles detailing nine instruments were obtained and included for analysis. Of the nine instruments, only two (Perspectives of Support From God Scale and Connections to God Scale) were psychometrically tested in populations of AAs who had completed primary treatment for their cancer. Cultural validity was tested in only the Perspectives of Support From God Scale, showing a deficit in the assessment of cultural appropriateness of these instruments to the population. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Further research is needed to confirm validity of these measures. Cognitive pretesting and assessment of cross-cultural validity can be used to ensure proper understanding of terminology and avoid potential biases. Repeated testing of the instrument in the desired population is necessary to confirm that constructs and items are understood and cognitively processed as intended.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent estimates indicate that there are more than 10 million cancer survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898010113495713">American Cancer Society, 2011</xref>) in the United States. African Americans (AAs) are recognized as a particularly vulnerable population that experience disparity in functional health after cancer, even after disease and treatment factors are controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010113495713">Aziz &amp; Rowland, 2002</xref>). The AA cancer survivor’s experience transitioning from active treatment to survivor is influenced by self-reported perceptions of a spiritual relationship with God (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010113495713">Bellury et al., 2011</xref>). Previous studies have noted that AAs have perceived their survival from cancer as a gift from God (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010113495713">Hamilton, Powe, Pallard, Lee, &amp; Felton, 2007</xref>) and that female cancer survivors reported “meaningful transformations and changes of a spiritual nature” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898010113495713">Lauver, 2007</xref>, p. 109), when transitioning from patient to survivor.</p>
<p>An increasing number of survivors incorporate spirituality into their available coping mechanisms as they work through treatment and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898010113495713">Levine, Yoo, Aviv, Ewing, &amp; Au, 2007</xref>); however, scant research exists addressing the role of spirituality in survivorship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010113495713">Bellury et al. (2011)</xref> acknowledge that there is a lack of research that looks specifically at the transition from patient to survivor in minority cancer survivors, and the effect that spirituality has on successful transition. Although a number of instruments have been developed that measure spirituality and its relationship on health, few have been psychometrically tested specifically to AAs with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898010113495713">Lewis, 2008</xref>). This integrative review’s purpose is to synthesize instrumentation that assesses spirituality in AA cancer survivors, driven by the research questions: <italic>What psychosocial instrumentation is published that measures the variable of spirituality as a response to illness, and have these instruments been validated in AA populations with cancer?</italic></p>
<sec id="section2-0898010113495713">
<title>Defining the Cancer Survivor</title>
<p>Cancer survivor is a concept that appears frequently in the literature, designating a person who has received cancer treatment and is in a postintervention phase. The concept differs across disciplines, professional and lay groups, and individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898010113495713">Chinn &amp; Kramer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898010113495713">Rendle, 1997</xref>). The National Coalition for Cancer Survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898010113495713">2011</xref>) proposes that from the time of diagnosis and through the end of life, a person diagnosed with cancer is a survivor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010113495713">Feuerstein (2007)</xref> argues that from the completion of primary treatment up to end of life, a person is a survivor. For the purpose of this project proposal, a cancer survivor will be operationally defined as a person who has completed primary treatment for his or her cancer.</p>
<p>Chronic stressors persist among long-term cancer survivors, distinct from survivors of other diseases or medical trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010113495713">Deimling, Bowman, Sterns, Wagner, &amp; Kahana, 2006</xref>). Cancer survivors report concerns about survival, fear of recurrence, along with the distress associated with continued monitoring and testing. As time passes, these fears are replaced by anxiety about the carcinogenic effects of radiation or chemotherapy or about being diagnosed with another cancer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0898010113495713">
<title>Defining Spirituality</title>
<p>A distinction between religion and spirituality is part of the operational definition of spirituality in this discussion. There are clear differences between the two concepts. Religion, per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0898010113495713">Visser, Garssen, and Vingerhoets (2010)</xref>, places spirituality within a certain context of practiced beliefs and traditions of a community; whereas spirituality refers to an individual’s perceptions of closeness to God or a higher being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898010113495713">Hill &amp; Pargament, 2003</xref>), a search for meaning, or an experience of the sacred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0898010113495713">Visser et al., 2010</xref>). Religious traditions, including prayer and rituals, are strategies that are utilized to find meaning and purpose in life. In essence, one could rely on spirituality at the cessation of treatment for cancer, without having to take part in religious traditions or commitments. Although a more inclusive definition of spirituality would include its religious aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010113495713">Burkhardt, 1989</xref>), this review seeks only to examine spirituality as a construct in itself, and thus instruments measuring religiosity will not be included.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898010113495713">Levine et al. (2007)</xref> acknowledged that ethnic differences and variations could affect the relationship of a person’s spirituality and its role in his or her health and coping. AAs are often able to rely on their faith in times of need and tend to be more spiritual than White women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010113495713">Aziz &amp; Rowland, 2002</xref>). Social support is essential for everyone during times of transition to survivorship; however, it is particularly lacking in AA populations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010113495713">Hamilton, Crandell, Carter, and Lynn (2010)</xref> found that older AA survivors must often navigate outside of traditional familial boundaries to find support. Due to fear of being stigmatized or socially isolated in their families and communities, they may be reluctant to communicate their needs to others. For AAs, the church can be this place of support, where they are able to have fellowship, education, expression, and communication with their peers, in addition to worship. AA women who valued their spirituality were found to have an increased self-esteem, have a more positive outlook, and engage more with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010113495713">Bellury et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Spirituality in AAs, for the purpose of this integrative review, is operationally defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898010113495713">Mattis (2000)</xref> as a “dynamic and interdependent process that involves an inward process leading to self-reflection, self-awareness, inner strength, emotional fortitude, centeredness, calm, self-criticism, and clarification of core values and beliefs” (p. 119). It is important to note that the measurement of spiritual coping is significantly different from the measurement of level of spirituality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010113495713">Hamilton et al., 2010</xref>). Instruments measuring spiritual coping and religiosity are excluded from the analysis, as described further in the Method section.</p>

<sec id="section4-0898010113495713">
<title>Cultural Validity</title>
<p>When an instrument is developed, all items should be sensitive to respondents specifically in the population. Language, diet, values, habits, traditions, and beliefs may have different meanings across cultures and ethnicities and can be interpreted differently within these populations. Ensuring that the meaning of the construct and other factors are retained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010113495713">Ashing-Giwa, 2005</xref>) demonstrates cross-cultural equivalence or validity. Pretesting ensures that the meanings of constructs are as intended by the researcher.</p>
<p>Methodological procedures to test for cultural validity are essential to ensure consistency of meaning in different populations. Cultural validity can be demonstrated through consultation with members of the community as well as experts on the specific culture or population, for feedback that guides the translation of the instrument or development of an instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0898010113495713">Stromburg &amp; Olson, 2004</xref>). Cognitive pretesting can be used to assess how individuals respond and understand items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0898010113495713">Stromburg &amp; Olson, 2004</xref>) and includes the “think-aloud” and the verbal-probe methods. Based on these methods, researchers can alter an instrument prior to psychometric testing.</p>
<p>When an instrument demonstrates psychometric reliability and validity in a population, and a researcher seeks to use it in an alternate population, cross-cultural validity must be tested prior to administration. It is important to consider applicability, including whether items are culturally relevant, conditions are consistent, and the type of measure is appropriate for the culture, in selecting an existing measure for use in another population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898010113495713">Kagawa-Singer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0898010113495713">Switzer, Wisniewski, Belle, Dew, &amp; Schultz, 1999</xref>). In addition, the reliability and validity of the instrument must be assessed and compared across the two cultures or ethnicities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0898010113495713">Stromburg &amp; Olson, 2004</xref>) to confirm that it is appropriate for use with both sets of participants.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-0898010113495713">
<title>Search Strategy</title>
<p>A systematic search of appropriate databases and Google Scholar was undertaken with the following keyword combinations: Blacks, African American, spiritual, spirituality, instrument, psychometrics, cancer, oncol*, and neoplasm, from 1982 to 2012. Internet searches were conducted for epidemiological data, including the U.S. Census and the American Cancer Society. In addition to database searches per the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0898010113495713">Whittemore and Knafl (2005)</xref> method of integrative review, journal hand searching, cross-searching, networking, as well as a review of reference lists of pertinent articles yielded additional items for consideration. Once appropriate instruments were selected based on inclusion criteria, the researcher searched for resources detailing psychometric data of these instruments, as well as examples of appropriate application in either AA and/or cancer populations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898010113495713">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates this process for selecting relevant articles and the instruments and for searching of the literature for psychometric data on specified instruments and appropriate application.</p>

<title>Criteria for Considering Studies</title>
<p>To be included in this review, studies had to meet specific eligibility criteria. These criteria included studies that examined instruments directly measuring spirituality in cancer survivors and/or AAs or demonstrated use of the instruments in primarily the AA and/or cancer survivor population and studies that included development and/or psychometric testing of a measure of spirituality, including reliability and/or validity data. Excluded from the analysis were studies that measured spiritual coping; included religiosity with spirituality; measured wellness or quality of life; were created for terminal cancer patients; did not report reliability and/or validity data; did not report sample race and/or ethnicity, unpublished thesis or dissertation works; and were not in English.</p>
<p>Studies were individually evaluated and appraised using appropriate tools for each study design. The investigator evaluated descriptive quantitative studies with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies (STROBE) tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898010113495713">Gallo et al., 2011</xref>), and assessed quantitative experimental studies with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials tool (CONSORT), which is appropriate for experimental trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898010113495713">Schulz, Altman, &amp; Moher, 2010</xref>). No study was excluded based on evaluation data, however the variance in meeting criteria was included as a variable and potential limitation because, per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0898010113495713">Whittemore and Knafl (2005)</xref>, “reports of low relevance and rigor contribute less to the analytic process” (p. 549).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>After examination of relevant articles, 13 studies met the eligibility criteria for this review. The studies that met the inclusion criteria used the following nine spirituality measures: Perspectives of Support From God Scale (PGS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010113495713">Hamilton et al., 2010</xref>); Spiritual Well-Being Scale (SWBS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898010113495713">Utsey, 2005</xref>); Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale (DSES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898010113495713">Loustalot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898010113495713">Loustalot, Wyatt, Boss, May, &amp; McDyess, 2006</xref>); Connections to God Scale (CGS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010113495713">Holt et al., 2011</xref>); Spiritual Involvement and Beliefs Scale (SIBS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010113495713">Burg, Hatch, Hellmich, &amp; Naberhaus, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898010113495713">Mystakidou, Tsilika, Parpa, Smyrnioti, &amp; Vlahos, 2007</xref>); Faith, Importance and Influence, Community and Address (FICA) spiritual history tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010113495713">Borneman, Ferrell, &amp; Puchalski, 2010</xref>); Spiritual Perspectives Scale (SPS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010113495713">Conner &amp; Eller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010113495713">Dailey &amp; Stewart, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0898010113495713">Reed, 1986</xref>); Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy–Spiritual (FACIT-Sp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0898010113495713">Peterman, Fitchett, Brady, Hernandez, &amp; Cella, 2002</xref>); and the Spirituality Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898010113495713">Jagers &amp; Smith, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898010113495713">Table 1</xref> outlines study details and instrument psychometrics.</p>

Scores were summated and compared, and consequentially, in the majority of studies, the lower the score, the more spiritual, as defined by each specific instrument. A qualitative content analysis method was undertaken with the responses from the FICA Spiritual History tool to code key themes. This interview contained one single-item FICA quantitative measure that asked participants “to rate the importance of faith/belief in your life on a 0-10 scale” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010113495713">Borneman et al., 2010</xref>, p. 166).</p>

<p>Two studies examining psychometrics in an AA cancer survivor population reported Cronbach’s alpha scores greater than or equal to .80, indicating internal consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010113495713">Hamilton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010113495713">Holt et al., 2011</xref>). The interitem correlations for the PGS were greater than .30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010113495713">Hamilton et al., 2010</xref>), whereas two items had to be removed from the CGS based on item correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010113495713">Holt et al., 2011</xref>).

<p>Of the four instruments that explored psychometric properties in AA populations, three (SPS, the Spirituality Scale, and the DSES) demonstrated internal consistency with Cronbach’s alpha scores greater than .70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010113495713">Conner &amp; Eller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010113495713">Dailey &amp; Stewart, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898010113495713">Jagers &amp; Smith, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898010113495713">Loustalot et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898010113495713">Loustalot et al., 2011</xref>), with the exception of the SPS Spiritual Interactions subscale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010113495713">Conner &amp; Eller, 2004</xref>), which the authors stated could affect future applicability.

<title>Validity</title>
<p>Cultural validity is essential in determining the appropriateness of the selected instruments to the AA cancer survivor population. Of the two instruments psychometrically tested in the selected population, cognitive pretesting, including the “think-aloud” method was assessed with a panel of 34 AA cancer survivors, for the PGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010113495713">Hamilton et al., 2010</xref>), to determine questions that were relevant and how items were understood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010113495713">Holt et al. (2011)</xref> developed the CGS with experts in the community but failed to mention any cognitive pretesting of the instrument once developed. They did, however, discuss pilot testing of the instrument in a smaller sample and finalization for the full validation sample. The CGS was based and built on a body of grounded theory research within the same population.</p>
<p>Among the four instruments tested in AA populations, only the SPS reported cognitive pretesting with the “think-aloud” method to confirm cultural validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010113495713">Dailey &amp; Stewart, 2007</xref>). Reports of psychometric testing in the Spirituality Scale, the DSES, and the SWBS failed to report any preliminary cognitive pretesting specific to AAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898010113495713">Jagers &amp; Smith, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898010113495713">Loustalot et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898010113495713">Loustalot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898010113495713">Utsey, 2005</xref>). Because the FICA, FACIT-Sp, and SIBS were testing in cancer populations and not specifically AAs, it would not be appropriate to report cultural validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010113495713">Borneman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010113495713">Burg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0898010113495713">Peterman et al., 2002</xref>); however, the SIBS was tested for cross-cultural validity in a Greek population of cancer survivors to assess construct and item meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898010113495713">Mystakidou et al., 2007</xref>). It is important to note other methods of cognitive validation, including the verbal probe method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0898010113495713">Waltz, Strickland, &amp; Lenz, 2010</xref>). Utilization of this method involves a researcher constructing questions about items ahead of time, to gather information about the way respondent processed the question. The researcher then asks respondents to answer question as it was asked. The “think-aloud” method is free from interviewer-imposed bias and involves minimal interviewer training requirements, but it involves subject training and can allow subjects to stray from the topic. In contrast, the verbal probe method allows the investigator control of the interview and ease of training the subject, but there is a large potential for investigator bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898010113495713">Dilorio, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The content validity, or the extent to which an instrument measures all unique aspects of a given construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010113495713">De Von et al., 2007</xref>), is of particular importance in analysis of these instruments, because there are many facets of spirituality that could be interpreted differently specific to this population. Of the two instruments measuring spirituality in AA cancer survivors, content validity was only reported for the PGS review by a panel of representative AA cancer survivors, with a Content Validity Index score of 0.97 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010113495713">Hamilton et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010113495713">Holt et al.

Authors noted ease of readability and completion for the PGS, DSES, CGS, as well as the SIBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010113495713">Burg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010113495713">Hamilton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010113495713">Holt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898010113495713">Loustalot et al., 2011</xref>).

<title>Research Methodology</title>

<title>Theoretical Issues</title>
<p>As previously mentioned, only three studies actually incorporated a theoretical framework into their study design or instrument development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010113495713">Hamilton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010113495713">Holt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0898010113495713">Reed, 1986</xref>). A theoretical framework serves as a guide to deciphering and interpreting a concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010113495713">Bellury et al., 2011</xref>), and thus the lack of incorporation in the remaining studies can be seen as a significant issue. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0898010113495713">Reed’s (1992)</xref> Relational Framework for the study of religiosity and spirituality is widely used and encompasses the dimensions of connectedness through which one makes meaning, other updated frameworks may also be relevant. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898010113495713">Mattis and Jagers (2001)</xref> detailed a Relational Framework that centers on the idea that “believing in God places one in a relationship with, and immediately invites reflection of one’s connections and obligations to, the Other” (p. 520). This view of spirituality as a relationship could be applied directly to the AA population, where their relationship with God or a spiritual being is intertwined with their relationship with other parishioners and the worship community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010113495713">Hamilton et al., 2007</xref>). At each level of the social-ecological model, this framework addresses important relationships, including individual, familial, and community. Although it is known that spirituality can be used to transform the behavior of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898010113495713">Mattis &amp; Jagers, 2001</xref>), appropriate assessment is needed to explore the process by which one quantifies spirituality. Utilizing this theoretical framework in the guiding of instrumentation could aid in the development of further instrumentation to assess the role of social support and relationships through spirituality.</p>

<title>Methodological Issues</title>
<sec id="section23-0898010113495713">
<title>Sampling</title>
<p>Psychometric testing in the appropriate sample appears to be a significant issue. Only two instruments (the PGS and the CGS were psychometrically tested in the AA cancer survivor population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010113495713">Hamilton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010113495713">Holt et al., 2011</xref>), whereas others were tested in either an AA or a cancer population. In addition, income of participants was reported only in one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010113495713">Hamilton et al., 2010</xref>). The lack of stratification by socioeconomic status or income level presents an issue, as low socioeconomic status is associated with less social support, which can be key to managing the challenges and uncertainty faced in survivorship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010113495713">Aziz &amp; Rowland, 2002</xref>). There could be drastic differences in assessment between socioeconomic classes or income levels, including readability, importance, and understanding of terms. In addition, there was no specification of treatments received, location of cancer, or stage of disease at diagnosis in all but one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010113495713">Borneman et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, none of the studies listed a randomization plan or indicated randomizing subjects.</p>

<title>Instruments</title>
<p>The feasibility of an instrument is of particular importance in a vulnerable population such as AA cancer survivors, as there can be issues related to populations with low socioeconomic status and completion of instrumentation. Of the studies that did report feasibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010113495713">Burg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010113495713">Hamilton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898010113495713">Loustalot et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898010113495713">Loustalot et al., 2011</xref>), no problems were noted with the use of self-administered instrumentation in terms of ease of completion or time necessary. It could be hypothesized that because feasibility was not addressed in four of the instruments (SWBS, FICA tool, SPS, and the FACIT-Sp), there were issues not reported, although this is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010113495713">Borneman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010113495713">Conner &amp; Eller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010113495713">Dailey &amp; Stewart, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898010113495713">Mystakidou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0898010113495713">Peterman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0898010113495713">Reed, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898010113495713">Utsey, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Cultural Validity</title>
<p>Many factors, including culture, values, traditions, beliefs, primary language, and diet, can contribute to individuals’ beliefs about a concept or construct and their understanding of the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0898010113495713">Stromburg &amp; Olson, 2004</xref>). A participant’s understanding of the word <italic>spirituality</italic>, for example, can differ across different cultures and ethnicities; for an AA, it could mean the connection to God via transpersonal, interpersonal, and intrapersonal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0898010113495713">Reed, 1986</xref>), and could largely be influenced by familial traditions. For a Caucasian person, it may be merely the adherence to religious obligations and traditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898010113495713">Mystakidou et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, variances within a culture can be present, thus influencing the understanding of items in an instrument. It is thus imperative to examine the cultural validity of a new instrument, through cognitive pretesting, in order to ensure that constructs and items are understood as intended. Cross-cultural validation, where an instrument’s reliability and validity is tested and compared across multiple populations, is essential when determining the cultural appropriateness of the instrument to the desired subset of participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010113495713">Ashing-Giwa, 2005</xref>). Of the two instruments tested in AA cancer survivors (PGS and CGS), only one reported cognitive pretesting of the instrument through the “think-aloud method” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010113495713">Hamilton et al., 2010</xref>). Cross-cultural validation was performed only for the SIBS in a Greek Caucasian population of cancer survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898010113495713">Mystakidou et al., 2007</xref>). Unintentional bias of item wording, as well as a lack of comprehension, could pose a significant issue in appropriate application to the population of AA cancer survivors. In addition, neither face nor criterion validity was reported as employed methods for confirming validity.</p>
<p>Reliability and validity must be retested repeatedly in different populations and samples to verify appropriateness of the instrument in the desired population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010113495713">De Von et al., 2007</xref>). Because our desired population is AA cancer survivors, it is only appropriate to comment on the two instruments (PGS and CGS) that were tested in these samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010113495713">Hamilton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010113495713">Holt et al., 2011</xref>). The PGS and CGS both demonstrated adequate internal consistency, and test–retest reliability in the PGS was high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010113495713">Hamilton et al., 2010</xref>), indicating stability of scores over time. There were 2 weeks between the first test and the second, which is adequate per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010113495713">De Von et al. (2007)</xref>, so that respondents do not have so little time that they remember their previous answers or too much time that behaviors and lifestyles may have changed that could influence responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0898010113495713">Waltz et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Content validity was reported only for the PGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010113495713">Hamilton et al., 2010</xref>) and was adequate, which indicates congruence between the operationalization of an instrument and the relevant content domain for the construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010113495713">De Von et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0898010113495713">Waltz et al., 2010</xref>). Although convergent validity was reported for the CGS, it is evident that content validity was a missing and important component of assuring that the instrument’s content represents the definition of the construct.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are some limitations of note in this current synthesis. Despite the rigor of the process, important work regarding the measurement of AA cancer survivors may not have been included in this research for several reasons. Based on exclusion and inclusion limitations, pertinent studies that did not identify the specified keywords may have been missed. As a result of the sampling method, some research concerning spirituality instrumentation in AA cancer survivors may have been excluded. In addition, although an attempt was made to capture adequate representation by different disciplines, inadvertent exclusion of important work may have occurred during the screening of papers. As a result, it is possible that relevant information might have been missed. Limiting articles to those published in the English language could also have resulted in the exclusion of important work.</p>

<title>Implications for Future Research</title>
<p>The utility of these nine instruments is limited based on the samples in which they were psychometrically tested. Although the instruments examined in AAs (SWBS, DSES, SPS, and the Spirituality Scale), as well as cancer survivor populations (FICA, FACIT-Sp, and SIBS) demonstrated some merit in terms of reliability and validity, it is essential to test and retest it in the specified population. Only through such a repeated analysis can cultural applicability be confirmed. Further research is also needed to confirm validity via cognitive pretesting and assessment of cross-cultural validity to ensure proper understanding of terminology and avoid potential biases. Repeated testing of the instrument in the desired population as compared with other populations is necessary to confirm that constructs and items are understood and cognitively processed as intended.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to examine spirituality through an instrument reflecting the Relational Framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898010113495713">Mattis and Jagers (2001)</xref>, to truly encompass the interconnectedness of spirituality and relationships. In addition, it is important to note that the experience at the time a person is a cancer patient versus the time he or she is a survivor is dramatically different, each consisting of distinct needs and challenges. Based on this notion, an instrument assessing spirituality should attempt to consider these differences, so that interventions can be tailored accordingly.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The goal of this integrative review was to identify instrumentation measuring spirituality in AA cancer survivor populations and evaluate cultural validity. Cancer survivorship is a complex time that is wrought with both emotional and physical challenges, and spirituality could be one way that AAs are coping. Analysis of selected instruments and pertinent articles demonstrates a need for future testing on spirituality instruments in this population to determine applicability and cultural validity. Through careful identification of appropriateness and cultural fit of these instruments, health care providers can attempt to assess the spirituality of their cancer patients as they finish treatment and enter the phase of survivorship. Such an assessment is integral to understand coping mechanisms available to this vulnerable population. By illuminating and assessing this construct, appropriate instrumentation can provide insight into the interventional needs during and after the cessation of cancer treatment.</p>
