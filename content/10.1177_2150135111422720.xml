<abstract>
<p>Medical devices used in the United States must comply with federal regulations established to ensure that specified requirements have been met. The article will focus on 1 of 14 elements of the Quality System Regulation (QSR)—Design Controls. A high-level overview of these design control requirements is provided to increase awareness of the device development process and provide a basis for mutual understanding for continued dialogue with end users. Design control requirements were established by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an element of the QSR in 1996. Device manufacturers are required to have a quality management system (QMS) to ensure their devices are safe and effective. The QMS is established by writing operating procedures to achieve consistent application of the methods used to control quality and comply with regulatory requirements. The FDA has the responsibility to audit device manufacturers for compliance with the regulation. The requirements of the QSR and the resulting device design control procedures lend themselves to what is commonly known as the waterfall development process. This iterative process results in documented evidence that is defined in the QSR as the Design History File. This record of development is essential for managing the product life cycle. The elements and purpose of the design control process will be presented to illuminate today’s development environment. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Collaboration between device developers and the practitioner is essential for improving clinical outcomes and reducing time to market of innovative devices.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The development of new medical devices occurs in a highly regulated environment. The product development process for medical devices is defined and guided by numerous international regulations. This body of regulatory requirements makes medical device development a very complex endeavor.</p>
<p>Device development is a collaborative activity and ensuring “quality” can be an elusive goal. Quality in the context of this overview “means the totality of features and characteristics that bear on the ability of a device to satisfy fitness-for-use, including safety and performance.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111422720">1</xref></sup><sup>(820.3[s])</sup> Multiple areas of expertise must be engaged with the process. Typically engineers for product design and development of the manufacturing process, quality assurance people for testing, regulatory personnel for completing appropriate filings, and marketing and sales associates all work together to ready the device for distribution. In order for product development to begin, a thorough understanding of user needs must be documented and translated into relevant device requirements.</p>
<p>The communication of user needs from clinicians to the product development team is an essential component for ensuring safe and effective medical device development. By outlining some of the high-level regulatory requirements for medical device development, it is hoped the reader gains an understanding of the process, leading to enhanced collaboration between manufacturers and clinicians.</p>
<p>This overview will draw substantially from public domain information of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The primary US regulation defining the requirements for medical device manufacturers is 21 CFR Part 820 Quality System Regulation (QSR). The QSR contains many subparts to guide device manufacturers toward compliance. Design control requirements are detailed in part 820.30 of the QSR. The FDA has also published a guidance document<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111422720">2</xref>
</sup> regarding design controls that will be cited in this overview. Design controls can be depicted in the classic waterfall model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135111422720">Figure 1.</xref>

</fig>
<p>A variety of international standards maintained by the International Organization for Standardization<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111422720">3</xref>
</sup> also applies to medical device development. The requirements of these standards overlap the Quality System Regulation (QSR), which for clarity will not be specifically cited but must also be met by provision of objective evidence if the device is to be marketed globally.</p>
<p>The requirements of the QSR provide a framework for senior management of device manufacturers to create a quality management system (QMS) that will encompass the entire life cycle of a medical device. The product life cycle extends from conceptualization through development into production and onto distribution. The requirements established by the QSR “govern the methods used in, and facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all finished devices intended for human use.”<sup>1(820.1[a][1])</sup>
</p>
<p>The basis for the QMS is the documented policies and procedures. Many sections defined throughout the QSR begin with the specific requirement for a written procedure. Many sections within the design controls begin with the following statement “Each manufacturer shall establish and maintain written procedures….” This general requirement for defining, documenting, and implementing procedures will result in consistency of the design process and facilitate management oversight of the process.</p>
<p>The intent of establishing design controls is to create a process where issues affecting quality can be identified and addressed before the device is transferred to production. Design controls also apply to product or process changes that occur throughout the product life cycle. When properly applied, design controls will benefit the organization with improved communication throughout the process and yield designs that conform to user and patient needs.</p>
<sec id="section2-2150135111422720">
<title>Planning</title>
<p>Design control begins with a plan that is consistent with all of the QSR requirements. The plan is a communication tool to ensure that the entire organization understands what is going to be developed and how. It must define the organizational responsibilities for tasks and their implementation. The plan identifies major tasks, deliverables for each task, review points, and the required resources and timing estimated for implementation. The level of required detail is dependent on the size of the organization and complexity of the device.</p>
<p>The organizational responsibilities in the plan can typically be extracted from the quality manual required by the QMS. It is the senior management’s responsibility to implement an organizational structure that will ensure quality. Complex projects might have many sources providing input to the design. When this is the case, interrelationships and interfaces should be defined, coordinated, and controlled.</p>
<p>Task breakdown within the plan is needed to establish what resources are required to achieve the desired deliverable and includes an estimated duration to complete it. Tasks producing evidence of compliance with codes, standards, and regulations are advisable. Many plans define the predecessor and successor relationships between tasks and identify milestones for management review of activities.</p>
<p>Finally, the plan should be viewed as a living document that is frequently reviewed and revised as needed as new knowledge is acquired to ensure that management can make informed decisions about areas affecting product performance, patient safety, and resource allocation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2150135111422720">
<title>Defining User Needs</title>
<p>Device manufacturers must understand user needs. The primary method for gaining this understanding is by interviewing users, observing clinical practice, and documenting use cases. Secondary measures such as surveys, journal review, and study of available information of similar devices are also appropriate. Synthesis of this raw information into appropriate physical and performance requirements of a device is essential. Understanding user expectations and confirming user assumptions is part of the usability engineering process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2150135111422720">
<title>Design Input</title>
<p>Documented design input is the starting point for product design. The FDA guidance states, “The requirements which form the design input establish a basis for performing subsequent design tasks and validating the design. Therefore, development of a solid foundation of requirements is the single most important design control activity.”<sup>2(p13)</sup>
</p>
<p>Design input comes from many sources. Regulatory requirements and international standards as well as the documented user needs are given. Other design inputs stem from hazard analysis of intended use and reasonably foreseeable misuse. Often business considerations can be included as design inputs that constrain the design solution, for example, that existing materials or manufacturing processes be used.</p>
<p>Design inputs do not come from the “eureka moment,” at least not directly. Innovation leading to improved outcomes is the foundation of many successful device companies. Research and development is necessary and results in concept documents and prototypes that are useful to focus the conversation with end users and others on the development team to make qualitative assessments. As an illustration, during the early stage of device development an assumption of portability may elicit many possible solutions. It is not until quantitative limits are documented and approved by users, their representatives and other stakeholders to define size and weight as requirements that portability is established as a design input.</p>
<p>Developing requirements of appropriate detail involve considerations linked to the complexity of the device and risks associated with its use and the experience level of the team. A rigorous process established in written procedures is essential to address requirements that are incomplete, ambiguous, or conflicting. All assumptions of users, their representatives, developers, and other stakeholders must be driven out of the requirements until a balance occurs that permits design activities to begin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2150135111422720">
<title>The Design Process</title>
<p>The design process covers all the activity associated with meeting the described requirements and would be unique for every manufacturer. The goal of this article is to familiarize clinicians with the regulatory requirements guiding medical device development. This familiarization, it is hoped, can enhance collaboration between industry and clinical practice, leading ultimately to improved patient outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-2150135111422720">
<title>Design Output</title>
<p>Design outputs are documents that allow for adequate evaluation of the design to meet input requirements. These specifications, manufacturing procedures, assembly instructions, and inspection procedures comprise the core of what is called the device master record. All must be reviewed and approved before use. Design outputs result from many phases of the development process. The QSR states, “The finished design output is the basis for the device master record. The total finished output consists of the device, its packaging and labeling, and the device master record.”<sup>1(820.3[g])</sup>
</p>
<p>Development occurs in phases that flow from general to specific information, embodied in concepts and prototypes. The FDA guidance on this topic states, “As a general rule, an item is design output if it is a work product, or deliverable item, of a design task listed in the design and development plan, and the item defines, describes, or elaborates an element of the design implementation. Examples include block diagrams, flow charts, software high-level code, and system or subsystem design specifications.”<sup>2(p19)</sup> Design outputs in early phases can become design inputs in later stages.</p>
<p>There can be a wide array of design outputs and their contents requires whatever is needed to ensure the device can be fabricated, tested, inspected, installed, maintained, and serviced as intended. The design outputs must ensure essential requirements for safety and proper functioning of the device are included. Devices, including subsystems, resulting from the various design outputs have a pedigree so that changes can be tracked and the results of development testing and production quality records can be compared throughout the product life cycle.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-2150135111422720">
<title>Design Review</title>
<p>Design review is the examination of the design to evaluate the adequacy of the design requirements and the capability of the design to meet the requirements and provide the opportunity to identify issues. Design review occurs throughout the development process. When these are conducted is defined in the design and development plan.</p>
<p>The scope of a design review is defined by the stage of development and can have elements to address issues associated with manufacturability as well as how well the design will meet the needs of the user and patient. Design reviews are formal events that are comprehensive, systematic, and documented. The QSR dictates that each design review be organized to include qualified participants representing all functions concerned with the design stage being reviewed as well as an individual who does not have direct responsibility for the design stage being reviewed. If needed, specialists or clinicians should be included.</p>
<p>The purpose of multiple comprehensive and systematic reviews is to identify issues as early as possible and address them. The device is expected to provide users consistent and effective performance during use. This common definition of quality does not occur by chance and must be designed into the device. The structure of the QSR provides a method to control the quality of medical devices. It is unwise to minimize issues that are identified early in the development process. Critical analysis and data-based decision making are essential to address potential issues while the cost to correct these issues is relatively low.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-2150135111422720">
<title>Design Verification</title>
<p>Design verification is accomplished by creating records to confirm specified requirements have been fulfilled. As with many other elements of the QSR, design verification activities must adhere to written procedures. Design verification of design outputs includes documenting who, what, when, and how each element of the design was evaluated. Verification activities involve testing, inspection, and analysis. For many device manufacturers and for complex devices, verification activities are segmented into planning, writing protocols, executing the protocols, analysis of the data, and reporting the results. These results are subjected to the design review process as discussed previously. Design verification activities must be traceable, a topic to be addressed next.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-2150135111422720">
<title>Requirement Traceability</title>
<p>Requirement traceability is accomplished by tracing each design input requirement to a corresponding design output combined with documentation of the method and outcome of verification activities. If properly prescribed in the manufacture’s QMS, establishing a traceability matrix is not burdensome. The matrix approach can also be employed retrospectively from the “bottom up” and is useful to detect hidden assumptions and undocumented design inputs. Note that traceability in this context should not be confused with other requirements in the QSR for identifying and tracking critical components of a device.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-2150135111422720">
<title>Design Transfer</title>
<p>Before a medical device can be validated, the test specimens must be equivalent to production units. Following procedures for ensuring the device design is correctly translated into production specifications is the goal of design transfer activities. Production specifications ensure devices are consistently and reliably produced within product and process capabilities to produce a device that will meet all requirements.</p>
<p>Production specifications typically include assembly drawings, component specifications, manufacturing instructions, and inspection and test specifications. They can also include manufacturing jigs, fixtures, program files, and workmanship standards. Development teams including designers and production representatives have ample opportunity to communicate and document these specifications. This is a very important step in the process so that appropriate controls are established within the operations of a manufacturer or supplier.</p>
<p>Production equivalence is established by carefully documenting the conditions under which devices are made. The standard of meeting this requirement is recording the revision level of components that have been inspected, organized in approved product bill of materials, and assembled using documented manufacturing procedures.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this involves establishing a pilot plant to develop and validate the supporting manufacturing processes. A pilot plant with operations performed and supervised by production personnel can be effective at identifying unstable processes. It is improbable that units built in laboratories by the developers would be sufficient to determine the adequacy of the full-scale manufacturing process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-2150135111422720">
<title>Design Validation</title>
<p>Design validation is defined by the QSR as “establishing by objective evidence that device specifications conform with user needs and intended use(s).”<sup>1(820.3[z][2])</sup> Design validation follows successful design verification activities and is performed under defined operating conditions on initial production batches or their equivalents. The testing for the finished device is conducted in simulated or actual use conditions. Clinical evaluation of the premarket devices on patients requires the cooperation of many parties following a process beyond the scope of this article. Validations on devices complying with these requirements embody all the expected variations in components, materials, manufacturing processes, and the use environment.</p>
<p>Similar to conducting robust design verification activities, a successful design validation needs to be carefully planned. User needs and intended uses which have flowed through the requirements documentation process are now traced to tests defined in plans and protocols detailing the schedule, required resources, methods, and acceptance criteria.</p>
<p>At the end of all design validation testing, data analysis and reporting a design review is conducted as discussed previously. At this stage of the development process, the device manufacturer has all the information necessary to prepare a submission for global regulatory authority review. Once the regulatory agencies are satisfied, clearance to distribute the device can be granted.</p>
<p>You will observe the final activities involve the clinician in the evaluation of the finished device. The user is both the starting and ending point in the development process. Any gaps in fulfilling requirements identified at this stage are extremely costly in terms of time and money.</p>
<p>At the completion of device development, premarket approval from FDA is required before the device is cleared for use on humans. The time required to reach a decision depends on the risks associated with the intended use of the device. Current average times for obtaining premarket approval from FDA, when measured from first contact to a decision, are 31 months for the 510(k) pathway establishing substantial equivalency and 54 months for a Pre Market Approval (PMA) review.<sup>

<sec id="section12-2150135111422720">
<title>Risk Management</title>
<p>Risk management activities are essential in developing and managing safe and effective medical devices throughout the life cycle of the device. Compliance with the global regulatory requirements necessitates risk management activities such as hazard analysis and design and process failure mode effects analysis, and ongoing risk reviews be established with the manufacturer’s QMS.</p>
<p>Identifying, analyzing, controlling, and monitoring risks begin early in the development process. As user needs are assessed, risks associated with foreseeable misuse or device failure need to be documented. Design input requirements need to be established, verified, and validated to ensure all risks are mitigated to a level that is as low as reasonably practicable. As the development proceeds, the device and manufacturing process needs to be critically examined to establish appropriate controls. The controls then need to be shown to be effective with objective evidence for the design history file.</p>
<p>There is no way to completely eliminate risk associated with using a medical device. Every effort should be made to mitigate risks by design of the product and process used to fabricate the device. Even risks that are reduced to the lowest level that is reasonably practicable should be subjected to a risk/benefit review before fielding a device. Training and certification on the operation, maintenance, and use of the device may be required. The final precaution that can be taken by device manufacturers to prevent adverse outcomes is to provide the clinician clear indications for use, contraindications, cautions, and warnings in device packaging and labeling.</p>
