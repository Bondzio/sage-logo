<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to determine whether a single 7/8′′ nominal diameter stud bolt and nuts assembly would fail to perform its required function in a flange assembly when the nut was corroded. This work was undertaken to form a basis for further work in development of a fitness-for-service assessment for corroded nuts. No current quantitative assessments exist for this area. A failure criterion was defined as a minimum 206.8 MPa stress in the stud, based on the bolting requirements stated in ASME B16.5-2003 pipe flanges and flanges fittings. A simple test rig was manufactured for testing the compliance of the corroded nuts subjected to the 206.8 MPa stress level and the corrosion was simulated by removing uniform layers of material from the surface of the nut. Finite element analysis (ANSYS 12.0) was also performed to evaluate the test rig and to consider the interaction between the nut and stud at the thread roots. It was found that no failure occurred in the threading and that failure of the assembly only occurred when there was a &gt;60% material loss from the nut. The failure mode experienced was deformation of the flange plate. This analysis proved that a nut can experience significant effective material loss without damaging the flange integrity.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1464420712446278" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The problem of how to deal with corroded nuts (in flange joints) as efficiently as possible and in a safe manner is a problem regularly faced by maintenance engineers in many industrial sectors. A badly timed or unnecessary bolt change can result in out-of-schedule plant shut-downs which can potentially cost millions of dollars. A representation of a typical corroded flange joint is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1464420712446278">Figure 1</xref>.
<fig id="fig1-1464420712446278" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Corroded flange and nuts.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420712446278-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The main problem is not establishing whether the nuts can hold the required design load but is in assuring that, in a corroded state, they have the ability of providing the desired structural integrity until the next scheduled shut-down has occurred. This has created a requirement for a quantitative engineering evaluation tool, in the form of a fitness-for-service (FFS) assessment, to determine the integrity of the nuts and, hence, the compliance of the flange assembly during the corrosion process. No such criterion currently exists for corroded nuts albeit that similar FFS approaches have been applied to other equipment, such as piping and pressure vessels. The problem is currently left to the judgement of experienced engineers and is based partly on intuition and partly on visual inspection. Corrosion can be measured using ultrasonic measurement or digital radiography, but without a robust guide as to what the measured corrosion levels mean, the integrity of the system cannot be accurately validated.</p>
<p>The study specifically looked at the effect on joint strength, during the simulated external corrosion of the nuts and not the thread and core area. The corrosion damage of the threads and core area is an area of importance; however, external corrosion of the nut is a concern with significant loss experienced in practice. This has not led to failures but as there is an absence of an assessment criteria in this area it means that operators cannot categorically demonstrate the integrity of a joint and have to exercise judgement as to whether the nut needs replaced or not.</p>
<p>The need for established acceptance criteria in this area comes from the logic that at a certain point external corrosion of the nut will result in failure. For the development of a FFS assessment there needs to be a mechanical interpretation to identify the overall effect that corrosion is having on the flange but there also needs to be a time based lifespan assessment of the nut, based on the corrosion prediction. In the present study, the analysis focused on the mechanical effect of the corrosion on the flange integrity and identified when the loss of this integrity was likely to occur.</p>
<p>A nut size was selected that allowed for five reductions to the size of the nuts, but which remained practical to tighten with the aid of a torque-wrench. Corrosion was simulated by the uniform removal of effective material mass,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464420712446278">1</xref></sup> in stages of 1 mm layers, removed from the edges and top of the nuts. The dimensions of the nut samples are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1464420712446278">Table 1</xref>. Once the nut size was chosen the analysis was undertaken experimentally, using a test rig, and simulated using finite element analysis (FEA).

<sec id="sec2-1464420712446278"><title>Objectives and supporting information</title>
<p>The objective of this work was to determine whether and where a 7/8′′ UNC thread profile stud bolt and nuts assembly with nine threads per inch would fail, in accordance with the defined failure criteria, due to simulated external corrosion of the nut.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1464420712446278"><title>Failure criteria</title>
<p>There are three main potential zones of failure in the assembly.
<list id="list1-1464420712446278" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The threading between the nut and stud.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The contact area between the nut face and flange plate.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fracture of the corroded nut.</p></list-item>
</list>This analysis focused on the first two possible failure zones. The failure criterion was derived by the manipulation of the formula for the required bolting tensile stress area of a flange<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464420712446278">2</xref></sup> (equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1464420712446278">1</xref>)) and then applying a force balance, using the appropriate maximum pressures for each flange class.
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1464420712446278"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420712446278-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The force due to the internal pressure of the flange must be matched by the clamping force provided by the bolts. This force balance is as follows
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-1464420712446278"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420712446278-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
The minimum required stress in the stud can then be found by substituting equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1464420712446278">1</xref>) (when the equation is balanced) into equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1464420712446278">2</xref>) and then simplifying through and rearranging for the stress, which yields equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-1464420712446278">3</xref>)
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-1464420712446278"><label>(3)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420712446278-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula>
The minimum required stress in each bolting stud can then be calculated for each flange class.</p>
<p>This resulted in a minimal required stress of 120.7 MPa in each stud. A value of 206.8 MPa was chosen as being the threshold stress that the stud must hold, to provide the necessary clamping force; this includes a SF &gt; 1.5.</p>
<p>By having a failure criterion specific to a stud and nut assembly, meaningful analysis could be performed. If the failure criterion had been based upon an entire flange assembly it would have become very difficult to determine what was actually happening, as there would be many more factors affecting the integrity of the system, including flange rotation, and with each nut possibly experiencing different levels of corrosion the nuts would need to be individually assessed at some point in time.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1464420712446278"><title>Test rig</title>
<p>The test rig, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1464420712446278">Figure 2</xref>, was constructed using 100 × 100 × 12.5 mm<sup>3</sup> A516 Grade 70 steel plates, with a 25.4 mm diameter central hole. The rig had 12.7 mm thick dividers (of the same plate material) screwed into the plates to provide a 25 mm separation of the plates for access to the strain gauges on the stud. One full nut was used for tightening with the other as the machined test nut.
<fig id="fig2-1464420712446278" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>The test rig.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420712446278-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Due to the nature of the failure criteria it was necessary to produce a test rig that would isolate the nut and stud assembly so that the only measured parameter would be the longitudinal stress in the stud and ignore the stresses due to bending, shear or torsion. Bending in the test rig was minimised by using thick plates so any bowing effect of the plates would not create artificial stress concentration areas at the nut edges. The test rig was secured in a vice as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1464420712446278">Figure 2</xref>.</p>
<p>For application of the strain gauges (gauge factor at 24 °C of 2.095 ± 0.5%) the studs had a smooth section machined at their centre, around the circumference of the thread root diameter for a length of 20 mm, seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1464420712446278">Figure 2</xref>. Four strain gauges were positioned diametrically opposite from each other to enable bending effects to be taken into account, by taking a mean of the readings. The threading at the centre of the stud does not carry the load; therefore, its removal did not affect the overall system.</p>
<p>Previously unused plates were used for each test, as a smooth surface for the nut and plate interface was essential so as not to introduce bending to the stud. The torque wrench was calibrated using a wrench calibrator and before each test all gauges were checked and initialised.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1464420712446278"><title>Tightening procedure</title>
<p>A main concern with the test rig was how to tighten the assembly to the required stresses without distorting the system; as the corrosion process occurs after the system has been tensioned. A full nut was tightened, with a torque wrench, to achieve the required stress in the stud. As the assembly would ultimately fail at its weakest point (the machined nut side) not having both nuts machined was deemed acceptable.</p>
<p>The torque was applied in stages, to the wrench limit of 330 Nm, with strain readings recorded at each step using a data-logger. Readings were taken 2 min after the torque was applied to allow for short-term relaxation due to torsion and embedment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464420712446278">8</xref></sup> The strain in the stud was found to level off after 2 min.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1464420712446278"><title>Experimental results</title>
<p>The results for the tests of Nuts 1 to 5 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1464420712446278">Figure 3</xref>. It can be seen that for all of the tests the mean strain held by the stud passes the 206.8 MPa threshold and even past the 344.7 MPa threshold (which is likely to be the highest stress the stud will experience, at installation).
<fig id="fig3-1464420712446278" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Strain results for all tests.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420712446278-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The higher strains that can be seen from the Nut 1 test, between approximately 130–250 Nm, and the relatively higher strain of the Nut 2 test, up to approximately 250 Nm, are as a result of experimental error as the necessary time was not given to allow for the short-term relaxation.</p>
<p>The measured strain in the Nut 5 test was consistently below the measured results for the other tests and did not converge to the same strain after 330 Nm. By looking at the individual gauge results for the Nut 5 test, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1464420712446278">Figure 4</xref>, and by inspection of the plate that was in contact with Nut 5, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1464420712446278">Figure 5</xref>, it is clear that the assembly failed.
<fig id="fig4-1464420712446278" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Strain results for Nut 5 test.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420712446278-fig4.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig5-1464420712446278" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Deformation of the plate in Test 5.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420712446278-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The strain measured by Gauges 3 and 4 did not increase with applied torque. This indicates that the stud was not being strained at one section (Gauge 4) and was going into compression at another section (Gauge 3). It can also be seen that Gauge 2 did not increase at the same rate as Gauge 1. This combination of factors indicates that the stud was in slight bending. It can also be seen that this effect occurred before the failure threshold of 206.8 MPa.</p>
<p>The strain results for Nuts 1 to 4 did not exhibit a divergence in the individual strain gauge readings.</p>
<p>Due to the results from the final test being so different from the other tests, the stud used for the Nut 5 test was re-tested using two full nuts to ensure that the gauges were working correctly. This confirmed that the gauges were operating correctly.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1464420712446278">Figure 5</xref> illustrates that the sides relating to Gauges 3 and 4 show deformation of the plate, where the nut had begun to ‘bite’ into the plate. It can also be seen that the side relating to Gauges 1 and 2 shows little deformation which explains the bending that was experienced by the stud.</p>
<p>For all cases no thread stripping or deformation of the threading was experienced, all could be connected with different nuts which ran freely along the stud length.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1464420712446278"><title>Discussion of experimental test results</title>
<p>The results from the test rig indicate that over 60% uniform effective material loss can be experienced by a nut before the system will experience yielding in either the nut or flange. The bearing stress created by the reduced contact area of Nut 5 caused deformation of the flange plate before the failure criteria for the nut was reached which would result in a relaxation of the stud; therefore Nut 5 cannot sustain the 206.8 MPa load.</p>
<p>However, the bending of the stud indicates that the contact between the nut face and flange plate was either not perfectly flat or was off centre and causing greater stresses to occur on one side, potentially causing the system to fail prematurely. The contact face of the nut was unaffected by the machining process; the plate surface was free from visible imperfections and the plates were parallel. Therefore, the stud must have been off-centre. This slip will have occurred during the initial application of torque and could potentially occur in any bolted connection, so is not an error with the test rig. Flange and nut surfaces will never be perfectly perpendicular to thread axes and so bending will always be introduced, to some degree, to the stud in a flanged joint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464420712446278">8</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec11-1464420712446278"><title>Two-dimensional threading</title>
<p>The threading between the stud and nut was modelled using a static two-dimensional (2D) non-linear analysis in ANSYS 12.0. A 2D model of the threading was used as it was less computationally demanding but gave acceptably accurate results when compared to a 3D analysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464420712446278">9</xref></sup> the removal of the helical effect of the threading would not affect the load distribution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464420712446278">10</xref></sup> The purpose of the analysis was to understand whether or not the stress in the threading and the corroded nut would cause failure of the system. If not, the threading connection would not be required to be included in the 3D model.</p>

<p>An axisymetrical model of a UNC thread profile 7/8′′ stud and nut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464420712446278">11</xref></sup> with 9 threads per inch was modelled.

<p>The element choice for the analysis was Plane 82 as this 8-node element provides more accurate results for irregular shapes than lower order elements and can be used as an axisymmetric element. A material stress-strain curve was defined for a B7 grade material from the known YS and UTS values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464420712446278">Table 2</xref>). The mesh was created with a concentration of elements at the threading teeth edges to focus on the contact areas. The mesh was kept fairly fine in the areas away from the threading as the stress distribution through the nut and stud were also of interest.

<p>The highest stress was experienced in the contact area of the nut to the flange. The majority of the threading stress occurred in the first engaged thread with effectively no stress being experienced after the fourth engaged thread. The YS was exceeded only at stress concentrations, at the thread roots, and did not affect the integrity of the overall system.</p>
<p>The contact pressure experienced at the threads was mainly concentrated at the first three engaged threads, with the majority of the load at the first engaged thread. The pressure never exceeded 690 MPa.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1464420712446278"><title>Discussion of threading model</title>
<p>It was found that the threading connection would not experience any real deformation. This relates to the test rig results where no thread problems were experienced after testing. The nut did not experience any distortion, consistent with the test rig, as the stress levels remained low throughout the nut with a small area of high concentration of stress at the contact surface.</p>
<p>Improvements could be made to the accuracy of the results by modelling the plate and contact of the nut on the plate. However, this approach was not used as the main objective of the 2D analysis was to determine whether the threading would experience any yielding and not to determine the bearing stresses, which would be dealt with in the 3D analysis.</p>

<sec id="sec16-1464420712446278"><title>Test rig model</title>
<p>A half model of the test rig was created to simulate the test rig. The model was analysed in ANSYS 12.0. The element chosen was a ten node tetrahedral SOLID92. The diameter of the stud related to the stress area of the threaded stud.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464420712446278">12</xref></sup> No threading interaction was modelled, to minimise computational requirements. The stud and nut volumes were connected using the glue function, as were the volumes of the dividers and the plates.</p>
<p>The materials of the plate and the stud/nuts were defined as non-linear isotropic with stress–strain curves defined by using the YS and UTS, found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1464420712446278">Table 2</xref>. The model was meshed with a concentration of elements around the contact areas of the nut and plate. Contact pairs were created between the nut and the plate surfaces, resulting in the creation of CONTA174 and TARGE170 contact and target paired elements. A pre-tension mesh section was created in the centre of the of the stud volume. The mesh was altered to ensure the results were meshing independent.</p>
<p>The model was constrained by applying symmetry boundary conditions to all areas on the cross-section plane. The dividers were fully constrained. The stud volume was constrained from slipping laterally and a force was applied in the pre-tension section to load the model to the failure criteria of 206.8 MPa.</p>
<p>A static, non-linear analysis was used with the load being applied in 20 sub-steps to ensure that the material would follow the described stress–strain relationships, with automatic time-stepping on. No convergence issues were experienced.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1464420712446278"><title>Test rig model results</title>
<p>The analysis was performed for Nuts 1 to 5. It was found that for Nuts 1 to 4 the rig experienced no failure, consistent with the experimental test results. The analysis performed for Nut 5 did show that the nut would begin to ‘bite’ into the flange plate. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1464420712446278">Figure 9</xref> shows the stress in the plate for Nut 5 at 206.8 MPa, with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1464420712446278">Figure 10</xref> showing the contact pressures.

</p>
<p>The stress in the plate exceeded the YS and deformation was experienced around the edge of the nut contact area.</p>
<p>The contact pressure acting on the plate was found to be very high with a maximum of 705 MPa. These high pressures relate to where yielding was experienced in the plate, which would result in a relaxation of the stud to below the failure criteria.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-1464420712446278"><title>Discussion of test rig model</title>
<p>The results from the 3D model match the test rig and confirm that only the corrosion levels associated with the Nut 5 sample would result in the system not holding a tensile stress of 206.8 MPa in the stud and would result in a relaxation of the stud, to below the failure criteria.</p>
<p>The plastic deformations of the plate, hence, the relaxation of the system were modelled by inputting a stress to the stud, the same as the method used in the practical test rig. This means that an overall appreciation of the system in terms of ‘can this size of nut hold the required 206.8 MPa stress?’ is achieved. However, the loading did not directly relate to the in-service conditions but did give an indication as to the capabilities of the corroded nut.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="sec19-1464420712446278" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The analysis shows that when a uniform material loss occurs as a result of corrosion there can be a large volume loss before the integrity of the system is compromised. From the experimental test rig study, this was found to occur when the corrosion resulted in a material loss greater than 60%. However, the most important factor is the reduction of contact area of the nut, as stress levels away from this area appear unaffected by the material loss. This means that the mode of failure is due to deformation of the plate, which is a significant finding, as it indicates the most critical value is the contact stresses.</p>
<p>The test rig validated the FEA analysis. However, this was for the case of applying a stress as opposed to the corrosion process effectively reducing the contact area after the initial loading of the assembly. The test rig was found to be a crude idealisation that did not allow for an accurate prediction of possible relaxation due to the corrosion process. It is also worthy of note that the corrosion itself is unlikely to occur in a uniform manner and may create a more dome like effective nut shape, again an idealisation that may need to be revised for any further work.</p>
<p>It can also be said the sizes of the nuts are greater than is required for the in-service loads. This is most likely as a result of a required size for tooling and stiffness to cope with tightening, where far more excessive stresses are present during the pre-loading phase of the joint assembly than when in-service.</p>
<p>In development of a FFS assessment further work will be required, which includes:
<list id="list2-1464420712446278" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>revised test rig where the corrosion is actually simulated;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>more practical testing of a many sizes and materials of nuts to find any possible correlations between allowable corrosion levels and geometry or material;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>more in depth FEA analysis of the flange system, which can model the process of corrosion so the relaxation can be accurately measured.</p></list-item>
</list>This report covers ground work required to understand the mechanical limitations of the system and can be used as a foundation for further work to develop a full Fitness-For-Service assessment. Methods of measuring the corrosion are available, as are methods of corrosion prediction so there needs to be more work done to understand the mechanical limitations of all nut sizes when corroded. The results from this work may seem predictable to a point; however, what came from this work was a clear understanding of the damage mechanism as a function of material loss. The study managed to identify when the assembly failed and the manner of the failure, information not previously known.</p>
