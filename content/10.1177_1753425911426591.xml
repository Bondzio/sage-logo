<abstract>
<p>Leukocyte migration into the epithelial compartment is an important feature in the active phase of mycobacterial infections. In this study, we used the Transwell model to investigate the mechanisms behind mycobacteria-induced leukocyte recruitment and investigated the role of TLR2 and TLR4 in this process. Infection of epithelial cells resulted in significantly increased secretion of the neutrophil chemotactic CXCL8 and IL-6, but no secretion of monocyte chemotactic CCL2 or TNF-α was observed. In contrast to epithelial response, mycobacteria-infected neutrophils and monocytes secreted all these cytokines. Corresponding with epithelial cytokine response, mycobacterial infection of the epithelial cells increased neutrophil diapedesis, but decreased monocyte recruitment. However, monocyte recruitment towards mycobacteria infected epithelial cells significantly increased following addition of neutrophil pre-conditioned medium. Mycobacterial infection also increases alveolar epithelial expression of TLR2, but not TLR4, as analyzed by flow cytometry, Western blotting and visualized by confocal microscopy. Blocking of TLR2 inhibited neutrophil recruitment and cytokine secretion, while blocking of TLR4 had a lesser effect. To summarize, we found that primary alveolar epithelial cells produced a selective TLR2-dependent cytokine secretion upon mycobacterial infection. Furthermore, we found that cooperation between cells of the innate immunity is required in mounting proper antimicrobial defence.</p>

<p>Innate host defence mechanisms mounted at an early stage of tuberculosis-infection play a key role in the initiation and direction of adaptive T-cell immunity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425911426591">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425911426591">2</xref></sup> Entering the lung, mycobacteria invade the alveolar epithelial cells and resident macrophages that respond by an inflammatory response leading to recruitment of leukocytes from the blood.

<sec id="sec4-1753425911426591"><title>Cell culture</title>
<p>A549 alveolar epithelial cells (ATCC no. HTB-44) were cultured in Roswell's Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI) 1640 (Invitrogen, Stockholm, Sweden) supplemented with 0.05 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> gentamicin (PAA Laboratories, Linz, Austria), 2 mM glutamine and 5% FBS (PAA Laboratories), with a change of medium every third day. The cells were detached by Versene (140 mM NaCl, 2.4 mM KCl, 8 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1.6 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.2).</p>
<p>Primary bronchial epithelial (PBE) cells were used as control to the A549 epithelial cell line throughout the study. Bronchial material for primary cell cultures was obtained from lung explant from healthy donors with no history of lung disease. Bronchial tissue was dissected from lungs and kept in DMEM supplemented with gentamicin, PEST, Fungizone and 10% FBS (all from Gibco, Paisley, UK) until further isolation. After removing intraluminal mucus and surrounding tissue, bronchi were digested in 0.1% protease (Sigma St Louis, MO, USA) prepared in Gibco’s Minimum Essential Medium (S-MEM) supplemented with gentamicin, PEST and Fungizone for 24 h. Bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) were recovered by repeated intraluminar rinsing with DMEM supplemented with gentamicin, PEST, Fungizone and 10% FBS. Cells were filtered through a 100 µm strainer (Falcon, Becton Dickinson) and seeded in cell culture flasks coated with 1% Collagen−1 (PureCol, Inamed Biomaterial, Freemont, CA, USA) in bronchial epithelial growth medicum (BEGM) cell culture medium (Clonetics, Lonza, Germany). The following day, cells were thoroughly washed with a medium change every other day. Experiments were performed in passage 3. This study was approved by the Swedish Research Ethical Committee in Lund (FEK 91/2006).</p>

For the blocking experiments, monoclonal mouse anti-human TLR2 and/or monoclonal mouse anti-human TLR4 Abs (R&amp;D Systems, Copenhagen, Denmark) 10 µg/ml were added to the Transwell system or to the individual cell groups 30 min before the addition of BCG.</p>
<p>Leukocyte transmigration assays were performed as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1753425911426591">32</xref></sup> Briefly, neutrophils (1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup>, 0.5 ml) or monocytes (1.0 × 10<sup>5</sup>, 0.5 ml) were added onto the endothelial cells in upper well. For the experiments on neutrophil and monocyte interactions, monocytes were added to the upper well 3 h after the addition of neutrophils [past neutrophils (PN)] or in the presence of medium from BCG infected neutrophils [pre-conditioned medium (PCM)] in the lower compartment. After 3 h, samples were taken from the bottom well for leukocyte counting by Cell Counter (Sysmex, Hamburg, Germany) and analyzed for cytokines.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1753425911426591"><title>Flow cytometry</title>
<p>Epithelial TLR2 and TLR4 expression was investigated by FACS analysis. Alveolar epithelial A549 cells were infected as mentioned above and stained with monoclonal mouse anti-human TLR2 or monoclonal mouse anti-human TLR4 Abs (10 µg ml<sup>−1</sup>; R&amp;D Systems) for 30 min on ice. The PBE cells were used as a control. The epithelial cells were washed twice in PBS and stained with secondary anti-mouse IgG-FITC Abs (10 µg ml<sup>−1</sup>; Autogen Bioclear UK, Calne, UK) for 30 min on ice. FITC-labelled monoclonal mouse immunoglobulin G (10 µg ml<sup>−1</sup>; mouse IgG isotype control, R&amp;D Systems) was used as a negative control. Cells were washed twice in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry in a FACS Calibur instrument (Becton Dickinson). A total of 5000 cells were counted in each sample. Mean fluorescence intensities were calculated from the uninfected control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1753425911426591"><title>Confocal microscopy</title>
<p>Epithelial expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was detected by confocal microscopy. After infection, the alveolar epithelial A549 cells were spun down on glass slides in a cytospin2 centrifuge (RP centrifuge; HettichRotana, Malmö, Sweden) at 600 rpm for 5 min and fixed in 100% methanol. Before staining, the cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton-X (VWR International, Stockholm, Sweden) in PBS with 5% FBS for 10 min. Slides were incubated with anti-TLR2, anti-TLR4 or control IgG Ab (10 µg/ml; mouse IgG isotype control, R&amp;D Systems) for 40 min at room temperature (23°C). The slides were washed in PBS and incubated with secondary goat anti-mouse IgG Abs (Alexa Flour 488, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a dilution of 1:200 for 40 min in the dark at room temperature. Staining of DNA was performed by incubating the cells with propidium iodide (1 mg/ml) for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. After washing in PBS, the slides were examined with LSM-510 confocal equipment (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).</p>

<p>CXCL8, CCL2, IL-6 and TNF-α secretion by the infected cells was quantified in supernatants by ELISA (R&amp;D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1753425911426591"><title>Western blot</title>
<p>The epithelial cells were washed with PBS containing 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 lg ml<sup>−1</sup> PepstatinA, 5 lg ml<sup>−1</sup> Leupeptin (Sigma-Aldrich) and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), and lysed in modified radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM ZnCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing the same protease inhibitors. Protein concentrations were measured with the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were saturated with non-fat, dry milk and incubated with mouse mAb against TLR2 (R&amp;D Systems) or TLR4 (R&amp;D Systems) (all 1:500–1000) or mouse anti-GAPDH Ab (1:3000–5000; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA). Bound Abs were detected with rabbit anti-mouse HRP-conjugated Ab (1:50,000–200,000, Novus Biologicals) using ECL plus Western blotting reagent (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) and GelDoc equipment (Bio-Rad Laboratories). To quantify protein levels, band intensity was measured with ImageJ software28 and normalized against GAPDH.

<p>Effective cytokine secretion is essential in order to construct an appropriate inflammatory response against an infection. Induction of inflammatory response by mycobacteria-infected neutrophils, monocytes and epithelial A549 cells was estimated as a concentration of chemokines CXCL8 and CCL2 and of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425911426591">Figure 2</xref>). The PBE cells were used to compare mycobacteria-induced cytokine production. Compared with medium control, mycobacterial infection of neutrophils and monocytes induced an ascendant CXCL8 and CCL2 secretion that peaked 3 h after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425911426591">Figure 2A</xref>). Neutrophil CCL2 secretion was significantly higher than monocyte secretion 2 h after infection (<italic>P</italic> = 0.029 after 2 h; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 after 3 h). There was a difference between neutrophils and monocytes in the pro-inflammatory cytokine response to mycobacterial infection. Neutrophil infection induced an IL-6 and TNF-α production that peaked 2 h after infection and declined thereafter. However, mycobacterial infection of monocytes induced a continuous pro-inflammatory cytokine production during the whole experiment. The secretion of CXCL8 and IL-6 from infected epithelial cells was delayed and began 24 h of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425911426591">Figure 2B</xref>). No difference in cytokine production or cytokine secretion was observed between the alveolar A549 and the PBE epithelial cells. CXCL8 secretion peaked after 72 h, while there was a continuous increase in IL-6 secretion during our study. Mycobacteria did not induce CCL2 or TNF-α production from infected primary epithelial cells, while LPS, used as a positive control, increased all cytokines (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001)

<sec id="sec18-1753425911426591" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Mycobacteria have evolved a highly specific mechanism to proliferate in the host during infection. By manipulating the important host defence mechanisms, such as apoptosis and phagocytosis, this pathogen has killed an estimated 100 million people over the last century.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1753425911426591">36</xref></sup> In this study, we show that mycobacteria induce a specific inflammatory response from infected epithelium resulting in selective leukocyte recruitment. Mycobacterial infection of alveolar epithelial cells resulted in secretion of CXCL8 and IL-6, but no secretion of the monocyte chemotactic CCL2 or pro-inflammatory TNF-α was observed. Both of the epithelial cells used in our study, i.e. alveolar and bronchial, exhibited an identical inflammatory response against mycobacterial infection. However, in a human lung, the epithelial inflammatory response against mycobacteria would also be affected by the normal macrophage:epithelia ratio of 50:1000,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1753425911426591">37</xref></sup> which is missing in our Transwell model system. The epithelial response of CXCL8 would lead to recruitment of mainly neutrophils from the blood circulation, which was further confirmed in the model system. Infection of epithelial cells increased neutrophil diapedesis, while there was a decrease of monocyte recruitment. However, the addition of pre-conditioned medium from infected neutrophils increased monocyte recruitment, suggesting that arriving neutrophils secrete chemokines to attract more cells to the site of infection.</p>
<p>Analysis of the cytokine repertoire from mycobacteria-infected neutrophils and monocytes revealed that both of these cells secrete the measured cytokines, i.e. CCL2, CXCL8, TNF-α and IL-6. Interestingly, administration of the cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α was recently shown to induce a protective T cell immunity against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1753425911426591">38</xref></sup> Monocyte secretion of CCL2, CXCL8, TNF-α and IL-6 was more persistent and increased over time, while neutrophil cytokine response declined by the end of our study, possibly reflecting the short lifespan of these cells. Neutrophils have been implicated in anti-mycobacterial immunity based on the transfer of antimicrobial molecules to monocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1753425911426591">39</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1753425911426591">41</xref></sup> Both apoptotic neutrophils and purified neutrophil granules can reduce the viability of bacteria and augment the ability of infected macrophages to reduce bacterial growth. Neutrophil protection against infection was recently assessed in newly diagnosed TB patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1753425911426591">42</xref></sup> In this study, a depletion of neutrophils from a whole blood model dramatically reduced the release of anti-mycobacterial peptides in response to mycobacterial infection and reduced the ability to limit mycobacterial viability. Importantly, an inverse relationship was found between the amount of peripheral neutrophils and the risk of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, suggesting that neutrophils play a protective role very early on in infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1753425911426591">42</xref></sup> Additionally, another leukocyte, the eosinophil, is found in high amounts in serum of TB patients, but their function in immune response towards mycobacterial infections is not well investigated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1753425911426591">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the lung, TLR2 and TLR4 are mainly expressed on the surface of monocytes and neutrophils,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1753425911426591">34</xref></sup> but the mRNA level of these receptors within alveolar epithelial cells has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1753425911426591">44</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1753425911426591">46</xref></sup> We observed that mycobacteria induced increased TLR2 expression, while TLR4 expression was less affected by mycobacterial infection. This observation was further supported by protein analysis, where we could observe that epithelial TLR2 levels increased upon infection, while TLR4 levels remained at the background levels. Blocking of TLR2 had a major impact on neutrophil migration across activated endothelia, while blocking of TLR4 had no significant effect. One explanation could be that TLR signalling regulates neutrophil migration by increasing cell surface expression of chemokine receptors and activating CD11b/CD18.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1753425911426591">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1753425911426591">48</xref></sup> Chemokine secretion is also affected by TLRs, as blocking of TLR2 effectively decreased mycobacteria-induced cytokine secretion from both leukocytes and alveolar epithelial cells, while the blocking of TLR4 had the highest inhibitory function on epithelial and monocyte cytokine secretion. This observation is supported by previous studies on mycobacterial cell activation where secretion of CXCL8 was dependent on cooperation between TLR2 and TLR4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425911426591">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425911426591">13</xref></sup> Furthermore, the importance of intact TLR2 signalling was demonstrated by the increased susceptibility to TB infection in patients with <italic>TLR2</italic> polymorphisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1753425911426591">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1753425911426591">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, we found that primary alveolar epithelial cells produced a selective, TLR2-dependent cytokine secretion upon mycobacterial infection. Most importantly, we found that neutrophil influx is necessary for increasing the inflammation and recruitment of monocytes by broadening the repertoire of the inflammatory response. Cooperation between cells in innate immunity is thus required in mounting a proper antimicrobial defence.</p>
