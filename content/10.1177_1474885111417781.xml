<abstract>
<p>This article provides a new interpretation of Hannah Arendt’s critical analysis of the ‘perplexities of the Rights of Man’ by drawing attention to its overlooked methodological orientations, especially its ‘aporetic’ nature. Arendt’s critique is aporetic as it centres on the paradoxes of human rights and analyses them by putting into practice a mode of inquiry that she associates with Socrates. The article challenges the conventional understanding of aporia as a paralysing impasse and suggests that aporetic thinking can create possibilities of rethinking key concepts especially in times of crises. To make this point, I respond to Jacques Rancière’s criticism that the paradoxes introduced by Arendt paralyse thinking and doom human rights to an inevitable destiny of failure. I argue that, precisely because of its aporetic nature, Arendt’s critique attends to possibilities of rethinking and reinventing human rights, as can be seen in her articulation of ‘a right to have rights’.</p>

<p>Writing after the Second World War, Hannah Arendt inquired into the challenges posed by massive scales of population displacements in the 20th century, which rendered millions of people ‘stateless’. Those who were stateless, she argued, found themselves in a condition of rightlessness as they lost not only their citizenship rights but also their human rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1474885111417781">1</xref></sup> Arendt identified a paradox in this precarious condition: precisely when the stateless appeared as nothing more than human, it proved very difficult, if not impossible, for them to claim the allegedly inalienable rights they were entitled to by virtue of being born human. She took this paradox as a symptom of the ‘perplexities of the Rights of Man’ and offered one of the most powerful criticisms of human rights.</p>
<p>Arendt’s critical analysis of human rights has received much scholarly attention. While some political theorists have turned to her critique to grapple with the challenging problems posed by the contemporary plight of non-citizens to the existing institutional and normative frameworks of human rights,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1474885111417781">2</xref></sup> others have deployed it to rethink politics of human rights in terms of democratic and associational practices of claiming rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1474885111417781">3</xref></sup> Yet another group of scholars have drawn on Arendt’s critique for the purposes of finding less conventional foundations and justifications for human rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1474885111417781">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>This article joins these scholarly efforts to rethink human rights along Arendtian lines. However, it also makes the argument that this rethinking is enabled by an overlooked dimension of Arendt’s critique: its <italic>aporetic</italic> nature. Arendt’s critique is aporetic as it is centred on the perplexities or paradoxes pervading its object of study, as the title of the section on human rights in <italic>The Origins of Totalitarianism</italic> indicates (i.e. ‘perplexities of the Rights of Man’ or ‘die Aporien der Menschenrechte’ in the German version).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1474885111417781">5</xref></sup> In addition, it is aporetic in the sense that it puts into practice a mode of thinking that Arendt associates mainly with Socrates. Aporetic thinking starts with ordinary concepts of political life (e.g. justice, happiness, courage), calls into question their conventional understandings and opens up the possibilities of thinking them anew. I argue that Arendt undertakes such an aporetic inquiry in response to the crisis of human rights in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>Attending to this aporetic dimension, illuminating the <italic>methodological</italic> orientations of Arendt’s inquiry, is crucial since her analysis, which has proved to be inspiring for many, has not been immune to criticism. In one of the most powerful criticisms provided to date, Jacques Rancière has argued that Arendt’s analysis of human rights paralyses our political imagination with the paradoxes it introduces and makes it impossible for us to consider the democratic potential of modern rights declarations. In Rancière’s reading, Arendt’s critique traces the origins of problems such as statelessness to the paradoxes in the early formulations of human rights and attributes to these rights an inevitable destiny of inefficacy or failure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1474885111417781">6</xref></sup> Examining the methodological orientations of Arendt’s critique is crucial to address this deeply embedded scepticism about its premises and conclusions.</p>
<p>In the first section of the article, I delineate the main contours of aporetic inquiry by turning to Arendt’s discussion of Socrates in <italic>The Life of The Mind</italic> and <italic>Promise of Politics</italic>. Arendt’s understanding of ‘aporia’ is crucially different from its conventional understanding as a paralysing structure. Indeed, as her discussion of Socrates indicates, facing up to the perplexities arising from our prevailing assumptions about key concepts is the very condition of possibility for thinking these concepts anew. Since the goal of this section is to identify and explain what Arendt finds promising in the example of Socrates, I focus exclusively on her interpretation of Socrates, without questioning the validity of her claims about the Socratic method.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1474885111417781">7</xref></sup> The second section reconstructs the main arguments of Arendt’s critique of human rights, elaborated particularly in <italic>The Origins of Totalitarianism</italic> and <italic>On Revolution</italic>, in the light of the discussion of Socratic aporetic inquiry. On the basis of this interpretive work, the third section analyses the distinctive aspects of Arendt’s critique of human rights particularly in response to the criticisms raised by Jacques Rancière. Read as an aporetic inquiry, Arendt’s critique does not attribute an inevitable destiny to the paradoxes of human rights. As different from more recent criticisms of human rights, especially the one offered by Giorgio Agamben, Arendt’s analysis attends to the multiple, equivocal and contingent historical trajectories of these rights. Most importantly, it recognizes the possibility that the paradoxes of human rights can be politically navigated to contest inequality, as can be seen in Arendt’s analysis of the Dreyfus affair and her articulation of ‘a right to have rights’.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1474885111417781"><title>Aporetic thinking: methodological orientations of Arendt’s critique</title>
<p>Arendt’s critique of human rights takes its starting point from the puzzling condition of the stateless who found themselves deprived of not only citizenship rights but also human rights. Resisting the temptation to understand this troubling condition as ‘an unfortunate exception to an otherwise sane and normal rule’, Arendt analyses it as a symptom of some paradoxes deeply embedded in human rights since their early formulations in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1474885111417781">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the one hand, these rights were assumed to be natural; individuals were entitled to them by virtue of being born as human beings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1474885111417781">9</xref></sup> As distinct from rights that took their ground from history and changed from one community to the other, the rights of man were derived from human nature that was assumed to be universally shared and relatively stable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1474885111417781">10</xref></sup> They were the rights attached to all human beings abstracted from any belonging or membership in a political community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1474885111417781">11</xref></sup> On the other hand, the declaration of these allegedly natural, abstract and inalienable rights was coeval with the emergence of the nation-state. Within the context of the nation-state, ‘rights of man’ came to stand for ‘national rights’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1474885111417781">12</xref></sup> In an international system organized around the principle of nationality, human rights seemed to be unenforceable in the case of individuals deprived of citizenship in any sovereign state, as manifested in the condition of millions of stateless people who lost their political membership and became nothing but human.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1474885111417781">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Arendt’s inquiry is centred on the paradoxes, perplexities or aporias of human rights, and we usually associate these terms with some kind of an irresolvable logical quandary that is in many ways paralysing for thought. Indeed, this is the meaning that is implicit in Jacques Rancière’s recent criticisms of Arendt:
<disp-quote>
<p>She makes them [Rights of Man] a quandary, which can be put as follows: either the rights of the citizen are the rights of man – but the rights of man are the rights of the unpoliticized person; they are the rights of those who have no rights, which amounts to nothing – or the rights of man are the rights of the citizen, the rights attached to the fact of being a citizen of such or such constitutional state. This means that they are the rights of those who have rights, which amounts to a tautology. … Either a void or a tautology, and, in both cases, a deceptive trick, such is the lock that she [Arendt] builds.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1474885111417781">14</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In this rendering, an analysis centred on paradoxes is debilitating as it locks thought in a binary logic – human rights are either the rights of those who are cast as subjects without any rights (e.g. stateless or poor) or merely the rights of citizens who already have rights. Arendt’s reading, Rancière argues, blinds us to the political possibilities that release us from the paralysing grip of these conundrums as it fails to see how the equivocality in the declaration, arising from the simultaneous invocation of ‘man’ and ‘citizen’ as the subject of rights, opens up spaces for political contestation.</p>
<p>In what follows, I provide an alternative account that foregrounds the critical potential of Arendt’s inquiry by revisiting her analysis of aporetic thinking in her discussion of Socrates. In my rendering, thinking through perplexities and paradoxes is far from paralysing. In fact, aporetic thinking can be seen as the very condition of possibility for rearticulating human rights beyond the binaries that prevail in the conventional understandings of these rights (e.g. man/citizen, universal/particular, nature/history). This reinterpretation recasts ‘tension and contradiction’, as Jill Frank puts it in a different context, ‘not as stymying the possibilities for political action nor as making moot frameworks of falsity and truth, but rather as opening the way to less binary ways of thinking about age-old problems and dilemmas’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1474885111417781">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In her analysis of thinking in <italic>The Life of the Mind</italic>, Arendt describes Socratic dialogues, inquiring into key concepts of political vocabulary, as aporetic for two reasons. First, they are aporetic as they are centred on perplexities arising from our conventional assumptions about ordinary concepts. Second, they are aporetic also because of their resistance to resolving these perplexities by turning to an absolute principle or conclusive truth.</p>
<p>Socratic dialogues centre on ‘very simple, everyday concepts’ that are ‘part and parcel of everyday speech’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1474885111417781">16</xref></sup> For Arendt, they are valuable precisely because of this focus; since we invoke these terms very frequently, we rarely think about their meanings. In each dialogue, Socrates urges his interlocutors to give an account of the terms of their everyday vocabulary, and points to the perplexities that these accounts result in. Arendt underscores that these perplexities are not riddles to which Socrates has readymade answers; Socrates himself is deeply puzzled by them and sincerely interested in seeing whether his puzzlement is shared by his interlocutors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1474885111417781">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Arendt’s reading, Socratic dialogues are aporetic also because they refrain from resorting to an incontrovertible truth to resolve these perplexities. At times, Arendt describes the way Socrates proceeds as circular, and this seems to indicate that aporetic thinking leads to nothing other than the infinite regress of logical paradoxes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1474885111417781">18</xref></sup> Yet, in Arendt’s rendering, this movement from one perplexity to the other is promising precisely because of its resistance to impose some kind of an absolute principle for finding a final resolution to these challenging political and ethical dilemmas. As Socrates inquires into ‘perplexities’ arising from unexamined beliefs, his goal is not to give his interlocutors <italic>the</italic> truth. Refraining from the philosophical temptation to resolve the challenges arising from the contingencies of politics by resorting to an incontestable truth, Socrates urges his interlocutors to find the ‘truthfulness’ of their own opinions by carefully examining them in an incessant dialogue. All opinions, according to Arendt, are in need of such intersubjective affirmation that involves critical assessment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1474885111417781">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The critical import of aporetic thinking becomes clear especially in Arendt’s discussion of the metaphors used to describe Socrates. As a gadfly, Socrates demands his interlocutors to give an account of their taken-for-granted opinions, as he ‘stings’ and provokes them into thinking. For Arendt, aporetic thinking consists not merely of a provocation or prodding though; it also entails midwifery or ‘[delivering] others of their thoughts’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1474885111417781">20</xref></sup> Socrates ‘purges’ his interlocutors of their ‘unexamined pre-judgments that would prevent them from thinking’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1474885111417781">21</xref></sup> Probably, the most interesting analogy is that of the electric ray. Thinking of Socrates as this fish that can paralyse and benumb with its electric discharges evokes a negative image of aporetic inquiry – precisely the image that I am questioning. However, as Arendt underscores, what looks paralysing from outside, ‘from the standpoint of ordinary human affairs’, is indeed a productive moment as it is ‘<italic>felt</italic> as the highest state of being active and alive’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1474885111417781">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>When these three metaphors are taken together, aporetic thinking assumes a much more critical function than what the conventional meaning of aporia indicates. The Greek word <italic>aporos</italic> literally means ‘without passage’, and denotes an uncrossable and untreadable path, or an impasse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1474885111417781">23</xref></sup> Conventionally understood as a paralysing structure blocking the way and setting obstacles to thinking, <italic>aporia</italic>, in Arendt’s work, becomes the very condition of possibility for thinking our key concepts anew. Aporetic thinking assumes a crucial political and ethical import particularly in times of crisis when one can no longer rely on existing rules or laws to ‘tell the right from wrong, beautiful from ugly’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1474885111417781">24</xref></sup> Under these conditions, aporetic thinking can have a ‘liberating effect’ on the faculty of judgement, which, according to Arendt, is ‘the most political of man’s abilities’ as it helps us decide in the absence of given rules under which a particular case or phenomenon can be subsumed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1474885111417781">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>As I will discuss, Arendt’s critique of human rights engages in the practice of aporetic thinking she associates with Socrates. Similar to Socrates, Arendt takes a crucial term of our political vocabulary – i.e. human rights – and looks at the conventional accounts of what this term means. The very title of her article on human rights, published shortly before <italic>Origins</italic>, resonates with the ‘<italic>ti esti</italic>’ (i.e. what is it?) questions that instigate aporetic inquiry in Socratic dialogues: ‘“The Rights of Man”: What are They?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1474885111417781">26</xref></sup> Just like the everyday concepts that Socrates inquired into, the term ‘human rights’ had become ‘slippery’:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1474885111417781">27</xref></sup> ‘[R]ecent attempts to frame a new bill of human rights have demonstrated that no one seems able to define with any assurance what these general human rights, as distinguished from the rights of citizens, really are’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1474885111417781">28</xref></sup> More crucially, these attempts failed to attend to the one human right that the plight of the stateless seemed to reveal: ‘the right to belong to a political community’ (i.e. ‘a right to have rights’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1474885111417781">29</xref></sup> In response to this problem, Arendt undertakes an aporetic inquiry that centres on the perplexities of human rights – one that engages in a rethinking so as to render the concept ‘meaningful again’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1474885111417781">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hence, the goal of Arendt’s aporetic inquiry is not to demonstrate that human rights are either void or tautological, to use Rancière’s terms,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1474885111417781">31</xref></sup> but instead to open a critical space for their revaluation. In ways similar to the Socratic dialogues, which underscore that all of our opinions are in need of intersubjective affirmation to become truthful, Arendt’s critique highlights that human rights lose their meaningfulness without practices of scrutinizing our conventional assumptions about them. Only such practices can alert us to how these assumptions as ‘unexamined pre-judgments’ stand in the way of a new articulation that would allow human rights to be more responsive to crises inaugurated by unprecedented forms of injustice such as the ones encountered by the stateless in the early 20th century.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1474885111417781"><title>‘Perplexities of the Rights of Man’</title>
<p>Arendt’s analysis of the plight of the stateless results in a critical inquiry that centres on the constitutive tensions of human rights as manifested in modern rights declarations, especially the 1789 Declaration. In what follows I will discuss two ways in which aporias figure in Arendt’s analysis of human rights. First, human rights give rise to perplexities because of their ultimate groundlessness. Despite endless search for normative foundations to clarify their subject, scope and ground, they continue to be defined in terms of the tensions between man/citizen, universal/particular, natural/historical – tensions that can turn out to be explosive in some contexts. Second, human rights are perplexing also due to their tense, and at times even conflictual, relationship with the institutional structures established to protect them. To have at least some permanence, they are in need of institutions, and yet these same institutions can also end up undermining the possibilities of claiming and exercising human rights. I suggest that Arendt’s critique is aporetic as it centres on these perplexities to understand the problems encountered by the stateless <italic>and</italic> resists the temptation to resolve them by resorting to an absolute.</p>
<p>Particularly Arendt’s discussion of the Rights of Man in <italic>On Revolution</italic> calls attention to the perplexities arising from the groundlessness of modern rights declarations. Whereas in the past a new body politic could legitimate its founding with reference to divine authority, secularization in the modern age leaves political actors with the problem of finding a new authority for the laws, rights and institutions they establish.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1474885111417781">32</xref></sup> This problem attending the founding of any body politic in the modern era becomes manifest especially in the declarations of rights: ‘There is no period in history to which the Declaration of the Rights of Man could have harkened back… inalienable political rights of all men by virtue of birth would have appeared to all ages prior to our own as they appeared to Burke – a contradiction in terms.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1474885111417781">33</xref></sup> As utterances bringing forth the rights that they assert to be already existing, modern declarations, to use the words of Costas Douzinas, ‘install the radical contingency of linguistic proclamation into the heart of constitutional arrangements’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1474885111417781">34</xref></sup> This radical contingency can be seen, for example, in Arendt’s account of the preamble of the American Declaration of Independence, which announces the rights declared to be self-evident yet also adds, ‘<italic>We hold</italic> these truths to be self-evident.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1474885111417781">35</xref></sup> Arendt’s emphasis on ‘we hold’ indicates that rights owe their existence ultimately to our acts of declaring and claiming them and that these rights cannot be derived from any pre-existing ground.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1474885111417781">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>The perplexities arising from this groundlessness can be seen in the equivocal formulations of rights, especially in the 1789 Declaration that proclaims the subjects of these rights to be both ‘man’ and ‘citizen’. This aporia reverberates in the other constitutive tensions pervading the declaration; the scope of these rights, whether they are universal or particular, is undecided: if they are the ‘rights of man’, they are universal entitlements regardless of membership in a political community; if they are, however, ‘rights of citizen’, then they are rights guaranteed by particular communities. The nature of these rights is similarly ambivalent; the declaration presenting them as natural, prepolitical rights is proclaimed by a specific political community in a particular historical context (as can be seen in the American Declaration’s emphasis on ‘we hold’).</p>
<p>There is the temptation to turn to an absolute to resolve the perplexities attending such declarations, or any new beginning, in the modern era, as can be seen in the recourse to ‘nature’ as a new ‘transcendent source of authority’ or ‘an absolute from which to derive authority for law and power’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1474885111417781">37</xref></sup> However, Arendt finds this resolution problematic particularly in the light of statelessness as it relies on ‘an “abstract” human being who seemed to exist nowhere’ and evades the importance of political community for guaranteeing human rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1474885111417781">38</xref></sup> Positing nature to resolve the aporias arising from the groundlessness of human rights creates the illusion that individuals are subjects of rights in their natural condition. Yet, the condition of the stateless deprived of any political status reveals the problems of this assumption. Finding themselves in a kind of ‘state of nature’, the stateless persons are at best perceived as objects of charity – deserving our compassion as fellow human beings sharing the same innate qualities with us – and at worst, as ‘savages’ whose humanity is barely recognizable and whose alienness is perceived as threatening.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1474885111417781">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nature has long been discredited as the foundation of human rights. However, Arendt’s aporetic inquiry has crucial implications even in a postmetaphysical age that has moved away from such absolute grounds. The continuing theoretical debates on the normative foundations of human rights suggest that the perplexities arising from the groundlessness of these rights are still not easy to come to grips with. Indeed, the appeal of resolving the political and ethical dilemmas of such groundlessness by establishing foundations, albeit not metaphysical ones, is demonstrated by the scholarly debates on Arendt’s understanding of human rights. Arendt’s critical readers, including Seyla Benhabib, see the lack of normative foundations in her analysis of human rights as an unresolved problem.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1474885111417781">40</xref></sup> Scholars such as Peg Birmingham and Serena Parekh, however, defend Arendt against these criticisms precisely by deriving normative foundations for human rights from her political theory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1474885111417781">41</xref></sup> When Arendt’s critique is read as an aporetic inquiry, however, the lack of foundations is not a problem awaiting a solution; it is indeed in tune with a mode of thinking that refuses to establish final resolutions for the political and ethical dilemmas arising from the groundlessness of human rights. Taking us away from a ‘project of philosophical foundation-giving’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1474885111417781">42</xref></sup> this thinking instead turns our attention to how political actors themselves navigate these political and ethical dilemmas as they declare, invent or claim rights within changing historical circumstances (as will be seen in the analysis of Dreyfus affair in the next section).</p>
<p>Arendt’s resistance to invoking an absolute to resolve the perplexities of modern declarations, linking her analysis of human rights to Socratic aporetic inquiry, is also motivated by a practical concern. A thinking centred on foundations can give us the illusion of security and stability and turn our attention away from questions of how human rights can be politically guaranteed. For Arendt, human rights are in need of political practices and institutions that can provide relatively permanent guarantees: ‘We are not born equal; we become equal as members of a group on the strength of our decision to guarantee ourselves mutually equal rights.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1474885111417781">43</xref></sup> Only artificial, conventional or man-made laws can give permanence to these mutual guarantees of political equality. Human rights are in need of such artificial inventions if they are to be effective; indeed, Arendt underlines the ‘inefficacy of all declarations, proclamations, or enumerations of human rights that were not immediately incorporated into positive law, the law of the land’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1474885111417781">44</xref></sup> Yet her account also suggests that the very institutional structures that we establish to have relatively permanent guarantees can end up undermining these rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1474885111417781">45</xref></sup> Arendt’s analysis of this constitutive tension between human rights and the institutional structures established to protect them also underscores the aporetic dimension of her critique.</p>
<p>The 1789 Declaration itself is an embodiment of this paradox to the extent that it simultaneously posits nature as the foundation of the Rights of Man <italic>and</italic> implicitly acknowledges that these rights are in need of artificial institutions with its coeval articulation of national sovereignty. The Declaration announces a set of inalienable rights and suggests that the nation was subject to the laws that ‘would flow from the Rights of Man’. It establishes the Rights of Man as ‘the source of all political power’ and ‘the foundation-stone of the body politic’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1474885111417781">46</xref></sup> Yet, it simultaneously declares that nation to be ‘sovereign’ and entrusts it with the guarantee of rights.</p>
<p>Arendt’s analysis of the nation-state reveals the tension between human rights and the institutions that are entrusted with their protection. The institutional framework of the nation-state rests on a precarious balance between ‘nation’ and ‘state’. ‘State’ legitimizes itself as the ‘supreme legal institution’ in charge of ‘the protection of all inhabitants in its territory’, regardless of their nationality. ‘Nation’, however, is an exclusive community composed of those who belong ‘by right of origin and fact of birth’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1474885111417781">47</xref></sup> Arendt argues that the precarious balance established between nation and state was imperilled particularly with the rise of national consciousness, which turned the ‘nation’ into a new absolute. Analysing ‘the conquest of state by the nation’, she underscores how the state lost its representative function and gradually became an instrument of the nation. Through this gradual conquest, nationalism identified ‘citizens’ only with those who were ‘nationals’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1474885111417781">48</xref></sup> As a result, the equivocality between the ‘rights of man’ and the ‘rights of citizen’, which could have been politically navigated to claim equality, was increasingly effaced in the name of the ‘rights of nationals’ within the context of the nation-state. As the egalitarian promises of modern rights were further undermined with the rise of imperialism and emergence of tribal or ethnic nationalisms, it became even more difficult to turn the equivocal invocation of the ‘rights of man and citizen’ into a site of political contestation to claim rights for those who are not nationals.</p>
<p>Can we think of other institutional structures that provide better guarantees for human rights and attenuate the violent effects of these constitutive tensions that we see in the nation-state? Very briefly put, the aporetic inquiry outlined here suggests that, although some institutional structures might be more promising in terms of offering effective guarantees for equal rights, no institutional form, including a denationalized, post-national or cosmopolitan one, will fully resolve the tensions between rights and their institutional protections. To illustrate this point, I will briefly discuss Arendt’s arguments in favour of limited sovereignty and her reflections on world government and citizenship.</p>
<p>Although Arendt provides us with one of the most powerful criticisms of sovereignty,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1474885111417781">49</xref></sup> in a puzzling section of <italic>The Human Condition</italic>, she also makes room for what she describes as ‘limited’ sovereignty: ‘Sovereignty, which is always spurious if claimed by an isolated single entity, be it the individual entity of the person or the collective entity of a nation, assumes, in the case of many men mutually bound by promises, a certain limited reality.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1474885111417781">50</xref></sup> This limited sovereignty, bound by mutual promises given by those constituting the political community, one can argue, would provide more effective guarantees for human rights. Indeed, some scholars suggest that Arendt’s analysis points to a territorially bound state with the institutional framework of a republican federation as the guarantor of rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1474885111417781">51</xref></sup> Would such a republican framework resolve the aporias of human rights? Although Arendt does not address this question explicitly, given that the mutual promises are not completely immune to the contingency and fragility characteristic of human action, they can provide guarantees that are only <italic>relatively</italic> permanent. In the face of this contingency and fragility, political actors still need to be attentive to how the republican structures established to furnish guarantees for equality can end up losing their potency, or even worse, create their own violent exclusions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1474885111417781">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>Could post-national, or even cosmopolitan, structures offer resolutions to the constitutive tensions that seem to pervade institutional forms centred on the principle of sovereign territoriality? Could such structures provide conclusive answers to the aporias of human rights, especially those arising from what Seyla Benhabib refers to as the ‘paradox of democratic self-determination’?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1474885111417781">53</xref></sup> Arendt’s very brief discussions of world government, world citizenship and world-wide federation in different contexts indicate that even a cosmopolitan framework would not fully resolve the aporias arising from the tense relationship between human rights and their institutional guarantees. These aporias would certainly be transformed and redefined in a cosmopolitan setting, and even then, not always to the effect of providing more stable guarantees for human rights. For example, Arendt’s brief invocation of the possibility of a world government at the very end of her analysis of human rights in <italic>Origins</italic> suggests that even post-national structures can end up drawing violent distinctions between ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’. From Arendt’s perspective, a world government does not eliminate the possibility that ‘a highly organized and mechanized humanity will conclude… that for humanity as a whole it would be better to liquidate certain parts thereof’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1474885111417781">54</xref></sup> Even short of such liquidation, there is no guarantee that a world government would protect human rights and maintain human plurality. Indeed, as this world government tries to achieve common bonds among different peoples, it can end up destroying differences, creating ‘a horridly shallow unity’ and giving rise to the ‘forbidding nightmare of tyranny’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1474885111417781">55</xref></sup> Similarly, a world citizenship does not necessarily free us from the constitutive tensions between rights and their institutional protections, especially given the possibility that it can end up eradicating differences between citizens of a diverse range of political communities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1474885111417781">56</xref></sup> Even more nuanced articulations of cosmopolitanism do not seem to be impervious to such dangers. A good example in this regard is Karl Jaspers’s idea of a ‘world-wide federated structure’, which aims to sustain human plurality by advocating the ideal of ‘limitless communication’; although Arendt seems to be quite enthusiastic about this institutional proposal, she is still hesitant to fully endorse it as can be seen in her criticism of Jaspers’s proposal to abolish war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1474885111417781">57</xref></sup> Her critique suggests that this world-wide federated structure ‘would harbor its own peculiar dangers’, including the alarming prospect of ‘federated police forces’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1474885111417781">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>As this brief discussion looking at Arendt’s invocation of non-national institutional possibilities in different contexts demonstrates, the constitutive tensions between human rights and their institutional guarantees do not exist only in the framework of the nation-state. Even if the guarantees of these rights could be completely detached from the nation-state and assumed by other institutions, there is still a need to undertake critical inquiries of the dynamic and tense relationship between human rights and the institutional orders established to protect them. What is at stake here is an aporia that is characteristic of any politics of human rights. On the one hand, despite their prevailing conceptualisation as abstract, natural and inalienable rights, human rights are in need of intersubjective guarantees that can have some relative permanence only within an institutional structure. On the other hand, the institutions we establish for guaranteeing these rights can end up eroding them or rendering them ineffective. Arendt’s aporetic inquiry is characterized by this ‘antinomic’ relationship, to use Étienne Balibar’s terms, between rights and institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1474885111417781">59</xref></sup> Her recognition of this antinomy in her discussion of several institutional forms renders her analysis relevant for contemporary readers interested in post-national and cosmopolitan possibilities.</p>
<p>Arendt’s critical analysis implies that the perplexities arising from the founding premises and institutional entanglements of human rights constitute the very terrain that political actors continue to navigate as they claim, exercise and debate human rights. One needs to carefully examine this terrain and attend to these perplexities to understand how problems such as statelessness leave some people without any rights. Such re-examination is the condition of possibility for rethinking human rights in response to these problems, as will be seen in Arendt’s own invocation of ‘a right to have rights’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1474885111417781"><title>Aporias of human rights: recapturing equivocalities and contingencies</title>
<p>As Arendt attempts to read the systemic problems encountered by the stateless as a symptom of the ‘perplexities of the Rights of Man’, does her aporetic inquiry end up attributing to modern rights declarations a fatalistic trajectory? Does her account leave us with a very deterministic account, suggesting that the paradoxes of human rights inevitably lead to problems such as those encountered by the stateless? These questions have been recently raised by Jacques Rancière who suggests that Arendt’s analysis leaves us with ‘<italic>an overwhelming historico-ontological destiny</italic> from which only a God is likely to save us’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1474885111417781">60</xref></sup> Indeed, Rancière suggests that it is Arendt’s analysis that provides the intellectual underpinnings of Giorgio Agamben’s recent critique that ties human rights inextricably to sovereign violence.</p>
<p>Although Rancière is right to point out that Agamben is inspired by Arendt, he overlooks some of the distinctive aspects of Arendt’s critique. Agamben and Arendt have similar starting points as they both take the problems such as those encountered by refugees as symptoms revealing the deeply embedded paradoxes of human rights in a nation-state system. Yet, whereas Agamben sees these paradoxes, including the constitutive tension between ‘man’ and ‘citizen’, as a reinscription of the centuries-old metaphysical divide between <italic>bios</italic> (politically qualified life) and <italic>zoē</italic> (natural life) that has held human life in the grip of sovereign power and subjected it inescapably to violence,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1474885111417781">61</xref></sup> Arendt’s analysis casts them as challenging modern political and ethical dilemmas that can be navigated and renegotiated in different ways. Her aporetic inquiry, attuned to the complex historical trajectories of human rights and aiming at their rethinking, significantly differs from Agamben’s sweeping statements speaking to the ‘24 centuries’ of Western political history.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-1474885111417781">62</xref></sup> Furthermore, whereas Agamben calls for a politics that renounces all concepts tied to sovereignty, including human rights and citizenship,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-1474885111417781">63</xref></sup> Arendt’s critique aims to grapple with the paradoxes of human rights precisely to think them anew.</p>
<p>To outline these distinctive aspects of Arendt’s aporetic inquiry in response to Rancière’s critique, I discuss two interrelated points. First, far from being a one-sided, deterministic account, Arendt’s critique foregrounds the <italic>equivocal</italic> effects of human rights – their political promises and risks – precisely because it is centred on their aporias. Second, these aporias are not ahistorical contradictions dooming human rights to an ontological destiny from the very beginning; instead, they are political and ethical dilemmas that are shaped and transformed significantly by historically <italic>contingent</italic> events and conditions, which can enable or undermine the democratic struggles of rights. In this reading, ‘perplexities’ of human rights are not logical contradictions or ontological traps ensnaring us perpetually, as Rancière’s reading of Arendt suggests; they are instead complex and demanding political and ethical questions that we continue to grapple with as we invoke, claim and exercise human rights.</p>
<p>This response draws on Arendt’s attempts to understand historical events in terms of equivocality and contingency:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-1474885111417781">64</xref></sup> Arendt does not turn to the 1789 Declaration to locate a chain of causes that would inevitably lead to the massive scales of rightlessness for the stateless persons in the 20th century. Rightlessness is neither historically inevitable nor completely haphazard or accidental given the ‘perplexities of the Rights of Man’. It owes its structure to a ‘crystallization’ of a set of ‘elements’, and yet none of these elements in this particular configuration determines the outcome in advance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-1474885111417781">65</xref></sup> In other words, perplexities in the founding premises and institutional orders of human rights can significantly, yet not completely, explain the complex configuration of rightlessness encountered by the stateless in the early 20th century. To fully understand this problem, one needs to look at other ‘elements’ in this constellation, including how political actors negotiate these perplexities and how historical events shape and transform politics of human rights. In this reading, just as any other element in this configuration, the Rights of Man do not have a single, fixed trajectory but contain ‘an infinite number of abstract possibilities’ and have an ‘equivocal past’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-1474885111417781">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>Suggesting that Arendt attends to the multiple possibilities and equivocal effects of the Rights of Man is almost counterintuitive given her scathing criticism of the French Revolution and the 1789 Declaration, especially in <italic>On Revolution</italic>. However, even this work allows an understanding of the French Revolution and the Rights of Man in terms of equivocal histories containing multiple possibilities. Most importantly, Arendt interprets both the French Revolution and the 1789 Declaration as new beginnings, as events exemplifying the ‘experience of man’s faculty to begin something new’ or the experience of interrupting the historical time that is assumed to be linear and continuous and of reclaiming political freedom as a shared human possibility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-1474885111417781">67</xref></sup> As new beginnings, both the French Revolution and the Rights of Man contain multiple possibilities and can be appropriated in different ways by political actors depending on historical circumstances. For example, Arendt’s account of the Paris Commune reveals that the French Revolution can be, and has been, appropriated in new and unanticipated ways by political actors. Arendt finds in the Commune, which she describes as an ‘unexpected and largely spontaneous outcome of the Revolution itself’, the possibility of reclaiming this new beginning for a political organization that can actualize the republican promise of equality and freedom through self-governance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-1474885111417781">68</xref></sup> She also credits both the French and American Revolutions for making ‘world politics’ imaginable for the first time, ushering an era in which politics would concern ‘all men <italic>qua</italic> men, no matter where they lived, what their circumstances were, or what nationality they possessed’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-1474885111417781">69</xref></sup> As one of the events ushering ‘world politics’ in this sense, the 1789 Declaration contains the promise of claiming equal rights for all regardless of nationality, ethnicity or race.</p>
<p>Arendt’s acknowledgement of this possibility, despite her criticism of the transformation of the Rights of Man into the rights of nationals within the context of the nation-state, comes to light particularly in her analysis of the Dreyfus affair. Arendt describes this case as one testing the impartiality of law, which was assumed to be the greatest achievement of the 19th century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-1474885111417781">70</xref></sup> For the most part, she reads the case as one grimly affirming that there was no such impartiality and that those who were ‘pariahs’ in the society did not share in the promise of equal rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-1474885111417781">71</xref></sup> Yet, Arendt’s description of the grounds on which Dreyfus should have been defended reveals her attentiveness to the equivocalities of the 1789 Declaration and the possibility that human rights can be turned into a political site of contestation for making claims to equality:
<disp-quote>
<p>There was only one basis on which Dreyfus could or should have been saved … the stern Jacobin concept of the nation based upon human rights – that republican view of communal life which asserts that (in the words of Clemenceau) by infringing on the rights of one you infringe on the rights of all.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-1474885111417781">72</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This statement is confusing given Arendt’s criticism of the 1789 Declaration, particularly its Jacobin interpretation. Yet, if the Declaration is understood as equivocal, in line with Arendt’s interpretation of historical events in general, it contains multiple possibilities, including political dangers and promises. Particularly the constitutive tension between ‘man’ and ‘citizen’ carries within it a risk. Within the context of the nation-state, this tension was generally resolved in favour of the ‘rights of citizen’, making it difficult for those who were not seen as members of the political community to claim human rights. Especially the rise of national consciousness, as mentioned earlier, can render this constitutive tension between man and citizen explosive at the expense of the ‘rights of man’. Yet, as an equivocal event, the declaration contains other possibilities, including the political possibility of contesting these narrow interpretations, as Clemenceau’s defence of Dreyfus demonstrates. Arendt applauds Clemenceau for his insistence on ‘jacobinischer Menschenrechtspatriotismus’ in the German version of <italic>Origins</italic>, or ‘Jacobin patriotism of human rights’ as highlighted by Hauke Brunkhorst.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-1474885111417781">73</xref></sup> This perplexing formulation is particularly striking as it simultaneously reveals the paradoxes of human rights (man/citizen, universal/particular, natural/historical) and shows the possibilities of politically navigating these to contest injustice and claim equality regardless of ethnicity, race or religion. As this case reveals, Arendt’s aporetic inquiry recognizes the equivocal effects of the 1789 Declaration by attending to not only the risks it harbours in its underlying assumptions but also the new political possibilities that its ambivalent formulations can give rise to.</p>
<p>It is precisely the recognition of such possibilities that Jacques Rancière overlooks in his critique of Arendt. Attributing to her a narrow understanding of politics that necessarily excludes rights struggles from its scope, Rancière suggests that Arendt’s critique fails to take into account the democratic possibilities inscribed in the equivocalities of the Rights of Man.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-1474885111417781">74</xref></sup> For Rancière, the interval between ‘man’ and ‘citizen’ in the 1789 Declaration can become the site of a political dispute whereby those who have ‘no part’ put to test the principle of equality inscribed in the Declaration; indeed, this polemical space is crucial for understanding the democratic struggles in the modern era.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-1474885111417781">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>As this brief discussion of the Dreyfus affair shows, Arendt would agree, though with some caveats. Although Arendt’s emphasis on the equivocal effects of historical events opens up the possibility of an analysis that is in tune with Rancière’s insistence on the need to recognize the democratic potential of these rights declarations as abstract inscriptions of equality, her critical inquiry also underscores the need to look at the historical conditions that can undermine or enable such possibilities of renegotiating the aporias of human rights – and this brings me to the second point about Arendt’s approach, i.e. attentiveness to <italic>contingency</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-1474885111417781">76</xref></sup> Rights struggles do not take place in a historical vacuum; historical conditions such as the rise of imperialism and racism, both of which Arendt saw as destructive for the notion of ‘humanity’ that is central to the concept of human rights, can indeed make it very difficult to politically negotiate the aporetic terrain of human rights so as to contest rightlessness and claim equal rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-1474885111417781">77</xref></sup> Arendt’s critique then turns our attention to not only the political practices of navigating the paradoxes of human rights but also the historical conditions that continuously shape the possibilities of claiming and exercising these rights.</p>
<p>This emphasis on contingency counters Rancière who suggests that Arendt casts the rightlessness of the stateless as an inevitable doom dictated by the ‘perplexities of the Rights of Man’. The goal of Arendt’s aporetic inquiry is not to find out the logical contradictions that have determined the effects of human rights in some formalistic and atemporal sense. To use Richard Beardsworth’s apt description of Derrida, Arendt’s critique is instead ‘concerned to untie aporia from logical determination’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-1474885111417781">78</xref></sup> It underscores the need to analyse the deeply embedded paradoxes in the 18th-century rights declarations to understand the late modern phenomenon of statelessness. However, it does not suggest that these constitutive tensions necessarily lead to the rightlessness of the stateless or the totalitarian catastrophe. The plight of the stateless is instead a contingent yet structured (hence, not accidental) constellation – one that is crystallized through the configuration of several elements, including the paradoxes in the underlying assumptions of modern rights declarations, tensions in the institutional structures established to guarantee these rights (e.g. nation-state) and historical transformations that aporias of human rights undergo as a result of events such as the rise of imperialism.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1474885111417781"><title>Conclusion: human rights and aporetic critique</title>
<p>Rancière suggests that Arendt’s paralysing quandary, stuck within binary conceptions of man/citizen, nature/history, abstract/concrete, universal/particular, renders rights of man either void or tautological, and his critique ends with a provocative call: ‘If we want to get out of this ontological trap, we have to reset the question of the Rights of Man.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-1474885111417781">79</xref></sup> In the light of this reconstruction of Arendt’s critique of the Rights of Man, I argue that aporias, perplexities and paradoxes, understood usually in negative terms as paralysing quandaries, can indeed be crucial in rethinking human rights beyond their conventional binaries especially in times of crisis. In the face of the crisis triggered by massive scales of statelessness, Arendt shows how conventional accounts relying on these binaries, particularly the binary of nature versus history, render human rights either void or tautological in Rancière’s terms. Understood as natural rights grounded in some kind of a universally shared, abstract nature, human rights are assumed to exist independent of human plurality; yet, without intersubjective guarantees and mutual agreements that are possible only within a community of actors, human rights can be rendered meaningless and void, as the plight of the stateless reveals. Understood as historically grounded rights that we inherit as members of particularistic communities, however, human rights risk becoming tautological as they indicate nothing more than the rights of citizens and leave out those who are deprived of citizenship.</p>
<p>To use Rancière’s terms again, for purposes counter to his, Arendt ‘resets’ the question of human rights to think them anew beyond these conventional binaries that fail to respond to the crisis triggered by statelessness. This rethinking is exemplified by her efforts to rearticulate human rights as ‘a right to have rights’ – a rearticulation that is conspicuous by its absence in Rancière’s critique. Arendt tries to clarify this perplexing rearticulation in several ways; it indicates ‘a right to belong to some kind of organized community’, ‘to live in a framework where one is judged by one’s actions and opinions’ – in short, ‘the right of men to citizenship’ and ‘the right of every individual to belong to humanity’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-1474885111417781">80</xref></sup> Even more so than the ‘Jacobin patriotism of human rights’ that Arendt applauds in Clemenceau’s defence of Dreyfus, this new formulation resists reducing human rights to either the ‘rights of man’ or ‘the rights of citizens’ by insisting on the importance of both citizenship <italic>and</italic> humanity for guaranteeing rights. This attempt to refuse the either/or logic of the conventional binaries such as man/citizen, universal/particular, and nature/history<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-1474885111417781">81</xref></sup> can be seen especially in the striking formulation in the British edition of <italic>Origins</italic>, <italic>The Burden of Our Time</italic>:
<disp-quote>
<p>The Rights of Man can become implemented only if they become the <italic>prepolitical</italic> foundation of a new <italic>polity</italic>, the <italic>prelegal</italic> basis of a new <italic>legal</italic> structure, the, so to speak, <italic>prehistorical</italic> fundament from which the <italic>history</italic> of mankind will derive its essential meaning in much the same way Western civilization did from its own fundamental origin myths.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-1474885111417781">82</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As seen in this perplexing articulation, which is not without its own productive aporias, Arendt’s critique concludes with a rethinking of human rights that refuses to unequivocally determine the scope, subject and ground of these rights. Arendt’s own declaration – of a right that is deeply political yet cannot be fully guaranteed by any existing political community, a right that is in need of laws yet cannot be contained in any specific legal order, a right that is historically contingent yet resists any historicist determination – demonstrates that there are no easy resolutions to the perplexities of human rights. The goal of aporetic inquiry is not to find such resolutions in the form of underlying foundations or institutional models but instead to grapple with these perplexities to understand how they are manifested in new forms of rightlessness as well as in new struggles for equality that can reinvent the meaning of human rights.</p>
<p>This rearticulation of ‘a right to have rights’ is also important in terms of understanding the distinctive goals of Arendt’s aporetic critique of human rights. Similar to Socratic dialogues urging Athenian citizens to find the truthfulness of their own opinions by carefully examining them, Arendt’s critique does not aim at abandoning human rights but instead rendering them meaningful again. Setting the task of critique as rethinking, Arendt’s inquiry raises cautions against some of the more recent criticisms of human rights such as the one offered by Giorgio Agamben. Theoretically, as Arendt’s aporetic approach indicates, a critique attributing to human rights a singular, uniform logic fails to attend to the multiple, equivocal and contingent effects of human rights as a discourse characterized by aporias. Politically, calling for an emancipatory politics severed completely from human rights, such a critique risks overlooking the struggles that reclaim these rights in imaginative ways.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-1474885111417781">83</xref></sup> With its equivocal and contingent understanding of aporias, an Arendtian critique of human rights not only subjects their underlying assumptions and paradoxical effects to a relentless scrutiny but also attends to (indeed, as the brief discussion of Arendt’s perplexing notion of ‘a right to have rights’ indicates, participates in) such inventive practices of rearticulating these rights.</p>

First, as the tragic fate of the American Revolution demonstrates, even republican arrangements that have their origins in mutual promises can end up losing their potency when they fail to establish common spaces where citizens can act together. Second, Arendt also attends to the possible violent exclusions of a republican arrangement; in an often overlooked section of <italic>On Revolution</italic>, for example, she criticizes the Americans for failing to address poverty as a political problem, which left the poor ‘excluded from the light of the public realm’.

Rancière (n. 6), pp. 298–9, 301–302. This reading, however, overlooks the fact that Arendt uses the term ‘social’ in many different, and often conflicting, ways, not always suggesting a distinct realm with a given set of issues and actors. For further discussion, see especially Hanna Pitkin (1998) <italic>The Attack of the Blob: Hannah Arendt's Concept of the Social</italic>. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. In addition, Rancière’s claim that Arendt’s ‘archipolitical’ vision hinders a positive assessment of democratic rights struggles is quite questionable given her favourable account of the labour movement in <italic>The Human Condition</italic>.
