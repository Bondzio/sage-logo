<p>Reading this book for review was a joy, bringing me home to experiences here and leading me out of my comfort zone there. That’s part of the excitement of creativity, of ‘doing theology’. It is not until what happens next actually happens that we can know it for what it is, celebrate difference and delight in the dynamic it brings to our learning. Imagine, then, my reaction when I talked with a colleague about <italic>Presiding like a Woman</italic> and he asked if one of the chapters was ‘throwing like a girl’?! I suspect that if Rachael Heyhoe Flint had penned it, it would have fitted in seamlessly.</p>
<p>We have a book specifically about women presiding. In a perfect world it shouldn’t have to be so, but ‘so’ it has to be. To borrow the poet Audre Lorde’s words, ‘If I didn’t define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people’s fantasies for me and eaten alive.’ Women are often crunched into other people’s fantasies, and this is sharply true in the context of presidency, in whatever forum a woman presides.</p>
<p>The cover image for the book is Fire of Urgency by Doris Klein CSA. Of this image she writes, ‘We are women who embody the fire of urgency as we explore transformative power’. It seems to me that the transformative power lies in hearing women to speech.</p>
<p>The dictionary will tell you that ‘presiding’ means ‘To hold the position of authority; act as chairperson or president. To possess or exercise authority or control. <italic>Music</italic> To be the featured instrumental performer’. How that is experienced is the stuff of these essays. Designed to explore the distinctive qualities, nature and approach women bring to presidency, the book effectively does this. With proven track records as published academics and experienced practitioners, the contributors bring a richness of opinion and experience to the table when it comes to exploring the particularity of presiding like a woman. Men and women, ordained and lay, leaders in churches around the world, the different voices provide as much positive space as creative substance in which to reflect, to imagine and to appreciate the significance and importance of how women conduct worship when in the role of President at the Eucharist.</p>
<p>Each chapter of this is written expressly to prompt questions, giving a particular experience of women’s presidency to spark the debate. It is rich in its variety of food for thought, with every chapter being stimulating and challenging, whether or not the perspective is one you share. This also means that, if you have to, it’s pick-up and put-downable too.</p>
<p>Clearly, women’s voices tell of their own distinct contribution in presiding; primarily in liturgical leadership, but in other contexts too. Rooted and grounded in personal practice, we are invited to reflect on the significance of women’s presence as president, through gesture, song, holding, giving. To use Nicola Slee’s expression, each president is here variously describing reaction to holding the ‘creative tension between the needs of the individuals, the dynamic of the group and the purpose of the group’s life’, with generosity and the accuracy of a sugar rush. The contributors theologically reflect on different facets: receiving like a woman, presiding in ways unrecognized by the established churches, or describing the historic development of women as presidents. In most of the essays, the importance of reciprocity and relationship is named and explored. We are encouraged to think and learn in the company of Feminist Theological giants, leading us to the realization that feminist theological method claims ‘without community there is no liberation’.</p>
<p>So, women’s experience of presidency has distinctive contribution to our understanding of the privilege and power of the role in different contexts – as a teacher, as a priest, as a father… we read clearly that not all presiding like a woman is presiding <italic>as</italic> a woman. This, of course, we knew, but hearing a man’s story in the midst of a collection of women’s stories gives a clarity to the difference which is otherwise inarticulate, but this way it actually shouts its way into your head through your eyes (see, Alastair Barrett, p. 166).</p>
<p>In a parallel way to grown-up eco-theology being more than ‘God made the world, made us, it’s lovely so let’s look after it’, presiding like a woman is more than ‘being mother’ at tea time, making sure that we wash our hands before we sit down and don’t drop crumbs.</p>
<p><italic>Presiding Like a Woman</italic> tells an important story, not least an important ‘first chapter’ in Anglican church history – for we are still at the receiving hands of the first generation of ‘home-grown’ women priests.</p>
<p>The contributions are varied which is engaging, with each chapter being short enough to hold one’s interest even if not to share the particular theological perspective, for all have a degree of theological bottom/reflection/competence.</p>
<p>The variety of presentation is refreshing too – Nicola Slee’s poetry (not the only poet to use her gifts to ease us /open a window into her vision/open perspective).</p>
<p>Not afraid to ask questions ‘Poetry is not only dream and vision; it is the skeleton architecture of our lives. It lays the foundations for a future of change, a bridge across our fears of what has never been before.’ Like gracious hosts, Nicola Slee and Stephen Burns invite us into Babette’s feast. Here we enjoy stimulating thoughts and conversations, entertainment, refreshment without being overfed, no compromise but openly given for/as food for thought. Variety and balance in what we are given, witty and energizing.</p>
