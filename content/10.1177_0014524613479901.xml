<p>The title of this book could be read as a double entendre. Its subject is the four traditional ‘Last Things’ of Christian theology: heaven, hell, death, and judgment. Moreover, the author experienced a near-fatal stroke in 2007 and describes his recovery as being ‘brought back to life’ (p. 2). One may assume, then, that Thiselton is offering a very personal perspective when he writes, ‘To be reprieved from serious illness, or to have experienced near death, far from deflecting us from this life, can give our present life a new depth’ (p. 2). Thus writing from a ‘practical concern’ for the subject (p. ix) Thiselton presents in this book some seasoned theological, philosophical, and pastoral reflections on eschatology and the Christian hope. The book feels like a collection of essays rather than a tightly argued monograph. It is outlined chapter-by-chapter in an introduction.</p>
<p>In the first chapter Thiselton observes how contemporary Western culture has repressed thoughts of death. Nevertheless Thiselton claims, with Moltmann, that ‘honesty about death can be liberating and life-enhancing’ (p. 2). The chapter encourages a recovery of corporate Christian mourning and includes pastoral thoughts on dealing with lives cut short. Here and throughout Thiselton’s strength is in pulling diverse philosophical and theological thinkers into the conversation. The basic perspective of this chapter is well expressed in one of its concluding sentences: ‘Disbelief in life after death makes life meaningless; belief in life after death invites a working and provisional meaning, which is grounded in God’s promise and human trust; postresurrection experience will bring access to a full and definitive meaning of all things’ (p. 15).</p>
<p>The second and third chapters address doubters of different kinds. In response to the skepticism of an ‘evidence-based’ culture, Thiselton asserts in the second chapter that ‘we may look beyond the present only on the basis of <italic>promise</italic>’ (p. 20). As both Old and New Testaments demonstrate, promise invites neither presumption nor despair, but trust. Much of the second chapter draws on philosophy of language to explain how promises bring about ‘the future shaping of the world’ (p. 30). The promise of God thus provides the basis on which the book can proceed. The third chapter completes the argument by surveying a number of contemporary theologians and Church Fathers who read Scripture critically but still hear the divine voice speaking through it. The promises of God concerning the Last Things are thus reliably mediated through the Bible. Christians who struggle with doubt are reminded of the value of the sacraments, which are effective signs of the covenant and confirm God’s promise through all the senses.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter helpfully investigates the concept of waiting, a rare topic in books on the Last Things. After surveying the biblical terminology Thiselton introduces Wittgenstein to defend the idea that waiting conveys a state of readiness, not necessarily a heightened psychological state of excitement. Expecting the Parousia can be compatible with the tasks of everyday life. The chapter concludes with a review of Christian attitudes toward expectation in Luther, Tyconius, Jerome, Augustine, Victorinus and Käsemann, among others.</p>
<p>Philosophical insight is applied to biblical conundrums again in the fifth chapter. Thiselton starts by considering two seemingly opposed biblical traditions—one which implies that believers enter Christ’s presence immediately at death and one which describes believers meeting Christ, after some delay, at the general resurrection. Thiselton seeks to reconcile these perspectives by employing categories from Gilbert Ryle: texts which speak of departing to be with Christ at death offer the <italic>participant’s perspective</italic>—a believer dies and the next thing they experience is being with Christ—while those texts which assume a gap between the death of individual Christians and the general resurrection offer the <italic>observer’s perspective</italic>. Although this is an intriguing solution, one might wonder if it adequately explains texts such as Phil 1.18–26 and 2 Cor 5.1–10. Thiselton could have brought the history of interpretation to bear on this issue as he does at other points in the book. The remainder of the fifth chapter attempts to apply participant and observer perspectives to the issue of the millennium. Here Thiselton is less successful as the contrast he highlights is actually between early and contemporary readers (see p. 86) and different ways of reading biblical prophecy.</p>
<p>Next Thiselton provides basic but sound overviews of the return of Christ (chapter six) and the resurrection of the dead (chapter seven). In the sixth chapter Thiselton demonstrates the central importance of the hope of the Parousia by surveying the Pauline letters, the Gospels, Acts, Hebrews, the Gospel of John, Revelation, and the ‘postbiblical church’. The seventh chapter mainly deals with Thiselton’s interpretation of 1 Cor 15 and its crucial concept of the ‘spiritual body’ (v. 44). Those who have read Thiselton’s commentaries on 1 Corinthians will find themselves in familiar territory.</p>
<p>Chapter eight addresses two questions: Can holiness be given in a moment? and What is the nature of eternity? The first of these questions pertains to the doctrine of purgatory. (A lengthy sentence concerning Moltmann’s view of purgatory on p. 129 is curiously repeated nearly verbatim on p. 131.) Drawing on O. R. Jones’s book, <italic>The Concept of Holiness</italic>, Thiselton contends that while holiness ‘requires a long period of growth and time <italic>within the conditions of this world</italic>’ nevertheless ‘the perfect vision, the presence of God, and the dispositional character of holiness, suggest that it is otherwise <italic>within the conditions of the postresurrection world</italic>’ (p. 136). Regarding the nature of eternity Thiselton outlines three proposed understandings (timelessness, everlasting duration, and simultaneity) before arguing for his own view: multidimensional and transformed reality.</p>
<p>The chapter that may provoke the most controversy among readers is the ninth one on the nature of ‘hell’ and God’s wrath. In a discussion heavily indebted to David Powys’s study, <italic>‘Hell’: A Hard Look at a Hard Question</italic>, Thiselton finds a diversity of views on hell within the early church and the Bible. Claiming that ‘we find so many different threads even within the biblical writings that it would be unwise to privilege or to prioritize some things over others’ (p. 158), Thiselton challenges the traditional positions of universalism, annihilationism, and a vision of hell as everlasting torment. He stresses that wrath is not a permanent quality of God and is not the opposite of love. Furthermore, ‘wrath does <italic>not last eternally</italic> and does not reach beyond time’ (p. 159).</p>
<p>The tenth chapter is entitled ‘The Last Judgment and Justification by Grace through Faith’ and it touches upon a range of topics including joy in the face of judgment, the book of Judges, the concept of righteousness, ‘the “illocutionary” performative act of God’s verdictive speech-act in judgment’ (p. 171), and retribution. The line of argument is unclear. The chapter would have benefitted from thesis, transitional, and summary statements.</p>
<p>The final two chapters concern the beatific vision of God. Chapter eleven starts with a consideration of four distinct ‘meanings’ of God’s glory, though Thiselton’s occasional confusion of the verb ‘glorify’ with the noun ‘glory’ makes this more of a thematic discussion. The rest of chapter eleven discusses Revelation’s purpose and symbolic language. The final chapter projects what glorification of God after the resurrection will involve. Though much of Thiselton’s discussion here is speculative—but not unreasonable—Christian readers will probably enjoy it.</p>
<p>Overall this book was very helpful, especially in its philosophical and pastoral dimensions. The bibliography is dated in places but the major flaw of the book, in my view, is that it feels disjointed. The cross-referencing within chapters is awkward at times (e.g. the five references to chapter 11 on pages 106–108) and chapters 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 11 juxtapose distinct topics with little integration. Nevertheless, this book is replete with insight and wisdom gained over a lifetime of ministry and scholarship. Thiselton expresses a hope that ‘pastors and churchgoers, as well as scholars, teachers, and seminary students, will benefit from this book’ (p. xii)—a hope which will undoubtedly be realized. Thiselton has presented us with fresh approaches to subjects of vital interest.</p>

<p>Both reception history and more specifically patristic exegesis have seen a rapid growth as a focal point in academic study of the text of scripture. Here Burns bring together insights from patristic writings dealing with Paul’s longest, richest, and perhaps most theologically challenging letter – Romans.</p>
<p>After the preparatory matter, the book commences with a short introduction (pp. xxiii – xxvii) that orients the reader to this volume, and flags-up some the issues that attend the study of Romans. The topics covered include the structure or plan of the letter, some broad comments concerning early Christian interpretation of the epistle, highlighting textual difference in the textual forms available to various early commentators, discussion of criteria for selections included, and a note about the use of various translations. The selection of ancient authors includes Origen, Rufinus, Cyril of Alexandria, Pelagius, Chrysostom, Abrosiaster, Augustine, and Theodoret. There are comments on every section of Romans, and hence the book functions as a compendium to nuggets of early Christian interpretation of the text. The value of the book is as an entrée to patristic interpretation. Yet this strength can also become a weakness. The selection of texts is precisely that – a selection. One can be left with the impression that patristic authors wrote nothing other than purple prose, but perhaps the greater danger is that by excerpting these selections from their larger literary context one loses a wider sense of the way patristic exegesis was done, and thus lacks the context in which certain arguments or interpretations were advanced.</p>
<p>The main function of the book is, therefore, to get readers interested in delving into the full texts of early Christian commentators. In this goal Burns provides a wise and sure-footed guide in relation to the selections presented. At the end of the volume some bibliographical resources are offered to assist further, more in depth study of patristic commentaries. Within the parameters of the series this is a helpful and well-executed volume.</p>
