<abstract>
<p>The global financial crisis has brought discussion of financialization to the fore. Yet, what is notable is the extent to which the dysfunctional micro-economic consequences of financialization at firm level have gone largely unremarked and unchanged. By revisiting and renewing the disconnected capitalism thesis, this article seeks to rectify the omission of a focus on financialization and the workplace and develops a complex and nuanced bigger picture that explores in some detail changes in accumulation, corporate, work and employment domains. The dual objective is thus to understand the dynamics and drivers of such changes and to identify the extent to which financialization has shaped them. In identifying patterns of connection and disconnection across and within domains, a recurrent theme concerns financialization interacting with, accelerating and exacerbating longer term trends such as labour market insecurity, externalization and internationalization.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article revisits and extends the thesis expounded in <italic>Disconnected Capitalism: Why Employers Can’t Deliver Their Side of the Bargain</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0950017013479827">Thompson, 2003</xref>), referred to from now on as the disconnected capitalism thesis (DCT). While the original was not the first to discuss financialization, its impact may, in part, be attributed to linking such emergent trends to the workplace. Though the subsequent global financial crisis (GFC) has brought considerably greater attention to financialization, including in this journal, the judgement of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0950017013479827">Martin et al. (2008</xref>: 120) that ‘the links to labour […] remain tenuously explained and in need of further consideration’ is still pertinent. Such a reconsideration also enables a number of the objectives of this Special Issue to be met: to reflect on the direction of travel of the sociology of work and employment, to engage with key debates and to reflect on and advance theoretical understandings.</p>
<p>The article begins by briefly summarizing the original argument and outlining ways in which it has been picked up and developed by others. It then goes on to distinguish the approach and goals from other ‘big picture’ perspectives, leading to an expanded version of the multi-domain, multi-level framework originally advocated. This is then used to explore some detailed changes in relevant domains: accumulation, corporate, work and employment. The dual objective of the article is thus to understand the dynamics and drivers of such changes and to identify the extent to which financialization has shaped them.</p>

<title>The DCT thesis</title>
<p>The central argument was that there was a growing divergence and dysfunctionality between employer objectives in the work and employment spheres. Labour was asked to invest more of themselves (effort, commitment, new aspects of labour power such as emotions) at work, yet employers were retreating from investment in human capital, a retreat manifested in declining security, career ladders, pensions and the like. This divergence was primarily driven by the pursuit of shareholder value within an increasingly financialized capitalism. Growth strategies for firms were directed to a simultaneous squeezing of labour and more active management of corporate assets, manifested in delayering, disaggregation, downsizing and divestment. Local, unit and functional managers were tasked with responsibility for pursuing high performance from labour, but they ultimately lacked the capacity to sustain the enabling conditions.</p>
<p>As a result, the DCT was pessimistic about the sustainability of high performance work system strategies as the foundation for either firm competitiveness or business models. A number of conceptual consequences flow from this. Emphasis should be placed as much on the dynamics of capital markets as the traditional focus on product and labour markets. Attention should also be paid as much to the cohesiveness of regimes as to their continuity. Such disconnections and their largely negative consequences for innovation and stability at firm level and for opportunity and security for labour belie the optimistic promises of a new stable and progressive settlement associated with post-Fordist and related perspectives such as the knowledge economy or informational capitalism.</p>
<p>It is important to note what the article did not do or do sufficiently well. First, it did not adequately identify the mechanisms through which shareholder value pressures are ‘translated’ into workplace outcomes and to a lesser extent which new (or old) economic actors facilitated or mediated such processes. Second, it did not trace the impacts and causal mechanisms in detail in any particular context. Third, it only hinted at responses from labour. Fortunately such issues have been picked up by other researchers who have applied and extended the DCT.</p>
<p>In this journal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0950017013479827">Clark (2009)</xref> has identified the private equity business model as a significant mechanism of financialization, further outlining the negative impacts on stable employment relations from the short term focus and requirement to service debt of such firms. Cushen focuses on the financialization of organizational structures, identifying a transfer of powers from professional managers to boards of directors and corporate level structures more directly accountable to shareholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0950017013479827">Cushen and Thompson, 2012</xref>). The latter also demonstrates the impact on the conditions of employees and their growing anger and insecurity. This theme is also prominent in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0950017013479827">McCann’s (forthcoming)</xref> account of disconnections leading to a growing ‘crisis of attachment’ among IT workers affected by outsourcing (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0950017013479827">Jenkins and Delbridge, 2007</xref>). Even when not applying the thesis, a range of studies have referenced it in broad support of the argument that financialization in the economy has led to divergent work and employment demands and weakened capacity to sustain collaborative, progressive practices (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0950017013479827">Cullinane and Dundon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0950017013479827">Delbridge, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0950017013479827">Ellis and Taylor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0950017013479827">Jenkins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0950017013479827">Reed, 2005</xref>). Recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017013479827">Appelbaum et al. (forthcoming)</xref> is notable for expanding the emphasis on broken bargains or ‘implicit contracts’ to consider a wider range of stakeholders.</p>

<title>Paradigms, projections and domains</title>
<p>This section moves on to broader considerations of what kind of argument the thesis is and the extent to which it can be built on and generalized. The DCT puts forward a partial rather than paradigm break argument, identifying elements of continuity and discontinuity from Fordism or managerial capitalism. Ultimately post-Fordism faded as a source of explanation of change because its core claims about markets, skills and employment relations turned out to be deeply flawed. While all model building tends to overstate system cohesiveness, Fordism and post-Fordism tended to inherit the over-determined conceptual architecture from regulation theory. Such attempts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0950017013479827">Jessop, 1992</xref>) have the merit of seeking to connect institutional domains. However, in creating a ‘unified account’ of capitalist development, over-ambitious goals of linking phenomena from macro-economic structures, state formations, labour markets and processes within the same explanatory framework, inevitably break down or collapse in a welter of exceptions and variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0950017013479827">Thompson and Vincent, 2010</xref>: 57–8). Though there are exceptions (for illustration, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0950017013479827">Vidal, 2012</xref>) the framework is largely functionalist. Regimes of accumulation, constituted primarily by particular patterns of production, consumption, circulation and distribution, are ‘guided’ by modes of regulation, encompassing institutional structures and norms at various ‘extra-economic’ levels. Regulation is assigned an a priori purpose of securing the expanded reproduction of capitalism and ‘a strategy is sought which could be adequate to reproducing it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0950017013479827">Jessop, 1990</xref>: 195). The issues of agency and connectedness are, therefore, obscured or obviated.</p>
<p>An attempt at developing a more credible, yet still circumspect big(ger) picture heuristic was begun in the 2003 article, but left unfinished. There, it was argued that political economy, firm governance, employment relations and the labour process should be treated as ‘distinctive spheres’ and patterns of connection and disconnection within their different trajectories be sought out. Building on the initial observations, the intention here is to argue that the dynamics of and inter-relations between four institutional domains should be explicitly considered, including the extent of influence from financialization.</p>
<p><italic>Accumulation</italic>: there is no single logic of capital that drives accumulation, the domain refers to the interconnections and pattern of dominance in the (industrial, financial and commercial) circuits of capital. This frames and shapes the structure of competition between capitals, models of growth and forms of coordination of global economic governance, sources of power for elites and fractions of capital.</p>
<p><italic>Corporate</italic>: refers primarily to the modes of coordination and power relations between firms and to an extent the complex relations between sites within them, with reference to general mechanisms (market, hierarchy, network) and particular forms (e.g. global value chains or production networks, supply chains); but can also refer to corporate governance and other structures that articulate relations between the firm and various circuits of capital.</p>
<p><italic>Work</italic>: refers to the technical and social divisions of labour, hierarchies of skill and expertise, relations of control and coordination within the labour process. This gives rise to focus on issues such as socio-technical systems, new production concepts and lean production.</p>
<p><italic>Employment</italic>: refers to employment and industrial relations policies that characterize national institutional structures. But the term can also refer to any distinctive arrangement of internal and external labour markets, skill formation and wage setting structures and institutions, industrial relations and employee representation/voice systems.</p>
<p>This kind of contingent, multi-level analysis seeking to re-connect spheres and literatures, begun but not fully elaborated in the original DCT, has received considerable support from other researchers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0950017013479827">Edwards, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0950017013479827">Gleadle and Cornelius, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0950017013479827">Ramirez and Rainbird, 2010</xref>). These categories are not exhaustive and are contributions to a bigger picture. In particular, they only indirectly deal with the state and related political projects. However, the purpose of this article is to outline some basic trends, connections and disconnections across these four territories of analysis.</p>

<title>Domain changes: some trends</title>
<sec id="section5-0950017013479827">
<title>Financialized capitalism as new accumulation regime</title>
<p>It was widely asserted in social theory and public policy that the knowledge-based economy or if preferred ‘informational capitalism’ was hegemonic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017013479827">Castells, 1996</xref>). Such trends were and are, however, confined to relatively marginal supply-side domains or particular knowledge-intensive sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0950017013479827">Thompson and Harley, 2012</xref>). Instead, shifts in the dynamic of accumulation have produced a new regime that can be designated as financialized capitalism. The term ‘regime’ is associated with the previously-discussed regulation theory and has connotations with its totalizing characteristics. However, this article uses it in a more restricted sense to refer to a growth or macro-economic regime whose source of profits is increasingly through financial channels and financial engineering rather than production and product markets. Financial developments drive the pattern and pace of accumulation; and the drivers even of non-financial firms are increasingly focused more on enhanced returns in capital markets. Though the emphasis may differ in some respects across the authors, this is consistent with arguments and evidence from most post-Keynesian, regulation and Marxist commentators on financialization or finance-dominated capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017013479827">Appelbaum et al., forthcoming</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0950017013479827">Bellamy Foster and Magdoff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0950017013479827">Froud et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0950017013479827">Hein and Truger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0950017013479827">Krippner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0950017013479827">Lapavitsas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0950017013479827">Stockhammer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0950017013479827">Williams, 2000</xref>). All focus to some extent on the primacy of finance over production, consistent with the emphasis in the 2003 article on the concept of shifts in the circuits of capital developed within labour process theory.</p>
<p>There is some additional commonality around other characteristics and mechanisms of financialization. These include the distributional dynamics of a declining wage share, falling real investment, shifts in the composition of aggregate demand and wider means of extracting value. The latter is particularly important for labour. A number of commentators emphasize the emergence of households and workers’ revenue – in some countries at least – as a focal point for accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0950017013479827">Bryan and Rafferty, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0950017013479827">Lapavitsas, 2011</xref>). A consistent theme examines new focal agents and intermediaries, including investment banks, private equity firms and global consultancies.</p>
<p>It is true that some regulationist writers continue to make attempts to link the above trends to a correspondence with a neo-liberal mode of regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0950017013479827">Stockhammer, 2008</xref>). However, while it is the case that capital market liberalization and de-regulation has facilitated the spread of financialized practices and the subordination of institutions of global economic governance to financial logics, the link between financialization and neo-liberalism is more complex and contingent. The former has increasingly spread across varieties of capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017013479827">Appelbaum et al., forthcoming</xref>) and the trend towards a ‘competition state’ whereby in a world system of interlocking manufacture, trade and finance, nation states are under enhanced pressure to frame growth strategies in the light of new global market disciplines is a longer term one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0950017013479827">Elger and Burnham, 2001</xref>). Financialization has given an added twist to that process, the global financial crisis revealing the degree of inter-connectedness of banking systems and the vulnerability of state and supra-state agencies to new market powers and pressures. Individual states and their institutional architectures, will, of course, still be characterized by differential exposure to capital market pressures. In other words, there are still ‘different paths or trajectories of financialization’, in part contingent on political struggles and degrees of economic pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017013479827">Engelen and Konings, 2010</xref>: 617).</p>
<p>The DCT was and is not a comprehensive theorization and mapping of financialization as a whole. It focuses on particular institutional inter-relations and on the dynamics and the negative consequences of shifts in circuits of capital for labour and the sustainability of workplace-based productivity bargains with employers. The emergence of new markets for corporate control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0950017013479827">Lazonick and O’Sullivan, 2000</xref>) and the active management of corporate assets through downsizing and divestment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017013479827">Blackburn, 2006</xref>) has not only created greater instability at firm level, but has weakened coherent institutional complementarities in national economies and the links between them and firm strategies. Such arguments have been strengthened and widened by more recent research from a similar perspective (see in particular <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017013479827">Appelbaum et al., forthcoming</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0950017013479827">
<title>Corporate structures and governance</title>
<p>Most work and employment scholars have traditionally shown little interest in or understanding of this sphere. Early post-Fordist arguments tended to echo popular management and organization theory on trends towards development of loose, dispersed and decentralized network forms, following the so-called collapse of the vertically integrated firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0950017013479827">Mulgan, 1989</xref>). It is important to note some of the supposed consequences for work and employment relations – including the growth of collaboration through teamworking, project groups and communities of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017013479827">Adler, 2001</xref>). While it is accepted that such developments are more likely among professionals and in knowledge-intensive firms, they are seen as part of a shift from market and hierarchy to trust as means of coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0950017013479827">Thompson G, 2005</xref>). When coordination is not attributed to trust or culture, new forms of ICT are presented as facilitating the articulation of complex networks of parent-subsidiary relations and dispersed units across national boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0950017013479827">Castells, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, a review of the literature and evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0950017013479827">Alvesson and Thompson, 2005</xref>: 495) reported that ‘With respect to interorganizational relations, neither surveys nor case studies give any significant support to the idea that pyramidal hierarchies are replaced by looser networks.’ A key insight of critical research is to distinguish between the dispersal of units and delegated operational autonomy on the one hand and strengthened financial and other controls by the central structures on the other. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0950017013479827">Ackroyd (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0950017013479827">Harrison (1994)</xref> show in their work on British and US firms, though structures are becoming more decentred, ‘directed’ networks retain significant power and strategic capacity at the centre or ‘hub’. This is confirmed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0950017013479827">Appay’s (1998)</xref> French studies of ‘constrained autonomy’ in inter-firm relations.</p>
<p>Other contrasts and correctives to the post-bureaucratic line on corporate structures can be derived from the increased number of critical researchers with an interest in capitalist political economy who are utilizing global value chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0950017013479827">Flecker and Meil, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0950017013479827">Taylor, 2010</xref>) or global production network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0950017013479827">Coe et al., 2008</xref>) frameworks. The former focus largely on the governance patterns and power dynamics between lead and supplier firms at sector level; while the latter are interested in a broader set of relations of power, positionality and value capture between all relevant firm and extra-firm actors within a network. Also notable is the growing power of buyer-driven supply chains, such as those dominated by large supermarkets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0950017013479827">Gereffi, 1994</xref>), that can dictate price, performance and even patterns of labour organization and usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0950017013479827">Newsome et al., 2009</xref>). Such developments can also be linked to trends towards systemic rationalization whereby firms increasingly seek profitability across the whole value chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0950017013479827">Altmann and Deiß, 1998</xref>). Logistics and other functions in the supply chain and global production networks play a greater role and can lead to a squeeze on labour either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>Financialization connects to such processes in a number of important ways. The strengthening of a market for corporate control accelerates the trend towards structural disaggregation or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0950017013479827">Martin et al. (2008</xref>: 126) call the decomposition (and therefore revaluing) of capital assets. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0950017013479827">Blackburn (2006)</xref> refers to the ‘disposable corporation’, but this can be extended to the increased trade of particular corporate assets as activist investors such as private equity firms seek to realize additional shareholder value. Again, this is likely to undermine stability of employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0950017013479827">Clark, 2009</xref>). This perspective allows the role of ICT to be thought about in a different and more sceptical way: focusing on its capacity in a disaggregated and directed network to enhance surveillance and performance management and strengthen financial control systems. The resultant resource allocation models frequently lead to a cascading down of monitoring, target setting for cost savings and performance measures that tighten controls and reduce security for large sections of the workforce.</p>
<p>A second key connection is the financialization of organizational structures, strengthening of corporate powers and weakening of other stakeholder claims. The realignment of owner-management relations and securing the loyalty of and support for speculative, short term behaviours of corporate agents at senior executive level is increasingly secured through practices such as stock options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0950017013479827">Henwood, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0950017013479827">Lazonick, 2009</xref>). The negative consequences for labour of this ‘convergence of the new top managers’ and shareholders’ interests’ is outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0950017013479827">Widmar’s (2011</xref>: 672) study of the transformation in the orientation of previously stakeholder-oriented Swiss firms. In turn, this is linked to the transfer of powers, previously referred to, from local, unit-level managers to corporate executives more directly accountable to shareholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0950017013479827">Dore, 2008</xref>). Targets set from above can constrain the capacity of the former to provide appropriate rewards and opportunities to employees, even when they have delivered high performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0950017013479827">Cushen and Thompson, 2012</xref>). This is confirmed in the research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0950017013479827">Howcroft and Richardson (2012)</xref> on the growth of shared service centres in the context of global outsourcing of back office functions. Managers complained that they had limited influence over budgeting and were under continual pressure to cut labour costs and restructure operations to meet capital market requirements. In the case of private equity financing and takeovers, new, outside owners can undermine local decision making and systems of company-level bargaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017013479827">Appelbaum et al., forthcoming</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0950017013479827">
<title>Work</title>
<p>The work sphere is central to the disconnection argument in that the thesis recognizes a partial break from Fordism and Taylorism in which capital is seeking a qualitative intensification of labour power. In this sense the DCT accepts there is some truth to claims concerning goals of high performance work systems and discretionary effort, but challenges whether these are deliverable or sustainable given trends in capitalist political economy. To that extent, key trends in the work domain predate financialization.</p>
<p>What has been happening? The basic trends with respect to manufacturing are well known and reported: functional flexibility, multi-tasking, teamworking, continuous improvement, information sharing and problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0950017013479827">White et al., 2004</xref>). While the collective labour of the group involves expanded cognitive abilities and extra-functional skills, this has been accompanied by greater standardization rather than increased autonomy or generalized up-skilling. The pattern of neo-Taylorist standardization and measurement, with post-Taylorist accessing of tacit skills and knowledge is particularly characteristic of lean production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0950017013479827">Vidal, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Mass service work shows some similar trends, with frontline workers being required to contribute to low level operational decisions and enhanced customer interactions, but at the same time the deepening of standardized, scripted tasks, subject to high degrees of surveillance and technical controls. The spread of low wage, low skill service work has been characteristic of post-industrial societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0950017013479827">Frenkel, 2005</xref>). The increased reliance of interactive service work on the ‘soft skills’ of employees, ranging from simple behavioural scripting to more complex emotional and aesthetic labour, has been particularly notable. Call centres have become emblematic of the new trends in mass service work, combining intensive surveillance and technical controls, with heavy reliance on the mobilization of emotions and other soft competencies rather than technical skills and knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0950017013479827">Taylor and Bain, 1999</xref>). Call centres are thus good exemplars of the growth of hybridized control systems that combine technical, bureaucratic and normative dimensions.</p>
<p>Trends in work regimes represent neither up-skilling nor deskilling, but a broader and shallower palette of skills, with intensive utilization by capital of a greater variety of sources of labour power. One outcome is rising intensity and work pressures. In various studies from professionals to customer service representatives, employees report reduced staffing levels in response to heightened market pressures and ratcheting up of management of performance; and stress and emotional exhaustion as they try to balance the twin pressures of demands for quality and quantity in high surveillance environments (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017013479827">Burchell et al., 2002</xref>). Such trends are present in most European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0950017013479827">Green, 2006</xref>). A related trend is the phenomenon of the growing elasticity of work, in which enhanced work demands and responsibilities stretch into home and private life, resulting in further time squeeze and families absorbing the burden of changes. A major study of the UK Department of Education and Employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0950017013479827">Hogarth et al., 2000</xref>) reported a long hours culture, with staff (often in professional and managerial roles) in most workplaces working significantly in excess of standard hours. Other UK surveys demonstrate extensive ‘negative job-to-home spillover’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0950017013479827">White et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>What is reasonable to infer is that financialization has exacerbated many of these trends. As a number of commentators have noted, taking labour out and squeezing extra performance from those who remain is a central mechanism for achieving shareholder value goals in the process of asset management. A similar pattern can be seen in parts of the public sector. There is evidence of the penetration of lean working methods, even as far as clerical labour in the UK civil service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0950017013479827">Carter et al., 2011</xref>). But the importing of private sector ‘best practices’ and politically generated performance targets are medium term trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0950017013479827">Hood, 2006</xref>). The consequences of post-GFC debt reduction programmes have, however, fallen primarily on public sector workers, not just in terms of job losses, but also work intensification.</p>
<p>Taking both long term and financialization trends into account, ‘high performance’ work is largely an outcome of performance management and market discipline rather than internalized normative controls, discretionary effort and self-policing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0950017013479827">McGovern et al., 2007</xref>). Normative interventions promoting commitment and focusing on cultural change are becoming less relevant or marginalized and there is simply not enough evidence of employee self-government to make the latter scenarios credible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0950017013479827">Thompson, 2011</xref>). In work environments saturated with sophisticated monitoring of performance, workers are largely unable to exercise significant voice. This is confirmed in the UK Skills Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0950017013479827">Felstead et al., 2004</xref>) and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0950017013479827">Green’s (2006)</xref> review of European trends, with six countries registering declining discretion, two rising and seven relatively stable in the 1990s.</p>
<p>As ever, it is important to recognize the diversity of work contexts. Professional and expert labour is much more likely to be undertaking project work in, for example, ICT sectors, creative industries and new media. Higher skill and knowledge utilization, greater autonomy and opportunities for learning are more likely in such circumstances. However, studies of software developers and a variety of other professions have shown increases in both the quality and intensity of work, driven by enhanced client demands, globalized competition and technological change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0950017013479827">Konzelmann et al., 2007</xref>). Intense time pressures can be characteristic of project work. Knowledge management systems are also responsible for increased regulation of expert labour as firms in sectors such as pharmaceuticals and biotech seek to speed-up the ‘molecule to market’ time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0950017013479827">McKinlay, 2005</xref>). It is also widely acknowledged that the work of public sector professionals and semi-professionals in many countries has become subject to greater regulation, audit and targets.</p>

<title>Employment</title>
<p>It was a central claim of the original DCT that insecure employment was driven primarily by the pursuit of shareholder value and undermined work-based bargains. Increased flexibility and risk have been long term themes of research on employment regimes. In her survey of changes following the decay of the Fordist model of male workers employed under standard employment contracts within a single organization, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0950017013479827">Rubery (2005)</xref> notes the decline of internal labour markets and the ‘seemingly relentless’ trend towards diverse, contingent, non-standard and numerically flexible labour contracts, though mediated by the form and strength of the regulatory system. Irrespective of the numbers involved, there is widespread acceptance that a key driver of change is externalization of labour markets, requiring that firms’ internal and external boundaries be redrawn, bringing into question employment contracts and the location of work.</p>
<p>At the optimistic end, some commentators have spoken of new kinds of flexible employees who ‘own’ their own knowledge and skills, dubbed free or portfolio workers and ‘entreployees’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0950017013479827">Hamel and Prahalad, 1996</xref>). This notion can be linked to a related assertion that the decline in the traditional ‘psychological contract’ focusing on employment security and corporate career ladders is being replaced by firms providing opportunities and transferable skills to help people become more <italic>employable</italic>, thus furthering a career across organizations and within occupational communities. It is important to acknowledge that non-standard does not necessarily mean casual or low skill. Some independent contractors have relatively beneficial employment conditions and scientists, engineers, teachers, ICT specialists and nurses are among the ranks of temporary employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0950017013479827">Barley and Kunda, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0950017013479827">White et al., 2004</xref>). Yet this perspective of positive externalization has large holes. The labour market is not being flooded by armies of mobile, high powered knowledge workers whose ownership of their own assets has companies at their mercy. In fact optimistic predictions of predominance of growth in high quality, knowledge work jobs have proven inaccurate. Polarization and a hollowing out of the middle is the main trend where expansion takes place at either end, but is weighted towards the bottom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0950017013479827">Goos and Manning, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0950017013479827">Vidal, 2012</xref>). Nor is there any reliable evidence that large firms have invested in new systems to support employability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0950017013479827">Hallier, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum there have been pessimistic claims of emerging ‘Brazilianization’ of the labour market – ‘The spread of temporary and insecure employment, discontinuity and informality into Western societies […] attractive, highly skilled and well paid employment is on its way out’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0950017013479827">Beck, 2000</xref>: 1–2). Without the geographic marker, such themes have re-emerged in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0950017013479827">Standing’s (2011)</xref> claims concerning the rise of a ‘precariat’ who subsist on a stream of insecure ‘bits and pieces’, short term jobs. Again, there are some trends that support such arguments, notably multiple job holding of insecure low paid work in the lower reaches of the service sector, often among female workers. In the UK, estimates put the figure at 5 per cent of UK employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0950017013479827">Nolan and Wood, 2003</xref>). Indeed, this figure may be an underestimate given the likelihood of employers and employees disguising off-the-books and other forms of work in the margins of the economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0950017013479827">McDowell and Christopherson, 2009</xref>: 337). Though the robustness of the precariat as a class or even a labour market category is doubtful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0950017013479827">Kalleberg et al., 2012</xref>), it does seem to connect to the experiences of marginalized young people in post-crash Southern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0950017013479827">O’Reilly et al., 2011</xref>: 587). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0950017013479827">Vidal (2012)</xref> is correct to point to the structural expansion of labour market insecurity linked to externalization and the growth of low waged work, but designating a new regime as ‘Waltonist’ (after Wal-Mart) risks under-playing sectoral specificities. In the UK and many other European countries at least, there is little evidence of systemic casualization and as internal comparisons across the OECD show, there is no consistent, long term pattern of increases in job insecurity or categories such as temporary work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0950017013479827">Fevre, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>There is no single trend because the state and national labour market institutions are still mediators of change, much more so than in the sphere of work relations. As the most extensive study of low waged work in Europe and the USA shows, there is no consistent relationship between that work and labour market insecurity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0950017013479827">Bosch and Gautié, 2011</xref>). States still have some capacity to give employers differential incentives to employ and reward labour in particular contractual categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0950017013479827">O’Reilly et al., 2011</xref>), resulting in a spectrum of ‘after’ Fordist employment regimes. So, is the outcome just continued diversity across a medium term trend towards increased externalization? In part yes, but not ‘just’. There are underlying trends at the interface of employment and work regimes that indicate a different version of the ‘age of insecurity’ thesis and one that gives much more weight to financialization alongside long term secular trends on flexibility.</p>
<p>One of the most significant is fragmented employment systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0950017013479827">Marchington et al., 2005</xref>). This term denotes the shift from the dominance of a single employer model to complex inter-organizational arrangements including a variety of contracting out arrangements and use of temporary and agency workers in both the private and public sectors. Similar trends can be seen at a global level in service level agreements between parties in the financial services value chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0950017013479827">Taylor, 2010</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0950017013479827">Bosch (2010)</xref> notes, fragmentation is seldom a reflection of actual changes in the labour process, but derives from strategic choices about who and how to employ by firms seeking cost savings. The consequent blurring of boundaries, combined with previously noted trends towards systemic rationalization and perpetual restructuring, tends to tighten cost pressures, undermine job security and introduce different pay structures and rates.</p>
<p>Though ‘inclusive’ employment regimes (such as flexicurity in Denmark) use collective bargaining, non-wage benefits and other measures to cushion the negative effects of competitive and corporate pressures and reduce the share of low waged work, the protective capacity of labour market institutions (as well as trade unions) is diminishing. As a result employer strategies increasingly take advantage of ‘holes’ in the fabric of employment regimes to shift more of the burden of risk from capital to labour. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0950017013479827">Heyes (2011)</xref> notes that within the EU, measures operating under the banner of flexicurity have tended to be geared towards eroding employment protection, resulting in the dominance of flexibility over security. Such trends require the notion of insecurity to be broadened from narrow concerns with issues such as rates of job tenure. Restructuring, transfers of risk inside and outside work, plus weakened protection help to account for multi-dimensional and rising subjective fears of insecurity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0950017013479827">Burchell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0950017013479827">Heery and Salmon, 2000</xref>). Though there are some inevitable tensions between ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’, it is important not to repeat unhelpful distinctions such as core and periphery from previous flexibility debates. Job and work insecurity increasingly affects skilled, professional and managerial workers who are no longer shielded from downsizing, delayering, intensification of work and performance management.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p>The contribution of this article is twofold. It has demonstrated the value of extended and applied versions of the DCT, identifying further how mechanisms of financialization shape work and workplace outcomes. In addition, the article has sought to map key and core trends across four inter-related domains, locating patterns of connection and disconnection.</p>
<p>To the extent that there is a unifying theme across these wide-ranging trends, it is about financialization interacting with, accelerating and exacerbating longer term trends such as labour market insecurity, externalization and internationalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0950017013479827">Vidal, 2012</xref>: 10). Take for example the globalization of back office work identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0950017013479827">Howcroft and Richardson (2012)</xref>. Shareholder value logic drives or intensifies continual restructuring and outsourcing that leads to spatial dispersal of production in search of the optimal combination of skills and costs. Such restructuring creates complex governance structures that are held together by ICT systems and service level agreements that allow for systematic performance comparison and capacity to shift and reduce resources. Centralized reporting and corporate control over sub-units operates effectively with standardization of processes and labour, leading to fragmentation, interchangeability and insecurity for labour.</p>
<p>The concept of disconnection is useful in two senses. First it highlights particular outcomes such as contradictory employer objectives in work and employment domains. The high performance from labour has been extracted, but in most circumstances the supporting employment <italic>system</italic> from capital has not been provided. The double disconnection between more demanding work and the failure of employment and corporate governance support structures help to situate what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0950017013479827">Green (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0950017013479827">Coats (2009)</xref>describe as a paradox concerning job quality. Most jobs, though in different ways, have become more demanding and while that means that for some, they are more interesting and challenging, the jobs are less secure, harder and subject to greater surveillance and performance targets. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that a downward spiral of falling commitment and trust is observed (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0950017013479827">CIPD, 2007</xref>). Employees have not ‘bought into’ corporate or managerial norms, but post-Fordist insecurity has not yet proven to be a potent source of labour mobilization.</p>
<p>Second, it directs attention to the absence of ‘structural coherence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0950017013479827">Jessop, 1999</xref>) and capacity to generate mutual gains among economic actors that any stable post-Fordist regime would require. Financialized capitalism as a growth regime is inherently unstable at macro and micro levels, in part because ‘corporate governance, finance, financial markets and the higher reaches of management [have] been increasingly disconnected from the internal value-generating side of an enterprise’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0950017013479827">Sorge, 2011</xref>: 185). This has become a public policy issue with the emphasis on re-balancing the economy following the GFC. But what is remarkable about the GFC and its aftermath is the extent to which the dysfunctional micro-economic consequences of financialization at firm level have gone largely unremarked and unchanged as activist investors and shareholder value metrics continue to inflict damage on a variety of stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017013479827">Appelbaum et al., forthcoming</xref>). This damage is obscured both by the origins of the crisis in securitization, banking debt and the bursting of an asset price bubble and by the misleading talk of the gap between finance and the ‘real’ economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0950017013479827">Thompson and Harley, 2012</xref>). As has been indicated, firms have become both players and playthings in the financialization game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0950017013479827">Lapavitsas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0950017013479827">Montgomerie and Williams, 2009</xref>). The GFC has not significantly altered those trends, though it has again exacerbated the consequences through recession and restructuring in the private sector and displacement of labour as the burden of debt reduction is placed upon the public sector.</p>
<p>How generalizable trends concerning financialization, its connections and consequences are is of course open to question. For example, some sectors are clearly more globalized than others, which means that convergent tendencies do not apply equally across all economies, introducing a variety of (national) capitalism arguments back into the picture. This article draws primarily, though not exclusively, on UK and North American evidence and, as discussed earlier, wage setting and welfare institutions at national level provide for some protection and variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0950017013479827">Bosch and Gautié, 2011</xref>). However, while it is true that <italic>after</italic> Fordism, there are still a series of disconnected capital<italic>isms</italic>, institutionalist perspectives remain underpowered in addressing issues associated with capitalist political economy in general and the penetration of capital markets across different economies in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0950017013479827">Appelbaum et al., forthcoming</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0950017013479827">Engelen and Konings, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Appelbaum et al. also argue that new loci for value creation and decision making offer a challenge to approaches such as labour process theory and other perspectives that focus primarily on the employment relationship. However, the case has already been made that the labour process remains a focal point of productivity gains, restructuring and value capture as part of the delivery of targets to shareholders. Indeed the emphasis on headcount reduction and performance management in some of their own cases illustrates this point. While changes in the circuits of capital require new ways of thinking about workplace change and greater analytic connections between domain changes, the DCT was already nudging labour process research away from workplace-centric ways of seeing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0950017013479827">Rafferty and Wright, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0950017013479827">Thompson and Vincent, 2010</xref>). A revised and updated DCT accepts the continued need for a variety of concepts and methodologies to grasp the new dynamics of capitalist political economy. As a distinctive approach to understanding systemic dysfunctionalities in the shifting circuits of capital, it offers not a ‘unified theory’, but a contribution towards a complex and uneven larger picture.</p>
