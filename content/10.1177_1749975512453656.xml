<p>What is the role, if any, of professional music criticism in the age of the internet, and what are the potential consequences of its likely demise? How do we evaluate the claim that the erosion of traditional forms of cultural authority, including professional criticism, is inherently democratic? To address these questions, this paper compares professional music criticism with the technologically-mediated forms of cultural judgment that have increasingly replaced it, analyzing the shift from aesthetics to consensus as the basis for cultural judgment. Rather than signaling the end of cultural authority, the recent transformations of the music world are marked by the emergence of authority of a different kind.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>While the last 20 years have been a period of significant change in the production of art and culture, the transformation of music in this period has been nearly complete. The ease with which it can be reduced to electronic bits and the relative comfort of listening to music through computers, headphones or hand-held devices has made its integration with new digital technologies appear seamless. Given the scope of these transformations, critical discourses of any kind that can add to our understanding of these changes and assess their impact should be in great demand. Yet, professional music criticism in the US is in a steep decline. In budget-cutting moves, major newspapers are dropping their arts coverage and music magazines have folded at an astonishing rate. Some popular music criticism has migrated to the Internet, though most critics report that they cannot earn any money from blogging. The undeniable fact is that ‘expert’ opinion seems superfluous when an interested music lover or consumer can simply click on a website and hear a sample of the music herself. Unlike in the case of news journalism, where the effects of these transformations have been the subject of much debate and eloquent defenses of the value of professional news work, there has been little conversation about the continued importance, or the fate, of music and art criticism. Perhaps this is because it seems clear that the news serves democratic ends, whereas criticism seems like a holdover from forms of cultural authority long abandoned. Indeed for many, the collapse of music criticism is a sign of greater cultural democracy.</p>
<p>But claims such as this have to be measured against actual effects and analysis of the forms of evaluation that have come to replace it, because cultural evaluation has certainly not gone away. From ‘American Idol’ to ‘What Not to Wear’, from panels of judges to audience vote tallies to online reviews of restaurants, hotels, films, books, and every conceivable service, we live in an increasingly evaluative culture. The contradiction I want to explore in this paper is between this proliferation of sites and opportunities for cultural judgment and the collapse of professional criticism. How are these two forms of evaluation distinguished? What should we make of the shift from aesthetics to consensus as the basis of cultural judgment, and what are the consequences for aesthetic experience and the aesthetic development of music? Finally how, given this state of affairs, should the claims of democratization be critically understood?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1749975512453656">
<title>Professional Music Criticism as an Ideal Type</title>
<p>In order to address these questions, I will present an ideal type professional music criticism and compare it with the networked, quantified and consensual forms that cultural judgment now increasingly takes. This ‘ideal type’ is drawn in part from comments made by critics of jazz, rock, Latin and world musics in two sets of interviews – one recent and one 25 years ago.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1749975512453656">1</xref></sup> These are popular musical art forms sometimes lumped together in the term ‘creative music’, and I use that as a shorthand. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1749975512453656">Paul Lopes’ (2000)</xref> description of the ‘restricted subfield of popular art’, popular art production that is not subordinated to the demands of the culture industry, is also applicable. Creative music criticism has historically served many functions, from consumer guide and gatekeeper to providing legitimation for artists and context for listeners. It is driven by a combination of aesthetic choices and journalistic requirements, including what Theodor Adorno referred to as the demands for ‘prompt topicality and wide publicity’ that often reduce it to ‘bleating along’ with public opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1749975512453656">1976</xref>: 152). Surely, professional criticism does not always live up to its potential as an alternative discourse of value. Yet critics are guided by professional ideals and aesthetic traditions that transcend these institutional constraints. The ideal type is composed of three variables: aesthetic evaluative criteria, tension between objective and subjective forms of expression, and professional responsibility to an imagined public.</p>
<sec id="section3-1749975512453656">
<title>1. Aesthetic Criteria</title>
<p>The task of criticism is to make judgments. But according to what criteria? Critics of creative music work in a range of musical traditions and genres, so there is not a single set of aesthetic standards that can be applied to each case. And critics were ambivalent about whether or not they have, or should have, a consistent personal aesthetic that guides their evaluative decisions. One critic remarked that his question is ‘does the music deliver on its promise?’, which suggests a more situated set of aesthetic criteria. In general, critics did not see themselves making pronouncements on the basis of prescriptive criteria (what John Dewey called a ‘judicial’ form of criticism or Kantian ‘determinate judgments’) but rather as illuminating the work through analysis of its aesthetic elements, contextualizing it within existing musical or aesthetic traditions, conveying some aspect of the experience of hearing the music and, through all these means, giving people the resources to enhance their own aesthetic experience. At its best, criticism connects affect with understanding, and reflects the fundamental principle that aesthetic experience is both.</p>
<p>Aesthetic analysis is a hallmark of criticism. Conventional aesthetic analysis would discuss form in relation to matter and the parts in relation to the whole, as well as the specific musical medium and its expressive possibilities. It is a form of immanent critique. Contemporary creative music critics engage in less explicitly formal analysis, because the language of formal analysis is not generally understood and they write largely for a general audience. A writer for <italic>The New York Times</italic> told me: ‘If I said “this music was composed of open fifths”, people would think I was talking about cognac’. Yet despite the difficulties of language, analysis is nevertheless an identifying feature of the critic’s work. He continued: ‘I want to make an argument based on the facts. That’s where analysis comes in. A review should be 80% data and 20% response. My job is to figure out how it works because how it works is why people like it.’ Chris Weingarten, a freelance writer for <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rollingstone.com">rollingstone.com</ext-link>, <italic>The Village Voice, Revolver</italic> magazine and the website <italic>Idolator</italic>, talked at length about the importance of ‘the because’, as in, ‘this music is good because …’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1749975512453656">Weingarten, 2009</xref>). It’s the job of the critic to discuss not just the affective experience of music, but how the music comes to have the effects that it does. For example:<disp-quote>
<p>Hearing [Cecil] Taylor stretches one’s mind. Despite his fearsome technique, these days he typically starts one of his uninterrupted hour-long sets quietly, reflectively, laying out a few notes as if they will be a theme to focus in on and explore. Just as their echo is dying, he starts to roll out rippling figures and plunging bass posts, harmonically distant yet evocative chords, and disturbing angular figures that seem completely unrelated to what he’d begun before. … These continue to come tumbling out after each other in faster succession if not predictable sequence, muddying the passage of time so as to seem simultaneous. They accumulate as waves of action, and become oceanic as crosscurrents and contrapuntal crests, sometimes – infrequently – calming so, in the lull, he can set forth another languorous, luminous and starkly haunting line. Is it what he started with ageless minutes ago? Or just a similarly bejewelled strand of pitches, suspended in the suddenly hushed (yet in our ears, still ringing) air? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1749975512453656">Mandel, 2006</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to this immanent analysis, critics evaluate work based on its ‘aesthetic significance’, i.e. whether or not it contributes to the development of the art form. In that respect, criticism (like music itself) negotiates past and future, the understanding of tradition and the capacity for surprise. One freelance critic who has written for the <italic>Boston Globe</italic> and the <italic>Miami Herald</italic>, and was managing editor of <italic>Jazziz</italic> magazine, asks how what the musician played fits in ‘with his or her own trajectory and how that fits into what is happening with the genre at this point and did it advance it … I don’t believe in the idea of progress of music, but is it moving the line, is it stretching the language?’ Evaluating music’s aesthetic significance requires a historical perspective and an understanding of tradition, for it is only in that context that distinction or difference can be recognized. As Adorno commented, ‘without expertise, without a habitual knowledge of the familiar, the new that is taking shape can hardly be understood.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1749975512453656">1976</xref>: 152). To understand if something is advancing the art form or stretching the language, critics have to know the language.</p>
<p>Critics also identify and bring to light emerging artists, making judgments not only about what is new but also about what is art, whether or not that term is specifically employed. Of course, this is one of the basic functions of any aesthetic discourse. What is ‘art’ is, again, not determined by a prescriptive set of aesthetic criteria, and there was a lot of variation on this point. However, most critics articulated it as something that goes beyond the expectations or conventions of a particular genre or style, or explores human emotions through those genres in a new way, or does so particularly well.</p>
<p>John Dewey suggested that synthesis is the unifying moment of criticism that complements the disunifying one of analysis. He describes synthesis as the creative response of the individual who judges, her or his insight into the work in question: ‘What is meant is that the critic shall seize upon some strain or strand that is actually there, and bring it forth with such clearness that the reader has a new clue and guide in his own experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1749975512453656">1934</xref>: 327). Contemporary critics echo this idea that the critic provides a guide to musical experience but cast it in a more egalitarian light. As one put it: ‘I think the most important part of the job … is to give the audience the tools to appreciate more elements of the music and to get more out of the performance or the record or the work of an artist.’ Through her or his persuasive writing, the critic can also get people excited about the music – enough so that they want to go out and hear it for themselves.</p>

<title>2. Subjective/Objective Forms of Expression</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Mr. Nascimento has been recognized as one of the world’s great voices almost from the beginning of his career in the 1960s. With a liquid-amber baritone that rises to an otherworldly falsetto, he can push along a rhythm, as he did in ‘Caxanga’, or glide serenely above the band, as he did in ‘Ponta da Areia’ [‘Sandy Point’, a railroad station in Bahia, Brazil]. He’s not a jazz singer, stylizing a song or adding showy improvisatory flourishes. As he (rightly) honors his melodies, the tunes simply seem to pour through him like sunbeams through a high window. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1749975512453656">Pareles, 2011b</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If analysis is an objective mode (how it works), synthesis is a more subjective one (both what it means to the writer, and whether or not there was a visceral connection between the writer and the music). The tension between the subjective experience of music and the obligation to objectivity was identified by many of the critics I interviewed as an essential feature of professional criticism and one that distinguishes it from what fans convey through their Facebook pages and Tweets. One critic noted:<disp-quote>
<p>You have to be inside and outside at the same time. Because on the one hand my feeling was always that you have to give yourself in to feel the music or to feel whatever that performance is being offered but at the same time to keep your distance, and both have to be happening at the same time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This remark echoes Adorno’s point that<disp-quote>
<p>The subjective reactions of a critic … are not opposed to objectivity of judgment. They are its premise; without such reactions music is not experienced at all. It is up to the critic’s ethic to raise his impression to the rank of objectivity, by constant confrontation with the phenomenon. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1749975512453656">1976</xref>: 148)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Fans, even well-informed ones, have no such obligation. The same critic continued:<disp-quote>
<p>… on the one hand, you do have a perspective, you have a point of view, you have a voice, but on the other hand you’re translucent, you let things through, you let people see the art, which is the object of the exercise. It’s not you, it’s not your ego.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another freelance writer, author of several books on jazz and a frequent contributor to <italic>Downbeat</italic>, spoke of the difference between the critic and the musician with respect to this issue. Musicians are<disp-quote>
<p>… not getting all the CDs from all over the world, they don’t have to judge them against each other, they don’t have to consider what somebody’s inspiration is or their motivation is, from another part of the world. They may be thinking about it in musicological terms, in stylistic terms, for themselves, as references to themselves, but journalists are mostly trying to put together some sort of coherent worldview of the world that they listen to, and to judge artifacts on that basis. But I think the musician is reading that world on the basis of the music they make.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1749975512453656">
<title>3. Professional Expertise and the Public</title>
<p>Analysis serves the function of objectivity, of grounding the subjective impressions of the critic in the work itself. But as the previous quote suggests, the move toward objectivity also goes beyond explanation or any specific analytical techniques: it inheres in the nature of the job. For one, the professional critic can be more objective because s/he did not buy the CD or pay for the tickets. One commented: ‘I don’t pay for my tickets. I don’t have to like it. … I know that it sounds like a smug remark, but it’s not a small point. You know, if I’m paying $120 for something, I’m probably gonna like it.’ Of course, ‘objectivity’ can be compromised by freebies and perqs from record companies and concert promoters, and the Payola scandal for radio airtime is hardly ancient history. But the point is still valid.</p>
<p>Perhaps more important, the professional critic writes for others, specifically for a public. This can mean a wide range of things, but all of my interview subjects spoke of their professional <italic>responsibility</italic> to their audience or to the reading public, a responsibility to be reliable, to be accurate, and to write well. Some also spoke of journalistic standards of verification, and protocols of interviewing and data collection. One talked at length about the obligation to create a public space, saying: ‘I don’t want to write Howard’s history of jazz. I want to participate in a social history of jazz that a lot of people participate in, and build a larger frame of reference and archive of information. … I want to make a place where people can convene.’</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section6-1749975512453656">
<title>Newly Dominant Forms of Cultural Evaluation</title>
<p>Where, ideally, the professional music critic makes judgments on the basis of aesthetic criteria, has a professional obligation to raise her/his subjective impressions to the status of objectivity, and assumes the responsibility of writing for an imagined public, the newly dominant forms of cultural evaluation rely on social or consensual criteria, valorize the subjective, and largely abandon a public role. In drawing these comparisons, I will paint a fairly broad picture that brackets some otherwise important distinctions between the various sites and forms of commentary about music online. Of these, the social media sites are at the furthest end from the ideal type but they are also of expanded importance, as this is where so many people find out about music. The work of independent bloggers runs the gamut between in-depth criticism and self-promotion. Sites like PopMatters and Pitchfork feature both news and reviews, with the former produced by paid staffers and the latter by amateurs who are most often unpaid. <italic>Wax Poetic</italic> appears both online and in print, and hews more closely to the older print model than most other sites. Some of the more established print critics contribute to sites like MSN Music or the Barnes and Noble Review. But while there is significant variation among these sites, as there was among different print outlets, they bleed into one another in ways that print could not. Aggregators like The Hype Machine follow trends on blogs and repost them. Musicians put out formal press releases to Pitchfork and PopMatters, put the material on their Facebook pages and Tweet it to their fans. The technological capability of linking between sites makes the lines between them, and between professional and amateur, much harder to draw, and lends itself toward a measure of discursive and stylistic conformity. In looking at online trends and their comparison with the ideal type, the differences between these sites are becoming those of degree rather than of kind.</p>
<sec id="section7-1749975512453656">
<title>1. Consensual Criteria</title>
<p>Where analysis concerns the musical elements and their effect, or the aesthetic significance of music (is it new, is it good, is it art?), social criteria have more to do with the social experience of music – are we having a good time, what’s the scene like, who’s there and who’s not? Of course, music criticism, particularly of popular forms, has included these things but rarely to the degree we are seeing now, or to the exclusion of analysis. And this occurs not just on the social media sites. The critics who write for sites such as Pitchfork and PopMatters bemoan the fact that, in this regard, most of what’s on their sites isn’t much different from Facebook, and it has been creeping into print journalism as well. In one sense, it really is no longer necessary to describe the music, as people can click on a link and hear it. The result, as an editor for PopMatters told me, is that ‘much of the writing is cursory – this is great, you really ought to hear this – it’s like reading a press release’.</p>
<p>What displaces aesthetic evaluation is not merely social: it’s also consensual. It follows a tendency identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1749975512453656">Lee Siegel (2009)</xref> as the shift from popular culture to ‘popularity culture’. Where judgments of aesthetic value are based on distinction or excellence, he argues that it is now more important to be noticed than it is to be good, fame stands in for accomplishment, and it is the number of hits, not the quality of the music that seems to matter. It is not that what is popular in this sense is always and necessarily bad. But where one of the functions of criticism used to be introducing people to new music or discovering something fabulous and bringing it to light, critics now tend to be behind the popularity curve. That heretofore almost mystical quality of ‘buzz’ has become an algorithmic function, something that can be verified, and if they’re going to retain any claim to being hip – not to mention relevant or credible – critics have to be on top of the latest trends. Again, that is not entirely new, but it has become a recursive system. Given the amount of information and the speed at which it is delivered, even the most established print critics are living, as one who writes for the <italic>New York Times</italic> put it, ‘under an avalanche’. He receives between 20 and 40 CDs a day, and an equal number of links to musicians’ websites. The editor for PopMatters told me he receives 80 to 100 emails a day and about 10 CDs. When I asked how they manage it, the response was that it is almost random but anything that has buzz, that is already popular, rises to the top of the pile.</p>
<p>This move toward a culture of consensus has not gone unnoticed. In his contribution to the <italic>Village Voice’s</italic> 2009 Pazz and Jop Poll edition, Chuck Eddy suggested that indie rock’s nearly exclusive domination of the top 40 albums and singles yielded ‘The Year of Too Much Consensus’. He speculated that among the possible reasons for this outcome, unusual for the history of the poll given the large number of critics who participate, is this:<disp-quote>
<p>Used to be, when you filled out your P&amp;J ballot, you hadn’t <italic>seen</italic> very many other Top 10 lists. Now, with websites pretending the year is over well before Thanksgiving and surviving prints mags falling in step with their own premature year-end countdowns, it’s hard to avoid peering over your neighbor’s shoulder. A story snowballs through the year, so by December, critics who don’t hear many releases and the ones who’ve heard too many to sort through – enough Pazz and Joppers to pass as a consensus – have had the words ‘Animal Collective’ pounded into their heads so incessantly that boarding the bandwagon seems like a no-brainer. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1749975512453656">Eddy, 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The quantization made possible by the Internet, the ability to link to the music directly, and the widespread phenomenon of voting for television contestants, not to mention the demise of traditional forms of cultural authority, all contribute to this shift to popularity and consensuality. But there is another structural phenomenon that helps explain these trends: the ‘cancellation of the long term’ that has been explored by Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello, Richard Sennett, Zygmunt Bauman and Ulrich Beck, among many others, looking at the nature of networks, or network society. Their analyses go beyond the by now familiar commentary on the temporal constraints of the Internet (the 24-hour news cycle, the speed, the overwhelming presentness and the lack of considered reflection that goes along with it) to consider the consequences for the structure and meaning of work, for capitalism, for personal relationships and social connection. In all of these analyses, as networks stand in for more hierarchical forms of organization, individuation, flexibility and mobility increase, but at the cost of much greater insecurity. For example, as short-term, project-based employment replaces full-time salaried work, workers have to become more flexible and mobile, not to mention agreeable, so they are well-positioned to be hired for the next project. Businesses are able to respond more quickly to changes in the market as workers assume more risk.</p>
<p>While the end of long-term commitment is beneficial to businesses, or for the bottom line, its impact on culture is deeply problematic. Mark Fisher suggests that the cancellation of the long term breeds cultural stagnation and conservatism, not innovation and diversity, because ‘a certain amount of stability is necessary for cultural vibrancy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1749975512453656">2009</xref>: 77). We need the long term to develop art, talent and a critical voice, to form a distant horizon that promotes experimentation because, unlike the new business model, short-term failure may lead to long-term artistic productivity or creativity. As Pierre Bourdieu put it: ‘How could one not see that the logic of profit, particularly short-term profit, is the very negation of culture, which presupposes investment for no financial return or for uncertain and often posthumous returns?’ (2001: 70).</p>
<p>These concerns about the relentless present are strongly reminiscent of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1749975512453656">Herbert Marcuse’s (1964)</xref> analysis of the one-dimensional society, where history and remembrance, which could rupture the present and help to imagine a different future, have become impossible, or perhaps just irrelevant to the demands of capitalist production and consumption. The decline of music criticism is bound up in this temporal shift. Where aesthetic criteria are grounded in past tradition but oriented toward the future, toward the development of the art form, consensual ones are based in the present: what people like, or what the conventions are, now. To the extent that aesthetic criticism is a historical project as well as an aesthetic one, it has a capacity to enlarge the present; indeed, that is its task. The displacement of the aesthetic as the basis of cultural evaluation and the de-historicization of criticism therefore represent a loss – the loss of an alternative discourse that enhances aesthetic experience and supports the long-term development of music.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1749975512453656">
<title>2. Subjectivity</title>
<p>The balance between objectivity and subjectivity that characterizes ideal type music criticism is overwhelmed by a more subjective style of presentation in the online environment. Everyone has an opinion, and there are millions of them out there, on just about every cultural product or phenomenon. The subjective experience of the writer, from the consumer experience of online reviews to the actual in-the-moment experience of Twitter, is the grist of online commentary. But the consequences of making the self the central focus of music, entertainment or criticism are not entirely clear. One commentator put it this way, with respect to reality television:<disp-quote>
<p>Just about every television show now has a web site that invites the viewer-consumer to play an active role in the show. You answer questions about plot or characters, read the characters’ blogs and, of course, vote on something or other having to do with the show. … The effect of such new forms of ‘access’ is a strange one. They abolish the space between you and the screen and literalize the fiction you are watching. <italic>You</italic> become the center of the entertainment, that, traditionally, helped viewers get out of themselves. Entertainment used to be ‘escapist.’ Now, it’s as though everyone who’s ever escaped has been pursued, rounded up, and returned to his or her own ego. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1749975512453656">Siegel, 2009</xref>: 112)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While the scope of this transformation is hard to gauge, there is no doubt that subjectivity (as well as privacy and personality) has taken on new meanings in the current cultural and media environment. Not merely a mode of personal expression, it is presented in this scenario as a form of ego projection and gratification driven by the demands of mass cultural production. Where criticism, like music itself, could take the listener on a journey into something unknown, or make that unknown more knowable, this new style of access reinforces what people already know and gives the networks and major cultural producers a false sense of ‘what people want’. Because, of course, most of us do not know what we want until we are confronted with it, and many of us like to be surprised.</p>
<p>Websites like Pandora and Grooveshark are the musical equivalent of the phenomenon to which Siegel referred. Much like online dating, one submits musical preferences, and through a series of algorithmic functions the system generates what it expects the listener will like. Yet the promise of expanding the range of possible musical choices and experiences is filtered through the subject’s already known taste and, as such, it is a promise that cannot be fulfilled. We seem to be increasingly trapped in what computer geeks like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1749975512453656">Jaron Lanier (2010)</xref> call ‘circuits of the familiar’ as serendipity, chance, and surprise are streamlined out of the system through the architecture of the new media technology. One writer put it succinctly: ‘you only get to know what you know’. The <italic>Times</italic> critic commented on how hard it is to find young reporters who are willing to take general assignments because ‘everyone’s jumped into their niche’. Indeed, the stunning contradiction between the tremendous diversity of music online and the growing insularity of listening experience was commented upon by every critic I talked with. It was one of the few points upon which there was complete agreement. Chris Weingarten summed it up thus:<disp-quote>
<p>So one of the unfortunate side effects …. is people are getting more stratified and separated in their listening habits. If you read <italic>Spin</italic> or <italic>Rolling Stone</italic> in ’96, you get an article on Nine Inch Nails, an article on Chemical Brothers, an article on Snoop Dog, and the Internet doesn’t work that way. If you’re into rap, you go to rap twitters. If you’re into metal, you go to metal twitters. Bands build audiences for themselves, you just follow the bands you like. You don’t have to, you don’t come across that stuff and that’s a problem. It’s harder to get exposed to things that aren’t in your comfort zone. … I can always learn about stuff that’s important to me, that’s easy. I want to learn about stuff that isn’t important to me. I want to be exposed to things. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1749975512453656">Weingarten, 2009</xref>)</p>

<p>The new music environment is often celebrated as one that is more democratic because the old filters – the critics, the A&amp;R guys, the major record companies – no longer exert the kind of authority that they once did and musicians can have a more direct relationship with their audiences. But while it is certainly true that the new media environment enables both the production and distribution of music in unprecedented ways, it would be a mistake to assume that it functions without filters or gatekeepers. Market research shows that ever-expanding choice tends to overwhelm consumers, who then come to rely on strategies or mechanisms designed to streamline that choice and to manage the diversity of options. An app appropriately called ‘Chorus’ is just one such mechanism. As reported in <italic>The New York Times</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>As the number of applications available for download through Apple’s App Store continues to swell, the need has grown for a more efficient way to filter through the 100,000+ options across the multitude of categories. As a result, app discovery tools have become a flourishing segment of the iPhone app market. … Chorus allows you to see which apps your friends have downloaded and rated highly. It then uses algorithms to make recommendations based on those preferences. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1749975512453656">Wortham, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Indeed, the ‘need’ for such mechanisms only increases: as of July 2011, the number of available apps had passed 425,000. Rather than an absence of cultural authority, its traditional forms have been replaced by new, technologically-mediated ones that return us increasingly to ourselves, or to our own personal ‘chorus’.</p>
<p>In sum, the new media technologies accelerate the postmodern tendency to put the self at the center of authentic experience and to understand cultural authority as fundamentally illegitimate or at least unnecessary. But at the same time that this opens up the conversation to anyone with a modem and therefore potentially to the broadest range of opinion and music itself, people report a narrowing of their listening habits. In one sense, this is not surprising, as real diversity depends on something besides the subjective dimension. A genuine experience of diversity is the ability to take the position of the other, or to confront, in the sense of being in the presence of, what is radically different. That is something that criticism, with its demand for a balance between subjectivity and objectivity, can enable. It represents an alternative to the cycles of ego gratification and reproduction of the familiar that increasingly curtail the possibilities of real musical diversity.</p>

<title>3. Abandoning the Public</title>
<p>What about the potential of the Internet to constitute a forum for a more broad-based public conversation about music or art? This would seem to be one place where the new digital technologies could advance conceptions of democratic deliberation. I asked critics if the new media provide a forum for more public discussion, as it is much easier to respond to a blog post than to write a letter to the editor. But despite the space for comments that appear on most (but not all) sites and the relative ease of posting, comments are rare and sustained conversation almost nonexistent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1749975512453656">2</xref></sup> Most of the critics noted that they get occasional corrections from knowledgeable readers, but most of the posts are hostile or juvenile, and use language not appropriate in polite company. A review of many websites confirms these impressions. So even if critics feel they are responsible to a public; the public does not seem to share that commitment, or does not see itself <italic>as</italic> a public, at least with respect to music.</p>
<p>By now, the only thing remarkable about the displacement of the public by the consumer is the degree to which it is being hastened by the unprecedented expansion of the means of ‘public’ communication. As sites and opportunities for commentary about music proliferate, they are mined for data that is quantified, aggregated and turned into profit by corporations that buy and sell information and by the cultural producers who are in a position to exploit it. In this media context, the critic’s professional responsibility to speak to or to help constitute a public is overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of other forms of commentary about music online and by its much greater economic utility. This gives new relevance to old distinctions between ‘publics’ and ‘masses’ and complicates claims to broader cultural democracy that attend the demise of criticism.</p>

<sec id="section10-1749975512453656" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Alexis de Tocqueville keenly observed that in democratic or egalitarian societies, without traditional status hierarchies and the cultural authority they maintain, popular opinion holds an even stronger sway over people as they seek that authority in each other. It seems that this tendency is being exaggerated in the new media environment. In the shift from aesthetics to consensus as the basis of cultural judgment, the familiar has become the new ‘good’. Where music criticism helps to keep open the space for the experimental or edgy or as yet unproven, consensual culture tends toward the middle, toward the agreed upon and the known. The aesthetic consequences are being mirrored in music itself, where retro styles and ‘digestibility’ dominate popular music, as Jon Pareles of <italic>The New York Times</italic> opined in his 2010 year-end column, ‘Want a Hit? Keep It Simple’. My argument is not that if the people like it, it must be bad. But the ability of critics to provide a counterpoint, to keep a space for alternative readings and interpretations of music and musical excellence open and lively – however well or poorly they have fulfilled that function in the past – is being increasingly eroded. The consequences for aesthetic experience, the aesthetic development of music, and real musical diversity are profound and cannot be simply rationalized as an unintended consequence of technological advancement.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that the erosion of cultural expertise made possible by the new technologies is democratic in at least one sense, in that there is broader participation in making and evaluating culture. If democracy were as easily quantified as CD sales or the number of hits to a website, perhaps the argument could be left there. But it is not just participation but also the terms of participation that must be considered. If greater participation in culture through digital technologies and the network structures in which they are embedded favors the market, discourages artistic innovation, or is bought at the expense of critical reflection on art, on what grounds can that be considered democratic? If, on the other hand, democracy means the expansion of opportunities for deliberation, for publicness, or for genuine diversity, the current situation falls short. Indeed, much contemporary democratic theory has been centrally concerned not with consensus but with difference, including one of the strongest senses in which the arts promote democracy – the meaningful confrontation with particularity or difference. As Bourdieu remarked: ‘Oddly, the “purest”, most disinterested, most “formal” producers of culture thus find themselves, often unwittingly, at the forefront of the struggle for the defense of the highest values of humanity. By defending their singularity, they are defending the most universal values of all’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1749975512453656">2003</xref>: 81).</p>
<p>I do not bemoan the breakdown of cultural authority (though it is a mistake to assume that new forms of cultural authority are not already taking its place), or think that other forms of commentary by fans, or by musicians, or even voting for one’s favorite television star are inherently evil. But in the new media environment, they threaten to overwhelm alternative aesthetic discourses that can provide a counterweight to the circuits of the familiar that mediate cultural diversity, the cancellation of the long-term that impedes aesthetic development, and the further erosion of the public sphere.</p>

<p>The first set of interviews was conducted in New York City in 1985. My subjects were all people with whom I had had extensive professional contact from my work as Program Director of New Jazz at the Public, a concert series of jazz and world music at Joseph Papp’s Public Theater. My concern at the time was to understand the criteria used in decisions about what gets into print and how different publication formats structured the content of music criticism (everything from word limits to notions of “news value” consistent with a publication’s position in the market). I therefore selected critics who wrote for different types of publications: one who wrote for a daily major market newspaper, another who contributed to a weekly newspaper that had a specific identification as a counter-cultural publication, a free-lancer who wrote for a variety of music magazines, etc. I did not publish my findings from this preliminary research, but they provide a very illuminating basis of historical comparison for the current project.</p>
<p>The recent set of interviews was done in 2009 and 2010. My questions here had more to do with how the professional world of criticism has changed, given the impact of the Internet and related technologies. I was able to re-interview two of the critics from my earlier sample, and spoke with eight other members of the profession. In selecting interview subjects, I was concerned with career trajectories, looking for a sample that would include some critics who had started in print as well as some who had only worked online, some who had actual jobs as opposed to others who were either freelance or wrote their own blogs, etc.</p>
<p>In neither instance were the interviews intended to be comprehensive or fully representative of the field, as they would for a more ethnographic study. They have, rather, provided a unique set of insights into the changing discursive world of the Internet.</p>

<p>One notable exception is Expert Witness, a relatively new blog by Robert Christgau. Dubbed the ‘Dean’ of rock critics in the US, Christgau has been writing about music for over 40 years, including the very popular ‘Consumer Guide’ that first appeared in the <italic>Village Voice</italic> in 1969. Although he is a regular contributor to many online sites, he reports his experience with Expert Witness as unique for the kind of commentary that readers provide. A review of the site suggests that many of these readers are other music writers, or former writers, constituting an unusual discursive community.</p>
