<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Osteochondral autografts in mosaicplasty are inserted in a press-fit fashion, and hence, patients are kept nonweightbearing for up to 2 months after surgery to allow bone healing and prevent complications. Very little has been published regarding alternative fixation techniques of those grafts.</p>
<p><bold>Hypothesis</bold>: Osteochondral autografts stabilized with a resorbable osteoconductive bone cement would have a greater load-bearing capacity than standard press-fit grafts.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design</bold>: Controlled laboratory study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Biomechanical testing was conducted on 8 pairs of cadaveric bovine distal femurs. For the first 4 pairs, 6 single osteochondral autografts were inserted in a press-fit fashion on one femur. On the contralateral femur, 6 grafts were stabilized with a calcium triglyceride osteoconductive bone cement. For the 4 remaining pairs of femurs, 4 groups of 3 adjacent press-fit grafts were inserted on one femur, whereas on the contralateral femur, grafts were cemented. After a maturation period of 48 hours, axial loading was applied on all single grafts and on the middle graft of each 3-in-a-row series.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: For the single-graft configuration, median loads required to sink the press-fit and cemented grafts by 2 and 3 mm were 281.87 N versus 345.56 N (<italic>P</italic> = .015) and 336.29 N versus 454.08 N (<italic>P</italic> = .018), respectively. For the 3-in-a-row configuration, median loads required to sink the press-fit and cemented grafts by 2 and 3 mm were 260.31 N versus 353.47 N (<italic>P</italic> = .035) and 384.83 N versus 455.68 N (<italic>P</italic> = .029), respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Fixation of osteochondral grafts using bone cement appears to improve immediate stability over the original mosaicplasty technique for both single- and multiple-graft configurations.</p>
<p><bold>Clinical Relevance</bold>: Achieving greater primary stability of osteochondral grafts could potentially accelerate postoperative recovery, allowing early weightbearing and physical therapy.</p>

<p>Focal cartilage defects are a frequent joint injury. Fortunately, different management options can be offered to patients presenting with such a condition. Mosaicplasty, first described by Matsusue et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512438382">24</xref></sup> and later popularized by Hangody et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512438382">15</xref></sup> is one of the reconstructive procedures available. This technique, which relies on press-fit insertion of cylindrical osteochondral autografts, is usually recommended for cartilage lesions of up to 4 cm<sup>2</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512438382">16</xref></sup> According to published case series, good to excellent clinical results are achieved in 69% to 96% of patients, depending on the injury and lesion location.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512438382">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512438382">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512438382">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512438382">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512438382">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512438382">31</xref></sup> Mosaicplasty is technically challenging for surgeons, and various factors will dictate the end results, such as preserving graft chondrocytes’ viability as well as re-establishing and maintaining joint congruency until definitive bony integration of the graft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512438382">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512438382">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512438382">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512438382">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512438382">34</xref></sup> Histological analyses from in vivo animal studies have demonstrated that grafts left proud at the time of insertion caused perigraft fissuring as well as fibroplasia and subchondral cavitation, while grafts countersunk 2 mm showed cartilage necrosis and fibrous overgrowth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512438382">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512438382">29</xref></sup> It has also been shown that loss of press-fit stability occurs in the postoperative period, with a reduction of the grafts’ load-bearing capacity to approximately 65%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512438382">33</xref></sup> Consequently, weightbearing is usually delayed until 6 to 8 weeks after surgery to allow for proper graft stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512438382">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512438382">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512438382">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512438382">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512438382">33</xref></sup> On the other hand, it has been shown after matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) that early postoperative load-bearing rehabilitation resulted in improved subjective functional and biomechanical outcomes compared with the traditional delayed weightbearing rehabilitation protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512438382">9</xref></sup> Although early load transmission through the repair site may not be as important in mosaicplasty as in MACI, positive effects of early weightbearing in mosaicplasty could translate into fewer adhesions, decreased muscle wasting, and improved gait pattern allowing for faster return to work or sports.</p>
<p>Considering this, a technique allowing early weightbearing without jeopardizing joint congruency would be clinically relevant. To our knowledge, only one study evaluated an alternative fixation technique of the grafts with resorbable bone cement. The authors concluded that cement augmentation of multiple osteochondral grafts improved their immediate axial load-bearing capacity, but the results were somehow equivocal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512438382">5</xref></sup> The aim of this study was thus to confirm those results and establish the value of resorbable bone cement as a primary fixation technique for osteochondral autografts. Of all available products, a biological polyurethane cement made of resorbable calcium triglyceride (Kryptonite, Doctors Research Group Inc, Southbury, Connecticut) was selected for its favorable characteristics, among which are a low exothermic polymerization reaction, adhesive properties, a porous structure allowing bony ingrowth, and bone-like mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512438382">6</xref></sup> Our hypothesis was that cemented osteochondral grafts would show increased primary stability compared with press-fit grafts. Hence, this study was designed to compare the axial load-bearing capacity of both single and multiple osteochondral autografts stabilized with a resorbable osteoconductive bone cement to that of press-fit grafts inserted according to the original mosaicplasty technique.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Eight pairs of fresh bovine distal femurs were obtained from a local slaughterhouse. These specimens came from Holstein calves aged between 3 and 5 months and weighing between 110 and 140 kg. Each pair of femurs was identified, wrapped in saline-soaked gauze, and frozen at −20°C. Before testing, specimens were thawed overnight at room temperature (23°C). On the day of testing, each femur was dissected free of soft tissues. The femoral diaphysis was cut down to 20 cm in length with an oscillating saw. The femoral diaphysis was then secured in the center of 5.08-cm-diameter (2 inches) by 10-cm-length acrylonitrile butadiene styrene cylindrical tubing (ABS DWV Solid Wall Pipe, Bow Plastics, Montreal, Canada) with cross pins and embedded in a polyester resin (Bondo Autobody Filler, Bondo Corporation, Atlanta, Georgia). This construct was then inserted in a custom-made adjustable angulated aluminum support. The sagittal orientation of the support was adjusted by a 5° increment to position the articular surface of the femoral condyles parallel to the horizontal plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512438382">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The instrumentation used for graft harvesting and implantation came from the Mosaicplasty System (Smith &amp; Nephew Inc, Memphis, Tennessee). Osteochondral grafts of 6.5-mm diameter by 12-mm length were harvested from the femoral trochlea using a tubular chisel. Great care was taken to harvest the graft perpendicular to the articular surface. Grafts were then cut down to 10 mm with a bone saw, using a custom-made jig, to ensure a flat bottom as well as a uniform length for all grafts. Grafts were kept in moist gauzes until implantation. The recipient sites were then prepared with a 6.5-mm drill bit using a drill press and dilated to the desired depth. Within each pair, recipient sites were prepared for press-fit fixation to a depth of 10 mm on a femur and for cemented fixation to a depth of 14 mm on the contralateral femur. For the first 4 femoral pairs, a single-graft configuration was tested, whereas a 3-in-a-row configuration was evaluated on the remaining 4 pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512438382">Figure 2</xref>). For the single-graft configuration, 3 recipient sites were made in the center of each femoral condyle at a distance of 10 mm from each other to ensure adequate lateral walls. For the 3-in-a-row configuration, each femoral condyle was hosting 2 groups of 3 adjacent recipient sites at a distance of 10 mm from one another. During drilling of those adjacent recipient sites, a 6.5-mm and a 13-mm spacer block were used to guide positioning of the aluminum support, ensuring consistency of recipient sites within each group.</p>

<caption><p>Of the 8 pairs of bovine distal femurs, 4 pairs were used to test the single-graft configuration, whereas the remaining 4 femoral pairs were used to test the 3-in-a-row configuration. Within each pair, press-fit grafts were inserted on one femur, and cemented grafts were inserted on the contralateral bone. After cement polymerization, each single graft and every middle graft of each group were submitted to axial compression testing. A preload of 15 N was first applied on the graft; then, load-to-failure testing at 2 mm/min was performed.</p></caption>

<p>Grafts in the press-fit group were inserted in the recipient sites using the delivery tamp until bottomed out. For the cemented group, a resorbable bone cement (Kryptonite, Doctors Research Group Inc) was prepared according to the manufacturer’s procedure. Approximately 0.3 mL of cement still in a liquid phase was inserted into the recipient sites using a 3-mL syringe (BD Luer-Lok Syringe, BD Canada, Mississauga, Canada) and a 2.1-mm catheter (14 G × 1.88 inches, BD Angiocath, BD Canada). Grafts were then inserted using the delivery tamp until they were flush with the articular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512438382">Figure 3</xref>). Any excess cement was wiped off using wet gauze. Cadaveric specimens were then wrapped in saline-soaked gauzes and kept at room temperature to allow complete bone cement polymerization.</p>

<p>Forty-eight hours after specimen preparation, the specimens within the aluminum support were mounted on the 15-kN load cell (model 662.20D-04, MTS Systems Corporation, Eden Prairie, Minnesota) of a servo-controlled hydraulic testing machine (858 Mini Bionix II, MTS Systems Corporation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546512438382">Figure 4</xref>). A 5.5-mm-diameter plunger was then centered over each graft being tested. In the single-graft configuration, every graft was tested, whereas in the 3-in-a-row configuration, only the middle graft of each group was tested. Grafts were preloaded to 15 N to standardize the plunger level. The plunger displacement was zeroed out. Axial loading was then applied until failure at a rate of 2 mm/min to avoid the hydraulic effect of the bone marrow in the recipient sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512438382">26</xref></sup> Load and displacement were recorded at a rate of 10 Hz using the load cell and a linear variable differential transformer respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that cemented cylindrical autografts have statistically greater primary stability than press-fit grafts at a displacement of 2 and 3 mm for both single- and multiple-graft configurations. To our knowledge, this is the only study comparing cemented grafts to a press-fit control group. In their study, Changoor et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512438382">5</xref></sup> intended to do such a comparison. However, their protocol was designed to evaluate sidewall fixation of multiple grafts in a 20-mm-diameter deficit. After graft insertion, the specimens were cut into a wafer, where both the articular surface and the construct bottom were removed to standardize sidewall height. This rendered the uncemented constructs too unstable for further testing. Without being objectively compared, this indirectly indicates that the sidewall stability of cemented grafts is greater than that of press-fit grafts. Furthermore, it has been shown that bottom support is a major factor in graft stability,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512438382">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512438382">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512438382">34</xref></sup> and therefore, an experimental design that includes bottom support is probably more representative of a clinical situation.</p>
<p>In our study, no statistical difference was found at a displacement level of 1 mm. This is thought to be because of cartilage compression. In fact, the cartilage surface was left on the osteochondral grafts. A 15-N preloading was performed to compress the cartilage and minimize this effect. Still, the amount of preloading might have been insufficient, and further cartilage compression might have occurred in the first millimeter of plunger displacement. Maximal strain of bovine cartilage is 68% according to the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512438382">4</xref></sup> With a mean cartilage thickness of 1.8 mm at the bovine distal femur,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512438382">27</xref></sup> this implies that the cartilage’s maximal compression could be as much as 1.2 mm. If this is the case, it is expected that press-fit and cemented grafts behave similarly in the first millimeter of axial compression and that no statistical difference is found. Three specimens were excluded from statistical analysis. One specimen was from the press-fit single-graft group, and the other 2 specimens were cemented single grafts. Loads necessary to sink those grafts were higher than expected (outliers), and upon visual inspection, the indenter was offset on the graft and in contact with the sidewall in each case. The high load values obtained were considered to represent a combination of graft displacement and sidewall impaction. If kept in the analyses, those high values would have skewed the results in favor of the cemented group.</p>
<p>The modification of the original mosaicplasty technique evaluated in this study has many advantages. The 10-mm cemented grafts inserted in a 14-mm recipient site with the bone cement still in a liquid phase behave like unbottomed grafts. They subjectively require low impaction forces and are easily tamped to flush level. As chondrocyte viability decreases with higher impaction loads, aiming for low impaction forces during graft insertion is advised.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512438382">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512438382">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512438382">34</xref></sup> For this reason, Whiteside et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512438382">34</xref></sup> have recommended avoiding the use of bottomed grafts. Once cement has cured, those grafts behave better than the uncemented bottomed grafts (control group) under compressive load. This is most likely because after polymerization, cement recreates a functional bottom support, converting those unbottomed grafts into bottomed grafts. Some interdigitation of cement within bone trabeculae of the grafts and of the recipient sites probably contributes to the added primary stability of cemented grafts. The cementation requires little extra time compared with press-fit insertion, and no modification to the actual instrumentation is needed if used in an open or mini-open approach. With this enhanced primary stability, weightbearing could potentially be allowed after full cement polymerization, as soon as 48 hours postoperatively. Ebert et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512438382">9</xref></sup> showed that accelerated load-bearing rehabilitation reduces knee pain, improves knee function, and may accelerate the return of a normal gait pattern without adverse consequences at 3-month follow-up after matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte transplantation. While this has not been studied, it is possible that similar positive outcomes could apply to patients performing early weightbearing after an autologous osteochondral autograft procedure as well. Furthermore, this adjunct fixation could prove particularly useful in clinical situations, where multiple adjacent grafts are needed and primary stability of the grafts is expected to be poor because of the quality of subchondral bone.</p>
<p>An osteoconductive resorbable bone cement was used in this study. The rationale for using this type of product was to increase primary stability while allowing osteointegration to occur for definitive stability. The cement used in this experiment is a product currently available on the market. It is a calcium triglyceride bone cement already approved for clinical use in different countries, including the United States and Canada, as a cranial defect repair material, and other clinical uses are under investigation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512438382">25</xref></sup> Unfortunately, very little independent literature regarding this cement has been published. According to the manufacturer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512438382">6</xref></sup> the liquid phase of the product is between 4 and 8 minutes after reconstitution, which is long enough to allow graft insertion. It is believed that insertion of grafts while cement is still liquid maximizes cement penetration in trabeculae, providing an optimal bone-cement interface. This phenomenon is probably amplified by expansion of the cement. Indeed, unlike polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), this cement expands while polymerization occurs. Most of the expansion happens in the first moments, but some additional expansion, up to 10%, takes place after 8 minutes after reconstitution. Nonetheless, no graft displacement secondary to this residual expansion was observed. This polymerization process is also less exothermic than that of PMMA, reaching peak temperatures of less than 48.9°C (120°F), which is below the level shown to be harmful to chondrocytes. Indeed, Voss et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512438382">32</xref></sup> have demonstrated that temperatures greater than 50°C to 55°C had a negative effect on chondrocytes’ survival. Once the process is completed, the cement has a porous structure, and calcium carbonate represents 30% of its matrix. A certain amount of cement resorption occurs, which allows osteoclasts to penetrate the closed pore structure, leading to osteointegration, which has been documented in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512438382">7</xref></sup> From a biomechanical standpoint, it is reported to have an elastic modulus similar to intact bone. It also features adhesive properties that might contribute to osteochondral grafts’ primary stability.</p>
<p>In this experiment, a bovine cadaveric model was chosen. While porcine and bovine models have been used in biomechanical assays on osteochondral grafts, it is known that porcine bone has an elastic modulus closer to that of human bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512438382">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512438382">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512438382">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512438382">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512438382">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512438382">34</xref></sup> The elastic modulus of bovine bone is higher, with values of approximately 26 GPa compared with 21 GPa for human bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512438382">22</xref></sup> Because there is a direct relationship between elastic modulus and the quality of press fit,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512438382">33</xref></sup> using a specimen with a greater modulus ensured optimal conditions for the press-fit control group. For the same purpose of favoring the control group, short, bottomed press-fit grafts were used because this has been shown to be the most stable configuration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512438382">18</xref></sup> Once bottomed out, it is thought that compression of the subchondral bone, either from the graft or at the bottom of the recipient site, must occur for further displacement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512438382">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512438382">19</xref></sup> Using a cadaveric model with a greater elastic modulus might have further enhanced this factor affecting the axial stability of bottomed grafts. It is possible that the difference in load-bearing capacity between cemented and press-fit grafts could prove being even greater in a bone with a lower elastic modulus such as human bone.</p>
<p>Regarding the multiple-graft configuration, the choice has been made to evaluate grafts in a 3-in-a-row configuration. This decision was based on previous work by Kordás et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512438382">21</xref></sup> in which 3 grafts in a row had the same stability as grafts inserted in a circular fashion. In their study, these multiple unbottomed-graft configurations resisted approximately 60% of the axial load of single unbottomed grafts at 1, 2, and 3 mm below the articular level. In contrast with those findings, this study showed no statistical difference in loads required to sink single and multiple grafts at all levels when analyzed within a fixation technique (single press-fit vs multiple press-fit grafts and single cemented vs multiple cemented grafts). This is probably because the bottomed grafts were used in this experiment. The magnitude of bottom support outweighs the contribution of sidewall friction in overall primary stability, making a decrease of sidewall support unremarkable.</p>
<p>This study has some limitations. As with all in vitro studies using animal specimens, direct inference to the human clinical situation is limited. Also, a relatively low sample size was used in this study. Although every graft was considered as an independent sample, this may have affected the power of the statistical analyses. This statistical strategy is supported by the fact that a great variability in subchondral bone properties exists at the knee, and thus, grafts from the same knee can be considered as different.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512438382">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512438382">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512438382">34</xref></sup> For this reason, this is a methodology that has been used by other authors. Because of the small sample size, a nonparametric statistical test was used, precluding the need for a normality test. Biomechanical testing was also limited to axial loading. Although shear and torsional forces occurring in vivo are disregarded, it is considered that axial compression is the main load to which implanted osteochondral grafts are submitted postoperatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512438382">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512438382">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512438382">33</xref></sup> Furthermore, testing was limited to quasistatic conditions. Cyclic loading, possibly more representative of actual in vivo conditions, would have been interesting to evaluate. Besides, only grafts in a row were tested as a model for a larger defect. Some clinical situations call for a greater number of adjacent grafts, and such a configuration could have been evaluated as well. Finally, the amount of bone cement used in each recipient site was greater than the amount needed to fill the void at the bottom of the graft. The purpose of this was to ensure that when inserting the graft, excess cement would interdigitate in bone trabeculae of both the graft and the recipient site at the bottom as well as within the sidewalls. As a result, some excess cement protruding at the articular surface had to be removed using wet gauze. Although this was easily performed, the presence of a thin layer of cement around the graft may delay integration of those grafts and may interfere with cartilage healing. Considering this, the cementation process could be refined to avoid cement protrusion inside the joint. Because of the cadaveric nature of our model, this study did not address the important question of whether the use of cement affects osteointegration in either a positive or a negative manner. Furthermore, histological analysis or x-ray microtomography of cemented grafts would have been interesting to evaluate the cement mantle at the bottom as well as around the graft and to document the interdigitation of cement into bone trabeculae.</p>
<p>New questions are also brought up by this assay. It has been shown that bony resorption and secondary loss of primary stability occur over a 7-day period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512438382">33</xref></sup> The behavior of cemented grafts in this regard is unknown. Interdigitation of cement within trabeculae of both the graft and the recipient site might countervail this loss of primary stability. Besides, it was reported by Hangody et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512438382">14</xref></sup> that early weightbearing in dogs after mosaicplasty caused graft subsidence and subchondral bony necrosis in more than a third of the cases. In the remaining grafts, bone necrosis did not occur despite weightbearing. In another study, Huang et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512438382">17</xref></sup> reported their results regarding osteochondral grafts inserted flush with the adjacent cartilage as well as countersunk 1 and 2 mm below flush level in a sheep model. All animals were allowed to bear weight after surgery. They found that bony union, vascularization, and new bone formation were present in all grafts even if they were countersunk. Considering those 2 studies, it appears that graft motion might have been responsible for subchondral bone necrosis that occurred in the former study rather than weightbearing or subsidence per se. By increasing the primary stability of osteochondral grafts, cement may prevent motion and subsidence, thus avoiding possible subchondral bone necrosis associated with weightbearing. On the other hand, definitive stability of implanted grafts relies on osteointegration. According to the manufacturer, Kryptonite bone cement (Doctors Research Group Inc) allows bony ingrowth and osteointegration to take place within its porous structure and through a resorption process. However, the occurrence of osteointegration and the extent of cement resorption in this particular setting still have to be documented. Further studies are needed to shed light on those critical issues.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study demonstrated that cemented osteochondral grafts have greater primary stability than press-fit grafts at a 2- and 3-mm level below the cartilage surface for both single-graft and 3-in-a-row graft configurations. The greater stability provided by cemented fixation could facilitate patients’ rehabilitation by allowing early weightbearing. However, before recommending clinical use, in vivo evaluation of short-term stability as well as the occurrence of osteointegration will have to be conducted.</p>
