<abstract>
<p>Alcohol consumption is associated with increases in aggressive behaviour, but the mechanisms underlying this relationship are poorly understood. One mechanism by which alcohol consumption may influence behaviour is via alterations in the processing of social cues such as gaze. We investigated the effects of acute alcohol consumption on the perception of gaze, using a task in which participants determined whether a stimulus face was looking towards or away from them. Gaze direction varied across trials, allowing calculation of a threshold at which participants considered gaze to switch from direct to averted. Target faces varied in both sex and attractiveness. Thirty social drinkers attended three randomized experimental sessions. At each session, participants consumed 0.0, 0.2 or 0.4 g/kg alcohol, and completed the gaze perception task. A significant three-way interaction involving target sex, participant sex and alcohol dose indicated that alcohol increased the cone of gaze for females viewing male targets (i.e. females were biased towards making a direct gaze judgement), but decreased the cone of gaze for males viewing male targets. Our data indicate that alcohol consumption influences gaze perception, but that these effects vary across sex of both stimulus and rater. These effects may have important implications for alcohol-related violence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Alcohol consumption has a wide influence on social behaviour through both social and cognitive disinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881110385599">Mulvihill et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881110385599">Leeman et al., 2007</xref>). In particular, alcohol consumption is associated with increased aggression and interpersonal violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881110385599">Plant, 2004</xref>), and has been implicated as an important contributing factor in violent crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881110385599">Hoaken and Stewart, 2003</xref>). In addition, alcohol consumption is associated with ‘risky’ sexual behaviours with outcomes including unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881110385599">Leigh, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881110385599">Cooper, 2002</xref>). However, evidence of a direct pharmacological link between alcohol and such behaviours is equivocal. Alcohol may increase the likelihood of aggression indirectly by inducing alterations in a number of physiological, cognitive or affective states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881110385599">Bushman and Cooper, 1990</xref>). Furthermore, these effects are potentially confounded by expectancy effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881110385599">Quigley et al., 2002</xref>) and individual differences in both propensity to drink and propensity to engage in aggressive behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881110385599">Pihl et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to the lack of direct links between alcohol and behaviour, the detrimental effects of alcohol on cognition and information processing are well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881110385599">Hernandez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881110385599">Koelega, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881110385599">Maylor et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881110385599">Nelson et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881110385599">Rohrbaugh et al., 1988</xref>), and these changes may underlie or mediate any effects of alcohol on social behaviours such as aggression or sexual behaviour. Since the ability to understand another person’s state of mind or intentions is a key part of successful social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881110385599">Baron-Cohen, 1995</xref>), one possibility is that alcohol may have an influence on the perceptual judgements of social stimuli as they are encoded. For example, misattributions of emotional state, or sexual intent could lead to inappropriate behavioural responses.</p>
<p>A potential mechanism by which alcohol may change social attribution (be they related to agonistic or affiliative behaviours) is via alterations in the processing of the social information conveyed by faces. This model proposes that acute alcohol consumption may lead to a misattribution of traits, which in turn may increase the likelihood of an inappropriate behavioural response (e.g. aggressive behaviour in response to a perceived negative emotional facial cue, or attempted mating behaviour in response to an apparently proceptive opposite sex individual). Several studies have reported impairments to the processing of emotional facial cues in alcohol-dependent participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881110385599">Townshend and Duka, 2003</xref>), and in response to the acute effects of alcohol in social alcohol users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881110385599">Attwood et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881110385599">2009b</xref>). Both anecdotally and experimentally, alcohol has been suggested to increase ratings of facial attractiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881110385599">Jones et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881110385599">Parker et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A further important cue in both antagonistic and affiliative social situations is eye gaze, and altered processing of gaze information has been reported in disorders associated with deficits in social cognition, including schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881110385599">Langdon et al., 2006</xref>) and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881110385599">Nation and Penny, 2008</xref>). Gaze direction is a valuable source of social information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881110385599">Kleinke, 1986</xref>). First, eye gaze directed towards you is an unambiguous signal that you are the focus of a person’s attention. This signal can have both positive (affiliative gaze or attraction) and negative (such as threat) interpretations depending on the context in which the signals are being sent and received (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881110385599">Itier and Batty, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881110385599">Kellerman et al., 1989</xref>). Regardless of the context, direct gaze constitutes a significant stimulus that is likely to require some modification of behaviour (e.g. either share or avoid the other person’s gaze). Second, it has been proposed that the ability to decode various signals from the eyes is the foundation for a ‘mindreading system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881110385599">Baron-Cohen, 1995</xref>). In other words, observing someone else’s gaze behaviour not only tells you about their direction of attention in relation to you and other agents in the external world, it also allows you to make inferences about the person’s internal mental state (i.e. their thoughts, feelings and intentions). This ability is crucial in being able to predict another person’s behaviour through observation alone.</p>
<p>Consistent with the view that the detection of gaze direction is a skill fundamental to successful navigation of the social world, we are able to detect very small deviations in gaze direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881110385599">Gibson and Pick, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881110385599">Antis et al., 1969</xref>). Yet there is some ambiguity in the perception of direct gaze, as there is a range of gaze deviation from absolutely direct within which observers feel that gaze is mutually shared. This ambiguity has been usefully conceptualized as a ‘cone of gaze’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881110385599">Gamer and Hecht, 2007</xref>), within which direct gaze is perceived by an observer.</p>
<p>Given that alcohol consumption is known to influence the perception of attractiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881110385599">Parker et al, 2008</xref>) and disrupt processing of emotional cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881110385599">Attwood et al., 2009b</xref>), we investigated whether acute alcohol consumption would influence the perception of gaze direction. In addition, we examined whether any effects of alcohol consumption were modified by the attractiveness of the target. Given that attractiveness ratings tend to increase with alcohol, and that direct gaze can be associated with attractiveness, we hypothesized that alcohol may indeed widen the cone of gaze for more attractive targets. We used computer graphic techniques to present identical gaze information within both attractive and unattractive faces of both sexes, and presented these stimuli to male and female social alcohol drinkers.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0269881110385599">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Thirty (50% male) social alcohol consumers (defined as between 10 and 50 units/week for males, and 5 and 35 units/week for females; a unit is equivalent to 8 g pure ethanol) were recruited from the staff and students of the University of Bristol, and from the general population, by means of poster and flyer advertisements, and word of mouth. This drinking criteria was the same as used in previous studies examining the effects of alcohol on attractiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881110385599">Parker et al., 2008</xref>) and emotional processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881110385599">Attwood et al., 2009b</xref>). Participants were required to be in good psychological and physical health, aged between 18 and 40 years, and not currently taking any psychiatric medication, as verified by self-report. Exclusion criteria included current use of illicit substances (excluding cannabis) and a direct family history of alcoholism (defined as parent and/or sibling). Participants were asked to abstain from alcohol consumption for 12 hours prior to each test session, and recent alcohol consumption confirmed by a breath test. Participants were paid £10 or awarded course credits, as appropriate, at the end of testing.</p>

<sec id="section4-0269881110385599">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>Photographic images of faces used in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881110385599">Penton-Voak et al., 2006</xref>), asked to pose in a neutral expression (130 in total, 65 female) were made symmetrical using Psychomorph software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881110385599">Tiddeman et al., 2001</xref>), and cropped to remove features extraneous to the face. Further images (10 in total, 5 female) were ‘average’ faces created by morphing together five different male or female faces. Faces created in this way are typically rated more highly in attractiveness than the exemplars of which they are comprised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881110385599">Perrett et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>In order that we could have one pair of eyes to put on every face, all 130 original images were morphed together to create an androgynous ‘mega-morph’. From this image, the eye region (excluding the eyebrows) was copied and pasted on to each of the 130 original and the 10 averaged images to create 140 images with identical eyes. To create plausible faces, each of the faces was first given the same (average) texture that was present on the androgynous morph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881110385599">Tiddeman et al., 2001</xref>). This meant that there was no discontinuity between the texture of the face and the pasted eye region. All 140 images were then rated for attractiveness by 10 participants. One male and one female face from the top and bottom quartiles of these attractiveness ratings was selected for use in the current study, giving four base faces for use as stimuli.</p>
<p>Using Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA) the direction of the gaze was manipulated on the androgynous face. The pupil and the iris of each eye in the photo was moved 15 pixels to the left (from the position of the observer looking at the face), so that each photo was clearly looking to their right-hand side. The direct gaze eyes and the averted eyes of androgynous face were then copied onto the respective high attractive and low attractive faces of each sex. This resulted in a final set of eight photos, consisting of direct and averted gazes for both high and low attractiveness male and female faces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881110385599">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We then constructed morph continua between the direct and averted gaze versions of each face. This produced 99 additional faces in which only gaze direction altered in a sequence from direct to averted gaze. This procedure generated four continua: high attractiveness male, high attractiveness female, low attractiveness male and low attractiveness female. Images were presented in greyscale on a 17 TFT monitor. Stimulus presentation and data collection were controlled by Matlab 7.0 (The MathWorks Inc., MA).</p>
<p>Questionnaire measures comprised the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire – Revised (EPQ-R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881110385599">Eysenck and Eysenck, 1991</xref>), the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI State and Trait) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881110385599">Spielberger et al., 1983</xref>), the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881110385599">Saunders et al., 1993</xref>), the Alcohol Urges Questionnaire (AUQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881110385599">Bohn et al., 1995</xref>) and visual analogue scales measuring ratings of ‘happy’, ‘drowsy’, ‘depressed’, ‘anxious’, ‘energetic’, ‘irritable’ and ‘craving a drink’ on a 100-mm scale ranging from ‘Not at all’ to ‘Extremely’.</p>

<sec id="section5-0269881110385599">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Each participant attended three sessions, approximately 1 week apart, at which they received a drink containing 0.0, 0.2 or 0.4 g/kg of alcohol, in a randomized order. The drinks were made by an experimental collaborator, and administration was double-blind. Drinks were made using vodka at 37.5% alcohol, with one part vodka to three parts tonic water, or a placebo consisting of an equal total volume of tonic water. All drinks were flavoured using lime cordial and chilled prior to serving. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that this is an effective placebo-controlled design, with participants identifying the drink they are administered at chance level during consumption. Test sessions were held between 12:00 and 18:00 and participants attended all of their sessions at approximately the same time of day.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at the first test session, participants gave informed consent, completed a screening procedure to confirm their eligibility to take part and were weighed. At the start of all sessions, baseline readings of exhaled alcohol were taken, followed by ratings of mood, anxiety and craving (VAS, STAI-State and AUQ). Participants were then presented with the drink and were given 10 minutes to consume all of the drink, and a further 10 minutes to sit quietly. At session one only, participants also completed additional self-report measures of drinking behaviour and personality (AUDIT, EPQ-R and STAI-Trait) during this period. At the end of the 20-minute consumption period, participants completed post-drink ratings of mood, anxiety and craving (VAS, STAI-State and AUQ). Participants then completed a 20-minute facial perception task (data reported elsewhere), before beginning the gaze perception task.</p>
<p>Participants were informed that the experiment was designed to measure perception of gaze direction. Following instructions, they were seated 65  cm away from the monitor with their position fixed by means of a chinrest. Facial images (measuring approximately 10 cm × 7 cm) were centrally displayed on the monitor for 500  ms followed by a blank screen until response. To prevent adaptation to gaze direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881110385599">Jenkins et al., 2006</xref>), the symmetrical face images were inverted along the vertical axis on 50% of trials so that gaze appeared to shift both to the left and the right. Participants’ task was to indicate, by means of a key press (up and down arrow keys), whether or not they judged the target face to be gazing directly at them (i.e. sharing mutual gaze). Accurate rather than fast judgements were encouraged. The experiment continued until a participant’s Point of Subjective Equality (PSE) could be calculated. This was measured using Adaptive Probit Estimation (APE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881110385599">Watt and Andrews, 1981</xref>). APE yields an estimate of both the PSE and variance of a probit function fitted to the psychometric function. Throughout each run, APE continually updates estimates of the PSE calculated from the observer’s recent response history and uses these estimates to select the subtle changes in eye direction in the stimuli to be presented. The first probit fit occurs after 16 trials, and after every 8 trials thereafter. Sixty-four trials from each continua were presented to each participant, with each participant seeing 256 trials in each session. In this case, the PSE is the point at which the gaze is perceived to be looking directly at the observer, or averted 50% of the time (i.e. the step of the continuum where judgements are most uncertain). As such, PSE determines the boundary of the cone of gaze: images below the PSE are judged as most often looking at the observer, those above are judged most often as looking away.</p>
<p>On completion of the task, mood, anxiety and craving ratings (VAS, STAI-State and AUQ) were taken again. Participants were then reminded that they may have consumed alcohol and therefore should not to drive, operate heavy machinery or engage in any activity that they would not normally do after alcohol. At the end of the third session, participants were debriefed and reimbursed as appropriate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269881110385599">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All analyses were performed using SPSS v.16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL). Data were analysed using a 3 × 2 mixed model repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), with alcohol dose (0.0, 0.2 and 0.4 g/kg alcohol) as a within-subjects factor and participant sex (male, female) as a between-subjects factor. For the analysis of task data, target sex (male, female) and target attractiveness (low or high) were included as additional within-subjects factors, while for the analysis of questionnaire data, time (baseline, pre-task, post-task) was included as a within-subjects factor. Greenhouse–Geisser corrections were applied when indicated appropriate by Mauchly’s test of sphericity. Significant interaction effects were explored using simple effects ANOVA and Bonferroni-corrected <italic>t</italic>-tests. For the gaze task, 14 PSE data points (3.8%) were identified as outliers using box plots. These data points were replaced by the mean PSE for that stimulus category. An alpha level of 0.05 was maintained throughout, except in the case of VAS data where an alpha level of 0.007 was employed, corrected for seven independent tests using Bonferroni’s method.</p>

<p>For AUQ data, there was a significant time × participant sex interaction (<italic>F</italic> [1.6, 40.7] = 6.6, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003), reflecting an increase in AUQ scores from pre-drink to post-drink in females, but no change in males.

Including AUDIT score as a covariate did not change these findings.</p>
<p>For the VAS data, there was a main effect of time on ratings of ‘drowsy’ (<italic>F</italic> [2, 56] = 6.3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) and ‘energetic’ (<italic>F</italic> [2, 56] = 15.0, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), reflecting a decrease in self-report of ‘energetic’, and an increase in ratings of ‘drowsy’ over time.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our data present robust evidence that differences in the perception of direct gaze depend on aspects of the face which are gaze irrelevant, such as sex and, to a lesser extent, attractiveness. Our findings also show that decisions about gaze direction are affected by the acute effects of alcohol consumption in social drinkers. Identical gaze information is interpreted differently in male and female faces, and is further complicated by target attractiveness. Given that the gaze information in our stimuli was carefully controlled to be identical in all categories of stimuli, we feel that this is more likely to reflect a top-down socio-cognitive process than a perceptual property of the stimulus. The properties of the face appear to bias the perception of the cone of gaze, perhaps reflecting experience with the social environment. Although any attempt to infer the nature of this process is necessarily speculative, given the data available, the social perception literature does present some interesting possibilities.</p>
<p>First, our data indicated that target sex has an influence on the perception of mutual gaze, with male faces leading to wider cone of gaze judgements than female faces. Male faces are perceived as both more threatening and dominant than female faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881110385599">Perrett et al., 1998</xref>), so one interpretation of this finding is that it represents a functional bias in information processing. Error management theory (an application of signal detection theory to the social realm) suggests that social decision-making mechanisms under uncertainty are not based solely on accuracy (correct versus incorrect decisions), but are also based on the costs and benefits of making specific types of error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881110385599">Haselton and Buss, 2000</xref>). In this case, the costs of failing to realize that you are the target of attention of a potential threat (here, an unfamiliar male face) may outweigh the costs of occasionally mistaking yourself as the object of attention when you are in fact not. The consequence of such a decision-making process may be to widen the cone of gaze when viewing male faces to err on the side of caution in this context.</p>
<p>The effects of acute alcohol consumption were observed on cone of gaze judgements that differed for male and female participants. The alcohol doses used are consistent with many previous studies in the literature, with the 0.4 g/kg dose specifically chosen as being just below the threshold at which gross motor impairment is typically observed, which may be problematic when computer-based behavioural tasks are employed. However, in comparison to alcohol doses in the research literature, this is a relatively low dose. That such a low dose causes a measurable change in gaze perception is notable. Unfortunately, blood alcohol content was not recorded in this study, which is a potential limitation. However, we have collected these data in other studies using the same procedure (data submitted), which have consistently shown blood alcohol content levels of 0.06  mg/l following a 0.13 g/kg dose and 0.70 mg/l following a 0.40 g/kg dose. We asked participants what they thought that they had received at the end of the session (approximately 40 minutes after consumption), at which point participants have had sufficient time to perceive these effects. Therefore, awareness of having received alcohol is consistently higher in the alcohol conditions as would be expected. We do not have data, however to verify awareness at the beginning of the task battery, when awareness may be lower. We avoid asking participants at this time as it may prime them to think about the effects of the drink just prior to completing the tasks. This is a limitation of most alcohol studies.</p>
<p>After consuming alcohol, there was a significant decrease in the cone of gaze when male participants viewed male targets. This may be due to a disruption of the cost–benefit analysis described above, as a result of alcohol-induced impairments of orbitofrontal cortex function which is implicated in assigning value to risk and reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881110385599">Pais-Vieira et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881110385599">Wallis, 2007</xref>). Arguably, decreased perception of direct gaze of another male would lead to a decreased likelihood of aggressive behaviour due to a decreased perception of threat. This is clearly at odds with the well-reported link between alcohol consumption and aggressive behaviour. However, as direct gaze can be a dominance cue, one speculative consequence of this finding is that men, when intoxicated, simply fail to perceive this social signal, leading to an escalation of male–male dominance competition that could culminate in an aggressive encounter. Indeed, in support of this, there is experimental evidence that direct gaze can dissuade aggressive acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881110385599">Ellsworth and Carlsmith, 1973</xref>). In practice, the social meaning of direct gaze is likely to vary situationally: our major point is that alcohol related disruption of the understanding of social signals may lead to inappropriate responses in some circumstances, not that direct gaze will always be interpreted aggressively.</p>
<p>In contrast, female participants showed an increased cone of gaze after alcohol consumption, particularly when viewing male targets. This may reflect an increased perception of threat, perhaps as a result of feelings of vulnerability after alcohol. An alternative explanation is that there is an increased perception of being the focus of male attention, potentially influenced by an alcohol-related heightening of sexual arousal or sex-related cognitions. This effect may be more likely to occur in women, as they are stereotypically more likely to be approached by men than vice versa in mate search contexts. As eye gaze is a primary cue for conveying social attention, women may be more sensitized to using gaze as a predictor of opposite-sex interest, or to signal their own interest, rather than more dominant approach behaviours.</p>
<p>It has been previously shown that judgements of eye gaze are associated with the emotion of the face, with avoidance-related traits being most associated with averted gaze, and approach-related traits more associated with direct gaze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881110385599">Adams and Kleck, 2003</xref>). The faces presented were derived from emotionally neutral faces (although some observers report that the unattractive male seems to have a slightly positive expression, a potential weakness that is hard to interpret in the current experiment but should be considered in future work), and it is possible that the sex differences observed in eye gaze perception after alcohol were, at least in part, due to differences in the attribution of emotional state to the neutral targets in male and female participants. Comparable data are not available in the current study to ascertain the relevance of emotional judgement, but future research could explore this.</p>
<p>Although the effects of attractiveness were observed in relation to target sex, there were no interactions between alcohol consumption and attractiveness. This would suggest that the attractiveness of the target has little effect on alcohol-related influences on eye gaze perception. However, it has previously been reported, both anecdotally and experimentally, that alcohol consumption increases ratings of facial attractiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881110385599">Parker et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, the lack of an interaction between alcohol and attractiveness may reflect a general increase in the perceived attractiveness of the targets in the unattractive condition to an extent that undermined the attractive–unattractive distinction. In addition, although the stimuli were designed to vary in attractiveness, three experimental constraints may have reduced the effectiveness of this manipulation. First, both unattractive and attractive faces had identical eyes, and the eye region is important in attractiveness judgements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881110385599">Fink and Penton-Voak, 2002</xref>). Second, to allow the eyes to be placed on attractive and unattractive faces, the skin texture was identical in all faces. Skin texture is also an important cue in attractiveness judgements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881110385599">Jones et al., 2004</xref>). Third, to allow gaze to be manipulated in both directions, and to prevent gaze judgements from being cued to the left or right by asymmetric facial features, all stimuli faces were perfectly symmetric, another property of attractive faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881110385599">Perrett et al., 1999</xref>). As such, attractiveness differences in our stimuli may not have been sufficiently large to elicit any variation in social perception.</p>
<p>A final note should be made regarding the drinking status of our sample. Although we recruited ‘social drinkers’, the mean AUDIT score was indicative of harmful drinking. We attribute this largely to the fact that our participants were predominantly students and that we do not recruit from the lower end of the drinking spectrum (i.e. &lt;5 or &lt;10 units alcohol/week for females and males, respectively), in order to reduce the likelihood of any adverse responses to alcohol. In our experience AUDIT scores are often inflated in student populations where there are numerous social events at which drinking is often actively encouraged (e.g. club nights, bar crawls) and where work commitments are fewer and/or more flexible. In support, comparable scores (e.g. 13–16) have been obtained in other studies with similar samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881110385599">Attwood et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881110385599">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881110385599">Parker et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, the high AUDIT classification in the current sample should be taken into account when generalizing these findings.</p>
<p>In our task, no explicit social context was set for the judgements of gaze direction other than cues implicit in the sex and attractiveness of the face. While this approach allows the investigation of participants’ basic biases, and the effect of alcohol on these biases, real-world gaze judgements occur in specific, context-bound interactions. Given that our studies indicate that characteristics of both target and observer can influence the interpretation of ambiguous gaze cues, a clear next step is to manipulate the context in which a gaze judgement is made. For example, if an aggressive context is made salient to observers, we may predict that the sex and/or emotional expression of a target faces will influence perceived mutual gaze more so than in a neutral context as we used here. Furthermore, there may individual differences (e.g. trait aggression) of considerable importance to social processing that should be considered in future work. This will allow the systematic investigation of the interaction between social context, alcohol consumption and social perception, which may prove fruitful in understanding the aetiology of alcohol-related violence and sexual behaviour.</p>
