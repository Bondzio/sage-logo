<abstract>
<p>Emigration of qualified teachers from developing countries is a double loss for the source countries, not only leading to emigration of high-skill labour but also affecting their future developmental base when these countries are already struggling to meet the millennium development goals (MDGs) in education. This article discusses emigration of Indian school teachers driven by rising demand in the destination countries, their dissatisfaction with the Indian education system and desire for a better life. The developed countries facing shortage of teachers, are actively recruiting from the developing countries like India to fill the gaps in the demand and supply of teachers. The shortages are caused by demand supply imbalances due to unattractiveness of the teaching profession, mass retirement of the baby-boom population of teachers, and high rates of teacher turnover in the recruiting countries. Such circumstances compel them to recruit teachers from other countries, creating an international market for teachers comprising the recruiting countries, source countries, the teachers, and the recruiting agents. While India is considered a labour-surplus country, it has serious shortage of teachers especially in the rural areas. The shortages have been projected to rise after the enforcement of the Right to Education (RTE) Act. Hence, the obscured trend of rise in teacher migration from India calls for attention. The author utilises the findings of an empirical study on migration of school teachers from India to argue the need of reforms in the Indian education system which are imperative to retain qualified and motivated teachers within the system which is required to fulfill the educational goals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although migration is not a new phenomenon and its origin dates centuries back, in the present era of increasing “globalisation”, increase in the dimension of migration and the changing profile of people migrating after the liberalisation usher has renewed dialogues among the governments, policymakers, and researchers. Although international migration has been a topic of debate, international migration of the highly skilled workers, also called as the knowledge workers, has been, inter alia, a major area of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311433206">Khadria, 1999</xref>). The rationale for such an immense importance attached to the issue of highly skilled migration is derived from the theories of human capital. The human capital theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1028315311433206">Becker, 1964</xref>) emphasised the contribution of skilled people in the development of a nation by establishing that the effective use of physical capital itself is dependent on the availability of efficient human capital. This contribution was originally highlighted due to the failure of traditional theories of growth (where inputs were defined as homogeneous units of labour and capital) to provide explanation for the “residual” factor in the total economic growth which could not be accounted for by the growth of the traditional factors of production. In early work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1028315311433206">Robert Solow (1957)</xref> the “residual” of unexplained growth was ascribed to technological change, but later, this general term was broken down to include improvements in the quality of capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1028315311433206">Denison, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1028315311433206">Griliches &amp; Jorgensen, 1966</xref>) and the investment in human beings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1028315311433206">Schultz, 1962</xref>). This investment in human beings which is done through education, training and other such investments determines the human capital of a nation. Owing to the importance of human capital in the development process, its outflow in the form of knowledge workers (also called the brain drain) hampers the pace of progress of the source countries. Hence, skilled out-migration from developing countries implies a net transfer of human capital and scarce resources (in the form of the cost of educating these workers) from low- to high-income countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1028315311433206">United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1028315311433206">World Bank, 2006</xref>). Moreover, among skilled workers there are serious concerns regarding outflow of human resources in social sectors like health and education as these are the basic areas for the development of a country, casting both a direct impact on the quality of a country’s human capital and on the overall well-being of a nation. Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1028315311433206">Sen (1999)</xref> points out how changes in spheres such as education and health can be important in the expansion of freedoms, and that they are significant not only for the reason of a nation’s growth and development but also as they are source of human freedoms.</p>
<p>Teacher migration leads to a double loss of both the educational input and output from the source country. It cannot be clubbed together as such with the other streams of highly skilled migration as with emigration of the highly skilled teachers, on one hand the source country is deprived of its human capital and on the other hand the possibility of erosion of the base for further development cannot be neglected. A teacher is the fulcrum around which the education system revolves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1028315311433206">National Council for Educational Research and Training, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1028315311433206">Commonwealth Secretariat (2003)</xref> observed,
<disp-quote>
<p>The link between effectiveness in education and the quality of teachers is undisputed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1028315311433206">1</xref></sup> Teachers play a pivotal role in the education system in any country, but the role of the teacher is even more relevant in developing countries and in areas where the educational environment is challenged and learning resources are limited. (p. 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The role of teachers in the education system is far reaching and multifaceted from maintaining the quality of education to providing access to education.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1028315311433206">2</xref></sup> Hence, emigration of well-qualified teachers from developing countries might have an adverse impact on its education system. However, there can be a possibility where teacher migration can be utilised to create a win-win-win situation for the destination country, the source country and the migrant teachers. If managed properly it can meet the shortage in the destination countries, bring the benefits of better educational methods and techniques via internationally exposed teachers to the source countries, and provide opportunities of professional and economic development for the teachers. However, a systematic database or information is imperative for undertaking such deliberations. In the absence of any such attempt, the present paper aims to venture in the area of teacher migration from India.</p>
<p>The article attempts to examine the extent and nature of teacher migration from India and to assess its causes and outcomes. The section on worldwide international migration of teachers gives a global overview of the extent and trends of international migration of teachers. Certain country studies are discussed to pinpoint the main features of teacher migration from source countries. The section on international migration of teachers from India presents the picture of teacher migration from India to various countries. The third section, Implications of Teacher Out-Migration From a Developing Country—India, deliberates the impact of teacher migration within the Indian context. Based on a small sample survey, the fourth section, A Case Study of Migration of School Teachers From India, delineates the migration cycle of teachers from India and their experiences, drawing comparisons for different destination countries. The last section concludes by listing the major issues, characteristics, and implications of teacher migration from India.</p>

<title>Worldwide International Migration of Teachers</title>
<p>Academicians and educators have been migrating since the time when ancient Greeks first tutored the Romans. Also, thousands of years ago, Indian saints and seers (people with knowledge of philosophy) travelled to various parts of the world to spread their knowledge to countries like Cambodia, Vietnam, China, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1028315311433206">Aggarwal, 2001</xref>). However, with the advent of globalisation there has been a sea change in the nature of this academic mobility. The increasing volume of teacher migration can be understood by analysing the shift in migration patterns towards an increasing proportion of highly skilled people, of whom teachers form one of the most important categories. Teacher migration has emerged as an area of concern among the developing countries that have been facing net loss of teachers to the developed countries. Increasing international migration of skilled professional teachers is aggravating teacher loss which has become a major issue in many countries across the world, particularly the small and less developed countries which are trying to maintain their national schooling systems to fulfil millennium development goals (MDGs) and Universal Primary Education (UPE) by 2015, and are facing teacher shortages at various levels. Although developed countries are also facing shortage of teachers (discussed later in the article), they are able to fill this gap by attracting and recruiting teachers from other less developed or developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1028315311433206">Commonwealth Secretariat, 2006</xref>). The huge wave of teacher migration is caused by an acute shortage of teachers in western countries, inter alia, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Importantly, teacher migration is highly prevalent among countries having an education system majorly based on English language like the United States, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Canada, Jamaica, India, Malaysia, and various other countries which have English as a medium of instruction. In cases where English is not a medium of instruction teacher migration is not observed as significant which might be due to language barrier.</p>
<p>International recruitment has created a global market for teachers as many of the developed countries have even set up special agencies to recruit teachers from abroad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1028315311433206">National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, 2005</xref>). According to Education International, there are approximately 100 private agencies in the United Kingdom which recruit teachers from Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1028315311433206">STPD, 2005</xref>). A report by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) stated that about 10,000 overseas teachers were recruited in 2000 in the OECD region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1028315311433206">OECD, 2005</xref>). As per other sources, nearly 19,000 foreign teachers were working in the United States on temporary visas in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1028315311433206">American Federation of Teachers, 2009</xref>). Moreover, teacher mobility does not only occur between poor and rich countries only but also across neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>Even though the trend is widespread, the area of international migration of teachers has not been researched significantly, until recently, when the governments of the Commonwealth nations felt the pressure of teacher shortage and the importance of the issue of teacher migration from less developed to more developed countries. This led the Commonwealth Secretariat to commission a study, published in September 2003, called <italic>Teaching at Risk: Teacher Mobility and Loss in Commonwealth Member States</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1028315311433206">3</xref></sup> The study contributed to international understanding of the teaching profession and the global challenge of teacher loss and migration. Establishing the role of teacher migration in teacher loss the study proved to be a milestone by providing a background for development of the Commonwealth Teacher Recruitment Protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1028315311433206">Commonwealth Secretariat, 2004</xref>) signed by 23 member nations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1028315311433206">4</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The protocol presents a “code of conduct” which outlines the rights and responsibilities of recruiting and source countries, as well as recruited teachers. It explains the benefits which can be availed from well-managed teacher exchanges but stresses that recruitment can also harm a national education system by taking away its best asset: trained teachers. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1028315311433206">UNESCO, 2006</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There exists vast disparity in the achievement of MDGs in education and EFA targets of “achieving Universal Primary Education (UPE) by 2015”. Even within the Commonwealth, some industrialised members have been able to provide primary education to all while others will certainly not achieve UPE by 2015 or for many years after that. The existing disparity between the developed and less developed countries justifies the objection and concern over migration of teachers from latter to the former (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1028315311433206">Commonwealth Secretariat, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The available literature on teacher migration makes it evident that substantial numbers of teachers are on the move as national governments attempting to cope with a shortfall in the supply of teachers in their own country are relying on international recruitment from outside their national boundaries. Unfortunately, the problem of shortage of really reliable information makes it difficult to determine the exact scenario and numbers. “The governments are either not recording the inflows or they are reluctant to provide the numbers of immigrant teachers. Large scale teacher migration prevalent today is being used by countries to fulfil teacher shortages” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1028315311433206">Laming, 2007</xref>). The short-term solution of hiring skilled teachers who are immediately available and who have the right qualifications to fill existing places is inappropriate as a long-term solution and indicates poor social and economic planning by the recruiting countries. As discussed earlier also, out-migration of highly skilled teachers from the developing countries is a net loss of human capital to the source country’s education system. Caution needs to be exercised in international recruitment of teachers from the developing countries as a pilot study<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1028315311433206">5</xref></sup> conducted by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1028315311433206">Commonwealth Secretariat (2006)</xref> observes, “The migration of highly skilled workers, including teachers, is a global phenomenon that is unlikely to slow down in the near future and that needs to be managed to maximise its benefits and minimise its costs (p. 4)”.</p>
<sec id="section3-1028315311433206">
<title>Country Studies</title>
<p>Review of a few studies available on teacher migration suggests that it has been detrimental for the education systems of the source countries. The studies indicate that the major cause of emigration of school teachers from the source countries is their dissatisfaction from the home country’s education system and a strong desire to reap economic and professional opportunities available in the destination countries. Some of these studies have been briefly discussed below:</p>
<list id="list1-1028315311433206" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>While discussing the impact of international teacher mobility on the education systems of two neighbouring countries, South Africa and Botswana, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1028315311433206">Appleton, Sives, and Morgan (2006)</xref> mention, “The significance of international teacher mobility for developing country education systems lies less in its quantitative effects in terms of numbers of trained teachers and more in its qualitative effects in terms of the kind of teachers who move.” The finding denotes that migrating teachers are among the best and migration drains the source country of its best teachers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>On the issue of migration of Fiji teachers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1028315311433206">Voigt-Graf (2003)</xref> remarked that migration of teachers adversely affects the quality of education in Fiji having limited human resource capacity. Emigration of teachers, the largest professional group of migrants, has led to filling of vacancies by less experienced and junior teachers and has led to falling educational standards. Rural schools particularly find it difficult to recruit and keep qualified and experienced personnel resulting in the drain of some of the best teachers from rural areas. For the Fiji Island Education Commission and its Education Ministry, both the quality and quantity of its teachers are serious concerns. The high turnover of teaching staff and emigration of considerable numbers of teachers are widely considered to have adversely affected educational standards in Fiji.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In small island states like Jamaica, there is loss of relatively large numbers of teachers in just one recruitment exercise, which appears to have been a relatively “disorganised” organised process. This has caused a number of difficulties including the disruption of schools because of the recruitment of teachers during the school year, the recruitment of experienced senior teachers who have been replaced by newly qualified teachers, and concerns about the treatment of the migrated teachers while working abroad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1028315311433206">Commonwealth Secretariat, 2006</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Analysing teacher migration from South Africa to the UK, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1028315311433206">Manik (2007)</xref> points out the dearth of literature on teacher migration. She reveals two cohorts of teachers leaving South Africa to pursue socioeconomic and career opportunities abroad that are both experienced and novice (inexperienced). The major reasons for teachers leaving South Africa are career dissatisfaction, financial and travel incentives, job-related conditions, and global experience. Financial imperative is a major factor for the migration of experienced teachers who were heads of the households whilst a majority of the migrant teachers were females. Migrant teachers varied in their biographical profiles, levels of resilience in the United Kingdom, sociocultural experiences and duration of stay abroad. Also, migrant teachers met conflicting experiences in the schools and the host society. Poor student discipline, loneliness, and climatic problems led to a stream of return migration, but within a year remigration was being considered. Hence, there exist dominant push factors for teacher migration from South Africa.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Amidst rising levels of international teacher migration, India, which is a leading source country for the highly skilled workers like scientists, doctors, engineers, nurses, and IT professionals, is also actively participating in the global market for teachers by sending teachers to various recruiting countries. The following section focuses on the extent and nature of teacher migration from India.</p></list-item>

<title>International Migration of Teachers From India</title>
<p>Indian academicians (teachers and researchers) have emerged as a major category among the highly skilled emigrants in the past decade due to all-pervasive internationalisation of education. Owing to the growing demand for teachers in many developed countries, Indian teachers are being constantly attracted towards them. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1028315311433206">India Together (2003)</xref> discusses the “swelling migration” of Indian teachers, particularly to Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom, triggered by a grave shortage of teachers in these countries. The article remarked that “the outward bound diaspora of Indian teachers reflects the fundamental transformation of the global labour market in recent years,” and it offers the thought that if the WTO further frees up cross border trade in services, India would become one of the leading suppliers of trained school teachers for developed countries. Today, the destination countries for Indian teachers cover a wide range from developed countries of west such as the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the United States; Gulf countries such as Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Sharjah, and Qatar; to Asian countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Maldives, and others. One major difficulty in tracing emigration of teachers both internationally and from India is the absence of systematic data. However, informal estimates show that in past few years hundreds of Indian teachers have been recruited by American and British schools and more are planning to emigrate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1028315311433206">Deodhar (2002)</xref> noted that “already about 10,000 secondary school teachers are working outside the country, and increasingly there is a growing demand for Indian teachers, especially in mathematics, sciences and English.”</p>
<p>The international demand for Indian teachers is not an entirely new phenomenon. In the 1960s, sizeable contingents of Indian teachers, particularly from Kerala and Tamilnadu, went to countries such as South Africa, Nigeria, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and to South-East Asian countries to teach in schools and colleges. Due to the existence of a large Indian diaspora, numerous job opportunities arise in Indian schools overseas. Also the number of CBSE schools outside the country has been estimated to be more than 100, with the largest concentration in West Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1028315311433206">India Together, 2003</xref>). However, the contemporary concerns are based on the rise in the volume and the changing nature of teacher migration from India. It has been contemplated that owing to highly selective and controlled immigration systems of the developed countries, India is likely to lose from the best teachers. Moreover, as was also seen in the case of Jamaica, when Indian teachers leave their jobs and emigrate, it generally takes six months to replace them, and during this period the students are adversely affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1028315311433206">India Together, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Like other teachers, Indian teachers are also largely attracted by economic opportunities in the developed countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1028315311433206">Education in India, 2004</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1028315311433206">6</xref></sup> These teachers are able to accumulate savings and also remit a good amount of money to their families in India. As teacher migration has become more organised over years, Indian teachers are being recruited through various modes like recruitment agencies, district education boards, education departments, and universities, directly by schools and via online. The next part of the article discusses the issues involved in teacher migration from India to the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries such as the Gulf countries and other developing countries of the world.</p>
<sec id="section5-1028315311433206">
<title>Migration of Indian Teachers to the United States and the United Kingdom</title>
<p>In the United States a significant number of school teachers have been recruited to teach in schools by various modes of recruitment. This is due to acute shortage of mathematics, science, and English teachers due to the retirement of the existing teachers and migration of native teachers to lucrative jobs in other sectors of the economy. According to the report of the National Commission on Teaching and America’s Future, there is a chronic teacher-retention crisis in the United States with as many as one-third of them quitting the profession after just 3 years on the job and one-half quitting after 5 years. The report entitled “No Dream Denied: A Pledge to America’s Children” says that more than 250,000 American teachers opt out of classrooms every year in favour of other jobs and professions. Also, teachers leaving for reasons other than retirement in the United States outnumber those retiring by about 3:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1028315311433206">Barber, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Nowadays there are large number of advertisements for job vacancies in newspapers by recruiters and employers seeking teachers from India. In the past decade, a large number of recruitment agencies have come up, which are engaged in the field of recruiting Indian teachers for overseas jobs in response to soaring demand for teachers in the developed countries. Jason Lyons, Houston-based vice president of U.S. Employment, a firm which recruits teachers from India for United States’ schools reported to <italic>Economic Weekly</italic> that they have placed more than 100 teachers from India in schools in 10 states in the United States between 2002 and 2003 and that they expected steady growth in India recruitment operations over the following years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1028315311433206">India Together, 2003</xref>). The greatest demand is for mathematics, special education, and science teachers. However, they also reported to have placed some outstanding elementary and English teachers from India in the U.S. schools. Among other things, salary is what attracts Indian teachers towards United States as most school jobs pay near or about US$35,000 (Rs.1,600,000) per year, offered by American local governments (with private schools offering better pay and perks) which is much higher than the Indian salary. In 2008, a report stated that there were 17 teachers from India teaching in the St. Lucie County School District since 2007 fall. These teachers were appointed as part of the Merit India Teacher program with Florida Atlantic University. The purpose of the program was to help school districts in the U.S. state to fill vacancies for experienced math and science teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1028315311433206">Westbury, 2008</xref>). In 2009, Educational Consultants India Limited (EdCIL) and State Department of Education, United States, signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for implementing a visiting teachers’ programme to promote a lasting relationship between communities of South Carolina and Connecticut in India by inducting teachers from India to schools in the United States; and to provide students an opportunity to participate in classes taught by teachers from Indian culture. However, this was aimed to be a long-term idea which had a clause of 1 year contract to be renewed every year. Also, if one examines, it is evident that the appointments were made in the subject areas in which the U. S. school districts were facing shortage of teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1028315311433206">Careers-India, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In the case of the United Kingdom, conservative estimates indicated a shortage of 2,500 teachers in 2002 which could possibly have been as high as 40,000. Also, there were 4,480 vacancies for nursery, primary, secondary, and special schools in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1028315311433206">Commonwealth Secretariat, 2003</xref>, p. 7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1028315311433206">2006</xref>, p. 12). Looming shortage of teachers in the developed countries has drawn their governments towards developing countries like India for recruiting well-qualified school teachers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1028315311433206">Miller (2006)</xref> found that around 43,000 Overseas Trained Teachers (OTTs) were working across the United Kingdom in 2006. Within the Commonwealth of Nations, England received teachers mostly from the developing countries, and several others from the developed countries. He also mentioned that the Home Office and Work Permits United Kingdom (as on December, 2006) confirmed that for the period January 1997 to July 2006 a total of 44,319 work permits and work permit extensions were issued to persons from overseas where the category included “teachers and trainers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1028315311433206">Miller, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1028315311433206">Table 1</xref> provides the number of foreign teachers who have been teaching in the United Kingdom on a work permit. There were 174 Indian teachers teaching in the United Kingdom on a work permit in 2003. Similar to the United States, teachers’ salary in the United Kingdom is the biggest draw for Indian teachers who start at £17,000 a year with a potential to draw as much as £27,000 once he or she has attained required qualifications in the United Kingdom or worked for a number of years. In the case of these developed countries generally, the school boards contact recruitment agencies which in turn advertise vacancies in India. After the applicants are vetted, school officials either come to India or interview potential candidates over phone, or in some cases through video conferencing, before employing them.</p>

<p>However, there is serious unavailability of data in this regard. In 2003, responding to a series of questions about OTTs working in the U.K. schools, the education minister said that the information on numbers of teachers with overseas qualifications was not available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1028315311433206">Commons Hansard, 2003</xref>). A report by Her Majesty’s Inspectors (HMI) found that only 3 among the 17 local education authorities (LEAs) surveyed had “good data” about the numbers of OTTs working in their schools, even though 6 of the 17 were actively recruiting teachers from overseas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1028315311433206">Office for Standards in Education, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Migration of Indian Teachers to Other Countries</title>
<p>Apart from the United States and the United Kingdom there is rising demand for Indian teachers in the Middle East, African, and Asian countries for teaching in English. Also, this trend is not limited only for the developed countries. Faced with an acute shortage of teachers, Bhutan’s education ministry has been attracting tutors from its neighbour India with special packages and allowances. The education ministry provided 20% of basic salary as “scarcity allowance” to Indians working in the country which was clubbed with the 30% contract allowance that is paid to Indian teachers over and above the basic salary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1028315311433206">Overseas Indians, 2006</xref>). Indian teachers have also been recruited in the Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and Oman. The most attractive prospect for job seekers in the Gulf is that working there provides an opportunity to save a major part of one’s salary with tax-free income and free housing. Except for food, telephone and recreation, most other expenses of daily living are provided in addition to the salary. Indian teachers have also traditionally migrated to the African countries. Thousands of Indian school teachers taught in Nigeria, Uganda and South Africa till a change in governmental policies and xenophobic outbreaks forced them to leave. However, demand still exists in a few countries like Zambia, Nigeria, etc.</p>
<p>EdCIL, a public sector unit, recruits teachers from India for overseas jobs as and when vacancies arise as a result of agreements between governments. “We go about it through ads and education fairs, but we have the added credibility of being a government institution,” says Ajit Kumar Motwani, director (technical) of EdCIL. It sends more than 400 teachers abroad every year and its “focus is on the Asian and African countries.” Similar to other Commonwealth countries, Indian teachers are also high in demand due to their grasp of English. The global preference for Indian teachers also arises due to their adaptability to the curriculum and respect for host country’s traditions. Especially in the Gulf countries, Indian teachers are preferred since they do not cause cultural shocks like the teachers from the west (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1028315311433206">Education in India, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1028315311433206">All India Management Association &amp; The Boston Consulting Group, 2003</xref>) projects that the manpower shortages in the developed nations will attenuate the already evident worldwide deficit of trained teachers. Like other source countries such as South Africa, Jamaica and Fiji, India is also facing shortage of teachers. These shortages are an obstacle in achieving educational goals of the country. The next section discusses the possible impact of emigration of school teachers from India on the country as it is already struggling to meet its educational goals.</p>

<title>Implications of Teacher Out-Migration From a Developing Country—India</title>
<p>As has been stated earlier, many of the developing countries like India have been striving since long to overcome the shortcomings of the education system at various stages. In order to fulfil the MDGs in education and the goal of Universal Elementary Education (UEE), India needs to overcome the obstacles in providing access and excellence in education. However, shortage of well-qualified teachers is widespread in various parts of the country and its proportion also varies from one region to the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1028315311433206">National Council for Teacher Education, 2010</xref>). The crisis is alarming in case of many rural and underdeveloped areas such as Doara in West Bengal, Bihar, and many other states. Even cities such as Delhi and Calcutta experience teacher shortages. Contrary to the initial trend and belief according to which only government schools faced the shortage and teacher turnover, public schools with good reputation are also facing hardships in recruiting well-qualified teachers now. To fulfil the requirements of the recently passed Right to Education (RTE) Act (2009), India needs additional 1.2 million teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1028315311433206">The Asian Age, 2010</xref>). Hence, teacher shortage is a serious concern for the Indian education system. In the light of the present needs of the Indian education system international migration of teachers from India may lead to “brain drain,” as when our own schools are facing shortage of well-qualified teachers, emigration of qualified teachers is likely to worsen the situation. Moreover, due to falling attractiveness of the teaching profession in comparison to other corporate high-paying jobs, youth are not entering this field which further deepens the problem. Where teachers have been trained at public expense (subsidised public education system) and where their skills and expertise cannot easily be replaced, their loss may represent a major impediment to the achievement of educational goals. As a result of teacher migration, many of the developing countries that are already having a tough time while trying to revive their weak education systems are deemed to see even more difficult times in future. Till the time teachers who are neglected and uncared for by the authorities in their own countries are attracted by teaching and other jobs in the developed countries that pay them better than what they get in the source country, they will continue to migrate. As for the source countries, since this migration is highly controlled and selective as a result of immigration policies, they are bound to lose their most important assets, skilled human capital which forms the foundation of a growing knowledge economy, to developed countries which are able to pay higher salaries due to their economic and political position. The next section presents the findings of a small sample survey on migrant Indian school teachers regarding their academic profile, causes of migration, salary differentials, and experiences. It deliberates to draw some conclusions regarding teacher migration from India, however realising that the findings may not be generalised.</p>

<title>A Case Study of Migration of School Teachers From India</title>
<p>This section presents a small sample study on international migration of teachers from India deliberating to study the direction, causes, and experiences of teacher migration from India. The present survey studies the population of school teachers of Indian origin who are teaching abroad, through a small sample study comprising 25 school teachers from high schools (in United States) and senior secondary schools (in Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Malaysia; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1028315311433206">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The sample has been selected through a form of purposive sampling, namely snowball sampling, due to the absence of database of any kind on the Indian migrant teacher population. A detailed, semistructured questionnaire has been used for the study.</p>
<sec id="section9-1028315311433206">
<title>Findings of the Survey</title>
<p>Majority of the migrant teachers were economically and professionally satisfied. The teachers were receiving much higher salaries in the destination countries as compared to their Indian salaries. However, a clear demarcation existed between the experiences of teachers migrating to the United States and to other Asian and Middle-East countries. The teachers in United States were found to be earning higher salaries, saving more and availing greater opportunities for professional development. Also, importantly, the teachers expressed that teaching in the destination country has been a challenging experience. Brief findings of the research, as divided into six heads, are described below.</p>
<sec id="section10-1028315311433206">
<title>Personal social profile of migrant teachers</title>
<p>Most of the migrant teachers were above 30 years of age, with a majority of above 35 years and none of them were below 25 years. Nineteen were females and six were male. Hence, we observe the increasing dominance of females in teaching profession where the number of female migrant teachers was three times the number of male teachers. This confirms the popular belief that school teaching is a female-dominated profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1028315311433206">Wylie, 2000</xref>) and highlights female participation in international migration. However, the sample also comprised female teachers migrating as a result of their husband’s migration. Further, as all the teachers are highly qualified and experienced, it could be deduced that a person’s education plays an important role in migration.</p>
<p>Almost all the teachers, that is 22, belonged to general category in social castes; only 3 belonged to OBC category; and none of them were from the categories of SC and ST.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1028315311433206">7</xref></sup> Hence, we find that a majority of the teachers migrating from India are from higher social castes falling only in the category of general and OBC, while none are in the categories of SC and ST which are considered one of the most socially deprived categories. Also, majority of the teachers were still Indian nationals—19. While some had become United States (5) and Malaysian (1) citizens, none of the teachers in United Arab Emirates and Qatar have become citizen there.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1028315311433206">
<title>Academic and professional profile</title>
<p>11 teachers were Bachelor of Science (BSc) graduates making them the largest category. 3 teachers each have done Engineering and Bachelor of Arts (BA), while 2 teachers, each, have done BSc (Computers) and Maths (Honours). Also, one teacher each has done Bachelor of Physical Education (BPEd), BA (Hindi), BA (English), and Bachelor of Commerce (BCom). Similar to the graduate degrees, the master degrees also indicated that Indian teachers are in high demand in science, mathematics, and computer science fuelling their migration. Owing to the importance of formal teaching qualifications, 19 teachers have acquired Bachelor of Education (BEd) in India before migrating, whereas 2 of them gained formal teaching qualification after migrating to United States. Importantly, none of the migrant teachers have taken any government grant/scholarship for pursuing their education in India or abroad.</p>
<p>A total of 20 teachers had a teaching experience in India before migrating, and 5 teachers were not teaching in India, they either migrated as students or as wives and joined teaching later. Further, 5 teachers had a teaching experience of 10 years and above before migrating, 5 had a teaching experience of 6 to 9 years, 4 had a teaching experience of 3 to 5 years, and 6 had a teaching experience of 1 to 2 years. This distribution indicates that 14 teachers had a teaching experience of at least 3 to 5 years before migrating. While the migrant teachers realised that such migration is a loss of experienced and qualified teachers to the sending country (India) but they were mainly influenced by their individual circumstances.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1028315311433206">
<title>Destination countries and causes of migration</title>
<p>There are 13 countries where the migrant teachers in the sample have taught during their life—India, Japan, Jamaica, Turks and Caicos Islands, Anguilla, Bahamas, Eritrea, North East Africa, and Maldives. Hence, the migrant teachers are found to have migrated to diverse destinations like North America, Africa, East Asia, South-East Asia, and the Gulf countries. However, majority of migrant teachers have not resorted to multiple migrations and most of them have limited to only one or two migrations.</p>
<p>The interplay of a range of complex factors shapes the migration decision making of teachers from India. When asked, almost all the teachers gave more than one reason behind their migration decision. The breakup is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1028315311433206">Figure 1</xref>. Clearly, professional development, better-living standard, family migration, and salary differentials were cited as one of the reasons for migration by maximum teachers. While some of them also mentioned social problems, corruption, and insecure jobs as the cause of their migration.</p>
<fig id="fig1-1028315311433206" position="float">

<p>Reasons for migration.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1028315311433206-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Further, in order to cross-check, eight broad causes of migration were given to the teachers to rank them as to how strongly they influenced their decision to migrate, as a result, the following order emerged: professional development, health and education, higher salary, better working conditions, family/friends abroad, opportunity for travel abroad, safer environment abroad, and unemployment in India. Hence, the predominance of better economic opportunities, professional development, and family issues projects them as the major causes of migration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1028315311433206">
<title>The process of migration and the modes of recruitment</title>
<p>A total of 14 teachers have migrated on work permit, 6 teachers migrated on spouse visa (all female teachers), 3 teachers migrated on family visa (all female teachers), and 2 teachers migrated initially on student visa. So, the largest category of migrant teachers migrated through a work permit confirming employment as the dominant motive. All the teachers who migrated on spouse visa were in Malaysia, and although they have migrated through family or spouse visa, some have obtained a work visa now.</p>
<p>Data highlight that the teachers were mainly recruited by the schools, recruitment agencies, and the local education authorities. However, four teachers have not been recruited to teach and they moved for other reasons like husband’s job, personal contact in the school, and two migrated as students. Only one teacher arrived in the destination country before 1991 while a majority of teachers migrated after liberalisation of the Indian economy in 1991. It shows that 11 teachers arrived in the destination country during 1991 to 2000, and 13 teachers arrived in their destination countries after 2000. Hence, this might be an indication that migration of teachers from India has increased after 1991 with a major impetus since 2000.</p>
<p>As teaching is a regulated sector in many countries, the migrant teachers had to meet the precondition of a qualifying examination imposed on the migrant teachers before starting teaching in the destination countries. A majority of 15 teachers (only 3 in United States) have not given any qualifying examination as a precondition to teaching in the destination country, and 10 teachers (all in United States) have given a qualifying examination before starting teaching abroad. So, it highlights that the precondition of a qualifying exam before teaching is strong in United States while it is not there in other countries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1028315311433206">
<title>Teaching salary differentials between India and the destination countries and economic condition of migrant teachers</title>
<p>The range of the net monthly salaries earned by migrant teachers in India (i.e., before migrating) was Rs. 300 to Rs. 25,000 averaging Rs. 8,752. In contrast, the range of starting monthly salary earned by migrant teachers in the destination countries was Rs. 13,750 to Rs. 200,000 averaging Rs. 65,805, which was 8 to 10 times higher than the range of salaries earned in India. Hence, such huge salary differentials provide a great incentive for migration. Also, there were significant differences among the salary for the United States and other Asian and Middle-East countries. While the range of starting net monthly salary earned by the migrant teachers in United States was Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 200,000, averaging Rs. 104,521, for other countries the range was Rs. 13,750 to Rs. 40,000 averaging Rs. 23,862. Hence, the joining salary of teachers migrating to United States is about five times more than the joining salary of teachers migrating to Asian and Middle-East countries.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1028315311433206">
<title>Experiences, future plans and feedback</title>
<p>A majority of the migrant teachers do not wish to return back to India in recent future, that is, after completion of their teaching contracts (20), only a few wish to return after completing their contracts (4), while 1 teacher said that she was indecisive. Moreover, 14 teachers do not want to stay abroad permanently, while 10 teachers want to stay abroad permanently. One teacher said that she is not sure about her decision. This highlights that although a majority of Indian migrant teachers do not plan to return to India after completion of their contracts, a majority of teachers do not want to stay permanently abroad, nevertheless a large proportion of migrant teachers want to stay abroad permanently. Almost half of the teachers want to return because of their family while others also want to return to their home country but only after settling their children abroad.</p>
<p>A total of 19 migrant teachers recommend teaching in the destination country for other teachers from India, and 6 teachers do not recommend it. Migrant teachers recommend teaching in the destination countries because of the opportunity of international exposure, professional development, and for better economic and living standards. Majority of the migrant teachers (16) view international migration as a big opportunity for self-development, 14 teachers state that international migration brings exposure to better technology and teaching methods of the other countries, and 12 teachers view it as leading to international development of teaching profession. 8 teachers said that it is mutually beneficial for both the destination and source country. 2 teachers said that there are better opportunities in India at present, while another 3 teachers said that international migration of teachers from India shall lead to a loss for the country but migrating to the destination country has been their individual decision. 6 teachers stated that there are discipline problems in the destination country schools. Hence, we note that a majority of teachers have positive views regarding international migration of teachers from India. Importantly, the survey contradicts the myth that Indian teachers are averse to challenges and unconcerned regarding professional development, as the teachers stated that they are greatly concerned and satisfied with their professional development and the challenges they face while teaching in the destination countries.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Migration of teachers from India is on a rise mainly due to shortage of teachers in the developed countries which are recruiting teachers to fill these gaps by recruiting teachers from developing countries. The resultant flow of human capital from the developing countries to the developed countries has been significant enough to affect the education systems of the former. Recruiting teachers by developed countries is a part of the immigration policy to attract knowledge workers from the other parts of the world in order to meet the skill shortages. The neoclassical economic theory of migration<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1028315311433206">8</xref></sup> states that international migration is related to the global supply and demand for labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1028315311433206">Massey et al., 1993</xref>, p. 233). Nations with limited labour supply and high demand will have high wages that pull immigrants in from nations with a surplus of labour. However, in the context of teacher migration from India, it is taking place even when there is shortage of teachers in both the destination and the source country. This can more appropriately be explained by the dynamics operating at the micro-individual level that has been captured by a very few studies, however, this has been captured to some extent in the neoclassical theories focusing on the individual’s decision to migrate in response to either wage or employment differentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1028315311433206">Harris &amp; Todaro, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1028315311433206">Lewis, 1954</xref>) or of an individual deciding to migrate on the basis of cost-benefit analysis of such movement in the expectation of income (economic) or other (noneconomic) maximisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1028315311433206">Sjaastad, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1028315311433206">Todaro, 1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1028315311433206">1989</xref>). India has increasingly participated in sending teachers for about two decades. However, since 2000, the volume has increased significantly. Although Indian academicians have often raised the issue of migration of highly skilled labour and its impact on India, teacher migration has not been studied adequately till now. This has happened because of two causes: First, the assumption of insignificant volume of teacher migration and second, due to the neglect of quality issue in the Indian education sector in general and neglect of the school teachers in particular.</p>
<p>The present article pinpoints the significance of teacher migration both globally and from India. Delineating the causes and impacts of the movement, via secondary data and a sample study, the article tries to establish human capital outflow from the education sector of India. Education acts as a double loss for the source countries, as through out-migration of teachers a country loses not only its human capital but also its future developmental base which it needs as a developing country. Teachers are an important component of migration outflows from India, and shortage of well-qualified teachers in the Indian education system makes them even more valuable. Indian teachers are migrating to various countries of the world, both developed and developing. Countries like the United States are preferred over others because of better economic and living opportunities. Further, opportunities for professional development, a big leap in career and access to international exposure also act as pull factors along with better standard of living, health, and education. Among the push factors, teacher migration has been triggered by low pay in India, lack of professional opportunities, and the social problems and corruption faced by migrant teachers in India. The respondent teachers have been receiving much higher salaries in the destination countries as compared to the Indian salary, which has been significant enough to attract nonteachers to migrate for teaching jobs. Hence, there is similarity of causes for the migration of teachers from India with the teachers migrating from other countries like South Africa. A majority of teachers are satisfied with their jobs and migration experience. Importantly, migrant teachers are experienced ones, as also observed in the case of migration of teachers from South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1028315311433206">Manik, 2007</xref>) and Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1028315311433206">Voigt-Graf, 2003</xref>). The migrant teachers did realise that such migration is a loss to the their country (India) which is losing experienced and qualified teachers, but the teachers were mainly influenced by their individual situations and experiences.</p>
<p>The article highlights the significance of high-skill teacher-migration flows from India to various countries. The study indicates permanent out-migration of experienced teachers from India in the basic disciplines of science and mathematics which might be a loss to India since it is already facing shortage of teachers that is acting as a major obstacle in achieving the educational goals. However, the present sample is very small to make any generalisations. The study indicates absence of research on teacher migration from India. Unfortunately, lack of adequate literature and data on the scale of international migration of teachers becomes one of the greatest obstacles for effective research and policy making. Hence, a challenging and important task remains to maintain a proper database and research framework for managing teacher migration to the best interests of the Indian migrants and the country, which shall help in understanding and working on the problems and issues of teacher migration.</p>

<p>Inevitably government officials, who tend to under- and devalue teachers on home turf and do precious little to improve their pay and service conditions, apart from the Sixth Pay Commission (which is also applicable to only central government employees) take a dim view of their heading for greener pastures.</p>

<p>The constitution of India provides for a quota system, whereby a percentage of posts are reserved in employment in Government and in the public sector units, and in all public and private educational institutions, except in the religious/linguistic minority educational institutions, for the socially backward communities—the Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Other Backward Castes (OBCs), who do not have adequate representation in these services and institutions. The proponents of the Constitution believed that the practice of the traditional caste system leads to severe oppression and segregation of the lower castes and limits their access to various freedoms, including education. The people who do not belong to any of these three categories form the general category and are not given any reservation benefits.</p>

<p>At the microlevel, neoclassical migration theory views migrants as individual, rational actors, who decide to move on the basis of a cost-benefit calculation. Assuming free choice and full access to information, they are expected to go where they can be the most productive, that is, are able to earn the highest wages. This capacity obviously depends on the specific skills a person possesses and the specific structure of labour markets. At the macrolevel, neoclassical economic theory explains migration by geographical differences in the supply and demand for labour. The resulting differentials in wages cause workers to move from low-wage, labour-surplus regions to high-wage, labour-scarce regions. Migration will cause labour to become less scarce at the destination and scarcer at the sending end.</p>
