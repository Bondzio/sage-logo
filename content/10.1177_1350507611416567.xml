<abstract>
<p>A long-standing debate in the negotiation field is whether negotiators can actually change their styles. In this article I offer two contributions to the literature and its pedagogy by suggesting that we shift the focus of the debate. Instead of considering negotiator styles as fixed predispositions, I propose that we view them as actions resulting from learning. From this perspective, the conflict-negotiation dynamic can be conceived as a critical learning process and negotiators as critical learners. We can then trace and incorporate the impact of negative emotions on learning and on the action it informs. I offer a system dynamic model to account for the cyclical links between actual conflicts, defensiveness, learning, and negotiators’ habitual responses to conflicts. Pedagogically, the model can be used descriptively to help negotiators understand such responses to actual conflicts, and prescriptively to garner their potential to change and transform. I share the experience of using the model in my classes and provide examples from helping negotiators unsettle their frames of reference and the assumptions they hold.</p>

<p>The negotiation literature is of two minds on whether negotiators can change their negotiation styles. An immediate consequence of this divide is the utility of including this important topic in the myriad of negotiation offerings that continue to surge in response to business demand for the skill. One camp uses results from literature reviews to suggest that negotiation styles and individual differences in general are basically fixed predispositions that do not impact negotiation outcomes appreciably (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350507611416567">Bazerman et al., 2000</xref>). The other group holds that even if these individual differences are difficult to change, negotiators and their managers can still benefit from knowing their styles (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350507611416567">Lewicki et al., 2010</xref>). I contend that the debate can be re-compassed if we consider the explicit role that critical learning can play in helping negotiators change the styles with which they face conflict.</p>
<p>Two particular characteristics of the current negotiation literature may have inadvertently kept the conversation within the conventional boundaries of what it means to learn negotiation skills. First, most negotiation frameworks have emerged from laboratory responses to cold, simulated conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350507611416567">Barry, 2007</xref>), which tend to attenuate the external validity of negotiators’ learning in the actual, messy, and hot conflicts. Second, the pedagogical translation of most negotiation frameworks into academic and training offerings has relied heavily on experiential activities such as cases, simulations, role plays, and so forth. Because these experiential, outside-in types of teaching tools focus mainly on categorizing, acquiring, and transferring knowledge (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350507611416567">Loewenstein et al., 2003</xref>), little attention is directed toward helping negotiators question and unsettle the assumptions they hold about their own negotiating styles. Challenging one’s own experiences and viewing them critically, becoming a self-conscientious and self-questioning learner, and being suspicious of one’s taken-for-granted assumptions all fall within the domain of critical learning (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507611416567">Cunliffe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1350507611416567">Reynolds, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1350507611416567">Reynolds and Vince, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1350507611416567">Vince, 1998</xref>), which is rarely incorporated into the negotiation literature and is the focus of this article.</p>
<p>Actually, my students and I had adopted and benefited from conventional negotiation frameworks in good currency and relied solely on their traditional experiential activities for about a decade—with traditional proxies of success measured in course demand, quantitative scores, etc. Then, I began to face unintended consequences. The off-the-shelf experiential activities I used to help learners acquire and transfer negotiation knowledge did not represent with fidelity negotiators’ actual struggles with the emotionally charged conflicts in their professional and personal lives. Consequently, there was no pressing need among students who practiced with experiential tools to question their allegedly fixed negotiation styles. Lewicki’s experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1350507611416567">1997</xref>: 265, emphasis added) was not uncommon:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In short, my own experience indicates that much negotiation training is cosmetic and superficial particularly if we really hope to develop strong <italic>skill acquisition and transfer</italic> to new problems. It is remarkable that neither corporations nor our students have demanded greater accountability from us for their level of skill development, given the total dollars invested in this industry.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I stress the goal of strong negotiation training in the above quotation because my own experience suggests that it is mainly <italic>because</italic> we only aim for students to acquire and (somehow hope that they can) transfer knowledge that the outcome is often superficial and cosmetic.</p>
<p>If transferring negotiation knowledge also means increasing the capacity to <italic>act</italic> upon it outside classrooms—the ultimate goal of negotiation training—then we should also heed the requirements to make negotiation knowledge actionable. In order for our academic advice to ‘stick’ and be actionable in real conflict situations, negotiators must be trained to detect and correct the negative impact of their defensiveness on learning and the actions they produce in actual, messy conflicts. Moreover, for the detecting and correcting to be long lasting, they must be performed within a broader framework that compels negotiators to be vigilant about continuously questioning whatever it is that gets them stuck into their habitual responses to conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611416567">Argyris, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350507611416567">2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet, learning to question critically and deeply is lost in the translation of most conceptual negotiation perspectives into experiential pedagogy, as well as in the transfer from the classroom to personal and professional conflicts. In fact, in my own experience, the seductive success of depending solely on conventional negotiation frameworks and experiential tools was so powerful that I did not even notice for years the gap between the action learning philosophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611416567">Argyris, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350507611416567">2000</xref>) I was successfully implementing in the design and management of the organizational behavior course and my experiential practice in the negotiation course—usually delivered in the same classroom.</p>
<p>My overall purpose in this article is to make two contributions to the negotiation literature and its pedagogy by focusing on critical learning as a significant variable in the conflict-negotiation dynamic. The first contribution aims at introducing a new model that accounts explicitly for the role of learning when addressing real conflicts charged with emotions. A nested set of assumptions informed my thoughts about this issue: negotiation skills are considered useful when they help managers address real conflicts; real conflicts are charged with emotions; emotions affect learning; learning informs actions; actions are what negotiators do when they put their habitual, taken-for-granted negotiation styles into effect; to the extent that learning is malleable, negotiator styles can be alterable; because negotiator styles trigger habitual responses to conflicts, we need to seek a deeper, critically reflective type of learning to override these automatic, taken-for-granted, habitual responses; if critical learning can do the overriding and transform negotiators, then we have created opportunities to solve ourselves while struggling to solve our problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350507611416567">Kegan and Lahey, 2001</xref>); if our negotiation offerings can make these opportunities available to negotiators, then we would have transcended the traditional focus of the mutual gain approach on fair expansion and distribution of the proverbial pie, into helping negotiators transform themselves in the process of negotiating. A conflict faced this way would be an enriching opportunity.</p>
<p>My second contribution is to add value to the negotiation pedagogy by describing how to implement the above model as a systemic, critical learning tool. I aim to show how the model can be used descriptively to help negotiators take a deeper look at their current tendencies, and prescriptively to facilitate discovery of their potential change and transformation. In addition, I will show that using a critical learning lens in the teaching and training of negotiation can help enrich the curriculum by detecting and using classroom conflicts as crucial data that would have otherwise been discarded as undiscussible, irrelevant, or even unexplained variance.</p>
<p>The above thinking process placed my efforts at the intersection of negotiator styles and actions, emotions, and learning. Argyris’ learning theory and action-oriented strategies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611416567">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350507611416567">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507611416567">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350507611416567">2010</xref>) address the relationships among these constructs within descriptive and prescriptive frameworks. Applied to negotiation, Argyris’ perspective would recognize that negotiators’ defensiveness—an important emotion associated with real, messy conflicts—would attenuate their capacity to learn and reason productively. The attenuated learning would then limit the action choices available to negotiators, leading them to use more protective, habitual strategies consistent with their taken-for-granted negotiation styles.</p>
<p>Focusing on Argyris’ learning and action strategies was useful for my journey during the last several years when I started to depart from the sole reliance on the experiential approach in teaching negotiation. Therefore, I shall concentrate here on Argyris’ perspective to be faithful to my own story and actual experiences in understanding negotiators’ defensiveness, learning, and actions. However, I shall also discuss other perspectives of critical and transformative learning when appropriate to illustrate their usefulness and relevance for my work and for future studies.</p>
<p>The balance of the article consists of four main sections. In the first section I discuss relevant literature on negotiator styles and emotions as they relate to negotiation learning. In the second I introduce a conceptual model to account for the role of learning and defensiveness as a predominant emotion in the conflict-negotiation dynamic. In the third section I discuss transformative learning as it pertains to the present work, in order to set the stage for the fourth section where I describe and give examples of how the focus on critical learning and the model have been implemented in the negotiation class. I end with validity checks, limitations, and concluding remarks.</p>

<title>Styles and emotions in negotiation</title>
<sec id="section2-1350507611416567">
<title>Negotiator styles</title>
<p>The literature suggests five modal negotiation styles: avoiding, accommodating/yielding, compromising, competing, and collaborative/problem solving—and the topic is a common ingredient in many negotiation texts (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350507611416567">Lewicki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1350507611416567">Shell, 2006</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1350507611416567">Thompson, 2009</xref>, for variations on these styles). Yet, the styles are also considered, along with individual differences in general, ‘the long standing mystery in the field of negotiation’ (Elfenbien et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350507611416567">2008</xref>: 1463) with different views surrounding their impact on negotiation outcomes—and, consequently, on their utility for negotiation courses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350507611416567">Bazerman et al. (2000)</xref> suggest that we teach around these difficult-to-change native dispositions of the negotiator, concluding in a review of the literature that ‘individual differences are of limited use because they are not under the negotiator’s control’ (p. 281). On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1350507611416567">Shell (2001</xref>: 157, emphasis added) uses negotiator styles in a flagship academic negotiation program, but only instrumentally within a conventional learning framework:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In my experience, there is a remarkable stability to the predispositions people report as the foundation for their styles—and associated stability to the <italic>struggles</italic> people report overcoming these predispositions to improve their practices. Occasionally, someone’s style changes dramatically in the wake of negotiation training but I count these occasions as the rare exceptions rather than the rule. For the rest, negotiation training is a source of information rather than transformation. People become better able to understand, explain, and adapt their behavior rather than change their predispositions.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I emphasize the struggle among Shell’s students because it seems to represent ‘unwanted variance’, something to avoid and, if possible, shield clients and the class from its burden. In my experience, this struggle can be a source of a richer type of productive reasoning and learning should we venture outside the boundaries of conventional meanings of learning (i.e. acquiring and transferring knowledge) and into critical learning territories. For example, Palmer (1979: 171, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1350507611416567">Vince, 1998</xref>) conceives of learning as ‘discovering a capacity to doubt the validity of perceptions which seem unquestionably true’, which is consistent with other critical learning perspectives (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611416567">Argyris, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350507611416567">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350507611416567">Cunliffe, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507611416567">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350507611416567">Gray, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1350507611416567">Vince, 1998</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1350507611416567">Shell (2006)</xref> expands the same instrumental perspective to his negotiation text, suggesting four key habits for effective negotiators: willingness to prepare, high expectations, patience to listen, and commitment to integrity. Necessary as these qualities are, they are only instrumental and deal with the negotiator ‘as is’, thus overlooking her/his potential to transform in the process of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350507611416567">Dehler, 2009</xref>). Judging from my own experience and from examining negotiation syllabi, popular texts, and pedagogical articles (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350507611416567">Fortgang, 2000</xref>), Shell’s perspective is quite common and the exceptions are quite rare (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350507611416567">Cobb, 2000</xref>). Most teachers use external instruments within a conventional experiential approach to categorize negotiator styles then brief students and compare results to population normative percentiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1350507611416567">Shell, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the early developer of the five predominant negotiator styles saw them more flexibly as ‘taxonomy of intentions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350507611416567">Thomas, 1992</xref>: 271), which is consistent with later research on personality and psychological traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350507611416567">Church, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1350507611416567">McCrae, 2000</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1350507611416567">McCrae (2000)</xref> distinguishes ‘basic tendencies’ in people’s personality systems from ‘characteristic adaptations’ with which they develop shared meanings of roles, habits, and skills, thus enabling them to ‘act and react on the basis of their immediate circumstances and repertoire of responses they have acquired’ (p. 15). If so, then the critical lens through which negotiation is conceived, taught, and practiced can contribute significantly toward reshaping negotiators’ sense making and enlisting their responsibility for change.</p>

<sec id="section3-1350507611416567">
<title>Emotions</title>
<p>Enriching negotiation learning with negotiators’ real conflicts can expose the learner to layers of here and now struggles-in-action. Consider for example the excerpts below from the experience of an MBA student in his mid-thirties who was an executive in a global brokerage firm—named Jack here.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I lash out at the other person and before I know it I am either in a screaming match or my counterpart has completely given up on the negotiation. For example, last week I had to cancel plans with my wife because I forgot that I had already made plans to attend the bachelor party of my friend. When I broke the news to my wife, she was understandably angry and upset with me. She told me that I was choosing my friends over her. This made me very angry and I sternly stated, ‘That is ridiculous for you to say that! You do not know what you are talking about. That is completely false. You are overreacting. The fact is, I am going so you sitting here arguing with me about it is only making it worse. Get over it already’. Not surprisingly, my wife became even more upset and all communications ceased.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To offer credible advice in such a situation, the learning has to account for the emotions underlying Jack’s reactions to his wife. Yet, with estimates of over 150 separate theories of emotions floating around (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350507611416567">Barry, 2007</xref>), bringing emotion into the negotiation domain has not been a simple exercise. Emotion in general ‘has proven famously difficult to pin down’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350507611416567">Gross and Thompson, 2007</xref>: 4), and its specific role in negotiation remains ‘an elusive one’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350507611416567">Barry 2007</xref>: 104). Nonetheless, certain advancements in the emotion literature are relevant to the present work. First, emotions make us feel something, and feel like doing something (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350507611416567">Frijda, 1988</xref>). Second, in our attempt to do something, we respond to many emotions with automaticity that is ‘evidenced by the speed and fluidity with which we produce our behavior’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350507611416567">Kirsch and Lynn, 1999</xref>). Third, although emotion is triggered automatically, conditions exist under which it can be regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350507611416567">Bargh et al., 1996</xref>). Finally, there is a true need to study actual conflicts in order to be able to observe and examine the real emotions they trigger. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350507611416567">Barry (2007</xref>: 103) reviews the literature on the role of affect in negotiation and expresses hope that ‘the study of affect in negotiation will ultimately compel researchers to leave the comfortable confine of the laboratory in favor of observational and ethnographic studies of “live” negotiation encounters’, and further suggests that affect has ‘relevance for more than just offers, concessions and deal making; it also plays potentially into understanding of personality … (and) learning, … to name a few’.</p>
<p>Against this background, specific findings are pertinent to my current focus on emotion and learning in the conflict-negotiation context. First, conflicts tend to be emotionally charged and laden with hot feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350507611416567">Janis, 1982</xref>). Second, negative emotions influence the initial stages of conflict by agitating the negotiator through feelings of anxiety, fear, and threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350507611416567">Higgins, 1987</xref>), resulting in defensiveness, which is largely triggered unconsciously and automatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350507611416567">Cramer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350507611416567">Gross and Thompson, 2007</xref>). Third, emotional processes include a self-feeding dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350507611416567">Gross and Thompson, 2007</xref>), which further exacerbates conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350507611416567">Friedman et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The above findings were consistent with my redesign of the negotiation course to include students’ real conflicts, which allowed for a realistic examination of the impact of defensiveness on learning. As it turned out, most of the actual conflicts students used in their course work had been escalating for quite some time, implying the work of a reinforcing process in the background. Consequently, students and I began to explore the complex dynamic responsible for the escalation of their conflicts over time. These efforts led to the iterative development and implementation of the model I discuss below.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1350507611416567">
<title>The model</title>
<p>The present model has descriptive and prescriptive functions. Usually, the descriptive purpose evolves gradually and interactively during the academic term. I discuss this aspect of the model in this section. Later on in the term, students use the same model but prescriptively via individual and organizational interventions aimed at cultivating critical and transformative learning in the negotiation class. I discuss these interventions later in the article.</p>
<p>The Conflict Cycle model (CC) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350507611416567">Figure 1</xref> is a proposition to account for negotiators’ learning when faced with ongoing, difficult, and emotionally charged conflicts. While students learn later that the premise of the model is also its promise—if it has been learned, it can be unlearned—I resist linking any prescriptive interventions facilitated during the academic term to the descriptive model while it is being developed in order to encourage students to think of this potential on their own.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1350507611416567-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1350507611416567">Senge et al. (1994)</xref>, I constructed the CC as a system thinking process with four key constructs that represent ‘the factors vital for understanding the problem’ (p. 178). The four constructs are linked to one another via arrows with polarity signs at the head of each. A plus (+) indicates that the two variables at the base and head of the arrow change in the same direction, and a minus (-) means they change in opposite directions. Because each link suggests a conceptual, temporal directionality between two variables, links can represent the automatic triggers and habitual responses involved in the conflict-negotiation dynamic. A complete cycle represents a <italic>r</italic>einforcing loop (R) when it contains all positive polarities (pluses) or an even number of negative polarities (minuses). The arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350507611416567">Figure 1</xref> are all linked with plus signs, and the three dynamics in the figure (R1 and R2 which are embedded within the larger dynamic, R3) all represent reinforcing loops.</p>
<p>I introduce the model with a few caveats. First, although the loop in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350507611416567">Figure 1</xref> can accommodate many more detailed variables and links, an important modeling challenge is to balance model parsimony with its validity. Second, the proposed model is just that, a proposition; thus, it can be used as a starting point to surface mental models and hidden assumptions about the variables included (or excluded) and about the suggested links and their polarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1350507611416567">Senge et al., 1994</xref>). Accordingly, a measure of modesty should be assumed when using system thinking configurations: ‘(S)ystem thinking requires understanding that all models are wrong (which brings) humility about the limitations of our knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611416567">Sterman, 2002</xref>: 521). These caveats signal from the outset that questioning is imperative for both model validation and class interactions.</p>
<p>The CC proposes that difficult conflicts and defensiveness go hand in hand, and reciprocally reinforce one another (R1). Thus, the more intense and difficult the conflict, the higher the defensiveness it triggers; reciprocally, the more one party is on the defensive, the more likely s/he would perceive that an intense conflict exists. The reciprocal link between conflict and defensiveness is corroborated by the literature and supported in practice. For example, conflict is typically viewed as a perceptual process involving opposition and disturbance to some existing interest. Attempts to restore or improve the status quo could be accompanied by negative emotions such as dejection resulting from disliking the other party, the process itself, or the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350507611416567">Lewicki et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350507611416567">Higgins (1987)</xref> suggests that conflicts agitate people by evoking feelings of anxiety, fear, and being threatened, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507611416567">Argyris (1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611416567">1993</xref>) includes these triggers in his conception of individual defensiveness as a psychological mechanism with which we shield ourselves from potential fears, threats, and embarrassment. Defensiveness, in turn, causes the conflicting parties to tighten up and approach the variance between them as a contest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350507611416567">Kets de Vries, 2004</xref>). Research on the automaticity of emotions also shows that sources of danger are automatically categorized as bad, and just as automatically trigger defensiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350507611416567">Cramer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611416567">Feldman et al., 2007</xref>). Even folk parables recognize this reciprocal pattern: A man was driving up a narrow, winding path of a rugged mountain. As he was struggling to negotiate a tight corner on the outer side near a deep cliff, a jeep suddenly appeared from the opposite direction, speedily passing through the tight corner. With a horrified face, the female driver in the jeep shouted at him as she too struggled to control her car: ‘Pig’. Incensed by the woman’s audacity and frightened by the near miss, the man retaliated with an uproar that vibrated down the deep cliff: ‘Bitch’, then turned the corner and hit a pig. In the present model, conflict and defensiveness maintain such a reciprocal, reinforcing dynamic.</p>
<p>For later interventions using the CC, it is worth noting now that while defensiveness is triggered automatically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350507611416567">Bargh et al. (1996</xref>: 241, emphases mine) specify three conditions under which conscious intention can control or override the emotion: ‘(a) <italic>awareness</italic> of the influence or at least the possibility of an influence, (b) <italic>motivation</italic> to exert the control, and (c) enough <italic>attentional capacity</italic> (or lack of distraction) at the time to engage the control process’. These conditions, particularly lack of distraction, are unlikely to be met when negotiators react to heated conflicts that are difficult to handle.</p>
<p>The CC then provides an explicit account of defensiveness and learning. I suggest exploring this relationship from the lens of Argyris’ learning theory. By examining over 10,000 cases in his career, Argyris (c.f. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350507611416567">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507611416567">1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611416567">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350507611416567">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507611416567">2004</xref>) suggests that we distinguish two types of learning. Single loop learning (SLL, the focus of the present descriptive function of the model) describes the non-reflective, non-critical type of learning that people <italic>tend to adopt</italic> when dealing with difficult situations such as emotionally charged conflicts. Double loop learning (DLL, to be addressed later) connotes the type of learning that people <italic>can be trained to adopt</italic> in order to reason productively, question their assumptions, and delve deeper into the master plans and root causes of their difficulties. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350507611416567">Figure 1</xref> suggests that defensiveness and the non-reflective, non-critical SLL go hand in hand.</p>
<p>SLL is non-reflective and non-critical because it ‘does not solve the more basic problem of <italic>why</italic> these problems existed in the first place’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507611416567">Argyris, 1990</xref>: 92). When people ‘deal with issues that are embarrassing or threatening, their reasoning and action conform to a type of theory-in-use I call Model I’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507611416567">Argyris, 2004</xref>: 62), which they implement to protect and defend themselves against fundamental, disruptive change; ‘almost uniformly, we deal with difficult situations by <italic>not</italic> dealing with them. We find ways to pretend to engage and in fact manage to avoid engaging and keep what we are doing hidden from ourselves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350507611416567">Argyris, 2010</xref>: 22, emphasis in original). Thus, when negotiators are on the defensive due to the threats and potential embarrassments triggered by difficult conflicts, they are likely to rely, with speed and automaticity, on the non-reflective, non-critical single loop learning pattern.</p>
<p>The SLL pattern is often characterized by learners saying one thing and doing another, denying or becoming unaware of the gap, making the denial undiscussible, then making the undiscussibility of the denial itself undiscussible and closing the matter to themselves and others, thus whirling into a self-sealing, anti-learning loop. This loop explains the axiom that people who are on the defensive tend to learn very little, if at all; they are usually busy shielding themselves from potential threats and embarrassment. In fact, data collected under defensive conditions (about the self, the conflict, and the negotiating party) are usually marred with bias and are typically used to build counterattacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350507611416567">Malhorta and Murnighan, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350507611416567">Figure 1</xref> also suggests that defensiveness and the non-reflective, non-critical SLL create a reciprocally reinforcing dynamic, R2. The unconscious and automatic defensiveness triggers the automatic and taken-for-granted master plan of Model I action strategies, which ‘tells individuals to craft their positions, evaluations, and attributions in ways that inhibit inquiry into them and tests of them with others’ logic. The consequences of these Model I strategies are likely to be defensiveness, misunderstanding, and self-fulfilling and self-sealing processes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611416567">Argyris, 1993</xref>: 52). It is worth mentioning here that SLL can be appropriate in some conflict situations, for example in simple or routine contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611416567">Argyris, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507611416567">2004</xref>). However, the CC is concerned with ongoing, emotionally charged conflicts that are difficult for the negotiator to handle.</p>
<p>Next, the CC suggests that non-reflective, non-critical SLL would trigger negotiators to summon their habitual responses to conflicts (even if these responses are not the most effective to deal with the conflict in the long run). I discuss this link with students in terms of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611416567">Argyris (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350507611416567">2010</xref>) calls ‘skilled incompetence’ (excelling in doing well what is essentially not good for us) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1350507611416567">Vince (1998)</xref> labels ‘willing ignorance’ (surrendering to habitual responses in the face of anxiety and defensiveness instead of proactively holding and staring at them with a view to change). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507611416567">Argyris (2004</xref>: 11) suggests that ‘Model I produces actions that are skillful yet incompetent because they produce consequences that the actors do not intend. The actors are unaware of their skillful incompetence while producing it’, and they do it with speed and automaticity because:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the very action required to be skillful produces unawareness. Once human beings become skilled they forget much of what they went through to become skillful. Skillful actions are those that work, that appear effortless, that are automatic, and usually tacit, and that are taken for granted.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Accordingly, SLL and its anti-learning patterns are likely to trigger negotiators to summon their respective habitual conflict-handling strategies—for example, fleeing the conflict for an avoider, giving up the store for a yielder, competing viciously for a win-lose negotiator. Alternatively, when low defensiveness reduces the chances for adopting non-reflective SLL, a negotiator may find it possible to shift slightly, temporarily, and only instrumentally from one habitual negotiation style to another (e.g. an avoider trying the yielding style), but the move will not be of the type that requires questioning rooted assumptions, frames of reference, and governing values that inform actions. Finally, it is worth noting that while conditions exist where any of these habitual styles may be appropriate to handle the conflict at hand (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350507611416567">Lewicki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1350507611416567">Shell, 2006</xref>), the emphasis here is on habitual responses versus thoughtful and critical reflection on the conflict at hand.</p>
<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350507611416567">Figure 1</xref> culminates in the ultimate impact of negotiator’s habitual responses on the initial conflict: they fuel more conflicts in the long run. The escalation of the original conflict may be explicit (as when relationships between the parties are tarnished) or inconspicuous (as when the symptoms of the conflict seem to disappear while its root causes continue to ferment beneath the surface).</p>
<p>I introduce the entire CC model to students around mid-semester, after discussing conventional negotiation concepts and related theories and after using traditional experiential tools to understand them. Once the CC is understood, students begin to apply it to their own actual conflicts as one of the means to facilitate transformational learning in the course. I discuss transformative learning below then provide actual examples of these interventions in the following section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1350507611416567">
<title>Transformative learning</title>
<p>Once we establish learning as a crucial variable in the conflict-negotiation equation, we can begin to benefit from the malleability of learning and the personal transformations it can yield (compared with the conceived rigidity of negotiator styles). I have used Argyris’ DLL and Model II strategies to help shift students’ learning paradigms in negotiation contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507611416567">Argyris, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611416567">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350507611416567">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507611416567">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350507611416567">2010</xref>), and have found the perspective consistent with many approaches to critical and transformational learning (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350507611416567">Cunliffe, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507611416567">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350507611416567">Kegan and Leahy, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350507611416567">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350507611416567">Kets de Vries and Korotov, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350507611416567">Mezirow, 1997</xref>). All these approaches emphasize the importance of questioning assumptions, discussing the undiscussibles, and changing frames of reference.</p>
<p>For example, productive learners in Argyris’ theory (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350507611416567">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507611416567">2004</xref>) would espouse Model II values <italic>and</italic> craft their action to be consistent with those values:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In Model II environment, the action theory-in-use helps—indeed, requires—mistaken assumptions to be reformulated, incongruities reconciled, incompatibilities resolved, vagueness specified, untestable notions made testable, scattered information brought together into meaningful patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350507611416567">Argyris, 2000</xref>: 72).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350507611416567">Mezirow and Associates (2000</xref>: 7–8) point out that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Transformative learning refers to the process by which we transform our taken-for-granted frames of reference … to make them more inclusive, discriminating, open, emotionally capable of change, and reflective so that they may generate beliefs and opinions that will prove more true or justified to guide action.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350507611416567">Mezirow (1997</xref>: 5) defines frames of reference as:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[T]he structure of assumptions through which we understand our experience … They set out our line of action … once set, we automatically move from one specific activity (mental or behavioral) to another [as] we have strong tendency to reject ideas that fail to fit our preconception, labeling those ideas as unworthy of our consideration—aberrations, nonsense, irrelevant, weird, or mistaken.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The above approaches are also consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350507611416567">Cunliffe’s (2002)</xref> use of reflexivity to help learners expose ‘contradictions, doubts, dilemmas, and possibilities’ (p. 38), as well as her utilization of the inside-out approach to explore how their ‘own involvement, assumptions and dialogue … might have impacted the process of constructing reality’ (p. 52). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507611416567">Cunliffe (2009)</xref> pursues the questioning and unsettling theme further by distinguishing self-reflexivity from critical reflexivity. Self-reflexivity involves dialogues with ourselves in which we question our core beliefs, fundamental assumptions, and values—as in the dialogue with self that students conduct while they implement the CC model. Critical reflexivity is concerned with ‘unsettling the assumptions underlying textual, theoretical, and ideological positions as a basis for thinking more critically about social and organizational policies and practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507611416567">Cunliffe, 2009</xref>: 93)—as in rethinking the basis of classroom norms when incorporating a critical learning philosophy into negotiation teaching.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350507611416567">Kets de Vries and Korotov (2007)</xref> propose a transformational program in which both cognition and emotions are seen as mutually contributing to trapping people into their own psychic prisons of habitual behaviors, thus explaining negotiators’ feeling of being ‘stuck’ in negotiation styles that appear ingrained and fixed. The authors further conceive of undiscussibility as the hallmark of conflict because a negotiator’s unacceptable feelings rarely reach consciousness, leading to failure to use available opportunities— e.g., a wider range of negotiation strategies in the present context. Prescriptively, the authors suggest helping learners to question patterns of behavior that they appear to avoid or ignore, and providing them with the skill to clarify cause and effect relationships. This dynamic reflective process sets the stage for a much richer framework for making sense of negotiators’ challenges, which ultimately provides greater insights regarding their individual conflicts. It is instructive to note the consistency of this approach with Argyris’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611416567">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507611416567">2004</xref>) perspective, Cunliffe’s (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507611416567">2009</xref>) ‘complexifying’ concept emphasized through practice of reflexivity, and the CC dynamic introduced here.</p>
<p>In sum, a negotiation course purporting to utilize the malleability of learning and avail critical and transformative learning to students should aim to help them—and their teacher—achieve a paradigm shift. I am not suggesting we eliminate conventional experiential practices (e.g. categorizing negotiator styles, role plays); they are useful and I use them regularly. Rather, I propose that we use them within a different learning philosophy in which negotiators feel they own, instead of being owned by, their conflicts. Within this questioning perspective, negotiators would realize the real, complex structure of their conflicts; tap their own emotions and defensiveness; be vigilant in detecting and correcting their frames of reference and governing values; possess new skills, wherewithal, and temperament to trace the history of their conflicts; stare at their habitual responses and the anxiety they create; learn to delve deeper into the root cause-effect dynamic of their conflicts; and foster an honest sense of the options available to them once they choose to be accountable for their own conflicts as subjects, not just objects in the narratives of their own stories. The negotiation course was designed and the class was managed with these transformational potentials in mind.</p>

<title>Cultivating critical and transformational learning in negotiation</title>
<p>With critical and transformational learning in mind, I invite students at the beginning of the course to commit to a different type of learning where we are expected to challenge all concepts and theories while addressing actual conflicts—and I stress that ‘actual’ applies to their own personal and professional conflicts as well as to any conflict that may arise in class throughout the term—and they do. We revisit this commitment again about mid-term, right after I introduce the CC with a prescriptive goal: to affirm the usefulness of action-oriented perspectives in addressing actual conflicts and in the process, breaking away from the gripping hold of the descriptive CC model. We do this by detecting defensiveness (theirs and mine in class) and by struggling to replace anti-learning with pro-learning patterns while we experience the course. I illustrate below some of these interventions and the implementation of the CC model, linking them to critical learning and its transformational potential when appropriate.</p>

<title>Class conflicts, Model II, and critical reflexivity</title>
<p>One time I inquired at the top of an Executive MBA class about an assigned reading. The few minutes that followed went something like this: A retired surgeon seeking a career change sitting to my left expressed his opinion by slamming the article on his desk while uttering his disappointment loudly:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I hated it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the middle of my attempt to get him to say more, he continued in the same pitch:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Do we have to like every reading assigned in this class? Or, maybe we have to admire everything written by anyone at the prestigious Harvard.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A few moments passed before a lawyer sitting a few rows back center responded in a more controlled manner:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Actually … hmm. I liked the article … a lot. The author put his finger exactly on what I personally feel and what I see in my law firm. I even shared the article with a few colleagues and my boss.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The surgeon took his gaze off me and turned to the lawyer, continuing his tone:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>What did you like about it, or is it just kissing up to the professor?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The exchange between the two continued for a few moments, while I deliberately withdrew from center stage. No other student interfered during the few minutes of this unscripted conflict. This signaled a class norm that needed to be disturbed and unsettled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507611416567">Cunliffe, 2009</xref>). When the surgeon and lawyer had finished their exchange, I let silence in the class brew for a few more moments before slowly stepping back into view. I asked if there were other comments, and heard none. I inquired if the class was ready to move on, and the speedy answers came in sighs of relief, murmured yeses, collective nodding, and immediate shuffling of papers preparing for the next item. After the class confirmed its theory-in-use to move on, I paused for a moment then mentioned that we better resurface the critical incident we had just buried for re-examination. We dissected the class conflict using the constructs of the course, including a discussion about the paradoxical responsibility of the class for saving its own collective face by witnessing a conflict and, without hesitation, bypassing it; for opting to not discuss the conflict then also collectively colluding in not discussing the undiscussibility of the cover-up that just took place; and consequently, for committing the very doom loop mentioned in the article that caused the conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350507611416567">Argyris, 1991</xref>). All of these actions were committed by the class in only a few minutes, under the pretense of continuing with the next item on the ‘learning’ agenda, which was, ironically, an off-the-shelf experiential simulation of a much cooler conflict. What began as an observation of one aggressive student creating and handling a conflict competitively, ended up as a thickly layered actual conflict with defensiveness, interrupted learning, unsettling class norms, face saving, and undiscussibility—the works. These layers of learning would have been missed had we been content with using traditional negotiation style instruments to categorize some students as competitive negotiators and others as avoiders.</p>

<sec id="section8-1350507611416567">
<title>The CC as transformational pedagogy</title>
<p>Right after the CC is introduced by the second half of the term, students begin to use the model to delve deeper into their own actual conflicts. The purpose of this assignment is to <italic>act</italic>ually and systemically begin to slow down and interrupt the automatic processes described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350507611416567">Figure 1</xref>. The awareness, motivation, and attentional capacity that students devote to the details of their respective conflicts help them meet the conditions that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350507611416567">Bargh et al. (1996)</xref> require to regulate automatic emotions. Using the CC in this process enables negotiators to examine the frames of reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350507611416567">Mezirow and Associates, 2000</xref>) that inform their theories-in-use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507611416567">Argyris, 2004</xref>), thus initiating an inside-out journey of reflexivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507611416567">Cunliffe, 2009</xref>). Further, the CC helps students recognize that the cognitive and emotional aspects of their conflicts intertwine to grip and cage their habitual behavior into what they may consider fixed negotiation styles. Below are excerpts from a journey with the CC as undertaken by a graduate student I will call Sandra.</p>
<p>Sandra (S) left a good job at one of the Top Five accounting firms to serve as the Controller for a client firm because she got along with the female CFO in the new firm. S had described the nature of her conflict early in the semester in a little over two pages, not knowing where the course would go with the assignment. (I overlook the nature and content of S’s conflict in this discussion to focus on the process of the method.) Shortly after, S and other students were asked to comb their stories in search of any emotions the conflicts might have triggered. For this phase, S included expressions such as ‘I was frustrated’, ‘She pretty much threw me under the bus’, ‘I was absolutely furious’, and ‘I was livid’. Next, students were asked to develop diagrams to plot the evolution of their conflicts over time. By then, S would have begun to recognize that she was dissecting a conflict that she had taken for granted throughout the time specified in the diagram; the process signals the start of her slowing-down journey toward deeper awareness and higher attentional capacity. The next step gets students to provide informal reflections on their own hot buttons, triggers, and manifestations of what they consider their defensiveness, then juxtapose them with their respective conflicts. Some of S’s triggers of defensiveness included threats and embarrassments such as ‘feeling inadequate and feeling betrayed’, and her manifestations of defensiveness included, ‘shutting-down, possibly giving-in, being hurt, feeling angry, and becoming resentful’. In S’s particular case, she went beyond what is required in this course assignment and added a third column to the Triggers and Manifestation matrix, calling it ‘Results’, which included her tendency to ‘move on but not forget, vent to others, and reduce loyalty’. Instructively, one of these results was precisely what her boss had inflicted upon her and gave rise to this conflict (venting to others about S). S summarized this portion of the assignment by stating: ‘I now realize that this conflict touched my hot buttons of fear of failure, dependency on someone else, intimidation, intolerance of others, and betrayal’ then proceeded to elaborate on each—way beyond what was required for this assignment.</p>
<p>Later in the course, I introduce the CC formally and ask each student to fully juxtapose their own conflict to the model. The juxtaposition is provided in the form of responding to pertinent questions about each construct of the cycle (e.g. conflict, defensiveness) with examples from their own real conflicts that either validate or refute the dynamics proposed in the CC. Then students import their examples into a reproduction of the CC diagram, expanded with bubbles to include bullets for each CC construct. For example, S noted that: ‘unfinished or substandard projects and feeling inadequate threatens (her) and causes (her) defensiveness’. S mentioned in the learning bubble that her defensiveness caused her to be closed and conclusive as she ‘gave up and lost interest’, and in an answer to whether she resists or welcomes healthy expressions of vulnerability, she noted: ‘I didn’t want to get blamed for not completing the manual, but I hadn’t finished it’, which she had denied in front of her boss in the actual conflict. In response to whether she had maintained distance from her conflicting party (her boss) or made efforts to be close, she stated that she ‘avoided interaction except when necessary’, which led to an avoiding of the conflict altogether. To complete the CC loop, S pointed out the impact of her habitual (avoiding) style on escalating the dynamic of her conflict over time:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The Avoiding style that I adopted led to anger and frustration—which then escalated the conflict and further put me far away from collaboration. Anger and frustration then brought resentment, and the conflict continued to increase.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The inside-out learning resulting from this approach has been quite instructive and transformative, particularly in beginning to question and unsettle assumptions that underlie and inform students’ frames of reference. In the next assignment, S continues to unfold her journey in that direction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1350507611416567">
<title>Letter to Self</title>
<p>At the end of the course, each student writes a ‘Letter to Self’ as a mountain top view of his/her own learning journey. At the end of the letter, students are encouraged to reflect on assumptions they have held about conflict and negotiation, and whether they are ready and willing to question these assumptions in pursuit of possible change. Many of these reflections surface deeply held personal values and beliefs about the conflict, themselves, and others.</p>
<p>Sandra began her Letter to Self with:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>While you pride yourself on being kind and fair, these traits in the extreme are setting you up to avoid or compromise in most conflict situations. In your quest for harmony, you let others take advantage of you, and don’t work towards the best solution for both parties. You might say that the issues are trivial, but are they really? Is it that you don’t want to assert yourself, for fear of failure or rejection? Since you speak your mind in most situations, why are you so afraid to speak your thoughts in a circumstance with potential conflict? Some of this baggage results from childhood. You went along just under the radar so that no one would question you or your ability.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And ended it with:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Am I beginning to be suspicious of some of my assumptions about myself, others, and the way I handle conflict, as a result of my individual journey with this conflict? Most people would feel hurt when they are betrayed. But what struck me the most is that it all goes back to self-esteem and not wanting to look bad to others. I really thought that it didn’t affect me. Once upon a time it did, but now it doesn’t. However, now I see that I still have this confidence in myself that is based upon other people’s perceptions … as Prof … stated, a light switch on the outside that other people can flick on or off. I saw this when I realized how much it bothered me that Y would tell people something that would make me look incompetent. Everybody at XYZ, Inc. knew my work, they didn’t think that. And the new Controller saw a lot of evidence of my work, he didn’t think that either. This feeling of incompetence is why the conflict was so difficult to put behind me, and how everything that Y did or said started to build—everything started bothering me!</p>

<p>Whether we choose to help negotiators reflect critically in order to begin their own journeys toward transformative learning, the depth and intimacy of their actual experiences are usually lurking in the background. Using the approach described in this article, negotiators are encouraged to utilize these critical examinations and the feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350507611416567">Raab, 1997</xref>) in which they have been marinated for a long time as necessary ingredients for transforming conflicts into learning opportunities.</p>

<title>Validity check</title>
<p>The quantitative scores from student evaluations of my course continued to be very high—similar on this account to many negotiation courses offered using conventional methods. However, students’ qualitative descriptions of their experience with the critical learning perspective were different, and the difference revealed deeper learning. Below are a few examples of anonymous course comments:</p>

<title>Model limitations</title>
<p>Adding the CC to course material introduced two main challenges to me. First, I had to sacrifice breadth for depth, for example dropping topics such as gender and cross-cultural negotiation to make room for introducing the model and its constructs. Second, I have found that introducing the CC model requires pedagogical vigilance on my part in the form of continuous attention to students’ and my own struggles with class conflicts throughout the term. In my own experience, the yield to students and me has far outweighed the cost.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Let us now zoom out to see the present work in its conceptual and pedagogical milieu. Conceptually, I have incorporated learning as an explicit variable in the conflict-negotiation equation, which means considering the negotiator as a learner and negotiation as a learning process. This conception has requirements and consequences. It requires examining negotiators’ learning in actual, hot, complex, and messy conflicts, so we may be able to detect and account for the impact on learning of the real emotions in these actual conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350507611416567">Barry, 2007</xref>). An immediate consequence of this new conception is the opportunity to capitalize on the malleability of learning to set the stage for releasing the transformative learning potential of the negotiator. To this end, I presented the CC and utilized Argyris’ learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611416567">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507611416567">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350507611416567">2010</xref>) as vehicles to examine then interrupt the dynamic of negotiators’ defensiveness, non-reflective, learning, habitual action, and the overall impact on escalating conflicts. The yield from applying this model has been quite rich, and, furthermore, consistent with other critical and transformative learning conceptions in good currency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350507611416567">Cunliffe, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507611416567">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350507611416567">Kets de Vries, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1350507611416567">Reynolds and Vince, 2004</xref>). The present framework is potentially liberating not only to the negotiator but also to the negotiation literature. Instead of being told we can only <italic>know</italic> about personal negotiation styles as categories and frames of knowledge—or more limitedly, that we should not even bother knowing them because they represent deeply ingrained dispositions—we can now summon a different promise: if it was learned, it can be unlearned, and hence <italic>transformatively changed</italic>. Whether learners choose to change is up to them of course, but we can, through learning, create an opening in what now seems a dead-end path. Because these frontiers require self-questioning of emotions, awareness, learning, and habitual reactions to conflicts, negotiators in the present perspective assume a much greater responsibility for their own conflict, as we saw in Sandra’s case above.</p>
<p>Pedagogically, the CC model offers an opportunity for negotiators to learn from their own messy conflicts, instead of depending solely on conventional off-the-shelf course material. Using students’ own conflicts deepens their engagement with the course and produces outcomes that they find useful. In addition, the CC can guide students, the teacher, and their class toward a new learning experience where they become learners and learning material at once—immersed into the multiple facets, complexities, heat, and lights of learning-by-modeling. In this regard, the CC model builds a two-way bridge where pedagogy and theory can constantly inform, validate, and profit from one another in a thicker actualization of mutual gains.</p>
