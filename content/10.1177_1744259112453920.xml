<p>In this work, the thermal performance of three different wall configurations was examined by hot box measurements and numerical simulations. Vacuum insulation panels were sandwiched between traditional insulation in walls where the load-bearing elements were standard 36-mm-thick wooden studs, I-profiled studs and U-profiled studs. The measured mean values of the thermal transmittance (<italic>U</italic>-value) were 0.09 W/m<sup>2</sup>·K with 36-mm-thick wooden studs, 0.10 W/m<sup>2</sup>·K with U-profiled studs and 0.11 W/m<sup>2</sup>·K with I-profiled studs. The comparison of the three wall structures has shown that with such low <italic>U</italic>-values, the numerical simulations are more sensitive to the accuracy of the dimensions and thermal conductivities used as input. This required measurements of the thermal resistance of the fibreboard in two directions, the thickness and thermal resistance of the vacuum insulation panels and the thermal resistance of the 36-mm-thick wooden studs and the mineral wool.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The vacuum insulation panel (VIP) exhibits conductivities as low as between 3.5 and 4 mW/m⋅K in a non-aged condition. The VIP solution consists of an open-pore structure of fumed silica core with a metallized polymer laminate envelope acting as a moisture and air barrier around the core material. Depending on the properties of the laminate envelope, the thermal conductivity of VIP will increase during the years, for example, up to 8 mW/m⋅K. A perforated VIP will have a thermal conductivity of about 20 mW/m⋅K. Thus, it is crucial to make the construction with VIPs in the building envelope as robust as possible.</p>
<p>Comprehensive investigations of thermal properties, performance and service life of VIPs have already been carried by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744259112453920">Brunner et al. (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744259112453920">Tenpierik et al.

A recent extensive review on VIPs for building applications has been given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744259112453920">Baetens et al. (2010)</xref>, also including material concepts beyond VIPs.</p>
<p>In the previous studies from our group, the effect of changing the configuration of different VIPs was investigated with hot box measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744259112453920">Grynning et al., 2011</xref>). Other experiments have investigated the aging effects on the thermal properties and the service life of VIPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744259112453920">Wegger et al., 2011</xref>), and also the applicability of VIPs when retrofitting wood frame walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744259112453920">Sveipe et al., 2011</xref>). The effect of applying different structural vertical wood frame stud profiles between the VIPs in order to minimize the heat loss through the building envelopes was initially investigated with hot box measurements by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744259112453920">Haavi et al. (2010)</xref>. The objective of this work is to study further the thermal performance of standard wooden studs, I-profiled studs and U-profiled studs with VIPs as the main thermal insulation between the vertical studs.</p>

<title>Studs</title>
<p>Standard 36-mm-thick wooden studs, I-profiled studs and U-profiled studs were examined with VIPs combined with mineral wool as the thermal insulation between the vertical studs.

<sec id="section12-1744259112453920">
<title>Instrumentation</title>
<p>In addition to the general instrumentation in the hot box, the wall constructions were instrumented with 40 thermocouples and 2 heat flow meters (HFMs). There were 14 thermocouples on each side of the wall and 6 thermocouples on the web of each stud. The HFMs were located on the hot side of the wall, close to the centre of the VIPs between the studs (approximately 100 mm to the left of the centre to avoid interference with the thermocouples). The two HFMs, referred to as TNO PU 43T.0024 and TNO PU 43T.0025, have been calibrated in an HFM apparatus.</p>

<p>The thermal conductivity of the fibreboard webs in the I-studs and U-studs was specified to be λ<sub>fb</sub> = 0.18 W/m⋅K in the European technical approval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744259112453920">SITAC, 2009</xref>). This thermal conductivity was used in the simulations with <italic>nominal</italic> input parameters.</p>
<p>It is common to measure the thermal conductivity through the thickness of fibreboard plates (refer to the perpendicular direction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1744259112453920">Figure 5</xref>), but the thermal conductivity in the longitudinal direction is not well known. The thermal resistance in the longitudinal direction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1744259112453920">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1744259112453920">6</xref>), that is, the direction of the heat flow through the I-studs and the U-studs, was therefore measured in an HFM apparatus according to the governing standard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744259112453920">NS-EN 12667:2001 (2001)</xref>. The result from the measurement was λ<sub>fb║</sub> = 0.38 W/m⋅K, which is 111% higher than the value from the technical approval. This measured value was used in the simulations with <italic>modified</italic> input parameters. The thermal conductivity from an equivalent measurement in the perpendicular direction was λ<sub>fb⊥</sub> = 0.14 W/m⋅K.</p>

<title>Thermal properties</title>
<p>The hot box results (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744259112453920">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1744259112453920">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1744259112453920">Figure 7</xref>) show that the wall with 36-mm studs has the lowest <italic>U</italic>-value, that the <italic>U</italic>-value of the wall with U-studs is 9.1% higher and that the wall with I-studs has the highest <italic>U</italic>-value, that is, 14.8% higher than the wall with 36-mm studs.</p>
<p>In the first case of the numerical simulations, that is, with <italic>nominal</italic> input parameters, the ranking of the walls was quite different. The wall with 36-mm studs had the highest <italic>U</italic>-value in these simulations. This could be explained by the fact that the actual thermal conductivity of the fibreboard in the web of the I-studs and the U-studs was significantly higher than specified in the European technical approval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744259112453920">SITAC, 2009</xref>). The measured thermal conductivity in the direction of the heat flow was λ<sub>fb║</sub> = 0.38 W/m⋅K, which is 111% higher than λ<sub>fb</sub> = 0.18 W/m⋅K which was specified in the technical approval. This is most likely because it is common to measure the thermal conductivity through the thickness of plates, and thereby failing to reveal the anisotropic thermal conductivity of the fibreboard. The thermal conductivity from an equivalent measurement through the thickness of the fibreboard plates was λ<sub>fb⊥</sub> = 0.14 W/m⋅K. This means that the thermal bridge effect of the I-studs and U-studs is significantly higher than expected and therefore increases the average <italic>U</italic>-value of these walls. In addition, the actual thermal bridge effect of the 36-mm studs is lower than expected. The thermal conductivity of the 36-mm studs from measurement was λ<sub>w 36 mm</sub> = 0.10 W/m⋅K, which is 23% less than the nominal thermal conductivity and therefore decreases the average <italic>U</italic>-value of this wall. This can be explained by the relatively low density of the 36-mm studs. The thermal conductivity can be related to the dry density of wood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744259112453920">Grynning and Uvsløkk, 2008</xref>), which means that the thermal conductivity decreases when the dry density decreases.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned factors which affect the thermal bridge effect, it was also shown that the measurements of the VIP and the mineral wool improved the results from the numerical simulations. The measured thickness of the VIPs was only 1.8 mm less than the nominal dimension of 40 mm, but this is still a reduction of 5%, which also means an equivalent reduction of the thermal resistance of the VIPs. The average thermal conductivity from the measurements at the centre of the VIPs was λ
<sub>cop</sub> = 0.00435 W/m⋅K, which is 9% higher than the nominal thermal conductivity. In addition to the VIP measurements, the thermal conductivity from the measurement of mineral wool was 0.034 W/m⋅K, which is 8% less than the nominal value.</p>
<p>Both the lower thickness and the higher thermal conductivity of the VIPs reduce the thermal resistance of the walls, while the lower thermal conductivity of the mineral wool increases the thermal resistance. The variations in the properties of the VIPs have nevertheless a more significant influence on the total thermal resistance of the wall, since the VIPs account for a larger share of the total thermal resistance.</p>
<p>All in all, the numerical simulations with <italic>modified</italic> input parameters have significantly better correlation with the hot box measurements than the simulations with <italic>nominal</italic> input parameters. With <italic>nominal</italic> input parameters, the ranking of the walls regarding lowest and highest <italic>U</italic>-value is not the same as for the hot box measurements, and the deviation between hot box measurements and simulations varies between −11.6% and 10.8%. With <italic>modified</italic> input parameters, the ranking of the walls regarding lowest and highest <italic>U</italic>-value is the same as for the hot box measurements, and the deviation between hot box measurements and simulations varies between −1.5% and 8.6%, which is a very good correlation.</p>
<p>The hot box results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1744259112453920">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1744259112453920">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1744259112453920">Figure 8</xref> show the <italic>U</italic>-value which is measured with the HFM, that is, close to the centre of the VIPs, excluding the effect of the studs. The measured <italic>U</italic>-value at the centre of the VIPs is almost the same for all the three wall constructions, which is expected, since this area should not be influenced by the studs. The comparison of the HFM measurements and the numerical simulations also shows that the simulations with <italic>modified</italic> input parameters have better correlation with the HFM results than the simulations with <italic>nominal</italic> input parameters. With <italic>nominal</italic> input parameters, the deviation between HFM measurements and simulations varies between −13.4% and −11.8%. With <italic>modified</italic> input parameters, the deviation between hot box measurements and simulations varies between −7.3% and −5.6%, which is quite good correlation.</p>
<p>It should be noted that all the <italic>U</italic>-values are very low. This means that the measured <italic>U</italic>-values are more sensitive to variations in the assembly of the full-scale wall constructions and possible air leakages. The low <italic>U</italic>-values also imply that the numerical simulations are more sensitive to the accuracy of the dimensions and thermal conductivities used as input. Relatively small variations in the thermal conductivity and the thickness of the VIPs, as well as variations in the thermal conductivities of the studs, have significant impact on the average <italic>U</italic>-value of the wall. This is illustrated by the deviation between the simulations with <italic>nominal</italic> input parameters compared with the simulations with <italic>modified</italic> input parameters. The accuracy of the numerical simulations was significantly improved by the measurements of the input parameters which have most influence on the <italic>U</italic>-values.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1744259112453920">
<title>Robustness and buildability</title>
<p>The thermal performance of the VIPs is very much dependent on the metallized polymer laminate envelope acting as a moisture and air barrier around the core material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744259112453920">Baetens et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744259112453920">Wegger et al., 2011</xref>). If the envelope is perforated, the thermal conductivity will be about five times higher than in the pristine non-aged condition. All three wall constructions in these experiments are considered to be relatively robust due to the mineral wool layer on each side, which reduces the risk of perforating the VIP envelope, for example, with a nail.</p>
<p>It was initially assumed that the low thickness (8 mm) of the web in the I-studs and the U-studs was going to reduce the thermal bridge effect, compared with the traditional 36-mm studs. The improved thermal properties of the wall were supposed to compensate for the additional work of insulating the small gaps between the VIPs and the I-studs and the U-studs. However, the measured thermal conductivity of the fibreboard in the web of the I-studs and the U-studs was significantly higher than specified in the direction of the heat flow. Hence, the construction of the three different walls and the following tests in the hot box have shown that the traditional wood frame wall construction with 36-mm studs has the lowest <italic>U</italic>-value and is easiest to build. The buildability of all three walls is strongly influenced by the fixed dimensions of the VIPs, which require better planning and higher precision, since the size of the VIPs cannot be adapted on the building site.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The hot box testing of different wood frame wall constructions with VIPs gave the following thermal transmittance (<italic>U</italic>-value):</p>
<list id="list3-1744259112453920" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Wall with 36-mm studs: 0.09 W/m<sup>2</sup>·K</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Wall with I-studs: 0.11 W/m<sup>2</sup>·K</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Wall with U-studs: 0.10 W/m<sup>2</sup>·K</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The wall sections had a somewhat low fraction of wood frame members and the results are not necessarily representative for normal walls. However, the comparison of the three wall structures has shown that with such low <italic>U</italic>-values, the numerical simulations are more sensitive to the accuracy of the dimensions and thermal conductivities used as input.</p>
<p>The accuracy of the numerical simulations was significantly improved by applying the measured values of (a) thermal resistance of the fibreboard in the web of the I-studs and U-studs, (b) the thickness and thermal resistance of the VIPs and (c) the thermal resistance of the 36-mm studs and the mineral wool.</p>
<p>It was discovered that the thermal conductivity of the fibreboard in the web of the I-studs and the U-studs was significantly higher than the nominal value λ<sub>fb</sub> = 0.18 W/m⋅K, which was specified in the European technical approval. The measured thermal conductivity was λ<sub>fb║</sub> = 0.38 W/m⋅K in the direction of the heat flow and λ<sub>fb⊥</sub> = 0.14 W/m⋅K in the perpendicular direction.</p>
<p>The experiments show that the application of VIPs makes it possible to obtain wall construction <italic>U</italic>-values of about 0.1 W/m<sup>2</sup>·K with a wall thickness of less than ~20 cm.</p>
<p>The proposed wall assemblies improve the robustness of the VIPs, since they are protected by a layer of mineral wool on both sides.</p>
<p>The use of VIPs in wood frame constructions requires better planning and higher precision during construction, since the size of the VIPs cannot be adapted on the building site.</p>
