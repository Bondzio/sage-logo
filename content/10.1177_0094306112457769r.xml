<p><italic>Poverty of Democracy</italic> seeks to contribute theoretical advancement in studies of political participation explaining aspects of its correlation with socioeconomic stratification in Mexico. The main argument is that standard theory places individual endowments and attitudes at the center of explanations whereas it should be occupied by political institutions, namely, “public policies, activities of the state, features of the party system, and the rules and practices that govern the political process” (p. 3). Even theories that take into account the mobilization power of social organizations “stop short in their search for institutional influences on political participation by leaving the state out of their analysis” (p. 37). Focusing on political institutions would enable the understanding of why the poor sometimes participate more than the rich, their choices of available political activities, and timely variations of the political participation levels of individuals and societies. As Mexico has gone through radical changes in political institutions from 1990 onwards, evidence on political participation from it would provide a test for the proposed advancement.</p>
<p>The description of the changes in Mexican political institutions is scattered in the book. Summarizing, changes in “the features of the party system, and the rules and practices that govern the political process” are brought about by the democratic transition from the authoritarian rule of PRI to a multiparty system. They began in 1988, when PRI won the presidential elections by the smallest margin ever, and other parties gained space. Throughout the 1990s, PRI kept losing power and in the aftermath of the economic crisis of the mid-1990s it lost the majority in the national congress, and then the presidency in 2000. Authoritarianism and patronage declined, albeit slower in the poorer regions. Changes in “public policies, activities of the state” are the shift from state-led development to neoliberalism, a motive of dissatisfaction for many Mexicans—shown by the result of the 1988 elections—including leftist PRI members who fled to found PRD. By the beginning of the 1990s, Mexico had a full-fledged neoliberal economy, and this might well have been one cause of the crisis, when the economy shrank and poverty skyrocketed.</p>
<p>Right from the onset, World Values Survey’s statistics on the political participation of Mexicans by income brackets show that overall political participation decreased sharply from 1990 to 2000. The decrease among the poor was relatively greater than that of the higher income group, widening the political participation gap. But from 2000 to 2005, overall political participation increased, more than doubling among the poor, thus reducing the gap, yet not reaching 1990’s level. These figures are presented as “the best information about changing patterns of political participation between 1990 and 2000” (p. 7). Hence one would expect the research to support with evidence the explanation of the decline in the political participation of the poor by the changes in political institutions, as well as its later increase. If life was worsening, how did political institutions lead the poor to participate in fewer sit-ins, strikes, rallies and petitions—the political participation acts of the WVS—from 1990 to 2000, and then to increase such political participation when life was getting better, from 2000 to 2005?</p>
<p>Alas, the implicit timetable is rather confusing, casting shadows on the conclusion of the research. It is said that the bulk of the fieldwork was conducted between 1998 and 2000, and that most of the work relies on the 2000 and 2003 waves of a survey. This mismatch between the period of the in-depth interviews and that of the survey is a serious problem. All the statistical models that allow the testing of the theoretical proposition that political institutions are more important than individual endowments are based on a 2003 survey. Their results show that political institutions do affect the political participation of the poor but they do not unveil their alleged power to explain variations, giving no clue on the declining participation from 1990 to 2000. Data for more than one time point are restricted to relative frequencies or subsidize univaried analyses which are not very enlightening.</p>
<p>Taking for granted that most of the interviews were done between 1998 and 2000, before the apogee of democratic transition represented by the loss of the presidency by PRI, and in the aftermath of the deep economic crisis, when PRI was still in power, and most of the leaders of other parties were former PRI members, it is no wonder there was cynicism and pessimism among the poor. It is likely that higher income groups shared these feelings. Oddly, the interviews’ materials always corroborate the book’s explicit bias against neoliberalism, and it is even stated that people were directly asked about their experiences with neoliberalism, which does not seem a proper methodological approach. It is hard to believe that all poor Mexicans felt that they were better under PRI’s patronage because it was easier to get something from the government, and “now” everything is depersonalized and decided by a computer program run in Mexico City by technocrats.</p>
<p>In sum, the book is well written and interesting. As a Latin American scholar, I found myself bothered by its ethnocentric flavor: Mexican researchers are often quoted, but mainly as providers of evidence, not of theories about the political participation of the poor in their own country. This sort of “intellectual imperialism,” however, is a generalized malady. Those interested in it should bear in mind that, contrary to what its title might suggest, this book does not offer a universally valid critique of democracy: democracy is poor in Mexico because the political institutions do not foster an enabling environment for the political participation of the poor. Clearly, it is not targeted at a broader public of social scientists, because it goes deep into very specialized discussions on theory and measurement of political participation. Nevertheless, those deeply entrenched in the field will certainly find food for thought in it, particularly in the attempts to model the effects of political institutions upon the political participation of different income strata.</p>
