<abstract>
<p>Considerable debate exists in the West about the effectiveness of high commitment management (HCM) practices in reducing the negative features associated with work in mass-production call centres. This debate has been glossed over the Indian context. Addressing the gap by critically examining the role of HCM practices in Indian call centres, this article highlights the crucial influence of the organizational agenda and the Indian sociocultural milieu. The findings support the crossvergence thesis while confirming that HCM practices rarely undermine the organizational imperative of control. Indeed, organizational interests prevail, being manifest via the ‘sacrificial HR strategy’. Clearly, employer organizations committed to promoting employee well-being and reducing attrition need to examine issues of job design, task demands and psychological contract obligations apart from implementing HCM practices.</p>

<p>It is about a decade since researchers began examining new forms of work organization such as call centres. Early work on call centres focused on the coercive employment systems that were adopted by these organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143831X11401926">Kinnie et al., 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X11401926">Fernie and Metcalf (1998)</xref> likened call centres to a ‘panopticon’ that controlled virtually every aspect of employee behaviour while Taylor and Bain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0143831X11401926">1999</xref>: 109) characterized call centre work as an ‘assembly line in the head’. Soon it was recognized that considerable variety existed within the call centre universe and employment conditions were wide-ranging. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11401926">Batt and Moynihan (2002)</xref> identified three main models around which work was structured in call centres. At one end of the continuum were organizations characterized by the professional service model that maximized the discretion and autonomy of call centre employees and at the other end were organizations that emphasized a mass-production model typified by a set of repetitive, routinized and highly scripted tasks. The mass-customization model, a hybrid of the above two, encompassed sophisticated human resource (HR) practices, resembling the high commitment management (HCM)/high performance work systems (HPWS) approach. The attempt was to ‘offset some of the worst features of call centre working’ by combining ‘fun and surveillance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143831X11401926">Kinnie et al., 2000</xref>). Since then, many studies have supported the benefits accruing from the implementation of HCM practices (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11401926">Clark, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143831X11401926">Harney and Jordan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143831X11401926">Malhotra et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0143831X11401926">Schalk and Van Rijckevorsel, 2007</xref>) coupled with the creation of state-of-the-art workplaces seeking to communicate ‘people values’ in mass-production call centres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143831X11401926">Barnes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0143831X11401926">Robinson and Morley, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11401926">Godard (2004)</xref> elsewhere argues that because of the costs associated with the implementation of HPWS, this approach, instead of providing relief to employees, increases work intensification and occupational stress levels. Therefore the notion of partnership as espoused by HPWS remains largely illusory as irreconcilable conflicts of interest between employers and employees are structurally embedded in the employment relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11401926">Danford et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11401926">Godard, 2004</xref>). Thus, HPWS are very much loaded in favour of managerial prerogatives, with little, if any, meaningful consultation with employees and/or their representatives over the terms of HPWS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11401926">Danford et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143831X11401926">Green, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0143831X11401926">Russell, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The focus of this article is to examine these diametrically opposite views that relate to the impact of HR policies in Indian call centres. We argue that though the HR policies in Indian call centres resemble the HCM practices elsewhere in the world, the organizational agenda of control is rarely compromised. In fact, with increasing pressure of competition, HCM practices may come to approximate a ‘sacrificial HR strategy’. Added to this is the complexity of the Indian context that makes the implementation of HCM practices as developed in the West difficult. However, before proceeding any further, it would be relevant to examine in detail the present debate relating to the use of HCM practices in call centres.</p>
<sec id="section1-0143831X11401926">
<title>HCM practices and call centres</title>
<p>It is often argued that HCM practices allow for the attraction and selection of highly committed and flexible employees, ensure that internal labour markets reward commitment and training with promotion and job security, and endorse the use of direct communication and team working (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X11401926">Hutchinson et al., 2000</xref>) by providing a supportive environment which adopts a less hierarchical leadership style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11401926">Clark, 2007</xref>). The role that HR plays is crucial in supporting management systems and evolving workplace cultures through participation in managerially constructed games and other planned social activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X11401926">Hutchinson et al., 2000</xref>). The focus is mainly on cultural attributes (e.g. the ‘fun factor’, team hype, symbolic rewards) rather than on work design features such as job autonomy. Thus, HCM initiatives are identified with team building activities, the ‘fun factor’, selective recruitment, focused training, two-way communication, performance-related pay and employment security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0143831X11401926">Russell, 2008</xref>). In the context of call centres, HCM practices are proposed to ameliorate the oppressive aspects of the call centre labour process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143831X11401926">Kinnie et al., 2000</xref>). The implementation of HCM practices, combined with state-of-the-art infrastructure and planned social activities, is supposed to engender employee commitment to organizational goals and reduce the incidence of absenteeism and intention to quit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143831X11401926">Barnes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0143831X11401926">Robinson and Morley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0143831X11401926">Schalk and Van Rijckevorsel, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>However, other research highlights the tensions underlying commitment in the high control context of call centres. Low discretion work environments can undermine HCM, particularly when employees experience superficiality in its implementation or see it as an obstruction to their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143831X11401926">Houlihan, 2002</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0143831X11401926">Van den Broek (2004)</xref> states that normative control through a direct HR approach was rejected by employees. This rejection was, to some degree, underscored by a recognition that while team leaders (TLs) and other managers endorsed the soft quality customer service focus, they simultaneously pushed quantitative output targets onto employees, thereby implementing a ‘sacrificial HR strategy’. Here management sacrifices the well-being of the staff by pushing the service/efficiency tension onto the frontline, and in the process, willingly accepts high levels of stress, emotional burnout and employee turnover among the frontline staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0143831X11401926">Robinson and Morley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0143831X11401926">Wallace et al., 2000</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11401926">Alferoff and Knights (2001)</xref> hold that employees were rarely taken in by the aesthetic trappings and trimmings of the workplace, which stood in sharp contrast to the work-intensive conditions of call centre operations. In the same vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143831X11401926">McGuire and McLaren (2009)</xref> suggest that addressing the physical working environment of employees is not enough to promote greater employee connection with the organization. Reducing the level of scripting, enhancing the involvement and participation of employees in work systems and target setting and organizing regular team events are equally relevant. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11401926">Callaghan and Thompson (2002)</xref> maintain that it is paradoxical to use selection and training procedures traditionally associated with the high-end non-routine work for routine jobs that have modest pay and flat promotion structures.</p>

<sec id="section2-0143831X11401926">
<title>The Indian context: Convergence, divergence or crossvergence</title>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, some recent research argues that clients play an important role in determining the HR system in call centres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143831X11401926">Harney and Jordan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143831X11401926">Kinnie et al., 2008</xref>). Given this, it is not surprising that in India, several researchers have documented the use of HCM practices that resemble those in the West in terms of sociotechnical systems and HR practices (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143831X11401926">Carroll and Wagar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0143831X11401926">Russell and Thite, 2009</xref>). In fact, some researchers have argued that well-being and job satisfaction form the pivot of HR practices implemented in Indian call centres, which are supposed to be highly innovative, professional, formal, structured and world class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11401926">Budhwar et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0143831X11401926">Thite and Russell, 2009</xref>), implying thereby that the HR policies in Indian call centres seem to be converging with western practices. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0143831X11401926">Wallace (2009)</xref> cautions that the outsource providers in India are under constant pressure by their clients to reduce operating costs and increase service levels, resulting in a ‘sacrificial HR strategy’ that compromises employees’ well-being and job satisfaction in favour of company objectives.</p>
<p>Besides clients putting pressure on HR practices, factors unique to each location, such as the community, the job market and history, shape the HR policies in call centres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0143831X11401926">Paulet, 2008</xref>). This could be particularly so in the case of Indian call centres, where in spite of changing trends in work systems, women remain absent from top management positions and career development systems are a matter of concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11401926">Budhwar et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, in the case of other Indian organizations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11401926">Kakar et al. (2002)</xref> note that in spite of being exposed to western influences and therefore to assimilation, transformation, reassertion and recreation, Indian organizations do not function as organizations in the West do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0143831X11401926">Sinha, 1997</xref>). The Indian ethos continues to prevail, with Indian workplaces reflecting a confluence between Indian culture and western industrialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143831X11401926">Kakar and Kakar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11401926">Kakar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0143831X11401926">Sinha, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0143831X11401926">1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0143831X11401926">1997</xref>). Thus, in India, personalized relationships and exchanges, identity-based interactions and hierarchical systems with related ingroup–outgroup affiliation and power distance influence work life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143831X11401926">Kakar and Kakar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11401926">Kakar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0143831X11401926">Sinha, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0143831X11401926">1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0143831X11401926">2008</xref>). Age, kinship, caste, religion, region, class, gender and authority are important factors in this regard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143831X11401926">Beteille, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0143831X11401926">Sinha, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0143831X11401926">Verma, 2004</xref>), though exceptions do exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X11401926">Basu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0143831X11401926">Noronha, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Power distance is favoured by both superiors and subordinates. Managers prefer the centralization of power, displaying not only a leaning towards hierarchy, tight controls and limited delegation but also a lack of confidence in their subordinates. Subordinates prefer a top-down approach embodying close supervision, restricted autonomy and clear and direct orders and hence work best under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11401926">Budhwar, 2009</xref>). Not surprisingly, bosses who demonstrate powerful and authoritative personalities are more likely to gain the respect of subordinates, with democratic management styles being viewed as a sign of weakness or incompetence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0143831X11401926">Sinha, 1995</xref>). With people finding it easier to work in superior–subordinate roles rather than as equals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0143831X11401926">Sinha, 1982</xref>), decision-making is centralized and communication tends to be more downward, favouring ingroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0143831X11401926">Sinha, 1997</xref>). Upward communication is generally adjusted to the status, moods and the reactions of the superiors, the nature of interpersonal relationships and the social and professional relationships in the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0143831X11401926">Sinha, 1997</xref>), and precludes critical feedback that would enhance superiors’ personal effectiveness and organizational functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11401926">Kakar et al., 2002</xref>). Further, the development of horizontal relationships, team spirit and collaboration is hampered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11401926">Kakar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0143831X11401926">Sinha, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, in keeping with the paternalistic character of Indian society, the Indian workforce appreciates and responds best to nurturant-task leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0143831X11401926">Sinha, 1982</xref>) where authority and benevolence are combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11401926">Kakar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0143831X11401926">Sinha, 1982</xref>). The leader is thus expected to be authoritative (but not authoritarian) but also caring, like the <italic>karta</italic> (paternalistic head of the joint family) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11401926">Kakar et al., 2002</xref>), getting the work done while taking a personal interest in subordinates’ well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0143831X11401926">Sinha, 1982</xref>). Subordinates are happy to be subservient to and respect authority but expect protection, concern and support from their leader, whom they idealize as a repository of all virtues and a role model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11401926">Kakar et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Sycophancy and ingratiation are considered to be the appropriate means of influence with leaders and are extensively used by employees to maximize their gains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143831X11401926">Bohra and Pandey, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0143831X11401926">Pandey, 1981</xref>). Not only does engagement with these behaviours deflect employee attention away from productivity-linked tasks, but also superiors’ responses and social categories contribute to the process. That is, superiors appreciate the attention and flattery and cultivate subordinates’ loyalty. While superiors gain power and information, subordinates’ employment continuity, security, career growth and success are ensured, with access to undue resources also being facilitated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0143831X11401926">Pandey, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>In matters of gender, men continue to espouse patriarchal world-views, and since they dominate workplaces, these attitudes prevail, further sidelining women. Discrimination against women workers and managers, in the formal and informal, public and private sectors in both urban and rural settings in matters of recruitment, promotion, job security, wages, etc., is commonly reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X11401926">Basu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143831X11401926">Bharat, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0143831X11401926">Papola and Sharma, 1999</xref>) as is sexual harassment at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0143831X11401926">Punwani, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0143831X11401926">Tejani, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X11401926">Banerjee and Knight (1985)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143831X11401926">Ito (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0143831X11401926">Noronha (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0143831X11401926">Thorat and Attewell (2007)</xref> highlight that kinship, caste, region and religion play a role in selection, appraisal, compensation, promotion and confirmation processes as well as in task performance in Indian workplaces across rural and urban areas and public and private sectors. They describe the politics of inclusion and exclusion in a hierarchically and relationally networked society where identity-linked social and affective ties, homosocial sponsorship and prejudice and stereotypes promote partisan and discriminatory practices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143831X11401926">Jodhka and Newman (2007)</xref> point out that in spite of a globalizing economy with concomitant emphasis on merit in recruitment as cited by private sector employees, caste, class and geographical location (proxied by family background) and region continue to affect selection processes.</p>
<p>In short, Indian workplaces resemble feudalistic set-ups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X11401926">Budhwar, 2000</xref>) which privilege the informal organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11401926">Kakar et al., 2002</xref>), allowing favouritism, discrimination, manipulative behaviours and corruption to persist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143831X11401926">Kakar and Kakar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0143831X11401926">Noronha, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0143831X11401926">Sinha, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0143831X11401926">1990</xref>). At the same time, there is also some evidence of ‘crossvergence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143831X11401926">Baruch and Budhwar, 2006</xref>: 97), which indicates that many global HR practices can be adopted in India with minor changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X11401926">Budhwar et al., 2009a</xref>) given that a significant number of Indian managers are either trained in the West or learn western management tools in Indian business schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143831X11401926">Baruch and Budhwar, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Given this background, the motivation for this part of the research was investigative. The urge was to search beneath frontline call centre employees’ (alternatively referred to as agents henceforth) acceptance of the uncritical view of HCM practices (findings not a part of this article [see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0143831X11401926">Noronha and D’Cruz, 2009a</xref>]) in the context of the contradictory perspectives on HCM practices and the Indian sociocultural environment outlined in the previous section.</p>
<p>At this point, it is relevant to clarify that this article is a part of a larger study which included 59 frontline call centre employees, the funding for which was provided by the Indo-Dutch Programme on Alternatives in Development (IDPAD). The findings in this article relate to two phases of interviews conducted with call centre managers from 40 different Indian and multinational corporation (MNC) third-party international facing call centres located in Bangalore and Mumbai working for UK and US clients. The first phase of interviews conducted with 15 managers (11 in Bangalore and four in Mumbai) at the junior level endorsed the optimistic view of HCM policies as enhancing employee well-being and job satisfaction (this is discussed further in the section on ‘HCM practices: The popular notion’). Accordingly, call centres in India were examples of non-hierarchical structures, performance-based career advancement, fantastic workplace ambience and transparency. At this stage, interviewing managers who control much of the production of the discourse in the workplace, therefore, seemed to be a futile effort. Nonetheless, we persisted with the idea of interviewing managers to search beneath the corporate discourse, as discourse may be read differently by various groups of managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X11401926">Barlow, 1989</xref>). We also realized that up to this stage of our study our interviews were only with junior managers, who like frontline call centre agents had little work experience and hence were more amenable to managerial efforts towards instilling corporate values into a comparatively young workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0143831X11401926">Van den Broek, 2004</xref>) with a high labour turnover.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the second phase, we interviewed a different set of 25 managers (16 in Bangalore and nine in Mumbai), of which six managers were from middle and senior levels with significant work experience in other organizations, while the rest were from the junior levels of the organizational hierarchy. In the second phase, the interviews with managers at the senior level were conducted first while those with the junior level managers were conducted later. This strategy worked as managers at the senior levels were more forthcoming and their views were then endorsed by managers at the junior levels of the hierarchy. The openness displayed by senior managers was also due to the affiliation of the researchers to a prominent business school in India and the assurance provided to them (managers) that the identity of their employer organizations would not be revealed. Besides this, informed consent, voluntary participation and confidentiality were adhered to in both phases of data collection. Consequently, in the second phase, the commonly held assumptions about the usefulness of HCM practices were problematized and subjected to critical enquiry. The participants were asked to reflect on the key themes of non-hierarchical structures, performance-based career advancement, fantastic workplace ambience and transparency in the context of Indian sociocultural environment and client requirements. The observations of managers at different levels of the hierarchy allowed for stronger assertions, as presented in the section titled ‘HCM practices: A re-examination’. Data collection in the second phase was also enriched by participants who had moved up the hierarchy from the lowest levels in the organization. These participants could recall, compare and contrast from their own work experiences as agents and managers the difference between what employer organizations espoused and the reality as it unfolded.</p>
<p>Participants in both the phases were identified through convenient snowball sampling initiated via personal contacts. In-depth interviews, conducted as per participants’ convenience, were completed in English and audio-recorded with consent. Further, both the phases were iterative with a continuous attempt to isolate themes while simultaneously achieving saturation. Participant transcripts were examined for themes, patterns and categories. This approach did not involve prefigured categories but allowed the researcher’s intuitive and interpretive capacities to prevail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X11401926">Crabtree and Miller, 1992</xref>). This process was facilitated through the use of various tools such as charts, matrices, event lists, causal networks and memos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143831X11401926">Miles and Huberman, 1994</xref>). These tools were also used to examine the linkages between themes, patterns and categories, and thereby initiate interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0143831X11401926">Patton, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>It is relevant to mention that the study did not attempt to identify regional differences based on location nor were the data treated separately for analysis and conclusion purposes.</p>

<title>HCM practices: The popular notion</title>
<p>As observed elsewhere by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143831X11401926">Brannan and Hawkins (2007)</xref>, at the recruitment stage, employers highlight their endeavours to provide a sociable culture, a prestigious brand, modern working space and potential for career progression as incentives for call centre employment. In the Indian context, there are two ways in which employers sought to create this image – first, by providing state-of-the-art infrastructure, and second, by highlighting innovative HR practices.</p>
<sec id="section6-0143831X11401926">
<title>State-of-the-art infrastructure</title>
<p>Recent organizational studies show how individuals may be influenced by physical markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X11401926">Heaphy et al., 2004</xref>). Call centre managers in the first phase of the study confirmed that this use of material artefacts hyped and enhanced the glamour of call centres. Call centres were located in ultra-modern buildings, offering state-of-the-art infrastructure and facilities, as also reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0143831X11401926">Ramesh (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143831X11401926">Mirchandani (2004)</xref>. Concrete and glass were aesthetically combined in constructing the outer structure of the buildings while elevators, air-conditioning, artistic interiors with wooden, marble or granite floors, bright lighting, elegant and comfortable furniture, decorative artefacts and electronic gadgets installed for security purposes completed the internal environment. Facilities within the office premises included individual lockers, cafeterias with wide-ranging menus at reasonable prices, recreation and de-stress rooms with bean bags, computers with internet access, music systems, televisions, indoor games such as carrom boards (indoor game), table tennis, chess, pool, etc., video games and reading spaces. Gymnasiums, badminton courts and sleeping facilities were also provided by a few organizations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0143831X11401926">
<title>HR practices</title>
<p>To enhance the attractiveness of call centres, managers in the first phase of interviews stated that organizations adopted various HR practices, rooted in the HCM concept:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Any organization you go to for an interview, the first thing they will tell you is that you will get a pay rise every six months. Second, that the organization will provide you with growth opportunities. Third, that the work environment is fantastic. And finally, they try and sell the brand of the organization. (Male, 30 years, operations manager)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Most importantly, managers stated that they were equal employment opportunity (EEO) compliant organizations, thereby claiming that their human resource management (HRM) structures were ‘identity-blind’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143831X11401926">Konrad and Linnehan, 1995</xref>) unlike those in old economy industries. The rationale underlying these assertions was that the organization eliminated discrimination and judged an individual on the basis of his/her achievements, during both recruitment and promotion. This was demonstrated by the several rounds of recruitment conducted to select call centre employees who could speak English confidently, which, in some cases, required the further and final approval of the clients. Once recruited, training formed an important component of the call centre set-up, encompassing a four- to eight-week period. Training included generic (such as cultural and linguistic training, communication skills and emotional labour skills) and process-specific modules. Following training, employees ‘go live’, and depending on their performance, decisions were made about their confirmation and/or retention.</p>
<p>With regard to promotions, claims were made about internal job postings (IJPs) being circulated every quarter and communication about promotion opportunities being shared. Organizational declarations that merit and objectivity influenced promotion decisions were interpreted by managers as the organization’s testimony of its professional orientation. Managers stated that the performance management system with explicit targets, monitoring and coaching, performance appraisal and performance-related pay gave credence to this assertion:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Everything is based on stats. Everything is based on actual numbers. How can you change the numbers? You can’t smile at the number and say, ‘Ok, please sit down.’ It will not change. You have to perform at work. (Male, 29 years, operations manager)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, reliance on hard statistical data thrown up by the automatic call dialling (ACD) system added to this perception, with agents being told that, for top performers, the transition from an entry level post to a junior level supervisory position occurred within a year of joining the organization. The propagation of the view that anyone whose performance was superior could quickly move up the organizational hierarchy was to inspire positive images of the employer in the agents’ minds, strengthening agents’ loyalty towards the organization and increasing their willingness to accept job-related demands and strain.</p>
<p>Managers also highlighted employers’ ‘concern’ for agents’ professional development and career growth. Many organizations had tie-ups with educational institutions for business administration and management courses, and agents availing of this opportunity were usually fully or partially funded by their employers.</p>
<p>Further, managers emphasized that employees in this sector, particularly those working for MNC captives, MNC third-party and Indian third-party organizations, received attractive pay packages which completely outdid the remuneration available in other sectors such as factory work, secretarial work and teaching, often earning more than their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11401926">Budhwar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0143831X11401926">Noronha and D’Cruz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0143831X11401926">Poster, 2007</xref>). Being a multinational (it is not uncommon for agents and managers employed in Indian third-party call centres to term their organization as MNC) with higher rates of pay reflected the prestige of the organization, as also observed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11401926">Brannan, 2005</xref>). Various allowances such as food allowance, night shift allowance (for those working in the night shift), transport facilities and medical/health services (including a doctor, a counsellor and a nutritionist on call) formed part of the package. In addition, agents received performance incentives in financial and material forms such as gift vouchers, clothes and accessories, movie and entertainment tickets, landline phone sets, cordless phone sets, mobile handsets, i-Pods, DVD players, etc.</p>
<p>By and large, managers interviewed in the first phase portrayed call centre organizations as extensions of college where work and enjoyment were combined. Concerted efforts were put in to create and maintain a vibrant environment to energize as well as de-stress employees. Various competitions, entertainment programmes, hobby classes, birthday celebrations, festival celebrations and so on were conducted during work hours, apart from activities such as team outings, team parties and office gatherings (including picnics, treks, family days, etc.) held during weekly offs (timetabled days off during the week) and public holidays, blurring hierarchical boundaries. Indeed, organizations employed fun officers, fun squads and event managers to manage these roles. Managers confirmed that the portrayal of ‘work as fun’ and ‘workplace as yet another campus’ was the central logic through which potential employees were attracted to the call centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0143831X11401926">Pal and Buzzanell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0143831X11401926">Ramesh, 2004</xref>):</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>It is all a picture that is painted, ‘Hey, you know what? This place is great. You can come here. Have all the fun you want. And we’ll take care of everything.’ When I joined the call centre, my colleagues said that it was a college. The first thing that we were given to understand is that, for achieving a sale, you are given a movie ticket. You achieve your targets and you get a pizza party. So it’s fun. (Male, 29 years, operations manager)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As has also been observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143831X11401926">Ng and Mitter (2005)</xref>, quite often the fun programmes involved agents’ families as well. Managers described the reactions of parents of call centre agents from middle-, lower middle- and lower-class families to such events. Given their exposure, lifestyle and aspirations, these parents were stupefied by the material artefacts associated with the employer organization. Being a part of the planned leisure programme, they also believed that the organization was concerned about employees’ well-being. Realizing that their offsprings’ employment with such progressive and generous organizations had altered their standard of living, parents developed a sense of awe and loyalty towards the organization. Once impressed, it was expected that parents’ sentiments could strengthen agents’ commitment to the organization, their performance could be improved and the chances of attrition could be stalled.</p>
<p>Further, employers in communications to agents downplayed bureaucratic structures and processes and emphasized integration. This orientation was particularly associated with superior–subordinate interactions and grievance handling processes. It was common practice to address everyone, including one’s superiors, by first name in a call centre organization, thereby de-emphasizing hierarchy and promoting integration. Indeed, managers reported instances where employees were reprimanded for using prefixes such as ‘sir’ or ‘madam’ when interacting with their superiors.</p>
<p>Call centre managers prided themselves on the number and nature of grievance avenues they provided their employees with. According to them, in keeping with a professional style of management, openness of communication in terms of content, form, style and route were valued. Therefore, in addition to periodic employee satisfaction surveys, skip-level meetings (grievances could be taken up by a manager above the immediate supervisor) and open forums with superiors, employees with grievances could approach anyone in the organization whether the chief executive officer (CEO), the TL or someone in between via email, letters, telephone conversations or face-to-face meetings. That the professional atmosphere in the organization precluded the complainant’s victimization was strongly emphasized. Under such circumstances, any third-party intervention including legal protection and collectivist groups such as trade unions were seen as redundant by the management. In other words, with their employers taking such great care of the employees’ interests, alternative mechanisms were not required. As observed elsewhere, these managerial preferences reflected attempts to promote the appearance of ‘professional’ service work which encouraged employee allegiance to a job and firm rather than to the collective interests of employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0143831X11401926">Van den Broek, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>It is of no surprise, then, that scholars conclude that Indian call centres used innovative HR practices (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11401926">Budhwar et al., 2009b</xref>). Nonetheless, the primary concern of managers was to organize employees around the employers’ objectives as detailed in the next section.</p>

<title>HCM practices: A re-examination</title>
<p>Managers included in the second phase of the study, while endorsing the observations made about the positive aspects of HCM practices in the previous section, simultaneously highlighted the breach in these practices that countered organizational assertions about the existence of non-hierarchical structures, career advancement, workplace ambience and transparency.</p>
<sec id="section9-0143831X11401926">
<title>The myth of non-hierarchical structures</title>
<p>Notwithstanding the emphasis on non-hierarchical structures, absence of bureaucracy and informality, managers expressed discomfort with agents’ informal though deferential behaviour with them. They resented being addressed by their first names and being treated as equals, even though the latter could coexist with respect. Managers responded to such display of informality either by unfairly picking on agents or by sidelining and ignoring them. Contrary to the discourse on integration and irrelevance of hierarchy that they themselves had propagated to the agents, managers expected agents to maintain traditional bureaucratic symbols within the organization and hence appreciated older agents who displayed appropriate restraint:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Here, you are suddenly thrown into an environment or atmosphere where you are told to address the CEO by the first or last name. They say, ‘Hey! You can call your CEO by his name’. But the CEO would actually want to be addressed as ‘Sir’. This is misleading. Man, if you call him by his name, he would probably sideline you and not look at you for the next four to five days. Yes, I’ve experienced this in the very first organization I worked in where I addressed my CEO as ‘Hey, ____!’, I was given a wry grin. The second time I called him by his name, he did not look at me at all. I then realized that I shouldn’t be calling him by his name. So the third time I said, ‘Sir, how are you doing?’, and he gave a wide smile. He made me realize that he wanted to be respected because he is the boss. You are supposed to go and say ‘Can I have a moment with you?’ It’s very <italic>babuish</italic> [bureaucratic], very Indian. I don’t think it will die for the next two centuries or three centuries. You don’t command respect, you demand it. (Male, 30 years, operations manager)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, managers expected employees to follow the due process of grievance handling. Agents’ reliance on the much-publicized open door policy and skip-level meeting practice invited victimization, which was sometimes so severe and prolonged that it left the agents concerned with no choice but to quit the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X11401926">D’Cruz and Noronha, 2010a</xref>). Indeed, managers viewed agents’ use of these policies with a sense of threat and suspicion. In their view, agents were either challenging them or holding them to ransom. Not only was such behaviour interpreted as unprofessional and immature and as indicative of wrong attitudes, but the managerial response to it emerged in the form of a nexus which, in protecting their own group’s collective and individual interests, victimized agents. Undoubtedly, in contrast to what was espoused, employers’ openness to feedback and commitment to employee well-being were questionable, confirming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11401926">Budhwar et al.’s (2006)</xref> observation that management mostly acted as a closed system, probably because democratic management styles are seen as signs of weakness in the Indian context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0143831X11401926">Sinha, 1995</xref>). Thus, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11401926">Cross et al. (2008)</xref> state, there may be various channels in place for employees to express their grievances but the response of these avenues leave much to be desired. Generally, TLs were the only accessible avenue available to agents to address their grievances:</p>

<sec id="section10-0143831X11401926">
<title>The illusion of career advancement</title>
<p>Employer organizations’ promises about career growth, made at the time of recruitment and followed up by various announcements and initiatives during agents’ tenure, included quick promotion opportunities and promotion criteria of objectivity and merit linked to performance.</p>
<p>Managerial interviews in the second phase of the study highlighted caveats on both these counts. Though promotion opportunities for agents existed and were implemented with regular periodicity, the opportunities themselves were limited in number and scope, given the peculiarities of organizational structure as has been earlier demonstrated in call centres elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11401926">Brannan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11401926">Budhwar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X11401926">Deery and Kinnie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143831X11401926">Holman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143831X11401926">Houlihan, 2002</xref>). Indeed, competition for the TL position was intense, given the limited number of posts and the large number of applicants, since the bottom-heavy, flat structure of call centres automatically restricted the number of promotion openings available to agents. To satisfy the agents’ augmented sense of expectation during the process of recruitment, organizations used two strategies: one, to maintain the impression of providing career progression, organizations engaged in horizontal/lateral growth strategies which entailed job enlargement. Second, more layers were added to the agent level with new designations that indicated a move away from being only an agent but did not signify entry into the TL position (the lowest level supervisory job). In that sense, movement was illusory. According to the managers, while agents seeking career growth valued the limited vertical movement afforded by such initiatives, considering these to be stepping stones to supervisory positions, they were disappointed with the long wait involved in moving into the TL level. At the same time, given the number of agents vis-a-vis the number of positions, even these incremental promotion initiatives did not guarantee career growth to all agents:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>The bottom line is that there is no growth for a long period of time. People have to learn to enjoy their jobs. (Male, 29 years, operations manager)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>While objective performance data were consulted, subjectivity played an important role in promotion decisions, operating in three ways. First, a long list of attributes such as being outgoing, mature, motivated, target-oriented and customer-oriented, possessing good communication and social skills, accepting additional responsibilities, displaying openness to feedback, being a team player, exhibiting leadership qualities, respecting superiors and striving for perfection was considered important. However, interpretations of and emphasis given to such behaviour in agents varied across supervisors. Second, adhering to organizational requirements and absorbing work-related strain, without complaining, were considered to be a measure of employee commitment. Third, agents were judged on the basis of the voluntary initiatives, beyond their jobs. These initiatives could relate to undertaking team building activities, sharing best practices, generating new ideas, filling in for TLs, working beyond shift timings with no extra payment, preparing reports for their superiors, conducting in-house courses, helping to reduce attrition, managing the shift, satisfying clients and displaying managerial qualities such as accountability and integrity. Though partaking in these initiatives extended work time and increased job demands, agents’ visibility in the organization, determined by his/her enacted commitment to the organization, extra-role initiatives on the job and relationships with superiors, played a significant role in promotion:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Up to a certain point, it is objective. From the consultant to the next level, it is based on scores. Beyond this, it is very subjective. (Female, 47 years, training manager)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>But cultivating a network of superiors was by far the most critical factor. Most of our managerial participants confirmed that being in the superior’s ‘good books’ was essential for a promotion. They described instances of agents attempting to win over superiors through interactions within and outside the office and then subsequently convincing them of the suitability of their candidature. Such interactions took various forms including doing favours for, carrying tales to and spying on others on behalf of the managers:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>It is like a pyramid, the bottom is vast. As you go up, it keeps tapering off. You keep updated, you keep in groove – what is the interview procedure, what are the next level responsibilities? You network well with the management, this means that you must regularly see your operations manager and say hello to him. (Male, 24 years, team manager)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Managers highlighted that under such circumstances where agents’ networks carried credence, not only were undeserving candidates promoted but also one could predict the successful candidate even prior to the selection process. Such a situation reinforces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11401926">Budhwar et al.’s (2006)</xref> finding that favouritism played a role in appraisal and promotion processes in Indian call centres. Phrases such as ‘buttering’, ‘bootlicking’ and ‘apple polishing’, widely used in Indian organizations to indicate the presence of ingratiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0143831X11401926">Noronha, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0143831X11401926">Pandey and Singh, 1986</xref>), were commonly referred to in the Indian call centre industry:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Like, you know, going behind your manager, joining him for a smoke, joining him for a drink, getting him a packet of cigarettes. So it’s what you do for your bosses – the bootlicking part. (Male, 25 years, operations manager)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, male managers in our study stated that women agents either voluntarily or involuntarily got into relationships with male managers. According to them, good-looking women had an undue advantage in getting ahead by dressing ‘provocatively’ and dating their male bosses. These comments by male participants seem to reflect a work culture that perpetuates gender stereotypes with obvious disadvantages for women. While women managers in our study agreed that this was true in some instances, they cited numerous promotions whose basis did not revolve around gender though other aspects of subjectivity may have been present.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, women managers underscored the gender-based hostility they experienced in supervisory and managerial positions. They elaborated that as agents, gender had no relevance for them, but became important with vertical movement, reflecting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0143831X11401926">Singh and Pandey’s (2005)</xref> observation. Women managers recounted that they were often not taken seriously, having to put in extra effort to prove themselves. Often, their ideas were not accepted and their decisions were criticized and ignored. Further, they were often subject to derogatory comments and chauvinistic jokes in the process, which confirmed the enduring nature of patriarchy in the Indian call centre industry.</p>
<p>Managers attributed the aforementioned emergence of subjectivity to the rapid growth of the call centre industry which allowed people with little managerial skill and talent to occupy key positions. Further, norms of grooming and nurturing future leaders provided superiors with enough scope to pick incapable people who they liked or who did not threaten their position. At times, the need to meet targets resulted in denying promotions to outstanding agents while allowing poorly performing agents to move ahead.</p>
<p>Managers were quick to point out that the limitations placed on career growth, as described earlier, were the primary reasons behind the much-publicized high attrition present in this sector.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0143831X11401926">
<title>The camouflage of workplace ambience</title>
<p>According to managers, the only thing that mattered to organizations was maintaining competitive advantage by meeting client requirements and service level agreements (SLAs; that is, a formalized agreement between clients and organizations to deliver stipulated services to customers that specified the expected process and outcome requirements whose fulfilment was critical to the continuity and/or renewal of the contractual relationship between the two parties). Workplace ambience was relevant only within this context. This is in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0143831X11401926">Ramesh’s (2004)</xref> observation that work and fun are balanced to create a productively docile workforce and that employers’ espoused commitment to employee interests is eclipsed by the primacy of the management, giving agents an illusionary sense of freedom and flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11401926">Alferoff and Knights, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143831X11401926">Houlihan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0143831X11401926">Van den Broek, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Elaborating further, managers pointed out that while the collegial atmosphere of the organization was promoted to energize and de-stress employees so that they could relate to the workplace and their performance could be maximized, fun initiatives held during work days were scheduled such that they rarely interfered with task requirements. Usually, fun activities were held either during breaks or before or after the shift. During the shift, such activities were held only when call volumes were low.</p>
<p>Similar programmes during weekly offs and public or festival holidays were conducted with several purposes in mind. They were means of understanding employees better and using this information to organizational advantage, of assessing employees’ commitment to work and to the organization and attempting to strengthen this, and of facilitating team development. On the flip side, though managers were aware that the team bonding emerging from such activities could be the starting point for collectivization and resistance, they worked to ensure that the attachment between team members served organizational purposes. References to the transactional psychological contract of employment were used to keep collectivist resistance at bay. Managers constantly reminded agents that they were not indispensible and the queues they witnessed during different phases of recruitment were proof of their vulnerability. Further, managers stated that in their view, engaging agents during weekly offs ensured that they got little spare time in which to indulge in any activity that led to union formation. Nonetheless, managers accepted that they had limited control over the fallouts of team bonding activities, especially its influence on attrition. That is, if one member of a team quit the organization, it was not uncommon for other members to follow suit:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Taking the team members out, spending money on them and partying with them is generally called team building. But I believe this does not really help in building teams, agents only enjoy. As long as they enjoy they are fine but this does not mean that they are not looking to change their jobs. These activities do not hold them back. What is the motto of doing all this? What are we achieving? (Male, 36 years, senior service manager)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Participation in organizational leisure activities planned on weekly offs and public holidays was considered to be a measure of agent commitment and played an important role in decisions about agents’ career growth. Attendance at these events was equated with employee commitment and ‘team playing’, and there was considerable pressure to attend, as has also been observed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0143831X11401926">Van den Broek, 2004</xref>). Managers pointed out that under such circumstances, call centre agents felt compelled to attend these programmes. They elaborated that many agents would prefer to spend their spare time as they wished but felt unable to exercise this choice. The situation appears to reflect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0143831X11401926">Spicer and Fleming’s (2004)</xref> stand that culture management was used to push the inside sphere of corporate culture out into other aspects of employees’ lives.</p>

<title>The sacrificial strategy of HR</title>
<p>Undoubtedly, workplace ambience was a means of facilitating the fulfilment of the organization’s agenda and was rarely accorded priority over organizational requirements. Managers’ interviews revealed that so great was the organization’s preoccupation with the completion of SLAs that they worked out targets that were higher than those specified by clients and passed them over to agents to deliver. In this manner, they sought to retain clients as well as compete successfully against other call centres. Employer organizations could get away with this practice not only by holding clients responsible for the stringent parameters expected of agents, linking this to process continuity and renewal, organizational survival and employment opportunities, but also by denying agents access to the organization–client SLA document, citing reasons of protocol. Nonetheless, the escalating strain and declining motivation that agents experience as targets grew increasingly unattainable could not be denied. Thus, as also observed in another context, employees find themselves squeezed between the objectives of the clients, their employer organization and the needs of the customers with whom they interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11401926">Cross et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143831X11401926">Kinnie et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Operational excellence agendas being currently adopted in Indian call centres to sustain India’s cost advantage in the global offshoring industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143831X11401926">NASSCOM, 2006</xref>) only further the employers’ emphasis on performance parameters, turning workplace ambience into a mere rhetoric. Managers spoke of cost cutting measures resulting in limits on recruitment such that agents had to extend work days and work weeks in order to meet higher target levels. Though agents are paid the normal rate of pay for an extended work day, this is in violation of the Shops and Establishment Act, which makes provisions for the payment of twice the normal rate in the case of an employee having to work extra hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143831X11401926">D’Cruz and Noronha, 2010b</xref>). Managers acknowledged that such developments have adverse implications for agents’ performance and well-being. But they admitted that unless agents’ performance deteriorated, nothing was done to address the situation and agents were sometimes working six to seven days a week without a weekly off for two to three weeks. Managers expressed helplessness over the situation, pointing out that their failure to adhere to organizational requirements would cost them their jobs. In their view, top management, in its focus on costs, was losing its humanistic perspective.</p>
<p>The foregoing description of task-related demands explains why recreational and leisure facilities and educational opportunities provided by employers become redundant. Agents had absolutely no time to utilize these facilities. The little spare time they enjoyed was allocated to sleep, family and friends and personal chores:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>We have various sports but agents hardly get time to engage in all that. They prefer to smoke than to play pool. So there is no activity at all. (Female, 31 years, shift manager)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Managerial data leave no doubt that employee well-being, packaged in the garb of workplace ambience, occupies a secondary position, being completely overshadowed by the organization’s preoccupation with competitive advantage. Indeed, workplace ambience is a mere means to this end. To borrow from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143831X11401926">Legge (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0143831X11401926">Storey (1993)</xref>, a hard HRM model is being couched in soft terms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0143831X11401926">
<title>The rhetoric of transparency</title>
<p>Managers’ interviews in the second phase highlighted the absence of transparency in various aspects of employer organizations’ functioning that interfaced with agents’ lives, confirming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0143831X11401926">Sparrow and Budhwar’s (1997)</xref> finding that Indian workplaces lacked open communication. As elsewhere, managers indicated that at the time of recruiting potential employees, organizations do not clarify the specific nature of work to be undertaken by them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11401926">Brannan, 2005</xref>). At this stage, candidates are given the impression that they are being screened by an MNC organization for work in the software sector. It is only after actually joining the organization, at the time of induction training, that employees realize that they will be working as call centre agents. This was particularly true when the call centre industry was establishing itself in India.</p>
<p>Another area where lack of transparency is apparent is that of agents’ remuneration. It is a common practice, at the time of recruitment, to disclose remuneration to agents in terms of cost-to-company (CTC). While CTC is the total amount of expenditure an organization undertakes for an employee in a particular year, including gross pay, variable pay, long-term benefits, leave travel allowance, medical reimbursement, transport, food, other allowances and loyalty bonus, this figure does not translate into the monthly salary that agents receive, which is a much lower amount. However, agents, most of whom are freshers (i.e. young and inexperienced) entering the job market for the first time, do not realize that this is the case until they receive their first salary.</p>
<p>Further, managers elaborated how the basis for agents’ promotions remained unclear to the latter. Though organizations cited objectivity and merit linked to performance as the determinants of promotions, various other factors, as delineated in the theme labelled ‘the illusion of career advancement’, influenced the process. Agents, going by the organization’s specified criteria, were baffled by promotion decisions which were not in keeping with stated norms. Attempting to understand the rationale behind these decisions, some agents would make enquiries with their superiors or with the HR department. Superiors’ and HR managers’ responses, which appeared to be unrelated to the specified criteria, allowed vagueness to surround the issue of promotion. Managers provided illustrations of these replies: mismatch of skills, mismatch between personal objectives and organization goals, failure to meet business objectives, inability to be an effective team player, contribution limited to the scope of work, lack of preparedness for the next level, suitability at current position not a predictor of appropriateness for the next level, excellence in performance not an indicator of leadership potential and strengths in current performance a reinforcer for continuity at the present position. Managers pointed out that superiors’ and HR managers’ creation of such haziness furthered agents’ confusion as to what constituted the real determinants of career growth.</p>
<p>The issue of process status was similarly handled. Employer organizations rarely divulged the truth about process termination, process continuity and process renewal, even when agents sought confirmation of circulating rumours. Further on the same lines, it is worth re-emphasizing that SLAs as jointly agreed upon by the client and the employer organization were never shared with agents. Clearly, the implementation of HCM practices in the Indian call centre industry did not alter the wide power distance integral to the national culture but only reinforced hierarchical structures as noted earlier.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The organizational agenda and the sociocultural milieu are crucial influences on the implementation of HCM practices in Indian call centres. This conclusion is based on interviews conducted in two phases with managers from Indian and MNC third-party international facing call centres in Bangalore and Mumbai. In the first phase, managers eulogized the use of HCM policies and the state-of-the-art infrastructure provided by employer organizations. They stated that the call centres were EEO compliant, career progression was objectively defined, employees received better pay and benefits, hierarchy was absent, grievance handling procedures were quick and easily accessible and fun activities reduced stress and enhanced employee well-being. These popular notions emerging in the first phase were then critically examined in the second phase. Interestingly, in the second phase, managers, while endorsing the positive view, simultaneously highlighted the cultural similarities between their call centres and other Indian organizations in terms of hierarchical structures, highly politicized career progression and lack of transparency. Their view lent support to the crossvergence thesis that there is cultural continuity with change rather than a complete break from the past work systems.</p>
<p>Further, interviews in the second phase revealed the predominance of the organizational agenda embodied in the ‘sacrificial HR strategy’. As a result, the rhetoric of non-hierarchical organizational structures, career advancement, workplace ambience and transparency only exacerbated the existing rate of attrition arising from job design elements. The implementation of HCM practices combined with state-of-the-art infrastructure and planned social activities designed to strengthen employee commitment to organizational goals and reduce incidence of absenteeism and intention to quit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143831X11401926">Barnes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0143831X11401926">Robinson and Morley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0143831X11401926">Schalk and Van Rijckevorsel, 2007</xref>) failed due to lack of any meaningful consultation with employees or their representatives, as observed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0143831X11401926">Russell, 2008</xref>). In fact, in the Indian context, far from consulting employees, HCM practices are advocated as a means to ensure union avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0143831X11401926">Noronha and D’Cruz, 2009b</xref>). We therefore recommend that employers serious about promoting employee well-being and reducing attrition need to take a holistic view of all relevant factors such as job design elements, task-related demands, HCM practices and psychological contract obligations rather than emphasizing only one of these at the expense of ignoring the others.</p>
