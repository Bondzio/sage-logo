<p>Like all good discussions, the topic for this themed section on teaching writing began as a series of conversations, most notably with my colleague across the hall who teaches courses in the English Education program that prepare undergraduates for student teaching in local high schools. These English majors know of course that they will teach literature and therefore must be familiar with current theory, literary terms, and genre studies. They know also that they will teach writing and suspect that doing so involves more than simply assigning a 500-word essay or correcting grammar mistakes. But how exactly do they teach students to write well? How do they structure classroom time? What exercises or teaching strategies have proven most effective? What are their academic goals and expected outcomes?</p>
<p>A second impetus was watching my own students struggle with writing reflections to accompany the document samples they would include in their portfolios. As numerous articles in previous issues of this journal attest, reflections encourage students to think about the skills they’ve acquired and the lessons they’ve learned over the course of a project or, in the case of portfolios, over the course of their academic careers. They can readily select the samples they are most proud of or the assignments they liked the best, but they struggle with defining the professional skills or academic goals behind those particular samples.</p>
<p>The final stimulus for this topic was the recognition that many of today’s students tend to be “just in time” learners. They’ve grown up with the Internet and expect all information to be available at all times, just for the logging in. Although I post an assignment several days prior to its due date, they often don’t access the specifics until the day, or night, before.</p>
<p>And thus began the search for new, or newly refurbished, ways of teaching students to write that would engage them with the process of education and encourage them to take ownership of their own learning. Hence, this topic was born and these two issues generated.</p>
<p>Appropriately, Holly Lawrence leads off this section with a discussion of reflective or self-exploratory writing in the business communication classroom. At first glance, such writing projects that ask students to focus on themselves rather than on their audiences seem out of place in this course. Through a concise but comprehension review of the literature, however, she builds a case for these assignments. Management theorists argue that leaders cannot effectively communicate an organizational vision unless they have thoroughly examined their own personal visions. And composition theorists argue that reflection is an essential part of the cognitive process that translates education into knowledge. Following this literature review, Lawrence provides several examples of business communication exercises that encourage reflection, beginning with the personal mission statement as the “quintessential” reflective document.</p>
<p>Following the thread of this discussion on reflection, Kenneth Price describes his adaption of the portfolio in a methods course for graduate students, teaching assistants, and adjunct faculty new to the discipline of business communication. Through the portfolio genre, he asks them to compile a body of knowledge about teaching business communication that includes, specifically, a statement of teaching philosophy, course content guides, an annotated syllabus, lesson plans, and assignment rubrics. These portfolios codify course content and quantify outcomes; as such, they are also valuable tools for both program assessment and for individual peer evaluation. Uploaded to a course management website, these completed portfolios provide a “scaffold” that anyone teaching the course can build on.</p>
<p>In the third article, Mascle tackles one of the most common problems that plague most, if not all, writers: “writing apprehension.” Understandably, students who lack confidence or feel anxiety about their ability to write will avoid situations that require writing, including courses that could help them develop skills. Compounding the problem are approaches to writing that stress correctness or focus on errors rather than emphasizing writing as a process. To build writing confidence among her students, Mascle suggests four strategies, the first of which is “mastery experience.” Students need success to bolster their confidence, and a “scaffolding” assignment that builds on previous work can do just that without adding to either the instructor’s or the students’ workload. The second strategy involves models that they can study and compare with their own writing, from textbooks, the workplace, and other students. The third strategy is positive feedback and constructive criticism, from a variety of sources. To this end, she provides guidelines to structure feedback from peer review sessions. Finally, she advocates personal journals and reflective writing assignments to ease students’ apprehension about writing.</p>
<p>In today’s global economy, college graduates, at both the undergraduate and MBA levels, often lack the communication skills that employers require. Although most possess the technical expertise or discipline-specific knowledge that employers require, they may not have mastered the writing and communication skills necessary for success in the professional world. In the third article of this section, author Lorelei Ortiz suggests simple exercises that assess a student’s mastery of basic composition strategies, grammatical correctness, sentence structure, and technical issues. These short, uncomplicated exercises also offer instructional flexibility. Used as a short in-class exercise or quiz, they offer communal learning. Assigned as homework or uploaded to a course management site, they provide personal self-assessment and individualized learning. They are also flexible; instructors can easily adapt them to meet specific course and student requirements.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the importance of job search documents in a business communication course, authors Huiling and Xin Ding propose a multimodal project that includes, in addition to the traditional resume and cover letter, a mock oral interview, video resume analysis, and peer critique of social media profiles. Because students are often inexperienced with the job search process, they may not fully understand the rhetorical complexities of this process; when asked to revise or update their resumes and letters, they tend to tinker with the format rather than reorganize or rewrite. To encourage serious revision of these documents, the authors ask students to present their qualifications in a 30-second introduction to the class who function as interviewers. From this exercise, students quickly learn that narratives can highlight their unique qualifications and that they need to select experiences for their relevance to the interviewers. As part of this unit, students also select and critique online video resumes, noting both lapses in presentation skills, such as mumbling or lack of eye contact, and in content, such as unsupported claims. Finally, they examine the professional personas projected through social media sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn. Of all the components in this assignment, the authors found that the 30-second introduction best achieved their goals. Through peer review and group feedback, this assignment helped students see for themselves the need to revise their job search documents, without relying just on input from their instructors.</p>
<p>All the articles in this themed section focus, in one way or another, on engaging students with their own learning and taking ownership of their education. We hope that they will also engage the journal’s readers in more conversations, like the one I had with my colleague across the hall that started it all.</p>
