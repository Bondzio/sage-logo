<abstract>
<p>Participation at university-sponsored summer sport camps is popular among youth athletes; however, there is a dearth of information to describe the injuries/illnesses experienced by camp participants. Data from a university-sponsored sport camp program from 2008 to 2011 were accessed retrospectively. The sport camp program had approximately 80 camps for 28 sports over 12 weeks annually. Male and female participants were 10 to 17 years old. Athletic trainers maintained medical documentation and provided medical referrals. Referrals were made for 9.9% (n = 478) of all injuries/illnesses. Emergency department referrals were made for 2.9% of injuries/illnesses. University health services received 42.5% of referrals. There were 1.1 referrals per 100 participants. Boys comprised 60.7% of referrals. Rugby had the highest referral rate—5.0 per 100 participants. These data help increase physician preparedness and guide the delivery of sports medicine services for related sport camp programs as a means to improve quality of care delivered to participants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many youth athletes attend university-sponsored sport camp programs each summer. Given that sport participation presents a risk for injury, sport camps may hire athletic trainers (ATs) to provide sports health care services. When an injury/illness is deemed to be outside of an AT’s scope of practice, a physician referral may be warranted. Description of the medical facilities to which participants are referred may help guide the delivery of sports medicine services provided by physicians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813493830">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previous camp studies have focused on recreational camps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813493830">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813493830"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813493830">4</xref></sup> and camps for children with specific medical conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813493830">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813493830"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813493830">7</xref></sup> The health care needs of such campers are likely different from those of youth athletes at sport camps. Therefore, the research findings cannot be appropriately generalized to assist sport camp health care providers or administrators who are interested in incorporating evidence-based medicine into their programs to prevent injuries/illnesses and improve on the quality of care provided to camp participants. Furthermore, such findings are not directly applicable to physicians who may be treating sport camp participants either directly referred from camp or after they return home from camp. Though several sport camp studies have been conducted, their findings are limited in scope and clinical implication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813493830">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813493830"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813493830"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813493830">11</xref></sup> Prior sport camp studies have focused on a single sport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813493830">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813493830"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813493830"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813493830">11</xref></sup>; moreover, 2 of the investigations examined skin lesions exclusively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813493830">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813493830">10</xref></sup> Although the studies yielded useful information, they are very specific and are only representative of a small sample of sport camps.</p>
<p>Universities often sponsor sport camp programs for a variety of boys’ and girls’ sports. The authors found that all 12 Division I universities participating in the same athletic conference as the university used in this study sponsor summer sport camp programs. Selection of 1 conference, containing colleges/universities from the same states as the university in this study, from Division I-AA, Division II, and Division III revealed that all 8, 16, and 11 colleges/universities, respectively, sponsor summer sport camp programs. The 14 public universities within the State System of Higher Education sponsor summer sport camp programs.</p>
<p>Participants can include children and adolescents with athletic abilities that can range from novice to elite. The programs may have camps that emphasize particular skill sets for sports, such as a kicking camp for football or a starts and turns camp for swimming. The health care needs of participants vary by sport as well as by gender. High school–based sport epidemiology studies have shown differences in injuries and injury risk among sports and between genders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922813493830">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922813493830">13</xref></sup> The age of participants can also influence the risk for injuries and the injuries incurred.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813493830">14</xref></sup> In addition to sport-related injuries, the health care staff for sport camps, including the physicians to whom participants are referred, are responsible for assessing and treating illnesses, which may be independent of sport participation.</p>
<p>This study was conducted at a university with a sport camp program that had a broad representation of sports and participant ages and athletic abilities. The aim was to describe the physician referral profile for the sport camp program. Such a description can help guide clinical practice for physicians treating injured/ill sport camp participants as a means to improve quality of care delivered to injured/ill participants because there is a dearth of information on the topic. An appreciation can be gained for the unique health care needs of each sport and both genders represented.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0009922813493830">
<title>Injury/Illness, Referral, and Exposure Definitions</title>
<p>For injuries/illnesses to be included in the study, the following 4 criteria were required: (1) the injury/illness occurred while the participant was attending a sport camp, (2) the participant sought sports health care services from a camp AT or camp athletic training student (ATS), (3) an AT or ATS documented a minimum of 1 independent variable (sport, gender, and year) and 1 dependent variable (body part and injury/illness type), and (4) an AT or ATS specifically documented the injury/illness he or she assumed the participant to have, for example, abrasion, muscle strain, concussion, and heat illness.</p>
<p>A medical referral required explicit documentation in the camp medical referral logs and/or the camp injury/illness log books to be included in the study. Cases that did not indicate a participant’s sport or the medical facilities to which a referral was made were also included. Exposure was calculated in participant-days. The camp participant enrollment for each sport camp was multiplied by the number of days the camp was held. For example, a 5-day-long camp with 200 participants had an exposure of 1000 participant-days.</p>

<sec id="section4-0009922813493830">
<title>Data Source and Design</title>
<p>This study was part of a larger descriptive retrospective epidemiological study, which was approved by the university’s institutional review board. The study was performed at a university-sponsored summer sport camp program. Each summer, the program conducted approximately 80 camps for 28 different sports over a 12-week period. The majority of camps were overnight camps—95.5% (n = 298)—though 4.4% (n = 14) were day camps. Each camp held an average of three 2-hour instructional sessions per day. During the 4-year period of the study (2008–2011) 44 499 participants attended the camp program over 1383 camp days. The numbers of camp days and participants, by sport, are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922813493830">Table 1</xref>. Male and female participants ranged in age from 10 through 17 years. Each summer, the camp program’s Director of Sports Health Care (GLV) hired approximately 20 ATs and 40 ATSs to provide sports health care services to injured/ill participants, allowing for substantively accurate data recording.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922813493830">15</xref></sup></p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Each sport camp was assigned an injury/illness log book for documentation. A separate log book was maintained to record all instances of medical referrals in which a camp AT transported a participant to and from a physician’s office or hospital. There were 3 medical facilities to which the majority of referrals were made. University health services, located on campus, received participants who were ill or required wound care. Participants who sustained orthopaedic injuries were referred to a university-affiliated center for sports medicine. Finally, participants were referred to a local hospital’s emergency department for injuries/illnesses requiring immediate evaluation and treatment, such as displaced fractures. Emergency department referrals were also made during nonhours of operation for the center for sports medicine and university health services.</p>
<p>The log books from 2008 through 2011 were accessed retrospectively for data collection. The injury/illness log books required that a participant’s name, the date, physical examination findings, and the injury/illness be recorded. Any instance in which a participant sought sports health care services was documented. For the purpose of this study, only the overall injury/illness rate was calculated. In the medical referral log book, ATs recorded a participant’s name and camp, the date, and the medical facility to which a participant was referred and transported. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922813493830">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates medical referral log book entries. The independent variables were camp participant gender and sport. The dependent variable of interest was medical facility referral. All documented referrals were entered into an electronic spreadsheet for data analyses.</p>

<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>SPSS 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY) and Epi Info 7 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA) were used for statistical analyses. Frequency analysis was performed on all variables of interest. Sports were categorized as noncontact, limited contact, or contact, per the American Academy of Pediatric Council on Sports Medicine and Fitness’s classification of sports according to contact,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922813493830">16</xref></sup> as individual or team in nature and as being played indoors or outdoors, as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922813493830">Table 1</xref>. The referral rates per 100 camp participants were calculated for all independent variables. Referral rates were also calculated per 10 000 participant-days. χ<sup>2</sup> Tests were calculated to investigate associations between medical facility referral and sport categories and between medical facility referral and participant gender. A probability level of <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was set a priori to indicate statistical significance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Only 1 large-scale epidemiological study, named the Healthy Camp Study, has examined injuries and illnesses at overnight and day summer camps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813493830">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813493830">3</xref></sup> Conclusions from these data, however, may not be able to be appropriately generalized to sport camps. The camps were recreational camps. The physical activities offered, such as canoeing or horseback riding, were recreational in nature and did not provide the instructional athletic environment commonly found at university-sponsored summer sport camp programs.</p>
<p>The Healthy Camp Study found that 60.1% of all camper injuries required off-site medical referrals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813493830">2</xref></sup> This is considerably higher than our injury/illness referral frequency of 9.9%. The health care personnel most commonly on-site at the Healthy Camp study camps were nurses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813493830">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813493830">4</xref></sup> Their scope of practice to provide care to campers may differ from that of ATs. In consideration of how often ATs triage, evaluate, and treat injured/ill persons during athletic participation, they may have more experience determining when a participant requires a medical referral, such as when utilizing the Ottawa Ankle Rules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813493830">17</xref></sup> Also, the structure inherent to the sport camp’s sports health care program, which included the presence of ATs and/or ATSs at all instructional athletic sessions and the presence of ATSs in the camp dormitories overnight, may have allowed for appropriate assessment of injuries/illnesses over time.</p>
<p>Though several small sport camp studies have been conducted, their generalizability is limited to the sports, participant ages, and participant skill levels represented. Hinton et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813493830">11</xref></sup> examined boys’ and girls’ lacrosse camp injuries over a 3-year period. Participants were 15 to 18 years old, with aspirations of playing collegiate lacrosse. ATs served as the injury recorders. Detailed information was provided regarding injury rates, affected body parts, injury type, and mechanism of injury; however, physician referral was not presented or addressed.</p>
<p>Three related sport camp studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813493830">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813493830"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813493830">10</xref></sup> have been from the same “high-intensity” summer wrestling camp program for boys 13 to 18 years old. The camp was conducted over 28 days, whereas most sport camps last 1 to 7 days. Two of these associated wrestling camp studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813493830">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813493830">10</xref></sup> have focused exclusively on herpes gladiatorum outbreaks, secondary to previous camp outbreaks. Coincidently, the third study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813493830">8</xref></sup> examined the emergency department use from the camp by accessing hospital medical records and camp physician records. Hendrickson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813493830">8</xref></sup> found that 30% of the participants were treated at the emergency department. The authors concluded that only 50% of the emergency department visits required emergency department care. Accordingly, Hendrickson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813493830">8</xref></sup> suggested the development of initial assessment protocols, given that most injuries and illnesses do not require emergency department care.</p>
<p>Because many sport injury epidemiology studies have been conducted at the high school level,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922813493830">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922813493830">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922813493830">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922813493830"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922813493830">20</xref></sup> the findings are likely not representative of the injury experience in sport camps. Athlete exposure is commonly calculated using athlete practices or athlete competitions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813493830">1</xref></sup> A single practice or competition session is held per day in organized sports, although multiple practice sessions are held during preseason training. This differs from the sport camp setting, where there may be 3 instructional sessions daily, in addition to recreational activities. Describing exposure in participant-days allowed for the inclusion of all participant injuries/illnesses, those occurring during sport participation, and those occurring during recreational activities or “free” time. Referencing the high school sport injury rates may be misleading for the sport camp population.</p>
<p>The nature of competitive high school athletic competition differs from that of instructional camp sessions. When instruction is the focus, skill development is emphasized over winning, which affects injury risk. Furthermore, during practices and competitions, all members of a team do not have the same exposure, playing for different amounts of time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813493830">1</xref></sup> At sport camps, often, all participants actively participate throughout all sessions, increasing the risk for injury. Finally, high school athletes typically range in age from 14 through 18 years. The injury, and subsequent medical referral, experience of athletes younger than 14 years differs from those of older athletes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813493830">14</xref></sup> Consequently, it would not be appropriate to reference a high school study when determining the sports health care needs of a 10-year-old child.</p>
<p>In addition to the high school studies, which often include the injuries for which ATs provide care, epidemiologists have examined youth sport injuries treated by physicians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813493830">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922813493830"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922813493830"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922813493830"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922813493830">25</xref></sup> These studies have included sport activities in which the participants were not in an instructional environment and/or supervised by coaches, such as at a playground or at a skate park.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813493830">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922813493830">22</xref></sup> Therefore, the injuries incurred during recreational sport activities may differ from those that occur with proper adult supervision. Commonly, researchers access hospital emergency department records to describe youth sport injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813493830">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922813493830"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922813493830"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922813493830"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922813493830">25</xref></sup> Harris et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922813493830">24</xref></sup> examined a Canadian minor ice hockey association’s youth ice hockey injuries treated at 7 emergency departments. The injury rates, stratified by the participants’ ages from 9 through 15 years, ranged from 21.8 to 135.8 injuries per 1000 players.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922813493830">24</xref></sup> Kukaswadia et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922813493830">25</xref></sup> conducted a similar ice hockey study, with participants ranging in age from 7 through 14 years. The emergency department injury rates for 2 hospitals ranged from 4.8 to 148.8 injuries per 1000 players. These studies present 2 major differences from our sport camp study. Overall, our study had 3.1 emergency department referrals per 1000 camp participants. As mentioned previously, this low referral rate may be associated with the presence of ATs and ATSs. Also, describing the sport-related injuries treated at emergency departments only does not capture the entire injury experience. For both ice hockey studies, the injuries treated at other medical facilities, such as at a primary care facility like university health services, were not accounted for.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922813493830">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922813493830">25</xref></sup> Describing all medical referrals from the summer sport camp program provides a comprehensive description of the sport camp injuries/illnesses requiring physician care in multiple settings.</p>
<p>Despite the great volume of participants in this study, only 2.9% of all sport camp injuries/illnesses yielded emergency department referral. This includes referrals made during the weekend, when other medical facilities were not open, and cases in which participants’ parents requested emergency department referrals when injuries/illnesses did not require emergency care. The low percentage may reflect the ability of ATs to manage injuries/illnesses on-site. The sport camp program in this study had an explicit mechanism by which to triage participants. As previously discussed, the ATs had several options when determining whether and where to refer an injured/ill participant and selected the most appropriate facility for each injury/illness.</p>
<p>Boys comprised a larger proportion of contact sport participants than girls—63.4% as compared to 33.7%. This excluded rugby and diving, which were coeducational camps for which enrollment by gender was not available. The nature of contact sports, as compared with limited-contact sports or noncontact sports, increases the risk of sustaining injuries, such as concussions or fractures, which require medical referral. A categorization of collision sports can also be made.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922813493830">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922813493830">27</xref></sup> A main objective of collision sports is for participants to purposefully make physical contact with one another; therefore, significant collisions are unavoidable. For our sport camp program, football, boys’ ice hockey, girls’ ice hockey, boys’ lacrosse, rugby, and wrestling represented collision sports. Whereas 70.0% of male participants participated in collision sports, only 4.9% of female participants did, again, excluding rugby which was coeducational.</p>
<p>Though musculoskeletal injuries commonly occur secondary to athletic participation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922813493830">28</xref></sup> the percentage of referrals requiring medical attention at university health services indicated the frequency with which general medical conditions occurred. Though illnesses may not be directly related to athletic participation, they occurred while participants were at sport camps and required referrals. Therefore, ATs and physicians should be prepared to recognize and/or treat illnesses in addition to injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813493830">3</xref></sup> The impact of illness recognition is great because illnesses can affect a camp participant’s sport participation status. For example, there is a risk for splenic rupture in the presence of splenomegaly, secondary to mononucleosis, during sport activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922813493830">29</xref></sup> This warrants recognition, physician referral, and appropriate management, which includes being withheld from contact sport participation.</p>
<p>Though best practices for a university-sponsored youth sport camp program has not yet been addressed in the literature, guidelines have been established for recreational camps. In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics published a policy statement, “Creating healthy camp experiences.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922813493830">30</xref></sup> When preparing for camp, it is recommended that “camps should have written health policies and protocols that have been reviewed and approved by a physician . . . tailored to the training and scope of practice of the on-site health care providers and developed with the input of those providers.”<sup>P796</sup> For the university-sponsored youth summer sport camp program used in this study, a collaborative effort among the university’s Director of Athletic Medicine (WJS), the sport camp program’s Director of Sports Health Care (GLV), and camp administrators allowed for the establishment and enforcement of such policies and procedures throughout the time period of the study. The training of the ATs and ATSs and state practice acts were major determinants of the policies and procedures relative to providing sports health care services to injured/ill participants. The program had established relationships with the medical facilities previously mentioned as well as with a dental practice. These relationships between physicians and ATs helped promote the delivery of quality health care and ensure participant safety.</p>
<p>This study presented with several limitations. ATs were not formally trained as recorders for the study; although, documentation is a required competency in the profession and related education program, and ATs have adequate documentation experience to record injuries/illnesses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922813493830">15</xref></sup> The retrospective nature of the study affected the quality of data collected. The desired level of detail, such as participant age, suspected diagnosis, or physician diagnosis, was not captured. Key variables were missing for 15.9% of all cases. Given that mechanism of injury/illness was not recorded, exposure was not calculated in participant training sessions, and comparisons could not be made between sport-related and non-sport-related injuries/illnesses. Calculation of exposure in participant-days assumed that all enrolled participants were present at camp and had the same exposure. The assumption does not account for factors affecting exposure, such as participants who may have left camp and returned home prior to the end of camp. Finally, a participant’s injury/illness may have required more than 1 referral—for example, a physician at University Health Services referring a participant to the emergency department. Cases such as this were not reflected in the sport camp medical documentation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>These data may help improve preparedness and guide clinical practice for treating youth sport-camp-related injuries/illnesses for pediatricians, sports medicine physicians, university health services primary care physicians, orthopaedists, and emergency medicine physicians affiliated with a university-sponsored sport camp program. These physicians have the potential to treat injuries/illnesses from sport camps. Familiarity of injury/illness trends by sport and by gender as well as the unique physical demands of various sports can aid in diagnosis, treatment, and management of injuries/illnesses, inclusive of determining the appropriate sport participation status. Participation status ranges from full participation to no participation. The establishment of these professional relationships between summer sport camp sports health care personnel and local medical facilities can be beneficial for both camp participants and physicians. Future research endeavors should seek to describe the specific medical diagnoses and mechanisms of injury associated with physician referrals.</p>
