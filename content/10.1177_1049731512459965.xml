<abstract>
<p>Objectives: The purpose of the current study is to examine whether the duration of Head Start participation is associated with a child’s weight and height. Method: The study employs a secondary analysis of 2,690 Head Start participants, 891 who entered at age 3 and enrolled for 1 year, 1,125 who entered at age 4 and stayed for 1 year, and 674 who entered at age 3 and stayed for 2 years. A logistic regression correctly classified the obesity probability (82.8%). Results: Early entry age and a longer duration in Head Start is associated with a lower obesity rate. Conclusion: Head Start should accept younger children and have them stay for a longer duration, particularly for children in high risk families.</p>

<p>Head Start has served children from birth to age 5, providing a comprehensive program for low-income children including health services. As a comprehensive preschool program, nutrition is a major part of Head Start’s mission and objectives. According to Head Start program performance standards, there are a number of mandates each Head Start program must follow to ensure proper nutrition. The purpose of the current study is to examine whether the enrollment duration of Head Start is associated with Head Start children’s nutritional outcomes. Specific study questions are: (1) Do Head Start children’s baseline characteristics differ depending on children’s entry age and enrollment duration? (2) Do children’s nutritional outcomes measured by Body Mass Index (BMI) differ among the three groups? (3) Do these associations differ depending on the number of family risk factors?</p>
<p>Obesity is a growing social problem in the United States. According to the obesity society, obesity is the most prevalent, fatal, chronic, and relapsing disorder of the 21st century (2009). It is also the country’s number one cause of mortality, morbidity, disability, health utilization, and health care costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049731512459965">The Obesity Society, 2009</xref>). Within the overall problem of obesity, the specific concern is the raising obesity rates among youth in the United States. Nearly 17% of children aged 2–19 in 2007 were obese, which was double the percentage recorded in the 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731512459965">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2010</xref>). Currently in the United States, one in seven preschoolers from low-income households are obese (CDC, 2010), pointing to the early onset of the obesity epidemic. In recent years, there has been an increase in obese preschoolers. This problem goes beyond U.S. borders as a worldwide problem, which has increased over the past three decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731512459965">Han, Lawlor, &amp; Kimm, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, obesity in childhood years is likely to persist into adulthood, with increased risk of future adult morbid obesity. In particular, childhood obesity persisting into adulthood creates a risk for cardiovascular and metabolic abnormalities and for increased morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049731512459965">Reilly &amp; Kelly, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049731512459965">Xanthakos &amp; Inge, 2007</xref>). While all these studies vary in their design, it is apparent that an obese child is more likely to be at risk of dangerous physical and psychological consequences that are costly to their health and to the health care system. The health concerns of childhood obesity have both short- and long-term consequences. The consequences of obesity reach beyond the increasingly high-economic costs and dangerous health risks.</p>
<p>Studies also indicated that obesity is a result of interplay among behavior, environment, genetic, and other various factors such as ethnic origin, socioeconomic status, parenting style, neighborhood safety, food availability, and exposure to media (CDC, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731512459965">Han, Lawlor, &amp; Kimm, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049731512459965">Lawrence, Hazlett, &amp; Hightower, 2010</xref>). Higher childhood obesity rates are found among Hispanic, African, and Native American minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731512459965">Anderson &amp; Whitaker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049731512459965">The Obesity Society, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049731512459965">Whitaker &amp; Orzol, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731512459965">Johnson, Mclnnes, and Shinogle (2006)</xref> indicated that an overweight child is most likely to be a young African American or Hispanic male who falls in the lowest income category. Furthermore, his mother is more likely to be younger, less educated, and unmarried. Additionally, qualifying for federal food assistance for low-income families and living in costly cities may contribute to childhood obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731512459965">Kimbro &amp; Rigby, 2010</xref>). Overweight children have limited access to affordable healthy food choices and live in neighborhoods with unsafe playgrounds, which decrease their outdoor physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731512459965">Isaacs &amp; Swartz, 2010</xref>). Moreover, low-income communities generally have built environments promoting energy intake without enough opportunities for energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512459965">Oreskovic, Kuhlthau, Romm, &amp; Perrin, 2009</xref>). This relates to the problem of low-income and minority children having access to fewer facilities, which decreases physical activity among residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731512459965">Gordon-Larsen, Nelson, Page, &amp; Popkin, 2006</xref>). Children are also bombarded by media ads for unhealthy food and portion sizes, adding in the creation of an “obesogenic” environment.</p>
<p>The federally funded preschool program, Head Start, addresses childhood obesity, specifically targeting children who have family and other risk factors, including lowincome. According to Head Start program performance standards, Head Start should provide snacks and meals with at least one third of a child’s daily nutritional needs for part-day classrooms and one-half to two third of a child’s daily nutritional needs for full-day students. Most Head Start programs use funds from United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Consumer Services Child Nutrition Programs as their primary source of payment for meal services, often through the Child and Adult Food Care Program. A nutritionist at each site actively plans and organizes the menus for children, taking into consideration special needs, cultural differences, and food allergies. The nutritionist is also available to assist the family with any nutritional needs they may have. Additionally, within 45 days of enrollment the nutritionist performs on-site screenings that include the weight and height of each child to screen for growth patterns which may be of nutritional concern (US Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049731512459965">USDHHS, ACF], 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Head Start additionally focuses on mealtime socialization of students. It is critical for preschoolers to develop “healthful nutrition attitudes and eating habits”; the attitudes of parents surrounding mealtime and mealtime behaviors impact how a child develops these attitudes and habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731512459965">Gable &amp; Lutz, 2001</xref>). In order to support and teach proper eating habits, Head Start creates a developmentally appropriate mealtime environment. Some nutrition socialization practices include encouraging mealtime manners and providing structured and predictable mealtimes when at school. Head Start programs also have family style meals with classroom students, staff, and volunteers to help develop and model mealtime manners and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049731512459965">USDHHS, ACF, 2006a</xref>). Head Start also focuses on the physical activity aspect of weight. Many Head Start classrooms use <italic>I Am Moving, I Am Learning</italic> (IMIL), which is a proactive approach for addressing childhood obesity in Head Start children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049731512459965">USDHHS, ACF, 2012</xref>). Additionally, Head Start performance standards promote physical development of students that support the devolvement of both gross and fine motor skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049731512459965">USDHHS, ACF, 2006b</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the importance of the various Head Start curriculum components, few studies have evaluated Head Start’s impact on children’s obesity problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731512459965">Gooze, Hughes, Finkelstein, &amp; Whitaker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731512459965">Hughes, Gooze, Finkelstein, &amp; Whitaker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049731512459965">Whitaker, Gooze, Hughes, &amp; Finkelstein, 2009</xref>). Hughes, Gooze, Finkelstein, and Whitaker (2010) identified the barriers to obesity prevention such as time, money, knowledge, and cultural beliefs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049731512459965">Whitaker et al. (2009</xref>) asked Head Start program directors by telephone, what their obesity prevention practices and environments are. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731512459965">Gooze et al. (2010</xref>) also surveyed how the obesity prevention program has been implemented in the Head Start program. The most representative Head Start evaluation study, the National Head Start Impact Study, does not include children’s obesity outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049731512459965">Puma, Bell, Cook, &amp; Heid, 2010</xref>), although it includes the coverage of medical insurance status. Students in Head Start were reported to have a greater risk for not meeting the recommended dietary allowances for several key vitamins and minerals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731512459965">Bucholz, Desai, &amp; Rosenthal, 2011</xref>). Since one third of the children entering Head Start are already overweight or obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731512459965">Hughes et al., 2010</xref>), Head Start needs research examining the association between Head Start and its childhood obesity rate.</p>
<p>Head Start enrollment duration is an important aspect in examining Head Start children’s obesity. Early childhood educators, social workers, psychologists, and other policy-based professionals have recently suggested the need for a new research agenda to analyze the optimal timing and duration of Head Start program participation. Of particular importance is the question of dosage effects, that is, who receives the most benefits and under what conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049731512459965">Reynolds, 2004</xref>)? There have been many nationally conducted Head Start evaluation studies on the dosage effects of the program. The Head Start Impact Study (Puma, Bell, Cook, Heid, &amp; Lopez, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731512459965">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049731512459965">Puma et al., 2010</xref>), the National Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Study (Love et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049731512459965">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049731512459965">Raikes et al., 2006</xref>), and the Head Start Family and Child Experience Survey (FACES, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731512459965">Mathematical Policy Research, Inc. 2007</xref>) collected data on outcome variables and examined the impact of children’s ages of entry into the program. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731512459965">Puma, Bell, Cook, Heid, and Lopez (2006</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049731512459965">Puma, Bell, Cook, and Heid (2010</xref>) found that Head Start’s impact on academic and health outcomes was more significant for children who entered Head Start at age 3 than those who enrolled at age 4. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731512459965">Lee (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049731512459965">2011</xref>) also found positive impacts of early entry and longer enrollment duration on children’s academic outcomes.</p>
<p>The examination of Head Start on children’s obesity needs to consider family risk factors affecting children’s daily lives. The Head Start program was founded based upon ecological theory that examines human development as a complex inter-relationship among self, family, and community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731512459965">Bronfenbrenner, 1979</xref>). Family and contextual factors have shown their impacts on Head Start and other intervention programs. More “compensatory effects,” also known as the <italic>lost resources hypothesis</italic>, have been documented for socioeconomically disadvantaged groups participating in intervention programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731512459965">Burchinal, Peisner-Feinber, Bryant, &amp; Clifford, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512459965">Caughy, DiPietro, &amp; Strobino, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731512459965">Lee, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049731512459965">National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Early Child Care Research Network, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049731512459965">Yoshikawa, 1995</xref>). Children raised in environmentally at-risk families—living in poverty, with low maternal education, or with single parents—benefited more from interventions than those who had more advantageous environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731512459965">Field, Widmayer, Stringer, &amp; Ignatoff, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731512459965">Lee, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049731512459965">Olds, &amp; Kitzman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049731512459965">Ramey &amp; Ramey, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049731512459965">Richardson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049731512459965">Yoshikawa,1995</xref>). The consideration of family risk factors in obesity outcomes is particularly important since obesity is more prevalent for children with family risk factors.</p>
<p>Finally, Head Start participants may have preexisting differences in baseline characteristics, due to reasons why children enroll in Head Start at age 3 rather than at age 4. These baseline variables also affect Head Start’s impact on children, and so several baseline variables were controlled statistically in order to extract the unique associations between Head Start and child obesity outcomes. Child’s gender and ethnicity and program characteristics (morning-, afternoon-, or full-day program) and geographical location of the program are considered in this study.</p>
<p>Based on data collected by local Head Start classroom, the proposed study examines some evidence of when and how long children should enroll in the program in order to enhance children’s nutritional outcomes. Specific study questions are (1) Do baseline characteristics differ among the three groups of Head Start children? One group is children who entered Head Start at age 3 and maintained enrollment for 1 year, the second group is for children who entered at age 4 and stayed for 1 year, and the third group is for children who entered at age 3 and stayed for 2 years. (2) Do children’s nutritional outcomes measured by BMI differ among the three groups? (3) Do these effects differ depending on the number of family risk factors?</p>

<sec id="section2-1049731512459965">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>This secondary data analysis was based on data collected from 60 local Head Start classrooms. Each year, approximately 1,400 Head Start children enroll in the Head Start program across four counties. The current study used 2-year cohort data collected during 2006–2007 (<italic>n</italic>= 1,430) and 2007–2008 (<italic>n</italic> = 1,260). Among 2,690 children who participated in Head Start and provided complete data, 891 had entered Head Start at age 3 and enrolled in Head Start for 1 year (Group 1), 1,125 had entered at age 4 and stayed for 1 year (Group 2), and 674 had enrolled for 2 years (Group 3 entered at age 3 in a previous year and continued to be in the program). Children whose BMI were greater than or equal to 5th percentile scores but less than 85th percentile scores (<italic>n</italic> = 1,718, 64.9%) and those whose BMI was greater than or equal to 95th percentile scores (<italic>n</italic> = 356, 13.5%) were included in the final analysis, with a final sample of 2,074 children. The current research was exempt review from the University Institute of Review Board because it is conducting a preexisting secondary data analysis. It did not meet the definition of systematic research, which includes research development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.</p>

<title>Children’s BMI</title>
<p>Children’s weight and height were measured during a general health checkup. The BMI percentile scores were calculated based on gender and age. Based on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049731512459965">CDC, 2012</xref>), children were classified into four groups based on national norms: (1) underweight for those whose BMI was less than 5th percentile scores, (2) healthy weight children whose BMI was greater than or equal to the 5th percentile but less than the 85th percentile, (3) overweight children whose BMI was greater than or equal to the 85th percentile but less than the 95th percentile, and (4) obese children whose BMI was greater than or equal to 95th percentile scores.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049731512459965">
<title>Number of family risk factors</title>
<p>The number of family risk factors was measured using indicators developed by the State Department of Education. It included 15 items: Single parent, unemployed parent, teenage parent, parental loss by divorce or death, incarcerated parent, frequent moving, non-English-speaking, low parental school achievement, diagnosed family problems, food insufficiency, parental substance abuse, violent parental temperament, child’s special need status, long-term illness, and abuse and neglect. Following a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049731512459965">Lee, 2011</xref>), children with four or more family risk factors were classified as the high risk group (<italic>n</italic> = 904, 34%).</p>

<sec id="section7-1049731512459965">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>In order to know the difference in baseline variables (research question 1), a one-way-analysis of variance (ANOVA) test compared baseline characteristics among those who entered at age 3 and enrolled for 1 year (Group 1), those who entered at age 4 and enrolled 1 year (Group 2), and those who entered at age 3 and stayed for 2 years (Group 3). Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine whether the probability of children having obese weight differed depending on the enrollment duration. Based on the definition of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049731512459965">CDC (2012)</xref>, healthy weight children (BMI ≥ 5th percentile &lt; 85th percentile) were recorded as 0 and obese children (BMI ≥ 95th percentile) were recorded as 1. Children who were extremely underweight (BMI &lt; 5th percentile) and moderately overweight children (BMI ≥ 85th percentile &lt; 95th percentile) were excluded from the analyses. After controlling for all baseline characteristics, a family risk factor variable was entered into the regression, followed by the entry age or enrollment duration (Groups 1 and 2; Group 3 was the reference group for research question 2) and the interactions between group status and the family risk factors (research question 3).</p>

<title>Findings for Research Question 2: Associations Between Group Status and Children’s Obesity Outcomes</title>
<p>Logistic regression was conducted to determine whether group status (entry age and enrollment duration of Head Start) predicts the probability of children’s obesity and whether family risk factors moderate the associations of Head Start enrollment and children’s weight outcomes after controlling for baseline variables. The overall model of predictors was statistically reliable in distinguishing between a healthy and obese status for a child’s weight outcome (−2 log likelihood = 1873.4, chi-square (<italic>df</italic> = 14) = 28.43, <italic>p</italic>&lt; .05). The model correctly classified for the obesity probability (82.8%).</p>
<p>Results indicate that, compared to White children, children from other ethnicities (excluding Black and Hispanic) are more likely to be obese (<italic>b</italic> = .38, Wald = 3.83, odds ratio (OR) = 1.46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Black and Hispanic children did not significantly differ from White children. Children who attend afternoon programs are more likely to be obese than those who attend morning programs (<italic>b</italic> = .26, Wald = 4.26, OR = 1.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Compared to children who entered at age 3 and stayed for 2 years (Group 3), children who entered at age 3 and stayed for 1 year (Group 1) were marginally less likely to be obese (<italic>b</italic> = −.47, Wald = 3.24, OR = 0.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049731512459965">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>In summary, this study found that children who had more family risk factors and who had been enrolled in Head Start at age 3 and stayed for 2 years were less likely to be obese. Compared to White children, children from other ethnicities (American Indian, multiple ethnicities, and Asian) had higher obesity rates. Children who attended Head Start in the afternoon were more likely to be obese than those who attended in the morning. Obesity rates also differed depending on the program’s geographical location.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There was no significant difference in Head Start children’s obesity rates in terms of entry age and enrollment duration. However, among children with high family risk factors, children who had entered Head Start at age 3 and stayed for 2 years had a lower obesity rate than those who had entered at age 3 and stayed for 1 year. Consistent with academic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731512459965">Lee, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049731512459965">2011</xref>), this may be due to a compensatory dosage effect of Head Start for children with many family risk factors (such as having a single parent, unemployed parent, teenage parent, parental loss by divorce or death, incarcerated parent, frequent moving, and others). Families with more risk factors have more difficulty providing nurturing home environments for their children, which in turn affect children’s health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049731512459965">Yoo, Slack, &amp; Holl, 2010</xref>). Single working mothers may not have time to prepare nutritious meals. Less educated parents may not know which foods contain more nutrition. When these children enrolled in Head Start at an early age and stayed for a longer duration, they tend to have less obesity, possibly because they received nutritious meals and participated in physical activity more than what was possible at home.</p>
<p>The positive association between a longer enrollment duration and obesity prevention indicates that the current trend of 1-year long participation in Head Start should be reconsidered. Previous studies indicated that early intervention programs, including Head Start, were more effective for younger children with more risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049731512459965">Lee, 2011</xref>). The more pronounced “compensated dosage effects” of Head Start for younger children indicate that the Head Start program should accept more young children who have higher family risk factors and provide 2 years of services. Moreover, the health outcomes might be cumulative products of child environments that include parenting practices, lifestyles, and living environments. Head Start’s current emphasis on family partnership that provides regular parental meetings to promote healthy nutritional parenting skills should be continued. Further, the Early Head Start program should be expanded by including more expectant parents.</p>
<p>Contrary to previous findings, children who were American Indian, Asian American, or had with multiple ethnicities (23.9%) had higher obesity rates than White children (17.6%) in the current study. However, Black (14.7%) and Hispanic (16.6%) children’s obesity rates were not significantly different from that of White children. Previous studies indicated that childhood obesity rates are higher among Hispanic, African African, and Native American minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731512459965">Anderson &amp; Whitaker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049731512459965">The Obesity Society, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049731512459965">Whitaker &amp; Orzol, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731512459965">Johnson, Mclnnes and Shinogle (2006)</xref> found an overweight child is most likely to be a younger African American or Hispanic male who falls in the lowest income category, living with less educated, younger, and single parents. The cultural differences in parenting might affect children’s weight outcomes; for example, Asian or American Indian mothers may identify heavier weights as healthy outcomes and put less emphasis on physical activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731512459965">Gordon-Larsen et al., 2006</xref>), particularly for young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049731512459965">Jain et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Children who attended afternoon programs showed higher obesity rates than those who attended morning programs. Possibly due to selection, this might be related either to enrollment duration or family risk factors. Children who entered Head Start at age 4 and stayed for 1 year were more likely to enroll in afternoon programs than those who entered at age 3 and stayed for 2 years. Children who attended the afternoon program tended to have lower family income. Their parents had fewer years of education and were less likely to be employed. Although not reported as a statistical result in the study, children from rural areas had lower obesity rates than those in urban areas. Children living in urban areas might also have more risk factors such as higher food cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731512459965">Kimbro &amp; Rigby, 2010</xref>), less outdoor physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731512459965">Gordon-Larsen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731512459965">Isaacs &amp; Swartz, 2010</xref>), and more fast-food take out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512459965">Oreskovic et al., 2009</xref>). These risk factors might affect children’s obesity both directly and indirectly through parenting environment at home, as well as through the neighborhood environment. This needs further investigation.</p>
<p>The current study did not collect data from randomly assigned experimental settings and did not allow for causal interpretation on Head Start impacts on children’s obesity rates. Furthermore, it did not provide information on specific parental involvement in the Head Start program. Moreover, although Head Start performance standards and other regulations require weight and height on-site screenings to be preformed within 45 days of enrollment and repeated later, data were unavailable on when children’s BMI scores were measured after having enrolled, which might either underestimate or overestimate the dosage effects of Head Start. Given these shortcomings, generalizations are limited and interpretations drawn from the data need to be cautious. This data, however, provided unique and rare information on Head Start children’s nutritional outcomes measured by children’s actual height and weight. In addition, it provided children’s age and enrollment duration, which allowed comparison between three groups of children. It also allowed for analysis within ecological contexts by providing several (individual, parental, and contextual) variables. These advantages rarely coexist, which strengthens the importance of this study.</p>
<p>Children who had higher family risk factors and had entered at age 3 and stayed for a longer duration in the Head Start program had lower obesity rates that those who had entered at age 3 but stayed for a shorter duration. This suggests that Head Start should accept younger children and have them enroll for a longer duration. This study further suggests that Head Start should address family and other risk factors in order to make a sustainable impact on a child’s nutritional outcomes beyond their enrollment in the program. Head Start itself, providing most children with a half-day program for only a 1-year duration, may not be sufficient to enhance children’s health by overcoming cumulative risk factors. The neighborhoods where children live also affect obesity. Based on the ecological model, extensive family and community partnerships should not only promote healthy meals and physical activities, but should also remove environmental risk factors (low-income, unemployment, substance use, lack of access to healthy food, lack of safe areas for physical activities, etc). Additionally, Head Start evaluations should address obesity disparities among various ethnic minority groups with culturally competent practices.</p>
<p>Long-term research on the height and weight outcomes of Head Start children should be conducted in order to see the impact of Head Start’s nutritional policy (exposure to foods, mealtime socialization, and obesity prevention) in later years. Research with a control group, those eligible but not accepted, would be beneficial in understanding the unique impacts of Head Start’s nutritional policy on childhood obesity. Additionally, research on nutrition or food intake in the home environment should be conducted for a better understanding on the impact of the home environment and how Head Start can prevent childhood obesity through its intervention. The FY 2013 budget increases Head Start funding by $85 million, bringing the total funding for the program to over $8 billion. Due to the current trend of increasing rates of childhood obesity, Head Start should aim to provide a more extensive and comprehensive nutritional program that can address health disparities, including childhood obesity and in low-income populations.</p>
