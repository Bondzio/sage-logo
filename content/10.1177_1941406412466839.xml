<p><bold>Studies have demonstrated that adolescents are more likely to engage in high-risk behaviors as it pertains to food allergies. Based on your experience, please discuss what you view as the developmental challenges that affect adolescents’ ability (or desire) to keep themselves safe from harmful foods?</bold></p>
<speech><speaker>Annunziato:</speaker><p>Some developmental researchers have identified this period’s core task as achieving freedom from the confining nature of childhood dependence, whereas others have focused on the freedom to make independent decisions and choices, pursue goals, and regulate one’s own behavior, cognition, and emotion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412466839">1</xref></sup> Achieving autonomy is a key developmental experience for adolescents; the problematic social, emotional, and physical outcomes that may follow if not achieved have been well documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412466839">2</xref></sup> Unfortunately, adolescents may perceive “defying” what adults have told them about food allergy management as autonomy. It can also be very reinforcing to experience freedom from the restrictions that they have lived with for so long. Therefore, a major challenge we face is how to help adolescents achieve autonomy while also ensuring that they remain safe. Another salient developmental challenge is related to peers. Adolescents may desire to spend more time with their same-age peers than with their parents or family members and can also face peer pressure. Both these situations could provoke high-risk behavior. And spending more time with peers can certainly be a manifestation of desiring more autonomy.</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Roland:</speaker><p>Typically, developmental challenges include a <italic>sense of invulnerability</italic> or “it won’t happen to me” for adolescents. The <italic>ability to think abstractly</italic>, and thus perceive the impact of their actions on their own health, is key to encouraging youth to be well informed about food allergies (signs/symptoms). They will hopefully modify their behavior to ensure the avoidance of harmful foods and be able to react appropriately when these exposures occur.</p></speech>
<p>Adolescents concerned about peer relationships and/or being identified as different can challenge youth with food allergies, as they may not want to speak up in front of friends when ordering meals. When foods are offered in a social setting (eg, when eating dinner at a friend’s house or at a party), they may hesitate to ask specifics about potential exposure to allergens. Youth may want to <italic>avoid embarrassment</italic> or <italic>having attention drawn to themselves</italic> and not acknowledge or act when the initial onset of symptoms develop and delay interventions, hoping that the body changes are not related to food allergy exposure but “something else” or that it will get better overtime, thus missing an opportunity for early intervention.</p>

<p>Each issue, we ask different professionals a set of questions about an aspect of their practice or a specific problem or disease condition they encounter. This month’s topic is food allergy management in adolescents. Our participants are <bold>Rachel Annunziato, PhD</bold>, and <bold>Michele Roland, MD</bold>. Full bios for each of the contributors can be found at the end of this article.</p>

<p><bold>Adolescents are nearing adulthood, which includes managing their own health care decisions. What are some of the strategies that you offer to parents and other adults who may be involved in an adolescents care?</bold></p>
<speech><speaker>Annunziato:</speaker><p>This relates very well to the above discussion of developmental challenges. Many researchers have suggested that health care management skills should be taught as early as possible and practiced with heavy parental support so that by the start of adolescence many behaviors are well established. This means that clinicians should teach and inquire about health care management in their preteen patients. Parents and children should maintain regular dialogue about different health care behaviors and how they are being overseen. Data suggest that there can be disagreements here (parents think children are responsible for a task but children think the opposite). Parents should create opportunities for their children to initiate health care management in an autonomous way. For example, they can give their teen the bulk of the “air time” at medical appointments so that they get used to talking with their clinicians and develop a sense of ownership (autonomy) over their care. Parents can encourage their child to choose meals at home or places to eat out to see how they do when making such decisions, and of course help them if they struggle. There are “subtle” ways too that parents can check in to see how their adolescent is doing with regard to health care management. For example, they can send their child reminder text messages (“Are there safe foods that you can eat at Daniel’s house?”) or emails. Such gestures may convey caring and respect for privacy while also using their child’s preferred mode of communication. From a developmental perspective, it is important for parents to promote self-management while offering a safety net as well. It is critical too for adolescents to learn such skills with this scaffolding as they may soon transition into new environments where it will be imperative to have mastered health care management.</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Roland:</speaker><p>Open communication and modeling of behavior is very important and should start early in childhood. Parents can help their children by participating in role-play, replaying scenes that have come up or might in the future. Parents need information to stay educated about safe food preparation as well as signs and symptoms of food allergies. Parents can support the use of smart phones or other devices with emergency (in case of emergency) information. Adolescents may benefit from creating a script for calling restaurants for information on menu items and food preparation. The issue of disclosure is an important one. Who <italic>needs</italic> to know about the adolescents’ food allergy? How should the information be delivered? It is helpful to encourage parents to be informed about the school’s policy on food allergies and what type of staffing is available in case of an emergency. Parents that maintain open communication with their child/adolescent/young adult and support them in the provision of early training in self-management knowledge and behaviors, while providing opportunities for rehearsal and incorporation into daily life at home, school or the community may find greater success in their child taking on food allergy management. If something is not happening at school (ie, eating lunch at school), it is important to ask why instead of why not.</p></speech>
<p><bold>Students with visible differences often suffer from bullying in the school environment. It is unfortunate that adolescents with food allergies may fall into this category. Please describe some of the resources that you direct clients/families to in order to support adolescents with food allergies, who experience bullying or other adverse events at school.</bold></p>
<speech><speaker>Annunziato:</speaker><p>It is very important to educate families about the high rates of bullying among children with food allergies. Because of this, we encourage parents and clinicians to talk with children about bullying, and do so repeatedly, as oftentimes trusted adults are unaware of it. Therefore, the first step is to bring bullying to light. This may also involve teaching parents how to talk about uncomfortable topics with their children. One strategy that can be helpful is for families to talk regularly about good and bad parts of their day. If parents do uncover bullying, it can be very helpful to take these concerns to school personnel and seek their help and guidance. Parents can also directly help their children. For example, perhaps they can insert themselves in situations where they learn that such events are common. Adult intervention can put a stop to bullying. And parents can teach and model strategies to their children that they can use in the face of bullying. This often includes “problem solving” with their child, which can result with adolescents having specific plans to use if they should be confronted by bullies. A useful Web site to learn more about related ideas is: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brightfutures.org/mentalhealth/pdf/families/mc/bullying.pdf">http://www.brightfutures.org/mentalhealth/pdf/families/mc/bullying.pdf</ext-link>.</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Roland:</speaker><p>I frequently recommend that these youth have a 504 plan or Individualized Educational Program (IEP) at school, if appropriate. Contact with school administrators is important to ensure that bullying is identified and addressed, with supportive care for youth experiencing bullying. Los Angeles Unified School District has a program with the Office of Human Relations, Diversity &amp; Equity that works to address issues of bullying. The following links provide guidance to parents, schools, and students on handling bullying:</p></speech>

<p><bold>Adolescents with food allergies often come with parents who have nightmares about “the big one.” Please provide 3 resources that you have found helpful for parents and other adults to help them manage their own anxieties.</bold></p>
<speech><speaker>Annunziato:</speaker><p>Parents often experience more anxiety than their children around food allergies. There are many resources that we can direct them to.</p></speech>
<list id="list1-1941406412466839" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Many parents find that the support of other parents with food allergies is incredibly helpful to allaying their anxiety. Connecting parents to each other is one option. Formal networks like The Food Allergy &amp; Anaphylaxis Network may be a useful resource as well.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Having a child with special health care needs can be very distressing. As a mental health professional, there are times when I determine that a parent’s symptoms are more so than what would be expected given this context. Sometimes, for example, parents may have a psychiatric diagnosis such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); parents of medically ill children have elevated rates of PTSD. In such cases, the best resource that I can offer is an explanation of why psychotherapy might be helpful and what it entails. Our group maintains a referral list of clinicians with expertise in this area.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Other resources that I use as a mental health professional are relaxation techniques such as guided imaginary and breathing exercises. Many also find mindfulness meditation helpful as well. “Reframing” or challenging one’s thoughts is a key component of “cognitive-behavioral therapy” that targets negative thoughts and distorted thinking like, for example, catastrophic thinking about food allergies. Finally, and importantly, I emphasize self-efficacy, meaning teaching parents that they do have the coping skills to address any situation that should arise.</p></list-item>
</list>
<speech><speaker>Roland:</speaker><p>I refer family to guidance materials provided at the American Academy of Pediatrics or AAP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://AAP.org">AAP.org</ext-link>) Web site. In 2010, the AAP published a comprehensive clinical report on the management of food allergies in school settings (see link below). The Web site also offers links to other Web sites related to allergy management. I encourage the youth and parent to create an action plan that has specific tasks, dates of completion, and who is responsible for accomplishing the goals of the plan. The food allergy anaphylaxis network provides wonderful resources for family, youth, and schools, which include a downloadable allergy action plan (see link below).</p></speech>

<p>Adolescents are very media conscious. You have been asked to create a media campaign to decrease high-risk behaviors related to food allergies. What behavior would you target (ie, reading labels, carrying an Epi-Pen, wearing a bracelet)? What platform would you use to get the message out (ie, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter)?</p>
<speech><speaker>Annunziato:</speaker><p>Facebook seems to be extremely popular among adolescents and young adults across different cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. I would therefore use this platform. I think it would be great to use Facebook as a forum to facilitate dialogue about high-risk behaviors. For example, a “status update” could be a question such as “How do you tell new friends about your allergies” or “How do you remember to always carry your Epi-Pen”? In another pediatric population, we ran a 1-day workshop on a Saturday about self-management and other topics pertinent to adolescents with special health care needs, and afterwards, participants chose to continue talking about these topics on Facebook.</p></speech>
<speech><speaker>Roland:</speaker><p>It is important to know the specific population (high school students, sports team, or club activity) that you are targeting. Although many youth have smartphones some may not. Many use social media and this would be a tool to provide information. Facebook seems to be quite popular. Targeting various behaviors would be helpful, but a screening that lets youth select a priority area for learning with interactive modules would be helpful. Those that have been instructed to use/prescribed epinephrine (eg, Epi-Pen or other products) could use a YouTube video to reinforce previous education. Youth could direct friends and family members to links on YouTube to learn more about food allergies.</p></speech>
