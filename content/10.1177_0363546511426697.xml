<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Head and face injuries in field hockey are a concern. However, published data on injuries in field hockey are minimal, with apparently no reports on head and face injuries in elite youth hockey players during major international tournaments.</p>
<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> To provide a descriptive account of head and face injuries in elite youth male field hockey players during the Men’s Junior World Cup 2009.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design:</bold> Descriptive epidemiological study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 324 players were observed during 58 matches in the tournament. The injury reporting system was based on that used in team sports during international tournaments. All the head and face injury documentation was done by direct on-location observation by a trained sports medicine physician followed by confirmation from the team doctors or physical therapists.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 24 head and face injuries were documented. The overall injury frequency rate was 16 per 1000 match hours and 19 per 1000 player matches. There were 92% of injuries that were of contact type, with the head being the most common site and contusion being the most common type of injury. The incidence of injuries was higher during the second half and during the medal/ranking phase of the tournament.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The risk of head and face injuries is high in elite youth players with a potential of both short- and long-term player time loss in international tournaments. Rigorous enforcement of rules prohibiting body contact can significantly reduce the chances of head and face injuries in elite youth field hockey players. In addition, player education on the injury risks and safe practices at the developmental stages is desirable to prevent injuries and prolong sporting careers.</p>

<body>
<p>Head and face injuries in field hockey are a concern with high incidence and severity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511426697">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511426697">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511426697">15</xref></sup> The struck ball can travel at high speeds in the air both during field play and during goal attempts, posing a high injury risk to the head and the face of the athletes. Contrary to the presumptions, it can be frequently observed during the game that the stick and the ball are at times raised at shoulder and near-head levels. Moreover, the use of powerful reverse stick hits (left-sided stick swing) especially in the shooting circle is frequently observed in modern field hockey. These actions raise the injury risk to the head and face region. In addition, despite the rules prohibiting any body contact, player collisions during the game further raise the risk of injuries in field hockey.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511426697">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Injuries to the head and face can be potentially serious<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511426697">16</xref></sup> and can be prevented with the use of appropriate protective gear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511426697">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511426697">16</xref></sup> Numerous studies have provided a detailed account of head and face injury risks and the benefits of protective gear in ice hockey in both adults and youth players at different levels of participation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511426697">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511426697">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511426697">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511426697">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511426697">21</xref></sup> However, head and eye protection is permitted only for medical reasons in field hockey. As such, the use of protective gear in field hockey is infrequent,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511426697">8</xref></sup> and there is a dearth of studies providing a focused account of head and face injuries in this sport. Apparently, the only published study on face-related injuries in field hockey during major international tournaments was conducted about 25 years ago; it reported that 62% of the players surveyed had sustained at least one facial injury, and a majority of these injured players needed medical consultation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511426697">3</xref></sup> However, this study did not provide an account of the type of injuries, and no data were reported on head injuries.</p>
<p>Field hockey as a sport has undergone tremendous changes in the past 2 decades. There have been developments in the turf material of the playing surface; technological advancements in the construction of hockey sticks; and changes in the player substitution, short corner, and self-pass from free hit rules over the years. These changes have increased the speed of play with fewer stoppages, have increased opportunities of goal scoring, and also have led to the development of stronger and faster players, all potentially contributing to enhanced injury risks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511426697">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511426697">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite these changes and also the increasing popularity of field hockey worldwide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511426697">14</xref></sup> published data on injuries in field hockey are infrequent and largely limited to female players.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511426697">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511426697">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511426697">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511426697">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511426697">17</xref></sup> There are minimal data especially on young field hockey athletes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511426697">23</xref></sup> With youth sports participation on the rise worldwide, it is imperative to conduct injury surveillance studies of young elite athletes to gain knowledge about the injury risk among this highly competitive population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511426697">20</xref></sup> It has been suggested that the elite youth athlete seems to be subjected to a high injury risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511426697">20</xref></sup> Moreover, it is reasonable to conceive that the players might be more willing to take risks during international matches during major tournaments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511426697">3</xref></sup> However, injuries in youth elite field hockey players during major international tournaments have yet to be reported in the literature.</p>
<p>The majority of the existing injury data are on collegiate field hockey players, and the implications of injuries have been reported in terms of player time lost during the season.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511426697">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511426697">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511426697">15</xref></sup> However, international tournaments present a different context. Injuries may lead to player time lost in the game, inability to return to the game, or being unable to continue in the tournament. Given that each team has only a few matches to play, each game affected by player loss may have serious bearing on the team’s prospects. Therefore, the injury incidence and patterns in terms of their implications need to be reported and evaluated with a different perspective during major international tournaments.</p>
<p>The objective of this study was to provide a descriptive account of the head and face injuries in male youth elite field hockey players during the Men’s Junior World Cup tournament 2009, with the presumption that this information can be used to evaluate the injury risk and patterns in men’s elite youth field hockey and help to educate the athletes, coaches, and trainers and promote injury prevention strategies for the future. In addition, such data would also add to the literature and broaden the existing knowledge base on injury patterns and risks in youth elite field hockey players especially during major international tournaments. Such information can provide greater insights into the age- and gender-based differences in the injury profiles of different field hockey–playing populations at different levels of participation.</p>
<sec id="section1-0363546511426697" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials And Methods</title>
<p>The injury reporting system used in the present study was largely based on that previously used for injury documentation in team sports during international tournaments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511426697">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511426697">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511426697">24</xref></sup> However, because field hockey rules allow rolling substitution, the clause of a player being able or not able to return to the game after substitution was added to the injury reporting system. Injuries to the eye and ear were also included in the list. The head and face injuries sustained by athletes were documented using a 3-step approach. First, direct on-location observation of each match was done by 2 research team members, with one being a trained sports medicine physician and the other being a university physical education lecturer and former National League field hockey player. The 2 observers were at diagonally opposite sides of the field and had a top-down view of the play. Second, personal communication with the team doctor or physical therapist was performed after the match, and third, personal communication with the team doctor or physical therapist was done the following morning in case some players reported an injury late after the match.</p>
<p>In the context of the study, the definition of an injury was adapted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511426697">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511426697">7</xref></sup> as any physical complaint in the form of pain, discomfort, or disability incurred because of match play–related activities that received medical or physical therapeutic attention, either immediate or postmatch, irrespective of the player being able or not able to continue with the match. The severity of injuries was categorized based on player time lost in the tournament. Category 1 included injuries that did or did not require immediate medical attention, but the player could continue in the game either with or without being substituted. Category 2 injuries were those requiring immediate medical attention, and the player could not continue in the game. Category 3 injuries were those causing the athlete to be unable to play in any of the subsequent matches in the tournament. For all the injuries documented, the information on player number, time of the match, part injured (head, face, ear, or eye), type of injury, severity of injury, cause of injury (stick, ball, contact, and noncontact), and consequences of the injury were recorded. The information on the part injured and the type of injury were further confirmed by the team doctor or physical therapist after the match and on the morning following the game day. Also, a record of whether the injured athlete could play the subsequent matches was documented. All injury documentation was performed by the members of the research team.</p>
<p>Approval for the study was obtained from the Junior World Cup competitions manager, and the ethical clearance for noninterventional research on human participants was obtained from the departmental ethical review committee. A total of 58 matches were observed in the tournament that involved the participation of 20 nations from the Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa, and the Americas. Twenty-eight matches from the preliminary round and 30 matches from the medals and ranking round were observed. At least 2 matches for each participating country were observed. A total of 324 (90%) of the 360 participating players from 20 countries were observed in the course of the study. The average age of the players was 19.2 years (range, 15-21 years).</p>
<p>The incidence of head and face injuries was expressed as the number of injuries per match and the number of injuries per 1000 match hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511426697">10</xref></sup> The total hours of match play were computed with the assumption that each match involved 22 players and lasted for 70 minutes (22 players × 70 minutes = 25.67 match hours). Only 2 of the matches observed went into extra time, and hence, these added minutes were not taken into account. In addition, the number of head and face injuries per 1000 player matches and player hours were also calculated using the method developed previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511426697">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511426697">11</xref></sup></p>

<p>Thirteen (54%) of the injuries were because of player contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511426697">Figure 1</xref>). Five (20.8%) of the injuries documented were during the preliminary round matches, while 19 (79.2%) were during the medal/ranking round of the tournament. Similarly, 5 of the 24 injuries (20.8%) occurred in the first half, while 19 (79.2%) occurred in the second half of match play.</p>

<p>The match had to be stopped on all the 24 occasions, and the injured players required immediate medical attention. Player substitution was performed for 23 of the 24 occasions. The team doctors/physical therapists confirmed that these substitutions were because of the injury and not because of tactical reasons. The only occasion player substitution was not done was a case of contusion on the forehead when the player continued after primary treatment on the field. Seventeen (74%) of the 23 injured players substituted could return to play, while 6 of the injured (26%) could not continue in the match. The injuries that caused an inability to continue were lacerated wound on the face (n = 2), ear drum rupture (n = 1), and concussion (n = 3). The one athlete with ear drum rupture also suffered concussion and could not continue any further in the tournament. None of the other injuries were severe enough to cause the players to miss any of the subsequent matches. The results also showed that there was no significant difference in the player positions in terms of injuries sustained. Moreover, in none of the matches observed did the goalkeepers suffer any head- and face-related injuries.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study documented the incidence, risks, patterns, and consequences of head and face injuries in men’s elite youth field hockey players during the Men’s Junior Field Hockey World Cup in 2009 jointly hosted by Singapore and Malaysia. The injury documentation and reporting method used in the current study was a minor contextual adaptation of the previously established method for the surveillance of team sports injuries during international tournaments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511426697">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511426697">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511426697">24</xref></sup> The results showed that elite youth field hockey players are exposed to a high risk of head and face injuries during major international tournaments.</p>
<p>Studies on injuries in field hockey have been infrequent and predominantly on collegiate-level female athletes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511426697">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511426697">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511426697">15</xref></sup> Apparently, the only study that has provided data on field hockey injuries during an international event was during the 2004 Olympic games.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511426697">11</xref></sup> This study reported that head and face injuries accounted for 27% of the total injuries, with the incidence being only second to the lower extremity injuries. But even with both men’s and women’s injuries combined in the study, the incidence rates of head and face injuries were significantly higher in the current study (injuries per match, 0.41 vs 0.23; injuries per 1000 player matches, 19 vs 10.5; injuries per 1000 player hours, 16 vs 9). This suggests that elite youth field hockey players are exposed to a greater risk of head and face injuries than their adult counterparts during major international tournaments. Any further comparative description of the data from the current study is limited by the dearth of studies during international tournaments in field hockey. However, the results of the current study do provide further insights into the risks, patterns, and consequences of head and face injuries in elite youth field hockey players.</p>
<p>Fifty-four percent of the head and face injuries were a result of player contact, providing further evidence that despite the rules restricting body checks, player collisions do add to the injury risk in elite field hockey. Moreover, the only case where the injured athlete could not continue any further in the tournament was also an outcome of contact injury. It has been recommended that for sports involving the possibility of injury by an object such as a stick or a ball, a differentiation of contact with a player or object is recommended to gain greater insights into the injury mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511426697">11</xref></sup> One third of the injuries were caused by the stick, suggesting that despite the rules prohibiting playing the ball with any part of the stick when the ball is above the shoulder height, the players do raise the stick to near-head levels during the game. The ball did not cause a single head or face injury in the matches observed. This was a surprising finding given that powerful hits that lift the ball in the air seem to be the most potential risk for head and face injuries. However, this did not seem to be the case in the current study. The results therefore indicate that firmer implementation of rules to restrict body checks and player contacts can significantly reduce the incidence of head and face injuries in elite field hockey.</p>
<p>A significant majority of the injuries (80%) occurring in the second half of play in this study was in agreement with the results reported in a recent study on elite U21 field hockey players.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511426697">17</xref></sup> The injury risk therefore seems to be higher toward the latter part of the match. The results also showed that the head and face injury risk is higher during the medal/ranking round of the tournament. Because losing a match in this round can lead to the elimination of a team from the tournament, the players may be willing to take more risks during this part of the tournament. The results also showed that the risk of head and face injuries in elite field hockey was independent of the playing position. This was strongly suggestive that field hockey has evolved to be a sport of interpositional play and that all the outfield players, irrespective of the playing position, were exposed to the risk of head and face injuries.</p>
<p>The head was more commonly injured than the face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546511426697">Figure 3</xref>). One hundred percent of the injuries to the head were a result of player contact, and in 8 of the 15 injuries to the head, contact with the stick was the cause of injury. Contusion was the most common injury to the head and face, followed by concussion and laceration in equal numbers. These findings indicate that the head is a vulnerable part in elite field hockey and that players might benefit from the use of appropriate protective gear in the game. Concussion was the cause of inability of the injured player to return to play in 50% of the cases. Furthermore, player substitution was done in 23 of the 24 occasions, of which 6 players could not return to play in the match and 1 of the 6 players (ear drum rupture) could not continue any further in the tournament. Therefore, head and face injuries in elite youth hockey can lead to short- as well as long-term player time loss, both of which can have decisive implications for the team especially in the medal/ranking/knockout phase of the tournament. However, based on the evidence from the present study and previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511426697">8</xref></sup> the majority of head and face injuries in field hockey seem to only result in short-term player time loss. Surprisingly, despite a higher risk, no goalkeeper in the games observed had any head or face injury. This finding was contrary to the contention of previous studies published more than 2 decades ago.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511426697">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511426697">19</xref></sup> However, it was in agreement with a recent study on elite female U21 field hockey players in which the goalkeeper sustained the least number of injuries over a 5-year period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511426697">17</xref></sup> This does suggest that the sport has changed over time in terms of injury risks and patterns, and the goalkeeper in the present times may not be as vulnerable as perceived earlier, at least for head and face injuries. This might be owing to the ergonomically and technologically enhanced protective wear used in the present by the goalkeepers in field hockey.</p>
<p>Elite youth field hockey players are at high risk of head and face injuries, with potential consequences in their playing career and long-term sports participation. Currently, the rules prohibit the use of protective headgear in field hockey except for medical reasons. Collectively, the data from the present and previous studies suggest that field hockey players can benefit from the use of protective headgear. The results also indicate that head and face injuries can be an outcome of risk-taking play behavior especially during major international tournaments. This presents a critical area for player education especially during the developmental years. Sports organizations and youth coaches should seriously consider inculcating education on safe practices to young athletes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511426697">15</xref></sup> and discourage high-risk play during training and competitions.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The risk of head and face injuries in elite youth field hockey players is high, with the potential of both short- and long-term player time loss during international tournaments. The majority of head and face injuries result from player contact during play. Evidence from the present study suggests that rigorous implementation of rules restricting body contact can significantly reduce the incidence of head and face injuries in elite youth field hockey players. Also, the player at the developmental stages should be educated on the evidence of injury risks and consequences and encouraged to adopt safe practices in the sport. Nonetheless, injury prevention, adopting safe practices, and athlete education and development should be a lifelong practice for all team sports.</p>
