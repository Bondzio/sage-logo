<p>Hosea 2.20 (Eng. 18) describes the resolution of some sort of human/animal conflict. Several things connect Hos. 2.20 to Gen. 9.2, where human/animal conflict is created. Assuming that Hos. 2.20 and Gen. 9.2 are related texts, they describe a paired set of events: the beginning of human/animal conflict in the distant past, and the end of that same conflict at some point in the future. Hos. 2.20 was, therefore, describing the resolution of the human/animal conflict which God wove into the fabric of the postdiluvian world in Gen. 9.2. Thus, Hos. 2.20 described a lasting, constitutional change to the human/animal relationship.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Several Israelite texts describe a future characterized by peace between human beings and animals, and sometimes between animals themselves (Lev. 26.6; Job 5.22–23; Isa. 11.6–9; 35.9; 65.25; Ezek. 34.25, 28; Hos. 2.20 [Eng. 18]).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309089212466467">1</xref></sup> In describing this future, these texts mention several taxonomic groupings of animals, as well as several ways that animals are involved in the creation or operation of the peace.</p>
<p>Before delineating these variations, the basic structure of taxonomic thought must be outlined. To form a classification system a society divides its animal inventory into several primary level taxa (e.g. animals → land/aquatic/flying). These primary level taxa are subdivided into several, more exclusive secondary level taxa (e.g. flying animals → insects/birds), some or all of which are subdivided into several, more exclusive tertiary level taxa (e.g. birds → hawks/sparrows/crows), and so forth. The process of subdivision ends in a terminal level of specificity beyond which categoric distinctions are no longer made (e.g. crows → American crows/fish crows).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0309089212466467">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Animals are presented in the aforementioned texts in one of three ways taxonomically. Style one is found in Isa. 11.6–9 and 65.25 and consists of a selection of land animals at the terminal level of specificity (the way animals are involved in the creation or operation of peace is noted to the right):</p>

</fig>
<p>Style two is found in Lev. 26.6, Isa. 35.9, Ezek. 34.25 and 28, and Job 5.22 and 23, and consists of a single taxon situated at or near the primary level:</p>

</fig>
<p>Style three is found in Hos. 2.20 (Eng. 18), and consists of three primary level taxa which encompass the whole of the animal kingdom except for aquatic animals (their absence will be discussed below):</p>

<p>High carriage (h-c) land animals have longish legs that cause them to move over the ground (e.g. hares, goats); low carriage (l-c) land animals have short legs/no legs that cause them to move along the ground (e.g. rats, snakes).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0309089212466467">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Looking more closely at Hos. 2.20 (Eng. 18), it has been argued that the human/animal peace which God announces there resolves the hostile situation announced in Hos. 2.14 (Eng. 12), where God says he will send wild land animals (‭הדשה‬ ‭תיח‬) to devour the agricultural countryside.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0309089212466467">4</xref></sup> While this is undoubtedly true, if that was all Hos. 2.20 was meant to resolve, then the way to have done so would have been (1) to deal exclusively with the animals that are a threat (as in the style two texts), and (2) to describe either (a) the removal of these animals from the landscape (as in the style two-A texts) or (b) their future pacific disposition (as in the style one and style two-B texts). Hosea 2.20, however, indicated that peace would be established between human beings and all animals, not just wild land animals; furthermore, it described peace as coming about through the creation of a covenant with all animals, not through the removal or pacification of some of them. Thus, the outcome envisioned by Hos. 2.20 is more sweeping than a resolution to the conflict described in Hos. 2.14 would entail, while the mechanism to create the peace is more formal and significant than necessary to eliminate the threat described in Hos. 2.14. In sum, while the announcement of a future peace between human beings and animals in Hos. 2.20 resolves the human/animal conflict announced in Hos. 2.14, it ultimately resolves a conflict that is broader and weightier than that, a conflict which exists between human beings and all animals, and one which requires a covenant to fix. This article will determine what that conflict is.</p>

<title>2. Primary Level Classification Schemas</title>
<p>In order to identify what human/animal conflict is at issue in Hos. 2.20, it is first necessary to determine where to look for information that will lead to an identification. Note then that one of the distinctive features of Hos. 2.20 is its use of a primary level classification schema. As seen in the following examples, the Israelites had several primary level, animal classification schemas:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0309089212466467">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>As indicated, Hos. 2.20 contains a truncated form of the habitat-locomotion schema (II).</p>
<p>The basic function of a primary level schema was to draw the mind across the broad expanse of the world's animal inventory. In some of these texts, however, the schema was more significant than that. First, in some instances, the primary level schema conveyed or reflected something integral to the meaning of a text. For example, schema I, which reflects the Israelite understanding of the world as consisting of three parts—water, land, and air (e.g. Exod. 20.4; Deut. 5.8)—was used in several texts where the animals that will inhabit those three parts of the world are created (e.g. Gen. 1.20–25; 2.19), or where they are threatened with being uncreated or with wasting away (e.g. Jer. 12.4; Hos. 4.3; Zeph. 1.3). Schema III, which reflects an awareness that some animals (domesticated land) have a close relationship with human beings, while others (e.g. wild land) have a more distant relationship, was used in several texts where there is an interest in the place of human beings within the created order, and in the relationship of human beings to animals (e.g. Gen. 2.20; Pss. 8.8–9 [Eng. 7–8]; 104.10–26).</p>
<p>Second, different texts sometimes used the same schema to deal with the same subject, raising the possibility that they were related to each other in some way, perhaps as inhabitants of a common thought world or intellectual tradition, or even that one text was borrowing from or commenting on another text. For example, regarding the schema I texts, it has been suggested that the destruction/languishing of the world and its animals in Hos. 4.3 and Zeph. 1.2–3 involves a reversal of the creation of the world and its animals as described in Gen. 1.20–25 (the order of animals in Hos. 4.3 and Zeph. 1.2–3 is the reverse of Gen. 1.20–25).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0309089212466467">7</xref></sup> Regarding the schema III texts, it has been argued that Psalm 8 conveys a sense of human authority over animals by naming animals according to the taxonomic categories used when animals are named in Gen. 2.20.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0309089212466467">8</xref></sup> And given the close similarities between the only two texts that use schema V—the dietary laws of Lev. 11.2–23 and Deut. 14.3–20—it has been argued that they are related in some way.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0309089212466467">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In light of these two ways that a primary level schema could be a significant part of a text, it is possible (1) that the habitat-locomotion schema found in Hos. 2.20 conveys an idea which is integral to the meaning of the passage, and/or (2) that Hos. 2.20 is part of a group of related texts that use the habitat-locomotion schema in the course of dealing with the subject of human/animal conflict (hereafter, the schema/subject combination). If either scenario is true, it might shed light on what human/animal conflict was being resolved in Hos. 2.20.</p>
<p>Of course, for this line of inquiry to be fruitful, it is necessary that the use of the habitat-locomotion schema in Hos. 2.20 was deliberate and not happenstance. As to this, there are two texts in Hosea which use a primary level schema: Hos. 2.20 and 4.3. Hosea 4.3 uses schema I, and, as is the case with some of the texts that use that schema (see above), Hos. 4.3 deals with the wasting away of the three types of animals that inhabit the three parts of the world. Hosea 2.20, however, deals with a different subject (peace between animals and human beings) and uses a different schema (schema II). Thus, Hosea or his tradents (hereafter Hosea) (1) were not constrained by a need for literary consistency or by allegiance to a particular school of zoological thought to use the same schema in different texts, and (2) coordinated schema with content in one text. These things suggest that the use of the habitat-locomotion schema in Hos. 2.20 was deliberate. It is reasonable, then, to proceed.</p>

<title>3. The Habitat-Locomotion Schema</title>

<p>In addition to Hos. 2.20, the schema/subject combination is also found in Gen. 9.2. The only other place where it might be (latently) found is Gen. 1.26 (<sc>mt</sc>), where animals are placed under human authority, an arrangement which might be thought of as leading to conflict. Two things, however, argue against Gen. 1.26 containing the schema/subject combination. First, the sequence of animals in the <sc>mt</sc> of Gen. 1.26 is interrupted by a non-animal entity in the fourth position:</p>
<fig id="fig3-0309089212466467" position="float">
<graphic alt-version="no" position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_0309089212466467-fig3.tif" xlink:type="simple"/>
</fig>
<p>This suggests that the <sc>mt</sc> is corrupt and that the <italic>BHS</italic> apparatus (cf. Syriac) is correct, meaning that Gen. 1.26 actually contains schema IV and not schema II. Second, even if the <sc>mt</sc> of Gen. 1.26 is correct, and even though the governing authority of human beings over animals would be the background against which any conflict between human beings and animals would unfold,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0309089212466467">10</xref></sup> the governing authority of human beings over animals does not in itself lead to conflict. For example, in the Genesis 6–9 story, even if animals are among the corrupt inhabitants of the world mentioned in Gen. 6.12 (‭קשב־לכ‬), as is sometimes argued, human beings and animals are clearly presented as getting along with each other just fine; they enter the ark together (Gen. 7.1–16), ride out the storm together (Gen. 7.17–8.12), and depart the ark together (Gen. 8.13–22), with no sign that conflict is present or has been suspended for the occasion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0309089212466467">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In sum, other than Hos. 2.20, only Gen. 9.2 uses the habitat-locomotion schema in the course of dealing with the subject of human/animal conflict. It is possible, then, that Gen. 9.2 and Hos. 2.20 are related in some way. But is that probable?</p>

First, as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0309089212466467">Table 1</xref>, Gen. 9.2 presents the full form of the habitat-locomotion schema, while Hos. 2.20 presents a truncated form (aquatic animals are absent). Given such a basic difference, it might be argued that these texts are related at nothing more than a superficial level. The absence of aquatic animals, however, is common among primary level schemas (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0309089212466467">Table 1</xref>). It reflects a tendency for the Israelites to focus on the terrestrial part of the world (land and air) where they existed, and to mention only those animals found with them there. The terrestrial part of the world is the geographical focus of Hos. 2.16–25 (Eng. 14–23) (desert [v. 16]; vineyards [v. 17]; valley [v. 17]; land [vv. 20, 23]; sky [v. 23]; earth [vv. 23–24]). Thus, aquatic animals are absent from 2.20 because Hosea coordinated the content of the primary level schema with the geographical purview of the context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0309089212466467">12</xref></sup> Their absence in Hos. 2.20 does not, therefore, undermine the possibility of a connection between Hos. 2.20 and Gen. 9.2.</p>
<p>Second, Hosea was an eighth-century prophet, while Gen. 9.2 is often regarded as an exilic/post-exilic, priestly text. It might be argued, then, that Hos. 2.20 could not be related to a text written several centuries later. Scholars have suggested, however, that the primeval history (Gen. 1–11) consists of traditions that were extant in Israel prior to their incorporation into the text as it now stands;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0309089212466467">13</xref></sup> thus, even if the flood text in its present form is exilic/post-exilic, that does not preclude the possibility that flood traditions, including those regarded as priestly material, were extant when Hosea was working. Alternatively, some scholars date the priestly school to the pre-exilic period, even to the eighth century or earlier;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0309089212466467">14</xref></sup> this would place both Hos. 2.20 and Gen. 9.2 in the same time-frame. Other scholars consider Hos. 2.20 to be an exilic/post-exilic interpolation;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0309089212466467">15</xref></sup> this would place its composition at a time when either a pre-exilic or an exilic/post-exilic Gen. 9.2 was extant. In sum, a relationship between the content of Hos. 2.20 and Gen. 9.2 is possible regardless of how one dates the texts (a matter which will/need not be resolved here).</p>
<p>There are several things in addition to their unique use of the schema/subject combination which suggest or support a connection between Hos. 2.20 and the Gen. 9.2 tradition. First, if Hos. 2.20 is referencing the Gen. 9.2 tradition, then Hos. 2.20 is referencing something from history. History is referenced extensively in the book of Hosea. For example, reference is made to Jacob (12.3–5 [Eng. 2–4], 13 [Eng. 12]), the exodus from Egypt (2.17 [Eng. 15]; 11.1; 12.10a [Eng. 9a], 14 [Eng. 13]; 13.4), the sojourn in the wilderness (12.10b [Eng. 9b]), David (3.5), the activities of past prophets (6.5; 12.11 [Eng. 10]), and past building activities (8.14a). Reference is also made to events that have taken place at Baal-Peor (9.10), Gibeah (9.9; 10.9), Beth Arbel (10.14), Admah and Zeboiim (11.8), and at, or involving, Adam (6.7); the references to Jezreel (1.4) and Gilgal (9.15) may also involve past events. Finally, reference is made to covenantal/legal traditions (4.6; 6.7; 8.1, 12). Given that Hosea made extensive use of history elsewhere, the idea that he did the same in Hos. 2.20 is plausible and reasonable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0309089212466467">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Second, the habitat-locomotion schema reflects a particular way of seeing and thinking about animals. Leaving aside Hos. 2.20 and the questionable text of Gen. 1.26 (<sc>mt</sc>), this schema was used in 14 texts (groups B and C in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0309089212466467">Table 2</xref>). Of these, seven (50%) are found in Genesis 6–9 (group C), while the other seven are scattered across and within five other books (group B). In the flood story itself, the habitat-locomotion schema was used seven times, while each of the other schemas found in the story was used only twice:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0309089212466467">17</xref></sup></p>

<p>Given that its presence within the textual record is heavily concentrated in the Genesis 6–9 story, and that it predominates within the Genesis 6–9 story itself, the habitat-locomotion schema clearly had strong associations with the telling of the primeval flood story. It is plausible, then, that this schema carried such an association in the minds of Hosea and his audience. This would support the idea that Hosea was referencing an element of the primeval flood story when he used that particular schema in Hos. 2.20.</p>
<p>Third, Hos. 2.20 deals with both human/animal conflict (v. 20a) and human/human conflict (v. 20bα). Genesis 9.2, which deals with human/animal conflict, is part of a larger textual complex which also deals with human/human conflict (Gen. 9.5–6). Thus, the human/animal conflict mentioned in Hos. 2.20 and Gen. 9.2 is associated with human/human conflict in both places.</p>
<p>Fourth, a covenant is made with animals in Hos. 2.20. Animals are, therefore, interested parties in the covenant. Elsewhere in the textual record, animals are instrumentalities in covenants between God and the Israelites that God uses to reward or punish the Israelites for their obedience or disobedience (e.g. Lev. 26.6, 22; Deut. 28.4, 18, 27, 31, 38–42, 51; 30.9; 32.24; see also Hos. 2.14). As instrumentalities, animals function as objects in the affairs of others. As interested parties, however, animals are subjects, having lives and interests of their own, and their existence has its own integrity. Note, then, that animals are interested parties in a covenant soon after Gen. 9.2, in Gen. 9.8–17, the only place in the Israelite textual record other than Hos. 2.20 where this occurs. Furthermore, animals are treated as subjects throughout the Genesis 6–9 story. For example, when God says there will be a flood, animals stand with human beings as those who will experience destruction and preservation (Gen. 6.7, 19–20; 7.1–4, 7–9, 21–23); when the flood is over, animals and human beings emerge from the ark together as those who will inhabit and fill the world (8.15–19); and when the parameters of their relationship in the postdiluvian world are established, animals stand with human beings as both victims and perpetrators (9.2–6). Thus, Gen. 9.2 is part of a narrative tradition which, like Hos. 2.20, thought of animals as subjects in the world, and as interested parties in a covenant.</p>
<p>In sum, the preceding four points, along with the earlier point that Hos. 2.20 and Gen. 9.2 are the only places in the textual record where the schema/subject combination appears, make a robust case that Hos. 2.20 and Gen. 9.2 are related in some way. While the precise nature of this relationship is beyond the scope of the present study, it seems reasonable to assume that, at the least, if they are related, they inhabit the same thought world regarding human/animal conflict. That is, they think about and understand human/animal conflict in the same way, and are thinking about the same conflict. Assuming this, reading Hos. 2.20 in light of Gen. 9.2 explains what conflict is being resolved in Hos. 2.20.</p>

<title>5. The Transformation of the Human/Animal Relationship</title>
<p>The Israelites believed that the human/animal relationship had changed over the course of time. According to Israel's Primeval History (Gen. 1–11), the amicable human/animal relationship that existed in the ante- and peridiluvian world (e.g. Gen. 2.19–20; 4.2, 20; 6.19–21; 7.8–9, 14–16; 8.1, 6–11, 18–19) became antagonistic in the postdiluvian world, when, as described in Gen. 9.2–6, God changed how human beings and animals related to each other. Specifically, in Gen. 9.2, God placed the fear (‭ארי‬) and terror (‭תתח‬) of human beings upon all animals, and gave all animals into the hands of human beings (‭ונתנםכדיב‬). The word combination ‘fear and terror’, as well as the words for terror (‭תתח‬; התחמ‬), were often used in contexts where there was grave conflict involving serious physical harm.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0309089212466467">18</xref></sup> The expression ‘given into the hands of’ was usually used in military contexts when one group was given into the hands of another to be killed, plundered, and/or exiled.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0309089212466467">19</xref></sup> These ideas in Gen. 9.2 are expanded on in Gen. 9.3–6, which notes that there will be violence and bloodshed on both sides, with human beings killing and eating animals, and animals killing human beings. Thus, God established an intense, bilateral conflict between human beings and animals in Gen. 9.2–6.</p>
<p>In light of this, if Hos. 2.20 and Gen. 9.2 are dealing with the same human/animal conflict, then they describe a paired set of events: the beginning of human/animal conflict in the distant past, and the end of that same conflict at some point in the future. In other words, Gen. 9.2–6 describes the primordial, postdiluvian transformation of the human/animal relationship from peaceful and amicable to antagonistic, while Hos. 2.20 describes the eventual transformation of the human/animal relationship from its present antagonism back to its peaceful and amicable ante- and peridiluvian state. Between these two events lies the antagonistic human/animal relationship experienced by the Israelites in their daily lives (e.g. Deut. 28.26; Ps. 124.7; Prov. 6.5; 7.22; Eccl. 9.12; Isa. 18.6; Hab. 2.17).</p>
<p>In terms of what this resolution would entail, based on what is mentioned in Gen. 9.2–6, the fear and terror of human beings would be lifted from animals, and the violent or carnivorous killing of animals by human beings and of human beings by animals would stop. It would also mean that human authority over animals would continue, and perhaps also that the sacrificial killing of animals by human beings would continue, since the Israelites understood that those things preceded the flood event and the creation of human/animal conflict (Gen. 1.26–28; 4.3–4; 8.20). Isaiah 11.6–9 confirms that the absence of fear and terror of human beings in animals, the absence of the violent or carnivorous killing of animals by human beings and of human beings by animals, and the continuation of human authority (since the little child leads the animals) were part of how some Israelites were thinking about the human/animal relationship in the future world. Caution must be used here, however, in specifically defining the entailments of Hos. 2.20. While it is reasonable to assume that Hos. 2.20 and the Gen. 9.2–6 tradition were extant at the same time, it is unclear whether all aspects of Gen. 9.2–6 as it now stands were part of Hosea's thought world; furthermore, a study would have to be made of Hosea's thinking about animal sacrifice before deciding whether he thought that sacrifice would continue in the future world.</p>
<p>In sum, if Hos. 2.20 is read in light of Gen. 9.2, then Hos. 2.20 was talking about the resolution of the longstanding and pervasive conflict between human beings and animals which God wove into the fabric of the postdiluvian world. Thus, it is describing a lasting, constitutional change to the human/animal relationship. This would explain why the resolution involves all animals and why it uses something as formal and significant as a covenant as the mechanism.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0309089212466467">
<title>6. The Configuration of the Covenant in Hosea 2.20</title>
<p>Having identified the human/animal conflict being resolved, there is something else about Hos. 2.20 that warrants scrutiny: the configuration of the covenant mentioned there, which is described in the following way: ‘I [God] will cut/make for them a covenant…with animals’ (‭יתרכ‬ ‭המדאה‬ ‭שמרו‬ ‭םימשה‬ ‭ךּוע־םעו‬ ‭הדשה‬ ‭תיה־מע…‭תירב‬ ‭מהל‬). The idiom of ‘cutting a covenant’ is regularly used in the textual record with the preposition ל or the preposition ‭םע‬.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0309089212466467">20</xref></sup> Its use with both at the same time, however, is unique to Hos. 2.20. As scholars have wrestled with how to understand this distinctive syntax, they have arrived at three explanations of how the covenant in Hos. 2.20 works. One, God will enter into a covenant with animals that will benefit those identified as ‘them’; thus, ‘I will enter into a covenant with animals for (the benefit of) them’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0309089212466467">21</xref></sup> Two, God will enter into a covenant with animals; thus, ‘I will enter into a covenant with them, (that is,) with animals’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0309089212466467">22</xref></sup> Three, God will broker a covenant between those identified as ‘them’ and animals; thus, ‘I will broker a covenant between them and animals’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0309089212466467">23</xref></sup> In sum, the covenant partners in Hos. 2.20 are either God and animals (nos. 1 and 2), or ‘them’ and animals (no. 3). The ‘them’ are either human beings (nos. 1 and 3) or animals (no. 2). When the ‘them’ are thought to be human beings, they are usually thought to be the Israelites.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0309089212466467">24</xref></sup> However, the use of a masculine plural pronoun to refer to the Israelites in Hos. 2.20 contrasts sharply with the feminine singular references found in the surrounding context (‘she/her’: 2.16, 17, 19, 25 [Eng. 14, 15, 17, 23]; ‘you’: 2.18, 21, 22 [Eng. 16, 19, 20]). Consequently, the ‘them’ are sometimes thought to be human beings in general or the children of Hosea and Gomer (Hos. 1.2–9; 2.4, 25 [Eng. 2, 23]).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0309089212466467">25</xref></sup> The shift in pronouns is also sometimes thought to reflect the fact that Hos. 2.16–25 (Eng. 14–23) is a composite of independent statements which referred to the Israelites differently.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0309089212466467">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reading Hos. 2.20 together with Gen. 9.2 suggests a way through this thicket of issues and interpretations. The basic parameters of the conflict created in Gen. 9.2 are these: the author of the conflict is God, the participants in the conflict are human beings (notably referred to with a masculine plural pronoun) and animals, and the direction of the antagonism is bilateral, with human beings harming animals and animals harming human beings. It is possible that the resolution of this conflict would be configured differently, but this seems unlikely. The resolution of a conflict must inevitably address and work with the particulars of the conflict which it is resolving. This is true, for example, of the conflict/resolution sequence of Gen. 6.7 and 9.8–17, which has some association with the conflict/resolution sequence of Gen. 9.2 and Hos. 2.20, since Gen. 9.8–17 is not only proximate to Gen. 9.2, but also the only place in the textual record other than Hos. 2.20 where animals are interested parties in a covenant. With Gen. 6.7/9.8–17, the configuration of the conflict created in Gen. 6.7 (where God says he will kill human beings and animals through flooding) and the configuration of its covenantal resolution in Gen. 9.8–17 (where God says he will never again kill human beings and animals through flooding) are the same: the author of both the conflict and its resolution is God, the participants in both are God and humans/animals, and the direction of both the antagonism and conciliation is unilateral (God will kill; God will not kill):</p>

<graphic alt-version="no" position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_0309089212466467-fig4.tif" xlink:type="simple"/>
</fig>
<p>Assuming, then, that there will be some amount of symmetry between a conflict and its resolution, the following is the configuration of the conflict created in Gen. 9.2, and the corresponding configuration of its resolution:</p>
<fig id="fig5-0309089212466467" position="float">
<graphic alt-version="no" position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_0309089212466467-fig5.tif" xlink:type="simple"/>
</fig>
<p>As indicated, the author of the resolution of the conflict created in Gen. 9.2 would be God, the resolution would take place between all human beings and all animals, and the direction of the conciliation would be bilateral, with human beings behaving peacefully towards animals and animals behaving peacefully towards human beings. In light of this, and assuming that Hos. 2.20 contains the resolution of the conflict created in Gen. 9.2, the correct interpretation of the statement ‘I will cut/make for them a covenant…with the animals’ found in Hos. 2.20 would be, ‘I [God] will broker a covenant between human beings and animals’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0309089212466467">27</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0309089212466467">
<title>7. The Human Participants</title>
<p>Having explained the configuration of the covenant, there is one final thing to consider about Hos. 2.20. As was just presented, a strict structural correspondence between the resolution in Hos. 2.20 and the conflict in Gen. 9.2 indicates that human beings, and not just the Israelites, participate in the covenant with animals announced in Hos. 2.20. The geographical focus of Hosea, however, is the land of Canaan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0309089212466467">28</xref></sup> For example, the two main sections of Hosea (Hos. 1–3 and 4–14) each begin with a reference to the land associated with the relationship between God and Israel (Hos. 1.2; 4.1); the land is also referenced in Hos. 2.20bα. Furthermore, the Israelites are a pervasive presence throughout Hosea 2: as the wife/mother (e.g. Hos. 2.4, 7, 18 [Eng. 2, 5, 16]), as the mother's children (Hos. 2.4, 6, 25 [Eng. 2, 4, 23]), and as a group (Hos. 2.10 [Eng. 8]). It might be argued, then, that Hosea would have only had the Israelites in mind when describing the covenant with animals in 2.20. This would not, of course, correspond to what is found in Gen. 9.2. However, an adjustment to the content of Gen. 9.2 is already found in Hos. 2.20 (the absence of aquatic animals). Thus, it is possible that Hosea also made an adjustment in the human participants.</p>
<p>Note two things, however. First, the Israelites are not alone in the mental landscape created by Hos. 2. The lovers that the wife/mother goes after are also there (Hos. 2.7, 9, 12, 14, 15 [Eng. 5, 7, 10, 12, 13]). These lovers are Canaanite gods (which implies the presence of Canaanites), and/or non-Israelites with whom the Israelites are entering into alliances.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0309089212466467">29</xref></sup> These lovers are present when God humiliates the wife/mother (Hos. 2.12 [Eng. 10]), and one can imagine them as observers of what happens thereafter, as when God supplies the wife/mother with what she and they thought they were supplying her with (Hos. 2.23–25 [Eng. 21–23]). Thus, both Israelites and non-Israelites are part of the mental landscape surrounding Hos. 2.20. Second, if Hos. 2.20 is indeed announcing a lasting constitutional change in how human beings and animals relate to each other, and not just a temporary détente, a nationally or ethnically limited implementation of this change would create a logistical muddle. For example, limited implementation would mean (1) that human beings and animals would act one way towards each other in Canaan (where the Israelites are), but another way in Egypt and Assyria (where the ‘political’ lovers are; Hos. 7.11), and/or (2) that the wild animals on the hillsides surrounding the city of Samaria would continue to fear Canaanites (the followers of the ‘divine’ lovers), but would no longer fear Israelites.</p>
<p>In sum, a strong case can be made for humankind being the human participants in the covenant with animals announced in Hos. 2.20. This is not unassailable, however. In the end, perhaps it can simply be said that, if the Israelites were the official human participants in the covenant, the impact of the covenant would not be limited to them, but would extend to humankind (and aquatic animals) as well, or that, if human beings were the official human participants, the point of the covenant was to create the environment within which the Israelites and their restored relationship with God could flourish.</p>
<p>In either case, the rest of the argument made above remains true. The covenant announced in Hos. 2.20 is brokered by God between animals and (some grouping of) human beings, and it resolves the human/animal conflict created in Gen. 9.2.</p>
