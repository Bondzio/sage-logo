<p>We live in an age where a plethora of definitions exists for what constitutes narrative depending on the disciplinary context from which it is approached. While this breadth of definitional possibility may reflect the ongoing expansion of cultural and technological means of expression, to some it may trivialise the term ‘narrative’ as something too all-encompassing to be truly meaningful. In <italic>Contemporary Narrative: Textual Production, Multimodality and Multiliteracies</italic>, Fiona Doloughan illuminates the theoretical foundations she draws out in the opening chapter by skilfully employing a case study approach that situates her discussion of narrative in relation to specifically chosen texts.</p>
<p>Each chapter focuses on a different aspect of contemporary narrative. For example, chapter five, ‘Cultural transformations of narrative’, discusses adaptations of classic texts by contemporary authors, in this case Jeanette Winterson’s transformation of Woolf’s <italic>Orlando</italic> in her novel <italic>Sexing the Cherry</italic>, and Ali Smith’s re-imagining of Ovid’s <italic>Metamorphoses</italic> in her story <italic>Girl Meets Boy</italic>. This case study approach enables the reader to examine the book’s key ideas one by one, rendering an otherwise overwhelming subject manageable.</p>
<p>The overall structure of the book may be seen to reflect the developmental trajectory of the narrative form itself: from the more structured temporal constraints of the traditional novel, through the deconstruction of the form via the incorporation of visual elements and increased hybridity of modes and media, intercultural adaptations and transformations, to the contemporary emphasis on the suspension of temporal order. The penultimate chapter, focusing on narratives of travel, illustrates most explicitly the implications of this suspension and disruption, and the move towards a greater spatialization in narrative. Doloughan understands this shift as reflective of the compression of space in the wider world, characterised by mobile and internet technology, as well as a shrinking of time precipitated by an increase in available transport.</p>
<p>The opening chapter sets out the aims of the book: not to provide definitive answers about an ever-evolving form dictated by the production of new texts, but to give the reader a sense of the cultural significance of narratives, as well as a clearer understanding of how and by what means they are constructed and translated across different modes and cultures. Doloughan offers a useful historical context by citing theorists of classical (Genette; Bal), as well as post-classical (Herman; Ryan) narratology. The position she maps out for narrative in the contemporary world is one that embodies multimodality, translation and transformation. The book provides a helpful guide to current ideas in contemporary narrative, interweaving them with insights from linguistics, critical theory and social semiotics, in particular the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357212454255">Gunter Kress (2010)</xref>. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470357212454255">Bahktin (2004)</xref>, Doloughan espouses the view that narrative is inherently a dialogic process of co-construction between creator and audience. Outside the confines of the book under review, this position can be seen as reflected in a broader multimodal culture where ‘sharing’ predominates via the now widespread use of mobile and social networking technologies. Throughout the book Doloughan revisits the theory and terminology she outlines in the initial chapter. Combined with the inclusion of a glossary of key terms, this serves to synthesise the theory underpinning the book with the case studies cited.</p>
<p>While Doloughan’s book covers a wide range of themes, she is clear to emphasise in the introductory chapter the importance of situating ‘definitions of and approaches to narrative in relation to disciplinary, epistemological and methodological preferences’ (p. 12). To place the book in relation to the current journal, the remainder of this review will focus on Doloughan’s discussion of the move towards the visual in narrative.</p>
<p>It might be suggested that multimodality merely gives a label to a perspective that has been present in the novel form since at least the narrative experimentation of the modernists of the early and mid 20th century, if not before. For example, Stephan Dedalus, the main protagonist in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470357212454255">Joyce’s (1922/1993)</xref> <italic>Ulysses</italic> muses on ‘the ineluctable modality of the visible’ (p. 37), the same novel ending with an extended interior monologue devoid of punctuation. To delve further back to the 18th century, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470357212454255">Sterne’s (1759–1767/1991)</xref> <italic>Tristram Shandy</italic>, the experimental form of which anticipated the stream of consciousness writing of Joyce and Woolf, includes a black page in the midst of its narrative (p. 73). In the context of contemporary multimodal realisations of narrative, it is worth noting here a recent interdisciplinary project organised by the Laurence Sterne Trust for which 73 artists across a range of disciplines created their own versions of the black page (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.laurencesternetrust.org.uk/exhibition.php?id=42">http://www.laurencesternetrust.org.uk/exhibition.php?id=42</ext-link>). Among other things, this black page has been interpreted as an ironic visual representation of the central character’s inability to express the feelings regarding death that overwhelm him (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357212454255">Yandell’s, 2012</xref>, comments on the black page in his review of the <italic>Shandy</italic> edition published by Visual Editions in 2010). The inability to express oneself verbally is also echoed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357212454255">Eliot’s (1974)</xref> poem ‘The Lovesong of J. Alfred Prufrock’, as well as the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357212454255">Samuel Beckett (2006)</xref>. In their attempts to solve this dilemma, Beckett’s characters either resort to silence or to manic gabbling. Beckett’s tragi-comic prose and drama also draws extensively on the visual and gestural modes of silent film. While these modernist texts and the texts dissected in the current book are still predominantly verbal in form (as is wider literary culture), the difference now is one of modality. Groundbreaking authors such as Beckett drew richly on other mediums, such as film and visual art, to express their literary ideas, but their individual works remained situated within boundaried disciplines, e.g. drama, poetry and novels. Contemporary narrative may be characterised as more overtly multimodal in form, reflecting the ongoing social proliferation of readily available multimodal communication technologies. Indeed, Doloughan’s argument is, to a great extent, informed by the notion that it is now the screen, rather than the printed page, that is becoming the dominant site of the appearance of text.</p>
<p>In chapter two, ‘Intermodal translation’, Doloughan explores how verbal and visual modes intersect within single texts. The chapter provides case studies from the literary field (Sebald’s <italic>Austerlitz</italic>), and the visual field (Seawright’s <italic>Hidden</italic>). In the case of <italic>Austerlitz</italic>, charting ‘the story of one man’s discovery of his true identity and his eventual confrontation with the uncomfortable and traumatic “facts” of his existence’ (p. 28), photographs are incorporated at key points in the text, disrupting the flow of the narrative. As the visuals are not uniformly separated from the text but sometimes appear mid-sentence, butting into the flow of the text, they break up the traditional temporal linearity of the narrative. This ‘forcing into consciousness’ (p. 34) of these images upsets the strictly coded linear reading path of the printed page, thus creating more space and potential for the reader’s interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357212454255">Kress and Van Leeuwen, 2006</xref>). Indeed, Doloughan explains this disruption of the traditionally linear narrative form as both a spatialization of the temporal and a temporalization of the spatial. An example of the latter is the inclusion of two contrasting images; one of Austerlitz’s untidy room and, in another part of the book, the neat sterility of the record room at Terezin concentration camp. While separated spatially, being situated physically in different parts of the book, it is suggested that over time and when related to other images within the text, configurations of associated meanings develop.</p>
<p>Doloughan draws on the theories of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357212454255">Barthes (1977)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470357212454255">Sontag (1977)</xref>, usefully synthesising them with her reading of the author’s motivation to employ images in this text. This interweaving of perspectives exemplifies the book’s dual strengths, namely the breadth of its cross-disciplinary approach coupled with rich insights provided by individual case studies. The inclusion of photographs in <italic>Austerlitz</italic> is also described as providing records to ‘supplement, if not antidote, the inadequacies and betrayals of language ‘(p. 36). Furthermore, the reader is seen as a co-constructor of the disrupted narrative in that a shared cultural knowledge of the horrors of the holocaust is assumed in Sebald’s filling of gaps in the narrative with particular images. What cannot be communicated verbally may be visually communicated, but this may require different ‘semiotic work’ on the part of the reader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357212454255">Kress, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>While in <italic>Austerlitz</italic> images are employed, in part, to make up for the limitations of language, thus demonstrating the potential of photographs, Doloughan next cites Seawright’s photographs of the desolate landscapes of Afghanistan war zones. The discussion that follows indicates that visual modes also have representational limitations. Seawright’s work consciously draws upon these formal limitations. By photographing places of conflict after those involved have left the scene, Seawright attempts to communicate what cannot be physically seen from a mere surface viewing. Doloughan cites Seawright’s work as evidence that ‘what is excluded from a composition can be as significant as what is included’ (p. 41). It is suggested that Seawright’s photographs also operate at both the temporal and spatial level. In temporal terms, the ambiguous, ‘hidden’, content of the images calls upon viewers to draw on their own historical and cultural knowledge, thus placing them temporally. In spatial terms, the physical image shown to the viewer may serve as only an index to the complexity of the narratives that lie beyond the horizon. This leads to greater reliance on a co-construction of meaning between maker and recipient, and is on the increase as multidimensional modes and mediums of expression proliferate.</p>
<p>The next chapter, ‘Intermedial translation’, discusses this shift in the writer–reader dynamic in relation to the increasing interactivity afforded to users of digital technologies. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470357212454255">Kress (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470357212454255">Vygotsky (1978)</xref>, the suggestion is made that, while multimodal onscreen environments may not give precedence to one set of tools over another, these different modes of engaging with the world make plausible the questioning of the long-standing separation of mind and body in Western thinking (p. 65). In interactive, digitally co-constructed, exclusively online narratives, such as ‘inanimate alive’ (discussed in this chapter), the reader’s experience is rendered more multisensory through the use of sound and image cues rather than over-relying on language. Furthermore, material extension of readers’ sense of effective involvement in the narrative is given added credence by the increased opportunities for embodiment afforded through their physical interaction with the mouse, keyboard and resultant changes in the onscreen narrative. This emphasises two key strands interwoven throughout the book under review: an increase in available modes and media through which to produce narratives is reflected in an increased dependency on an ongoing interactive dialogue between reader/viewer and writer/producer; and a shift away from an emphasis on the temporality of narrative as seen in the traditional novel, to an increasingly spatial one evidenced by contemporary artists’ traversing of multiple modes and media.</p>
<p>One criticism is that Doloughan could have drawn on a more diverse range of case studies. Both Woolf and Smith are multiply cited. Examples of other relevant works might include Winterbottom’s film adaptation of Sterne’s novel, <italic>Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story</italic> (dir. Winterbottom, 2006), and the 2002 film, <italic>Adaptation</italic> (dir. Jonze, 2002), in both of which fictional adaptation and reportage narrative intersect in interesting ways. Additionally, the book may have benefited from interspersing the printed text with images itself. This would have served to demonstrate first-hand the disruptive effect that Doloughan suggests the visual can have on the temporal flow of verbal narrative.</p>
<p>Overall, Doloughan’s book is a timely reflection of the ways in which contemporary narrative is moving beyond the constraints of the printed word and the traditional novel into territories more predominantly visual and interactive. By exploring the production of narrative through the frame of multimodality and multiliteracy, this book may prove to be an important reflection of the wider landscape of human communication in which language is no longer seen as the pre-eminent form.</p>
