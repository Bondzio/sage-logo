<p>Compared to extrusion and injection, hot-press molding can produce natural fiber plastic composites with many advantages. In this study, large cotton stalk bundles and HDPE composites were fabricated using hot-press molding. The effects of fiber size and drying temperature on the mechanical properties and thickness swelling of these composites were investigated. Cotton stalk bundles of three different sizes were oven-dried at 100°C 120°C, 140°C, and 170°C for 24 h. MAPE (5%) and phenol formaldehyde resin (5%) were added to enhance the interfacial bonding between the bundles and HDPE. Results showed that the mechanical properties of composites increased with the size of the cotton stalk bundles. The best mechanical properties were created at drying temperatures of 100°C and 140°C, with an obvious drop at drying temperatures of 120°C and 170°C. Thickness swelling of the composites was greatly improved and below 5%. The composites showed the lowest thickness swelling at a drying temperature of 170°C, and the highest at 120°C. Good bonding was found between cotton stalk fibers and HDPE, due to the addition of MAPE.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0731684411435726" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Natural fiber plastic composites (NFPCs) are a relatively new class of polymeric composites that is growing fast in the composites industry. NFPCs consist of a mixture of natural fibers (such as wood, kenaf, and banana fibers), and thermoplastics (such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE), high-density polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride), along with some additives (such as silane coupling agents, maleated anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) and maleated anhydride grafted polyethylene (MAPE)). There are mainly three methods of manufacturing NFPCs: extrusion, injection, and traditional hot-press molding. Compared to extrusion and injection, hot-press molding can produce composites at a higher productivity with lower pressure requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684411435726">1</xref></sup> The hot-press process also enables higher fiber loading with significantly larger dimensions, thus producing composites with improved performance at lower density and cost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684411435726">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684411435726">3</xref></sup> In addition, combining natural fibers with thermoplastics results in composites that are more moisture resistant, yet yields similar mechanical properties as medium-density fiberboard (MDF) and particle board.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684411435726">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684411435726">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Various parameters influence the properties of fiber-reinforced composites, including the fiber loading, fiber aspect ratio, fiber–matrix adhesion, stress transfer at the interface, and mixing temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684411435726">6</xref></sup> Many researchers report the effects of fiber loading on NFPCs’ properties, and most studies show that the tensile strength (TS), modulus of rupture (MOR) increases, while internal bonds (IBs) decrease as fiber loading increases;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684411435726">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684411435726">7</xref></sup> therefore, this research will not focus on fiber loading. Long fibers create an increased network system, resulting in increased bending properties of composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684411435726">1</xref></sup> Increasing fiber size increase the melt index, flexural and tensile modulus, as well as tensile elongation at break.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684411435726">8</xref></sup> Our previous research investigated the properties of HDPE and cotton stalk bundle composites, demonstrating that composite panels with oriented and long cotton stalk bundles perform at a relatively high level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684411435726">9</xref></sup> However, more researches are needed, since effects of large fiber size (above 10 mm in length) on properties of composites were less reported.</p>
<p>Because natural fibers are hydrophilic and plastics are hydrophobic, polar cotton stalk fibers have inherently low compatibility with the non-polar HDPE matrix, preventing the formation of a durable interface and leading to failure during the stress transfer from one phase to another. Thermal treatment of natural fibers is an effective physical method to improve adhesion between natural fibers and the thermoplastic matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684411435726">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684411435726">11</xref></sup> Recent research done by Ayrilmis and Buyuksari<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684411435726">12</xref></sup> showed that thermal treatment improved the thickness swelling of MDF made by cotton stalk with little decrease in MOR and modulus of elasticity (MOE). Youngquist et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684411435726">13</xref></sup> found that the addition of phenolic resin into wood fiber polymer composites greatly increased TS, IB, MOR, and MOE, and decreased the water absorption and thickness swelling. Ayrilmis and Jarusombuti<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684411435726">1</xref></sup> and Ashori and Nourbakhsh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684411435726">7</xref></sup> showed that MAPP significantly influenced TS, IB, MOR, and MOE, but had a less effect on thickness swelling. MAPE has also been shown to perform better than MAPP in polyethylene based natural fiber composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684411435726">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The objective of this study was to use cotton stalk bundles and HDPE to fabricate composites with hot-press molding. Phenol formaldehyde (PF) resin and MAPE were added to enhance the compatibility between cotton stalks and HDPE. The effects of fiber size and thermal treatment temperature on mechanical properties and thickness swelling of composite panels were investigated. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was also used to observe the interface between cotton stalk bundles and HDPE.</p></sec>

MAPE (5%), 5 wt% of PF resin, 35 wt% of HDPE, and 55 wt% cotton stalk bundles were used. The manufacture process is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684411435726">Figure 1</xref>. PF resin was first sprayed onto the cotton stalk bundles after drying. For fine and short bundles, HDPE flour was added, and then mixed in a high-speed blender for 5 min. The mixture was weighed and formed into a mat on a stainless steel caul with a forming mold frame. Since it is difficult to mix the HDPE flour and long cotton stalks in a blender homogenously without breaking the long bundles, the long cotton stalks were pre-pressed at room temperature to form four loose sheets for each mat, and the HDPE and MAPE flour mixtures were manually applied onto the loose sheets and formed into a mat in a forming mold frame. Mineral-oil releasing agent was used to prevent adhesion between mat and caul, and a top caul was placed on the top of the mat after forming. Mats were placed into an oil-heated press machine to press at 170°C. The whole process was thickness controlled. It took 20 s to reduce the mat thickness to 12 mm, and then 40 s to 10 mm. After that, the thickness was fixed at 10 mm for 10 min. Finally, the heater was turned off and the panels were cooled gradually to 35°C before they were removed.

<p>Natural fibers are hydrophilic porous composites of cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose polymer that are rich in functional groups, such as hydroxyls. Thermal treatment changes their chemical composition by degrading and volatilization. The chemical changes due to heating depend on the duration and temperature of the treatment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684411435726">16</xref></sup> and the chemical changes consequently affect the mechanical properties. Effects of drying temperature on mechanical properties are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684411435726">Figure 2</xref>. An initial drop of mechanical properties was observed when drying temperature increased from 100°C to 120°C. The hemicelluloses are the first structural compounds to be thermally affected, even at low temperatures, but cellulose is less affected by the thermal treatments, probably because of its crystalline nature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684411435726">1</xref></sup> Therefore, the hemicelluloses began to degrade when the drying temperature increased from 100°C to 120°C and treated for 24 h, resulting in lower mechanical properties. One of the main heat-treated natural fiber limitations is the decrease of mechanical strength, making this fibers unsuitable for most structural applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684411435726">17</xref></sup>
<fig id="fig2-0731684411435726" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Effects of drying temperature on mechanical properties of composites: (a) TS; (b) MOR; and (c) MOE.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684411435726-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>When drying temperature increased to 140°C, an obvious increase of mechanical properties of composites was observed, compared to that of composites with a drying temperature of 120°C. Furthermore, composites had a similar MOR and MOE at drying temperatures of 100°C and 140°C. The heat-treated fibers have a higher content of lignin and a smaller content of hemicelluloses, as well as a polycondensation reaction with other cell wall components. This results in further cross-linking, while at the same time, the lignin starts to degrade slightly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684411435726">18</xref></sup> The increased lignin content decreases the surface energy of fibers, and this lower surface energy improves wettability between natural fibers and polymer matrix.</p>
<p>Wetting of fiber plays a key role in the fiber–matrix adhesion, because it increases mechanical interlocking, contributing to the increase of mechanical properties. The addition of MAPE is crucial to improve the TS of composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684411435726">19</xref></sup> The MA groups of MAPE covalently link with the hydroxyl groups of the fibers forming an ester linkage. Furthermore, the non-polar part of MAPE becomes compatible with the virgin matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684411435726">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684411435726">21</xref></sup> Therefore, in spite of decomposition of much hemicelluloses and little lignin, the mechanical properties were higher at a drying temperature of 140°C than 120°C, due to cross-linking reaction, better wettability, and mechanical interlocking.</p>
<p>Previous thermal gravimetric analysis showed that cotton stalk fibers presented two decomposition steps. The biggest mass loss of cotton stalk fibers occurred between 220°C and 380°C, with a mass loss of about 66% that result from the decomposition of lignocellulosic constituents. The mass loss was about 1.1% between 105°C and 220°C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684411435726">9</xref></sup> However, when the duration of drying was long enough, for example, 24 h, the natural fibers degraded at a lower temperature. More hemicelluloses and lignin were degraded at a drying temperature of 170°C, and the hemicrystalline celluloses may also have begun to degrade, resulting in an obvious drop of mechanical properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684411435726">Figure 2</xref>). The maximum values of mechanical properties are observed at drying temperatures of 100°C and 140°C, and the minimum values of mechanical properties are attained at drying temperatures of 120°C and 170°C.</p></sec>

<p>Increased mechanical properties with high <italic>L</italic>/<italic>D</italic> ratios of wood plastic composites have been reported by many authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684411435726">22</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684411435726">24</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684411435726">Figure 2</xref> shows that mechanical properties rise with increased bundle size. There is a slight increase in the mechanical properties of composites from fine bundles to short ones.

<p>The value of the mechanical properties of fine-bundle and short-bundle composites are quite close to standard MDF and particle board, even though panel densities are quite low.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684411435726">Figure 3</xref> shows the effects of cotton stalk drying temperature on the thickness swelling of composites. Maximum thickness swelling is observed at a drying temperature of 120°C, while the lowest thickness swelling occurs at 170°C. Cellulose crystallinity increases due to degradation of amorphous cellulose, resulting in an decreased accessibility of hydroxyl groups to water molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731684411435726">26</xref></sup> This in turn decreases the equilibrium moisture content and consequently decreases the thickness swelling of composite panels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684411435726">27</xref></sup> The decomposition of hemicelluloses is the major reason that the thickness swelling of composites decreases as natural fiber drying temperature rises.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684411435726">17</xref></sup> However, there is a slight rise in thickness swelling at 120°C. This is mainly due to decreased bonding between cotton stalk bundles and HDPE at this temperature. Many voids within the composites represent water sites, resulting in higher water content in the composites after 24 h of water immersion.
<fig id="fig3-0731684411435726" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Effects of drying temperature on thickness swelling of composites.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684411435726-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684411435726">Figure 3</xref> also shows that composites with short bundles have the greatest thickness swelling, and composites with long bundles have the lowest one. It is easier to mix the smaller fiber with HDPE, MAPE, and PF resin homogeneously, and fewer voids are produced in the composite panel, contributing to less thickness swelling. In addition, short bundles are larger in length and thickness than fine bundles, so that less HDPE, MAPE, and PF resin enter them. Therefore, it is easier for water to penetrate into short bundles than fine ones, resulting in more fiber expansion in short bundles, which consequently increases thickness swelling. Long fibers account for less volume than fine and short fibers of the same weight, making it easier for HDPE to wrap around the bundles and resist water penetration. In addition, the HDPE in the composites with long bundles is connected to a network, and this network produces a force that prevents the expansion of cotton stalk fibers. Therefore, composite panels with long fibers have reasonably low thickness swelling.</p>
<p>The ability of water molecules to penetrate composites is greatly influenced by the quality of fiber–matrix adhesion, but not by whether the fibers are hydrophilic or hydrophobic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684411435726">19</xref></sup> MAPE can improve fiber–matrix adhesion, limiting the free movement of water molecules at the interface between fibers and the matrix, and reducing the number of paths for water molecules to penetrate further inside the fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731684411435726">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731684411435726">29</xref></sup> The addition of PF resin improves the bonding between cotton stalk bundles, diminishing the thickness swelling. The thickness swelling after 24 h of water absorption is under 5%, which is less than traditional MDF and particle board. These results are similar to those reported by many other researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684411435726">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684411435726">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684411435726">24</xref></sup> The results of analysis of variation in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0731684411435726">Table 5</xref> reveals that all sources of variation were highly significant.

<p>The morphological structures of cotton stalks and HDPE composites are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684411435726">Figure 4</xref>. The interface between cotton stalk bundles and HDPE is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684411435726">Figure 4(a)</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684411435726">Figure 4(b)</xref> shows the interface between cotton stalk bundles, PF, and HDPE. There are no gaps between cotton stalk bundles and HDPE, indicating good bonding in the interface between cotton stalk bundles and HDPE. This is because the addition of MAPE increases wettability between the bundles and the matrix. However, small gaps exist between the PF resin and matrix, and this has a negative effect on the mechanical interlocking between natural fibers and HDPE. This in turn may result in reduced mechanical properties and increased thickness swelling. However, PF resin may enhance the bonding between cotton stalk bundles.

<p>This study showed that the mechanical properties of cotton stalk bundles and HDPE composites grow with the increasing size of cotton stalk bundles. The mechanical properties of composites with long bundles were found to be two to three times that of composites with fine and short bundles. The best mechanical properties were created at drying temperatures of 100°C and 140°C, with an obvious drop at drying temperatures of 120°C and 170°C. The thickness swelling of the composites was found to be under 5%, and greatly improved compared to standard MDF and medium particle board. The composites showed the lowest thickness swelling at a drying temperature of 170°C and the highest at 120°C. Bonding was found to be good between cotton stalk fibers and HDPE, due to the addition of MAPE. PF resin enhances the bonding between bundles, but may have a negative effect on the wettability between bundles and HDPE matrix.</p></sec>
