<title>Case</title>
<p>A 41-year-old female patient presented with unstable angina pectoris. Her coronary angiogram showed critical stenoses in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the right coronary artery (RCA). The mid and proximal LAD lesions were predilated with a 2.5-20 mm balloon. The mid segment was stented successfully without incident. Subsequently, a 2.5-28 mm Promus<sup>®</sup> Element stent (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112448110">Figure 1</xref>, panel B) was implanted in the proximal lesion. Then, a 2.75-15 mm non-compliant balloon was advanced for the post-dilatation of the proximal Promus<sup>®</sup> Element stent. Although there was some resistance while advancing the balloon, it was passed into the stented segment. While imaging for positioning of the balloon, the implanted Promus<sup>®</sup> stent was found to be shortened significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112448110">Figure 1</xref>, panel C). When measured, the original stent length of 28 mm was found to be shortened to 21 mm. As the final result was technically satisfactory, no further stenting was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112448110">Figure 1</xref>, panel D).</p>

<title>Comment</title>
<p>Longitudinal stent compression is a recently recognised complication of modern stent platforms. Although thin-strut stents have the advantage of increased deliverability and flexibility, they seem to have lower longitudinal strength. In a recent report, stent deformation was reported to occur in 0.097% of stents deployed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112448110">1</xref></sup> Longitudinal stent deformation was seen most commonly with Promus<sup>®</sup> Element stents and the rate was reported to be 0.86%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112448110">1</xref></sup> In a laboratory experiment to assess the longitudinal strength of modern stents, a certain amount of force (50 gram force) was applied and the stents of the offset peak-to-peak design category (Element stent platform) had an average longitudinal compression of 13.20 mm (longitudinal compression of 47.07%), showing a markedly lower resistance to longitudinal compression than the other platforms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112448110">2</xref></sup> The reported mechanisms of</p> <p>longitudinal deformation are guide catheter compression of osteal stents, compression by proximal embolic protection catheter or Guideliner catheter and compression by post-dilatation balloon that would not readily pass into the stent deployed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112448110">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112448110">3</xref></sup> In most of the reported cases, compression was caused by the guide catheter or another device, mostly to the stents deployed in the osteal location. In our case, the longitudinal compression was caused by a post-dilatation balloon in a non-osteal location. The treatment of this complication often requires the use of a series of dilatation balloons, depending on the extent of compression.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize this relatively new complication of modern stents quickly. Otherwise, it could pose as a nidus for stent thrombosis. Moreover, the diseased segment could have been left uncovered by the stent. Our case and recently reported similar cases suggest that manufacturers should not neglect the importance of longitudinal strength in designing future stents.</p>
