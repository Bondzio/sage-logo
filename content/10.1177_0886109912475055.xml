<p>What is woman? This seems like a fundamental question. What is your gender? Are you a man? Or are you a woman? The pathway to answering these questions should, at least theoretically, be easy or, at least, easier then delving into complex questions, such as What is feminism? In reality, the gender question is simple when answered by cisgender people about their own gender identities. Defining gender has become more complex as we recognize the multitude of ways in which gender is fluid despite our history of creating dichotomous socially constructed gender categories. Gender, once easily defined in a static world dominated and defined by cisgender people, is now one of the characteristics that is targeted for microaggressions and macroaggressions by an uniformed and intolerant society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886109912475055">Ross-Sheriff, 2012</xref>) whose definition of gender is strictly limited to one kind of female or male. In fact, today, we are forced to face the expanding notion of gender or be in danger of passively supporting the high rates of violence that are inflicted on gender queer and transgender people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886109912475055">Stotzer, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Not unlike other historically underrepresented and marginalized people, the inclusion of the voices of gender queer and transgender people is a slow process that often results in the recognition of the omission (rather than the inclusion) of transgender and gender queer perspectives, voices, and presence among decision makers, power brokers, and knowledge producers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886109912475055">Gringeri &amp; Roche, 2010</xref>). Traditionally, the solution to include historically marginalized and underrepresented people is first to raise awareness about their absence and plan a strategy to include them in our realm. Inclusion often takes the form of looking to our social or professional network to find a representative of the missing demographic, so that the void can be filled. The final step is that we become vigilant in our attempt to include all voices by making sure that the right number of representatives are at <italic>our</italic> table. These efforts become evident when we reduce our colleagues to their demographic characteristics. We then congratulate ourselves on meeting our demographic need (in the spirit of equity). The problem is thus solved.</p>
<p>This process of attempting to include all voices, while familiar, continues to plague us and makes us susceptible to the same attacks that our nation’s universities are experiencing in the areas of affirmative action. It is our focus on the number or presence of “minority” people, rather than on the power dynamics that recreate the structural exclusion of historically underrepresented and marginalized people. This view leads us to focus on the <italic>minimum</italic> number needed. Our attempt to intervene in this way leads us to thinking errors described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886109912475055">Kincheloe and Steinberg (1997</xref>) as liberal or, at best, left essentialist multiculturalism. In other words, the depth of our understanding about social and structural exclusion remains at the level of celebrating diversity by hanging pictures of people representing various shades of color or understanding the contributions of our colleagues as one dimensional and representational.</p>
<p>The critical analysis of the dynamics of power and privilege moves us toward environments of equity and respect, but it is not the end point of the journey. A critical analysis of power identifies the problem but does little to move us to a solution. How often have we heard our privileged students question us about what to do about their privilege or, worse, leave our classrooms feeling disengaged, disempowered, and guilty? As it turns out, acknowledging the structural dynamics of power and privilege and its associated exclusionary practices is not the most treacherous juncture in the road to equity and justice. The difficulty lies in radically attending to our active and passive participation in acts of social and institutional exclusion. Little time is spent preparing ourselves, our colleagues, and institutions for the process of inclusion that requires recognizing the socially acceptable patterns of microaggression and inhospitality. As a result, our efforts at inclusion can leave the “included” feeling or experiencing increased marginality and stress.</p>
<p>The history of <italic>Affilia</italic> is rooted in issues of exclusion and inclusion. The creation of this journal occurred as a result of the founders’ experiences of exclusion as feminist scholars. The founders used their experiences of exclusion to create a platform of inclusion that was and is committed to scholarship that contains an underlying value and belief in equity, justice, and research accountability. <italic>Affilia</italic> has been and will continue to be dedicated to growing and evolving scholarship and scholars who are unafraid to address inequity through research, policy analysis, and theoretical development.</p>
<p>As the new editor in chief and coeditor in chief, we are dedicated to continuing the work initiated by journal founder Bernice Saunders (for a full list of founders, past EIC, corporate and editorial members see Ross-Sheriff, 2012a), recently revisited by immediate past editor in chief Fariyal Ross-Sheriff (2012b) and Christina Gringeri and Susan Roche (2010), and created by the editorial and corporate boards to attend to the radical exclusion of the voices, works, and research that make up the scholarship of <italic>feminisms</italic>. We are feminist scholars who are dedicated to a vision of feminisms that inhabits a continuous space of dialogue and discourse that moves us to think about and utilize feminist and womanist principles. Although we are committed to this process, we are not naive about the personal and professional obstacles that are involved in holding open a creative space that encourages the creative questioning, construction, and deconstructions of scholarship in pursuit of a full understanding of the dynamics of the human condition and social institutions. We understand that we benefit from the achievements (and perhaps failures) of the hundreds of activists in antioppression movements about race, gender, interpersonal violence, gay rights, and so forth. Nonetheless, we charge forward with the promise and obligation to live and promote the mission of <italic>Affilia</italic>. As activist, scholar, and lawyer Barbara J. Hart has said publicly many times, “the hardest thing to do is to truly live your mission.”</p>
