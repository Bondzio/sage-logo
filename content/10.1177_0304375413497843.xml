<abstract>
<p>The originary figure of the Western political subject is neither the Aristotelian <italic>zōon politikon</italic> nor the Agambenian <italic>homo sacer</italic> but the Socratic <italic>erēmos aporos</italic>. Like the Agambenian homo sacer, the Socratic erēmos aporos is abandoned by his fellow citizens, not outside the <italic>polis</italic> but <italic>in</italic> the polis, being a refugee in his own city. He lives, as Callicles says of Socrates in <italic>Gorgias</italic> (486c), “in his city as an absolute outcast.” Moreover, like the Agambenian homo sacer, the Socratic erēmos aporos also lives in a state close to death—“in a state as close to death as possible,” as Socrates says of himself in <italic>Phaedo</italic> (67d). However, there is a decisive difference between the Agambenian homo sacer and the Socratic erēmos aporos. Unlike homo sacer, the Socratic political subject is not abandoned by the <italic>sovereign</italic> but <italic>by himself</italic> through his own traumatic self-accusation. Furthermore, although erēmos aporos is also a “living corpse,” he is not thereby at mercy of the sovereign. On the contrary, it is <italic>he</italic> who has become sovereign, not because he has somehow managed to sublate his condition as abandoned and forlorn subject, but because this condition <italic>is</italic> the condition of sovereign freedom. In other words, it is neither his biological life in the order of nature (<italic>zoē</italic>) nor his form of life in the symbolic order of the polis (<italic>bios</italic>), not even his exposure to the threat of imminent death (homo sacer), but his <italic>symbolic suicide</italic> that renders him a sovereign individual subjected to no one. By removing the subject from his proper place in the symbolic order of the polis, such a suicide not only discloses subject’s unlimited responsibility but also renders him capable of transcending his limited position as a <italic>living being</italic> and becoming a thanatopolitical subject of his own biological death. Although such a subject also affirms life, life that is affirmed here is not mere life but sovereign life in the shade of the instinct of death.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the introduction to his <italic>Homo Sacer</italic>, Giorgio Agamben points out that there are two lines of analysis in Michel Foucault’s work: on one hand, the study of the biopolitical techniques with which the state assumes and integrates the natural life of individuals into its center; on the other hand, the examination of the technologies of the self by which the individual is bound to his own identity and conscience. Then Agamben laments that the <italic>intersection</italic> between the biopolitical techniques and the technologies of the self remained a blind spot or vanishing point in Foucault’s research—and that his own inquiry in Homo Sacer “concerns precisely this hidden point of intersection.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0304375413497843">1</xref></sup> In other words, the aim of Agamben’s analysis seems to be to identify those mechanisms through which the biopolitical techniques are transformed into the technologies of the self—that is, how the subject is formed in and through this double subordination. Yet instead of analyzing this intersection in Homo Sacer, the rest of the book is dedicated to the analysis of another intersection, namely that between the juridicoinstitutional and the biopolitical models of power. In this analysis, the subjective aspects of power remain as hidden as the intersection between the biopolitical techniques and the technologies of the self in Foucault’s work. The protagonist of the book is, as Agamben maintains, the life of homo sacer, a man who may be killed and yet not sacrificed, but nowhere in the book is there reference to those mechanisms with which this protagonist is transformed into a political <italic>subject</italic>, let alone to the formation of the psychic life of this subject. According to Agamben, the production of bare life—the life of homo sacer—is the original activity of sovereign power, but instead of analyzing this production from the perspective of the subject of power, Agamben concentrates solely on the objective juridicotechnical side of the process, on the production of bare life as the object of biopower.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is for this reason that Agamben comes to his conclusion that the concentration camp is the truth of Western biopolitics and that <italic>Muselmann</italic>—rather than, say, an Aristotelian <italic>zōon politikon</italic>—is the paradigm of the Western political subject. Toward the end of the book, to be sure, Agamben points out that the Western political subject is also a bearer of sovereignty (“sovereign subject”),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0304375413497843">2</xref></sup> but it is again from the juridicotechnical perspective that he proceeds in his analysis, without an account of the formation of this sovereignty at the level of the subject.</p>
<p>In this article, my aim is precisely to focus on those subjective mechanisms with which the Western sovereign subject is formed. In this respect, I argue that it is not subject’s bare life but his <italic>conscience</italic> that plays the most central role in the Western tradition since antiquity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0304375413497843">3</xref></sup> Moreover, instead of picking up an extreme case such as Muselmann—supposedly revealing the norm—for the object of my study I have chosen a generally acknowledged ethicopolitical hero in the Western tradition: Socrates. I argue that it is neither the Aristotelian zōon politikon nor the Agambenian homo sacer but the Socratic conscientious man that is the originary figure of the Western political subject. Surely, the Socratic man resembles the Agambenian homo sacer more than the Aristotelian <italic>zōon </italic>politikon inasmuch as the Socratic man—Socrates himself being the best example—is, like homo sacer, abandoned by his fellow citizens, not outside the <italic>polis</italic> but <italic>in</italic> the polis, being a refugee in his own city. Further, like the Agambenian homo sacer, the Socratic abandoned and forlorn man (erēmos aporos) also inhabits a condition that could be likened to death—“a state as close to death as possible,” as Socrates says of himself in <italic>Phaedo</italic> (67d)—but unlike homo sacer, he is not exposed to this condition by a sovereign law but by <italic>himself</italic> through the continuous accusations of his own conscience. Indeed, it is his conscience (<italic>daimonion</italic>) that makes him live close to death—or as Socrates in <italic>Apology</italic> (30b–c) proclaims: “I shall not change my conduct even if I am to die many times over.” Socrates does not change his conduct, that is, stop to philosophize in Athens, because his conscience does not allow it, and Socrates believes that he has to obey his conscience even if it places his life in peril. This also means that one’s conscience renders one capable of <italic>transcending</italic> the sphere of the mere life of homo sacer and entering a new level of life beyond the instincts of self-preservation. It is a radical revocation of such preservation as it makes one capable of sacrificing oneself for the Cause and becoming the subject of one’s own biological death. Like Agambenian biopolitics of mere life, politics of conscience is thus always already thanatopolitics, politics of death; but unlike the object of Agambenian sovereign thanatopolitics that is exposed to the “unconditional threat of death,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0304375413497843">4</xref></sup> the Socratic subject (erēmos aporos) is characterized by a profound <italic>scorn</italic> of death. Yet, it is precisely for this reason that erēmos aporos is able to overcome the sphere of mere life and to enter a new level of life whereby the subject becomes sovereign with regard to his biological life.</p>

<title>Arendt and Villa on the Socratic Ethics of Conscience</title>
<p>The origin of the Western thanatopolitics of conscience—at least one of these origins—can be found in Plato’s Socratic dialogues. Of course, there is nothing original in this argument itself. Already Apuleius identified the Socratic daimonion with conscience in his <italic>De deo Socratis</italic>. It dwells in the most profound recesses of the mind in the place of conscience (<italic>in ipse peritissimis mentibus vice conscientiae diversetur</italic>), guarding and observing us, reproving if we do evil, and approving if we do well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0304375413497843">5</xref></sup> Moreover, it has been noted long ago that Socrates’ introduced a novel ethicopolitical paradigm in the history of the West, the politics of conscience. Montaigne alludes to this and Hegel confirms it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0304375413497843">6</xref></sup> More recently, authors such as Hannah Arendt and Dana Villa have emphasized the same. They both, Arendt first and Villa in her footsteps, have argued that Socrates is the inventor of an ethics and politics the gravitational center of which is “the conscientious individual rather than tradition, convention, or public norms and opinion.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0304375413497843">7</xref></sup> In Arendt’s estimation, the best description of this can be found at the end of the contested Platonic dialogue <italic>Hippias Major</italic> (304b–e), in which Socrates complains about a fictive “close relative” who lives in his house and who is always insulting, blaming, and refuting him. It is worth quoting the lengthy passage in its entirety:
<disp-quote>
<p>Hippias, my friend, you’re a lucky man, because you know which activities a man should practice, and you’ve practiced them too—successfully, as you say. But it seems to me that some divine fortune (<italic>daimonia tis tykhē</italic>) holds me back. I am always wandering (<italic>planaō</italic>) and perplexed (<italic>aporō</italic>). If I make a display of how perplexed I am (<italic>emautōu aporian</italic>) to you wise men, I get mud-spattered by your speeches when I display it. You all say what you just said, that I am spending my time on things that are silly and small and worthless. But when I’m convinced by you and say what you say, that it’s the most excellent thing to be able to present a speech well and finely, and get things done in court or any other gathering, I hear every insult (<italic>kakos</italic>) from that man (among others around here) who has always been disgracing (<italic>elengkhō</italic>) me. He happens to be a close relative of mine, and he lives in the same house. So when I go home to my own place and he hears me saying those things, he asks if I’m not ashamed (<italic>aiskhynō</italic>) that I dare discuss fine activities when I’ve been so plainly refuted about the fine and it’s clear I don’t even know at all what that is itself! “Look,” he’ll say. “How will you know whose speech—or any other action—is finely presented or not, when you are ignorant of the fine? And when you’re in a state like that, do you think it’s any better for you to live than die?” That’s what I get, as I said. Insults (<italic>kakōs</italic>) from you and from him, blamed (<italic>oneidizō</italic>) by both. But I suppose it is necessary to bear all that. It wouldn’t be strange if it were good for me. I actually think, Hippias, that associating with both of you has done me good. The proverb says, “What’s fine is hard”—I think I know that.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0304375413497843">8</xref></sup>
</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Arendt, the “close relative” Socrates is speaking about is what the subsequent Western tradition has called “conscience.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0304375413497843">9</xref></sup> Correspondingly, the entire passage is, according to her, a good example of the “inner dialogue” characteristic of the Socratic politics of conscience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0304375413497843">10</xref></sup> And it is indeed possible that the relative in the passage is a metaphor of conscience. Yet less convincing is her argument that at stake here is a <italic>dialogue</italic>, for it is obvious that the relative does not discuss with Socrates but <italic>interrogates</italic> and <italic>reproves</italic> (elengkhō) him, calling ultimately his entire existence into question (“do you think it’s any better for you to live than die?”). It is, I think, precisely this calling into question rather than moral integrity or noncontradiction—as Arendt, Villa, and many others maintain<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0304375413497843">11</xref></sup>—that is the touchstone of Socratic politics. To be sure, Socrates also speaks about moral integrity, in Gorgias (482b–c), for instance. For Socrates, however, integrity is not merely the absence of the inner contradiction. For one can avoid the inner contradiction like Alcibiades who constantly escapes the disharmony of the soul by keeping himself busy in the public life of the polis. According to Socrates, this is absolutely lamentable. One should not avoid inner contradiction by escaping it. Integrity is something one must <italic>earn</italic> and one can earn it only if one is <italic>sensitive</italic> to the inner contradiction. However, this is not possible if one has no living experience of this contradiction. In fact, it is precisely this experience rather than its absence that is, for Socrates, the condition of all virtue.</p>

<title>Humiliation as the Method of Ethics</title>
<p>One is now of course tempted to ask, what is the experience of contradiction in the sphere of morality? In the tradition of the West, this experience has been called the experience of bad conscience, guilt, shame, disgrace, and so on, but perhaps more important than any of these terms, denoting usually one aspect of the wholesale phenomenon, is the <italic>essence</italic> of this fundamental experience—the experience the Greeks identified with <italic>synoida emautō</italic> (“knowing with oneself”). Synoida emautō is a verbal construction at the etymological root of the Greek conscience (<italic>syneidēsis</italic>), which in classical Greek could have a neutral meaning, signifying that one is conscious of something concerning oneself, but which could involve a moral meaning as well. Common to all these ethical uses of synoida emautō is that it expresses a <italic>profound sense of disorientation</italic>—a personal, moral, political, and religious sense of loss.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0304375413497843">12</xref></sup> It is this experience of disorientation originating in the experience of conscience that constitutes the essence of Socratic politics. Recall Socrates’ words in Hippias Major (304c) I quoted above, “It seems to me that some divine fortune (daimonia tis tykhē) holds me back. I am always wandering (planaō) and perplexed (aporō).” We also remember why he is <italic>aporos</italic>, meaning “helpless,” “without passage,” and “without orientation.” He is aporos because the “relative” living in his place constantly accuses him and puts him into shame no matter what he has done. In other words, especially if we interpret, with Arendt, the “relative” as a metaphor for conscience, the Socratic conscience is not a source of opinion, not even of normativity, but first and foremost <italic>the source of aporia</italic>. The conscience does not tell Socrates what to do and what to avoid but merely disturbs him up to the point of absolute confusion (“when you’re in a state like that, do you think it’s any better for you to live than die?”). In the same passage, however, Socrates also states that it is necessary to endure all this, because he thinks that it is good for him, and it is good to him because he believes that <italic>absolute disorientation is the necessary condition of true morality and politics</italic>. Only the one who, by virtue of humiliation, “knows with himself” that he knows nothing is capable of leading virtuous life: “I know with myself (synoida emautō) that I am not wise at all” (Apology 21b). This was a new formula of ethics and politics in the tradition of the West. The way to true moral and political knowledge goes through the absolute disorientation in terms of such knowledge. All the known truths have to be relativized in the confusing experience of conscience because there is no true virtue without absolute moral and political disorientation.</p>
<p>This is also the backdrop of Socrates’ famous “method” of elenchus. We may translate <italic>elengkhos</italic> as “cross-examination,” but given the fact that the word derives from the verb elengkhō signifying “to reprove,” “to disgrace,” “to shame,” and “to accuse,” a more illustrative translation would be humiliation. In fact, it is precisely the verb elengkhō Socrates employs in Hippias Major (403d) when he laments that his “relative” is always disgracing him: “I hear every insult from that man ( … ) who has always been disgracing (elengkhō) me.” Hence, the “relative” employs the same method of elenchus in the case of Socrates as Socrates, the gadfly, employs when he “cross-examines” or more precisely, reproves and disgraces the Athenians: “I shall,” Socrates proclaims, “question and examine and disgrace (elengkhō) everyone in Athens, young and old, citizens and foreigners” (Apology 29e–30a), continuing that “I never cease to rouse each and every one of you, to persuade and reproach you all day long and everywhere I find myself in your company” (Apology 30e). In <italic>Theaitetos</italic>, Socrates likewise proclaims, “I am a most eccentric person (<italic>atopos</italic>) and drive men to aporia (<italic>poiô tous anthrôpous aporein</italic>)” (Theaitetos 149a), adding that “those who associate with me (…) are in pain and (…) perplexed (<italic>aporia</italic>) night and day” (Theaitetos 151a). And, if we are to believe Plato, he was sometimes quite successful. Even Alcibiades, the proudest of the young Athenians, felt ashamed before Socrates, the self-appointed “conscience” of the Athenians:
<disp-quote>
<p>Socrates is the only man in the world who has made me feel shame—ah, you didn’t think I had it in me, did you? Yes, he makes me feel ashamed, because I know with myself (synodia emautō) that I can’t prove he’s wrong when he tells me what I should do; yet, the moment I leave his side, I go back to my old ways: I cave in to my desire to please the crowd. My whole life has become one constant effort to escape from him and keep away, but when I see him, I feel deeply ashamed, because I’m doing nothing about my way of life, though I have already agreed with him that I should. Sometimes, believe me, I think I would be happier if he were dead. (<italic>Symposium</italic>, 216b–c)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is sometimes complained that Plato’s Socratic dialogues are aporetic and do not lead to any conclusion, but, in truth, the only aim of such a “method” <italic>is</italic> aporia. In other words, the aim of the “method” of elenchus based on the accusations Socrates makes on his interlocutors is not to figure out what virtue means but, on the contrary, to reveal that all our conceptions of virtue are worth nothing and, ultimately, to elicit absolute disorientation in terms of morality and politics. The Socratic “method” of elenchus does not lead anywhere, or better still, it leads to <italic>nowhere</italic>. This is not a sign of the method’s failure, because it is the aporia that was sought for in the first place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0304375413497843">13</xref></sup> It was sought for, because Socrates believes that true moral and political knowledge can emanate from such an aporia alone. Only the one who, by virtue of disgrace and humiliation, knows with himself (synoida emautō) that he knows nothing, to whom the world as a whole has become impenetrable, is capable of virtue. As Socrates proclaims in <italic>Philebus</italic> (16b), “There certainly is no better road (<italic>hodos</italic>), nor can there ever be, than that which I have always loved, though it has often deserted me, leaving me lonely and forlorn (<italic>erēmon kai aporon</italic>).”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0304375413497843">
<title>The Tragic Model of the Socratic Politics</title>
<p>Although Socrates outlined the tenets of the Western politics of conscience, he was not without a model. This model can be found in Greek tragedies. Let us consider the most famous of them, Sophocles’ <italic>Antigone</italic>. Hegel may be wrong in claiming that Antigone is not a subject of conscience, but he is certainly wrong when he asserts that there is no such a subject at all in Antigone.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0304375413497843">14</xref></sup> There indeed is such a subject of conscience, although this subject is revealed only at the end of the play. This subject is Creon who acknowledges his <italic>hamartia</italic> (1306–1310), “Ah, no! I tremble with fear. Why does no one strike me full on my chest with a two-edged sword? I am miserable—ah—and bathed in miserable anguish!” A little later (1343–1345), he continues, “I do not know which way I should look, or where I should seek support. All is amiss (<italic>lekhrios</italic>) that is in my hands.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0304375413497843">15</xref></sup> This is the moment when the conscience enters the play. It is the moment when all the landmarks of moral and political orientation vanish, the moment when one finds oneself thrown into the “wilderness” (<italic>agrios</italic>; 1274). It is the moment when the known ways of the world, its authorities, laws, norms, traditions, and values are called into question, including Creon’s own authority. They have become relative, superfluous, turning eventually into nothing, at least for the subject that goes through this terrible experience that “no sacrifice can bring to an end” (1285).</p>
<p>Such a turning point can of course be found in almost all classical tragedies. The hero acknowledges his hamartia resulting in the turmoil of his soul. To be sure, it is not always a “conscience” but also the Furies (<italic>erinyes</italic>), Dike’s loyal maidens of vengeance, who are understood as the cause of this terrible experience. This holds true particularly for Aeschylus. In Sophocles’ plays, however, the role of the Furies is already diminished. In Antigone, for instance, they are mentioned only once, and even here (603) Sophocles speaks about the Furies in the mind (<italic>phrenōn erinys</italic>). Most clearly, however, this new attitude appears in Euripides’ plays, particularly in <italic>Orestes</italic>. In a decisive passage (392–397) where Orestes complains about his inner sufferings, he does not mention the Erinyes at all but speaks about <italic>synesis</italic>:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Orestes:</speaker>
<p>Here I am, the murderer of my wretched mother.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Menelaus:</speaker>
<p>I have heard, spare your words; evils should be seldom spoken.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Orestes:</speaker>
<p>I will be sparing; but the deity is lavish of woe to me.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Menelaus:</speaker>
<p>What ails you? What is your deadly sickness (<italic>nosos</italic>)?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Orestes:</speaker>
<p>My conscience (<italic>synesis</italic>); I know (<italic>synoida</italic>) that I am guilty of a dreadful crime.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Menelaus:</speaker>
<p>What do you mean? Wisdom is shown in clarity, not in obscurity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0304375413497843">16</xref></sup>
</p>
</speech>
<p>This passage has given scholars the reason to attribute to Euripides the very discovery of conscience, for he demythologized, as Bruno Snell says, the Furies by rendering their objective punishments into a purely subjective experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0304375413497843">17</xref></sup> Here, however, more essential than to speculate who discovered conscience is to focus on the <italic>consequences</italic> of this experience. For I contend that it is precisely these consequences, both internal and external, that are decisive regarding the Socratic politics of conscience. What then are these consequences? First of all, the experience of conscience entails the collapse of all the familiar coordinates of the world, whereby the hero finds himself, like Creon, thrown into the wilderness (agrios). He finds himself utterly alone and forlorn (<italic>erēmos kai aporōs</italic>), as Socrates describes the effects of his method in Gorgias. True, the exact expression erēmos aporos, that is, desolated, isolated, and abandoned (<italic>erēmos</italic>), helpless or without a way (<italic>aporos</italic>), occurs quite rarely in tragedies. We find it in <italic>Oedipus at Colonus</italic> (1735) where Ismene moans, “Unhappy me! Abandoned and helpless (<italic>erēmos aporos</italic>), where am I now to live my wretched life?” Yet tragedies are full of corresponding expressions, the most frequent of which is <italic>erēmos apolis</italic>, signifying abandoned (<italic>erēmos</italic>), without a city (<italic>apolis</italic>). We find it in Sophocles, in <italic>Philoctetes</italic> (1018) for instance, where Philoctetes accuses Odysseus of mistreating him: “You bind me and intend to take me from this shore where once you left me, a friendless, lonely without a city (erēmos apolis), living corpse.” But it is again Euripides who employs it most frequently. We come across the expression in <italic>Medea</italic> (255) as well as in <italic>Hecuba</italic> (811) in both of which the heroine complains of being erēmos apolis: “Now I am your slave,” says Hecuba to Agamemnon, “a happy mother once, but now childless and old alike, bereft of city, utterly abandoned (<italic>apolis erēmos</italic>), the most wretched woman living.” We find the same motif in Euripide’s <italic>Hippolytus</italic> (846) and <italic>Suppliants</italic> (1132) as well, but now it is the whole <italic>oikos</italic> that is desolated: “I am destroyed: my house is desolated (<italic>erēmos oikos</italic>), my children are orphaned,” Theseus bemoans.</p>

<title>A Refugee in One’s Own City</title>
<p>Let us return to Socrates. While the Greeks felt pity for a man who had gone through the tragic experience of synoida emautō leading to the condition of erēmos apolis, Socrates saw in him the model for the ethicopolitical subject. Accordingly, the aim of his ethical “method” (elengkhos) was to create such abandoned cityless subjects, like he himself, knowing not which way to look, or where to seek support, to use Sophocles words again: “It is,” Socrates says in <italic>Meno</italic> (80c), “not from any sureness in myself that I drive others to aporia (<italic>poiō aporein</italic>): it is from myself being more in aporia (<italic>autos aporōn</italic>) than anyone else that I drive others to aporia (poiō aporein).” Yet, we must be precise here. Socrates never says that he is an apolis—if we do not take into account his “exodus” (<italic>exodos</italic>) outside the polis in the beginning of <italic>Phaedrus</italic>. He is not an apolis but abandoned and helpless (erēmos aporos), atopos (displaced, out of place), as Socrates says of himself in Theaitetos (149a) and Callicles confirms in Gorgias (494d). As a matter of fact, it is not until the Cynics and especially the rise of Christianity that the condition of apolis as the true condition of wise and pious man is fully affirmed. A little before the passage in <italic>Discourses</italic> (3.22.94) where Epictetus proclaims that conscience (<italic>to syneidos</italic>) gives a Cynic the same power as guards and arms give to kings and tyrants, he asserts (3.22.47) that such a person, like he himself, is <italic>aoikos</italic> and apolis, without a house and a city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0304375413497843">18</xref></sup> Diogenes Laertius likewise reports (6.38) that Diogenes the Cynic used to say that all the curses of tragedy had lighted upon him: “At all events he was,” Laertius continues by citing some lost tragedy “<italic>apolis</italic>, <italic>aoikos</italic>, <italic>patridos</italic> <italic>esterēmenos</italic>,” without a city and home, deprived of a fatherland.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0304375413497843">19</xref></sup> In early Christianity, this citylessness and homelessness became a paradigm. Those who live in Christ are but “aliens (<italic>paroikos</italic>) and exiles (<italic>parepidemos</italic>),” without home (oikos) and without land (<italic>demos</italic>), as we read in 1 Peter 2:11. And although the theme is the most visibly present in the writings of early Fathers, it never disappears entirely. The true Christian is but a <italic>peregrinus</italic>, a “foreigner in the world (<italic>peregrinus in saeculo</italic>)” (15.1), as Augustine repeats almost throughout <italic>The City of God</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0304375413497843">20</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In contrast to this Cynico-early-Christian paradigm, Socrates categorically refuses to leave the polis, because, as he says in Phaedrus (230d), he is a friend of learning—and “the country places and the trees won’t teach me anything, and the people in the city (<italic>astu</italic>) do.” Hence, Socrates is not a Diogenes, let alone an early Christian. But we must take into account what kind of a city dweller Socrates is. For he is not a proper citizen of the polis either, “I am not the politician (<italic>ouk eimi ton politikōn</italic>),” as he says in Gorgias (473e). To the Greeks, a proper citizen was one who took part in the political life of the polis, but Socrates discredits “all the business commonly called politics” (<italic>Euthydemus</italic> 292e). Hence, Socrates does not fit in either of well-known categories in <italic>Politics</italic> (1253a) by means of which Aristotle distinguishes men from animals and gods. Socrates is not a zōon politikon, but strictly speaking he is not an apolis either, that is, “a lower animal (<italic>therion</italic>) or a god (<italic>theos</italic>),” living without a polis. Rather he is an apolis <italic>within</italic> the polis, a sort of animal-god as citizen. In other words, even though Socrates does not dwell outside the polis abandoned by his fellow citizens, he is not a citizen among others but a citizen abandoned in the polis, a refugee in his own city. He is erēmos apolis not outside the polis but at the heart of it—as a new figure of the citizen, the one who takes up the <italic>true</italic> political craft:
<disp-quote>
<p>I believe that I’m one of a few Athenians—so as not to say I’m not the only one, but the only one among our contemporaries—to take up the true political craft (<italic>hē hōs alēthōs politikē tekhnē</italic>) and practice politics (<italic>prattein ta politika</italic>). (Gorgias 521d)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Instead of the Aristotelian zōon politikon, it is precisely the Socratic abandoned citizen (erēmos apolis) that is the paradigm of the Western ethicopolitical subject and, at the same time, that of the autonomous citizen.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0304375413497843">
<title>Erēmos Aporos as the True Politician</title>
<p>We must ask, however, why Socrates conceived such a displaced erēmos apolis withdrawn from the normal social and political relations of the polis as the true ethicopolitical subject. The most obvious, yet all too simple answer is that by withdrawing from the public affairs of the polis Socrates is able to avoid injustice, for it is, as he says in the Apology (31d–e), impossible to avoid injustice if taking part in politics. The true key to this paradox lies rather in Socrates’ understanding of the allegedly <italic>positive</italic> consequences of the aporia incurred by the experience of synoida emautō. As already said, the negative consequence of the experience of synoida emautō is an absolute disorientation in terms of morality and politics, because it tears the subject from the social bond and, by the same token, from itself. Such a subject stands abandoned and helpless (erēmos aporos)—or, as Callicles says of Socrates in Gorgias (486c), he “lives in his city as an absolute outcast” (<italic>atekhnōs de atimon zēn en tē polei</italic>). However, to live in the city as an absolute outcast also signifies that the subject is no longer <italic>constituted</italic> by this bond but by the very painful division within the subject itself, the same division that cuts him out of the social bond in the first place. It is precisely for this reason that Socrates was able to scorn public opinion, “We must not consider at all what the many will say of us,” he says in <italic>Crito</italic> (48a). Indeed, if we accept Aristotle’s definition of shamelessness as contempt for public opinion (<italic>Rhetoric</italic> 1368b20–25), Socrates was the most shameless man in the Athenian polis. Yet Socrates’ shamelessness did not signify, at least not in his own opinion, that he was a bad citizen. In his own estimation, he was not shameless at all. On the contrary, he believed himself to be the only citizen capable of <italic>true</italic> shame. True shame is not dependent on public opinion, for true shame is not shame before others but <italic>before one’s conscience</italic>. Unlike “normal” shame—shame before others—which makes one’s existence entirely dependent on others’ opinions, the Socratic shame before one’s conscience is a <italic>liberating</italic> experience. The subject of conscience stands abandoned and perplexed, but not because other people despise him but rather because the nothing of conscience sets him radically free from the principles, norms, values, and opinions of the community. In other words, the subject of conscience stands apart as a <italic>sovereign individual</italic>. He is like the Cyclop in Euripides’ <italic>Cyclops</italic>, for the Cyclops are, as Silenius explains to Odysseus, “abandoned” (<italic>erēmoi</italic>) and “solitaires” (<italic>monades</italic>; 116), but precisely for this reason “none of them is subject to anyone” (<italic>akouei d’ ouden oudeis oudenos</italic>; 120).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0304375413497843">21</xref></sup> This is why Socrates commends his “relative” who carries on ceaselessly relativizing him and his world, for he realized that the absolute disorientation incurred by the experience of synoida emautō entails a fracture in the web of immanent social relations and thereby, the birth of a sovereign individual subjected to no one. Socrates is no longer dependent even on the constitution (<italic>politeia</italic>) of the polis (Gorgias 513a), that is, its truths, virtues, customs, and laws. The constitution of the polis and by the same token, the constitution of the entire visible world, has lost its meaning to him. It has become null and void, absolutely nothing, but <italic>it is precisely from this nothingness that the sovereign individual is born</italic>.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not his capacity to think that enables Socrates to distance himself from the “routines of everyday life,” as Villa maintains,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0304375413497843">22</xref></sup> but the disorienting experience of being rendered erēmos aporos by the accusing voice of conscience. In what sense, however, is such an erēmos aporos qua sovereign individual <italic>morally</italic> superior to a normal Athenian citizen? He is superior, according to the logic of Socratic ethical politics, because a normal citizen takes care of the affairs of the polis in his own limited and partial perspective measuring his action and responsibility according to the given norms and values. The displaced erēmos aporos, instead, measures his action according to the measureless measure of the nothing of conscience. This entails that he also <italic>takes care</italic> (<italic>epimeleomai</italic>)—or is capable of taking care—of the affairs of the polis (of its justice, piety, etc.; Apology 36c) in the same modality, that is, in the <italic>modality of unlimited responsibility</italic>. It is for this reason that Socrates reproaches and disgraces everyone in Athens, for he wants that all Athenians become lonely sovereign outcasts (<italic>erēmoi aporoi</italic>), because only such outcasts are capable of taking care of the affairs of the polis as well as their own souls (Apology 36c).</p>
<p>Also this turn from the condition of erēmos aporos qua sovereign individual to the responsible political subject also has its model in the Greek tragedies. While the Homeric hero, at least occasionally, blamed his misdeeds on delusions of the gods,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0304375413497843">23</xref></sup> the tragic hero acknowledges his responsibility. In Antigone (1317–1322), Creon confesses:
<disp-quote>
<p>Ah this responsibility (<italic>aitios</italic>) can never be fastened onto any other mortal so as to remove my own! It was I, yes, I, who killed you, I the wretch (<italic>meleos</italic> = useless). I admit the truth. Lead me away, my servants, lead me from here with all haste, who am no more than a dead man (<italic>mēdeis</italic> = nobody)!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, to become erēmos aporos and to become a subject of responsibility are not two separate moments but <italic>one and the same moment seen from two perspectives</italic>: becoming erēmos aporos through the accusing conscience means that one acknowledges one’s responsibility and vice versa, acknowledging one’s responsibility through the accusing conscience means that one becomes erēmos aporos. Yet Socrates elevated this tragic scheme to a new level, for what is at stake for him in this responsibility is not one’s guilt with regard to one’s evil deeds in the past but more profound responsibility in which responsibility becomes a permanent attribute of existence. While the experience of synoida emautō, the condition of erēmos aporos and responsibility defined the life of the tragic hero at a critical juncture when he became conscious of his evil deed, in Socrates’ politics of conscience these elements are put at the heart of everyday life. In Socratic ethical politics, one is no longer an erēmos aporos if one finds oneself responsible for a crime. One has to <italic>make</italic> oneself an abandoned outcast, to commit a sort of <italic>symbolic suicide</italic> (“to live in a state as close to death as possible,” as Socrates says of himself in Phaedo 67d) by means of continuous self-accusation. Due to these self-accusations, the condition of erēmos aporos becomes permanent and responsibility ineradicable.</p>
<p>In the formation of the Socratic ethicopolitical subject, in short, at stake is the dialectical move from the normal situation characterized by the morality of custom to the state of exception (erēmos aporos) through the annihilating experience of conscience (synoida emautō) and finally, back to the normal situation again as seen from the altered perspective of absolute responsibility enabled and, in the last resort, necessitated by the traumatic and disorienting experience of conscience. This dialectics is also the key to the enigma scholars have been wrestling with when trying to combine the rebellious Socrates with the law-abiding Socrates loyal to the fundamental traditional principles of the polis, that is, the Socrates who shamelessly refuses to assimilate himself to the order of the polis (politeia) and the Socrates who in Crito (51b–c) proclaims that one must always “obey the commands of one’s city and country.” Also Villa wrestles with this problem but he “solves” it by subsuming the conservative Socrates of Crito to the dissident Socrates of Apology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0304375413497843">24</xref></sup> In this regard, David D. Corey’s criticism of Villa is perfectly justified, as he argues that these two figures cannot be reconciled within the framework of the Socratic dissident citizenship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0304375413497843">25</xref></sup> However, Corey’s own solution is not very satisfying either, for he argues that Socrates’ oscillating attitude toward obedience is due to the contingent interventions of Socrates’ daimonion understood as a supernatural source of Socrates’ ethics and politics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0304375413497843">26</xref></sup> For even if we accept Corey’s conclusion that there is a supernatural source of authority for Socrates, it does not solve the problem how to reconcile the Socrates of Crito and Apology—especially when we take into account that Socrates’ daimonion says always the same thing, that is to say, it prevents him from doing wrong: “It is impossible that my familiar sign did not oppose me if I was not about to do what was right” (Apology 40c).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0304375413497843">27</xref></sup> From the perspective of the Socratic politics of conscience, however, there is no enigma here, for these two attitudes articulated in Crito and Apology represent two <italic>moments</italic> in this politics. It is precisely his refusal to assimilate himself to the principles of the polis made possible by the disorienting experience of conscience that <italic>enables</italic> Socrates to truly adhere to them in a conscientious way, namely in the modality of unlimited responsibility.</p>

<title>Erēmos Aporos, Homo Sacer, and the Western Thanatopolitical Subject</title>
<p>If the Socratic disoriented, abandoned, and forlorn man (erēmos aporos) is neither the Aristotelian zōon politikon nor an apolis pure and simple, that is to say, “a lower animal (therion) or a god (theos),” but rather stands at the <italic>threshold</italic> of the polis and the wilderness (agrios), being as if an animal-god within the walls of the polis, is he not then exactly what Agamben famously calls “bare life” or homo sacer? Also homo sacer is abandoned and forlorn, but not outside the polis but rather in the polis, being a refugee in his own city, a sort of <italic>anomos</italic> in the sphere of <italic>nomos</italic>. In addition, his life is not defined by certain form of life (<italic>bios</italic>) meaning a definite place in the order of the polis, but neither does he live natural life (<italic>zoē</italic>) like an animal or a god, but is a same kind of atopos as erēmos aporos. Finally, like homo sacer, erēmos aporos is a “living corpse” (<italic>en zōsin nekron</italic>), as Sophocles describes the tragic hero in Philoctetes (1018), or he lives, as Socrates says of himself, “as close to death as possible” (Phaedo 67d). What then is the difference between the Socratic erēmos aporos and the Agambenian homo sacer, if any?</p>
<p>Unlike homo sacer, the Socratic ethicopolitical subject is not abandoned by the <italic>sovereign</italic> but <italic>by himself</italic> through the traumatic accusations of conscience. Furthermore, although erēmos aporos is a “living corpse,” he is not thereby at mercy of the sovereign. On the contrary, it is <italic>he</italic> who has become sovereign, not because he has somehow managed to sublate his condition as abandoned and forlorn subject, but because this condition <italic>is</italic> the condition of sovereign freedom. In other words, it is neither his biological life in the order of nature (zoē) nor his form of life in the symbolic order of the polis (bios), not even his exposure to the threat of imminent death (homo sacer), but his symbolic suicide that renders him a sovereign individual subjected to no one. This is not to say that erēmos aporos would be an <italic>Agambenian</italic> sovereign, for although this sovereign occupies the same terrain of ban as homo sacer (they are “symmetrical figures”),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0304375413497843">28</xref></sup> they are nevertheless opposed to each other. Instead, erēmos aporos occupies the <italic>zone of indistinction</italic> of homo sacer and the sovereign. He is homo sacer as sovereign and sovereign as homo sacer, or rather, he is the sovereign continuously exposed to the condition of homo sacer through which he must in any case pass in order to become the sovereign subject of infinite responsibility. It is precisely this dialectics—continuous oscillation between bare life and sovereignty—that makes the Socratic erēmos aporos infinitely responsible political subject. However, the most decisive difference between homo sacer and erēmos aporos remains unconcealed unless we have deciphered the exact meaning of that infinite responsibility characteristic of the Socratic political subject.</p>
<p>As already said, the humiliating voice of conscience discloses one’s unlimited responsibility by removing one from one’s proper place in the symbolic order of the polis. However, it also renders one capable of transcending one’s limited position as a <italic>living being</italic>. It makes one capable of sacrificing one’s life: “I shall not change my conduct even if I am to die many times over,” as Socrates proclaims in Apology (30b–c). Socrates does not change his conduct, because his conscience does not allow it—to stop to taking care of citizen’s souls by reproaching them—and Socrates believes that he has to obey his conscience even at the peril of his life. In other words, the man of conscience—like Socrates—does not abhor even death. Indeed, he does not abhor death in particular, for his own death has become indifferent or rather an object of scorn for him. Yet, it is precisely once death has become an object of scorn that the instinct of self-preservation characteristic of mere life is rendered inoperative. In this sense, politics of conscience is always thanatopolitics, politics of death. It is a radical revocation of mere life and mere survival—a revocation that makes one capable of sacrificing oneself for a political cause. Paradoxically, this overcoming of mere life by becoming an absolute outcast in the disorienting experience of conscience which makes one capable of sacrificing one’s life also reconnects one to life, perhaps more tightly than ever. The conscience is in the service of death as it demands that you must sacrifice yourself for the Cause, but it is precisely for this reason that you are able to overcome the <italic>threat</italic> of death. Such overcoming entails affirmation of life, but life that is affirmed here is no longer mere life but sovereign life. In Freudian terms, it is life beyond pleasure and even reality principle—life under the auspices of the <italic>instinct of death</italic>. It is neither the Aristotelian zōon politikon nor the Agambenian homo sacer but the Socratic erēmos aporos—the thanatopolitical subject of sovereign life—that is the paradigmatic figure of the Western political subject.</p>
<p>This conceptually tiny but nevertheless decisive difference between erēmos aporos and homo sacer becomes clearer if we consider Agamben’s primary example of the modern homo sacer. This example is Muselmann, the most miserable inhabitant of the concentration camp, no longer living but not yet dead, no longer human but not an animal either, but beyond them both.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0304375413497843">29</xref></sup> Instead, one finds a paradigmatic example of the modern erēmos aporos in the citizen-subject of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s <italic>Social Contract</italic>—though here the voice of conscience is transformed into the voice of people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0304375413497843">30</xref></sup> In the initial situation of the contract, Rousseau tells us, the individual is pushed outside every community, law, and tradition, separated and isolated from his family, relatives, friends, eventually from every human being. Yet although he is now like a bandit, he is not left outside the body politic, but rather finds himself at the heart of it, for by the contract the individual not only alienates himself <italic>from</italic> every existing community but also with respect <italic>to</italic> the new body politic constituted by the contract: “These articles of association, rightly understood, are reducible to a single one, namely the total alienation by each associate of himself and all his rights to the whole community (<italic>l’aliénation totale de chaque associé avec tous ses droits à toute la communauté</italic>).”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0304375413497843">31</xref></sup> This is how the individual becomes what Rousseau calls a <italic>Sujet</italic>, totally at the mercy of the body politic that may compel him as it wishes, even kill him. Yet, Rousseau argues that the contract also renders the individual a <italic>Citoyen</italic> who by participating in the sovereign authority (<italic>l’autorité souveraine</italic>) of this new body politic obeys himself alone. On what account the individual is a sovereign Citoyen, if he is an absolute outcast at the mercy of the community? He is the Citoyen <italic>because</italic> he is an alienated, abandoned, and helpless Sujet, for it is such a subject alone that is capable of attuning to “the voice of duty” (<italic>la voix du devoir</italic>) which is the true mark of the Citoyen.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0304375413497843">32</xref></sup> To become a sovereign citizen presupposes that one becomes an abandoned outcast deprived of every community, law, and tradition. The individual is a citizen capable of giving himself a law and to obey it only on the condition that he is a subject exposed to the condition of erēmos aporos. Here lies the key to the “working of the political machine (<italic>le jeu de la machine politique</italic>),”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0304375413497843">33</xref></sup> the working that culminates in citizen’s duty to sacrifice himself for the cause of political community:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is thus a profession of faith which is purely civil and of which it is the sovereign’s function to determine the articles, not strictly as religious dogmas, but as sentiments of sociability (<italic>sentiments sociabilite</italic>), without which it is impossible to be either a good citizen or a loyal subject. Without being able to oblige anyone to believe these articles, the sovereign can banish from the state anyone who does not believe them; banish him not for impiety but as an antisocial being, as one unable sincerely to love law and justice, or to sacrifice (<italic>immoler</italic>), if need be, his life to his duty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0304375413497843">34</xref></sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>I am not the first to recognize that the Socratic politics is based on the self-imposed condition of loneliness. In his article, “Alone in the World: The Existential Socrates in the Apology and Crito,” Emanuele Saccarelli emphasizes the same, coming to the conclusion that Socrates is essentially an antipolitical and antisocial character.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0304375413497843">35</xref></sup> Yet, we must take into account that Socrates is antipolitical and antisocial only <italic>in the context of the Athenian polis</italic>. In the modern context and more precisely, in the context of the entire Western world since the birth of Christianity, he is neither antipolitical nor antisocial but rather a paradigmatic figure of the Western political subject. Hence, Saccarelli hits the mark when it comes to Socrates’ true character but fails to acknowledge the fundamental difference between classical and modern political life. The modern political subject is not the one who assimilates himself to the order of the state but, on the contrary, the one who is capable of distancing himself from that order, thanks to the alien voice within—the voice that does not only isolate him from the rest of community as an autonomous individual but which by the same token enables him to commit himself to the cause of community, as it is this voice that discloses him his real duty, that is to say, his duty to sacrifice his life to his duty: “It will not always be possible to verify whether the order has been carried out. With us, the verification must not, must never be left to a commissar, as it is in Russia. The only commissar we have must be our own conscience (<italic>das eigene Gewissen</italic>).”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0304375413497843">36</xref></sup> Thus, spoke Heinrich Himmler to his Schutzstaffel troops at Poznan on October 4, 1943.</p>

<p>The first and the only surviving document from the Classical period where the Greek word for conscience (syneidēsis) is mentioned is Democritus’ fragment no. 297 (Diels): “Some people, ignorant about the decomposition of mortal nature and in the <italic>syneidēsis</italic> of evil-doing in life, endure the time of their lives in confusion and fear because of inventing lies about the time after death.” Cited and translated by Philip Bosman, <italic>Conscience in Philo and Paul</italic> (Tübingen, Germany: J. C. B. Mohr, 2003), 61. It is not until the first century BC that the noun came into more frequent usage. This does not signify, however, that the Greeks did not know the experience of conscience, as is sometimes suggested. In order to express this experience, they used other nouns such as <italic>synesis</italic> or verbal compounds such as <italic>synoida emautō</italic> (“I know with myself”) from which the noun <italic>syndeidēsis</italic> derives. The earliest instance of <italic>synoida emautō</italic> expressing guilty conscience can be found in the <italic>Thesmophoriazusae</italic> (476–77) of Aristophanes: “I know with myself of many terrible things (<italic>ksynoid’ emautē polla dein’</italic>).” Aristophanes, “Thesmophoriazusae,” in <italic>Aristophanes with English Translation in Three Volumes</italic>, vol. 3, trans. B. B. Rogers (London, UK: William Heinemann, 1963), 170–71. Translation modified. On the experience of <italic>synoida emautô</italic> in the classical <italic>polis</italic>, see Philip Bosman, <italic>Conscience in Philo and Paul</italic> (Tübingen, Germany: J. C. B. Mohr, 2003), 49–105 and Antonia Canrcini, <italic>Syneidesis: Il tema semantico della “con-scientia” nella Grecia antica</italic> (Roma, Italy: Edizioni dell’Ateneo Roma, 1970).</p>

<p>As we can also read in Homer’s <italic>Odyssey</italic> (9.105-115), Cyclopes are “insolent giants without law (<italic>athemistos</italic>),” but at the same time, and because of this, each of them “makes his own law (<italic>themisteuō</italic>).” <italic>The Odyssey with an English Translation in Two Volumes</italic>, vol. 1, trans.

<p>For instance, when Agamemnon (<italic>Iliad</italic> 19.86) realized that he had made a mistake by robbing Achilles’ mistress, he blames gods: “Not I, he declared, not I was the cause of this act, but Zeus and my portion and the Erinys who walks in darkness: they it was who in the assembly put wild delusion (<italic>ate</italic>) in my understanding, on that day when I arbitrarily took Achilles’ prize from him.

<p>In the article, Corey also makes a strange claim that Socrates’ <italic>daimonion</italic> cannot be a conscience as Socrates regards its voice as coming from someone other than himself. In order to reaffirm his argument, Corey insists that Socrates’ <italic>daimonion</italic> intervenes also on occasions that are morally neutral as in the <italic>Euthydemus</italic> (272e–273a) in which his divine sign prevents Socrates from leaving a gymnasium. Corey, “Socratic Citizenship,” 220–21. On this point, see also Luc Brisson, “Socrates and the Divine Signal According to Plato’s Testimony: Philosophical Practice as Rooted in Religious Tradition,” <italic>Apeiron</italic> 38, no. 2 (2005): 6. On one hand, it is more than obvious that in the Western tradition the voice of conscience has <italic>always</italic> been other’s voice within, be that other God, nature, or the voice of the father. On the other hand, there are no morally neutral events for Socrates. Any man, as Socrates stresses in <italic>Apology</italic> (28b), who is any good at all, should look to this only in his actions: “whether what he does is right or wrong.”</p>
