<abstract>
<p>We report a patient with young onset Parkinson’s disease (PD) and a heterozygous point mutation in parkin (c.1000C&gt;T; p.Arg334Cys). After 8 years he developed pyramidal signs and reinvestigation demonstrated MRI and laboratory findings supportive of a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) with a primary progressive (PP) clinical course. This is a previously un-described association of young onset PD with PPMS. Imaging clearly dates the occurrence of each disease as chronologically separate phenomena. There is not currently evidence for shared causation or pathogenesis between the two neurological disorders but we will follow with interest the emerging genetic characterization of parkin in both PD and MS.</p>

<title>Case report</title>
<p>A 38-year-old male, born in India, presented in 2002 with a 9-month history of pain and stiffness of his left shoulder and a left hand tremor, present at rest and with posture. He reported pain in his left calf on walking with involuntary in-turning of his left foot. On direct questioning he confirmed a decline in smell perception. There was no family history of Parkinsonism or consanguinity. He had no significant past medical history and was in full time employment in England. On neurological examination, left-sided tremor-dominant Parkinsonism and dystonia of the left foot were noted. An MRI brain was normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512445942">Figure 1</xref>). He was diagnosed with young onset Parkinson’s disease (PD) and underwent a therapeutic trial of levodopa (L-dopa) with response.</p>

</fig>
<p>By late 2003 he had stopped working due to poor control of his symptoms and had developed prominent upper limb dyskinesia. He was referred to a movement disorder specialist who requested genetic testing (including sequencing and multiplex-ligation-dependent probe amplification for copy number variants) for mutations in genes associated with PD, namely alpha-synuclein (SNCA), LRRK2, parkin, DJ-1, and PINK1. Sequencing revealed a heterozygous point mutation in parkin (c.1000C&gt;T; p.Arg334Cys), which has previously been reported in combination with other mutations as a cause of parkin-related Parkinsonism. Repeat MRI brain imaging in 2005, performed as part of a diagnostic reassessment, was again normal.</p>
<p>The patient was discharged back to his local neurology service, after 8 years, at the age of 46. By this time his main complaints were of axial pain and stiffness with only 50% ‘on’ time associated with prominent dyskinesias. On examination, in addition to Parkinsonism and dystonia, left leg weakness and spasticity, pathologically brisk reflexes, bilateral clonus and an extensor plantar on the left were noted. Further investigations were arranged. MRI brain with gadolinium now demonstrated multiple T2 high signal lesions of the deep white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, some of which were enhanced, which were felt to be typical for active demyelination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512445942">Figure 1</xref>). CSF examination revealed unmatched oligoclonal bands and a mildly elevated protein. Serum inflammatory markers and autoantibodies were negative. Presynaptic dopaminergic deficit was confirmed with <sup>123</sup>I-ioflupane brain scintigraphy (DaTSCAN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512445942">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The evolution of this patient’s neurological disease thus satisfied McDonald’s diagnostic criteria for primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) in addition to young onset PD. Intravenous methylprednisolone resulted in brief respite from his axial pain and transient improvement of his left leg power, reverting to his pre-treatment mobility a few days after he was discharged home. Additional benefit has been achieved with therapist input and modification of his PD medications.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The association of young onset PD and MS seen in this case report is particularly rare. We unequivocally show, on the basis of normal sequential brain MRI studies, that MS followed the onset of PD by a minimum of 3 years.</p>
<p>Young onset Parkinsonism presenting with foot dystonia is classically associated with autosomal recessive mutations in genes such as parkin, PINK1 and DJ-1. However, genetic testing in this patient, including sequencing for point mutations and copy number variants in parkin and SCNA, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for common mutations and copy number variants in PINK1 and DJ-1, revealed only a heterozygous mutation in parkin. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, a second mutation in parkin may have not been detected by currently available technologies. Alternatively, it is not yet fully determined whether heterozygous mutations in parkin predispose to PD. Initial studies reporting an association of PD with heterozygous parkin mutations were subject to ascertainment bias, and a recent well-powered study does not support this association.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512445942">1</xref></sup> On the other hand, support for the role of heterozygous parkin mutations as a risk factor for disease, is the observation that mutation carriers can display dopamine reuptake deficiency in fDOPA PET analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512445942">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>At a cellular level, parkin is a E3 ubiquitin ligase which prepares defined proteins for proteasomal degradation. Parkin (and PINK1) also both have an important role in mitophagy (elimination of damaged mitochondria).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512445942">3</xref></sup> Using immunohistochemistry in MS plaques, both parkin and PINK1 have been shown to be upregulated in acute MS plaques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512445942">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512445942">5</xref></sup> Thus, PD and MS may share a common pathological pathway of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. It is conceivable, but not yet studied, whether mutations in parkin can influence disease course in multiple sclerosis. Another genetic loci associated with MS is HLA-DRB5. Genetic variability in this loci was recently found to be associated with idiopathic PD, highlighting the importance of inflammatory factors in both MS and PD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512445942">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>A clinical practice point from this case is that the emergence of clear pyramidal tract signs in idiopathic PD are infrequently observed and should prompt investigation for additional pathology. Compressive cervical myelopathy or white matter lesions can co-exist and should be identified and treated as necessary. In young onset PD brisk reflexes are more commonly seen and delayed central motor conduction times are a consistent feature in those with parkin mutations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512445942">7</xref></sup> However, in other young patients the association of Parkinsonism and pyramidal features may indicate distinct patho-aetiological conditions and mutations in ATP13A2, PLA2G6, FBX07 and Spasticin have been shown to account for some patients with this phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512445942">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The association of PD and MS is rare despite growing pathophysiological evidence that in MS, in addition to the typical white matter demyelinating lesions seen, there is more diffuse involvement of grey matter structures, including the basal ganglia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512445942">9</xref></sup> In 2007 Valkovic and colleagues published a review of 15 cases of concurrent PD and MS and since then only three further cases have been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512445942">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512445942"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512445942">12</xref></sup> The majority are thought to be due to coexistence of idiopathic PD and MS in the same patient. This notion is supported by abnormal DAT scans in the absence of corresponding demyelinating lesions within the basal ganglia on MRI. In some cases, however, strategically placed MS lesions within the dopaminergic pathways are likely to have caused Parkinsonism or worsened existing idiopathic PD and there are examples of symptomatic improvement of Parkinsonism after steroid treatment.</p>
<p>This case illustrates the rare association of two neurological diseases, young onset Parkinsonism and PPMS. We believe the two neurological disorders have occurred coincidentally but further insights may emerge from the ongoing genetic characterization of parkin in both PD and MS and we propose that other similar cases should be documented to populate potential genetic studies.</p>
