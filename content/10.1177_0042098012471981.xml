<abstract>
<p>This article examines how business improvement associations (BIAs) become involved in implementing public video surveillance systems in Canadian cities. The approach of BIAs to urban security is more complex than the literature on neo-liberalisation of public space suggests and it is shown how BIAs adopt lead, junior or reluctant partnership roles in implementing and writing policy for public video surveillance. Interview data from four Canadian cities are used to demonstrate how BIAs take on different positions in video surveillance policy-making and implementation. The article explores how local and regional policy contexts shape a BIA’s ability to pursue revitalisation projects and illustrates the way that provincial privacy guidelines function as a key policy instrument in the Canadian context. The article concludes by assessing what these findings add to literature on the neo-liberalisation of public space and urban studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Also referred to as business improvement zones (BIZs) and business improvement districts (BIDs), business improvement associations (BIAs) are involved in urban revitalisation and regulation in cities across North America and the UK. BIAs attempt to carry out ‘clean and safe’ revitalisation projects through business promotions, beautification, street-cleaning, façade regeneration and graffiti removal (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098012471981">Lippert and Sleiman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098012471981">Cook, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012471981">Ward, 2007</xref>). Due to the common emphasis on consumption, cleanliness and order maintenance, questions have been raised about whether BIAs can genuinely represent community interests. It is assumed that BIAs champion private or corporate interests since they are funded by levies on commercial enterprises. Indeed, BIA zones have been called “malls without walls” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098012471981">Graham and Marvin, 2001</xref>, p. 262) because of this pursuit of marketable space. Yet several authors have also shown how the work of BIAs intersects with public bodies, funding and laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098012471981">Ward, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098012471981">Wolf, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012471981">Hoyt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098012471981">Briffault, 1999</xref>) and is more multifaceted than literature on neo-liberalisation of public space suggests.</p>
<p>In this article, we use the example of public video surveillance in Canada to demonstrate how varied BIAs can be in their approach to urban surveillance and security. Dozens of BIAs operate public video surveillance systems in UK and US cities, but in Canada it has been rare until recently. Literature on public video surveillance has examined police, government and business advocacy for the implementation of video monitoring across the UK and Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012471981">Hier, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098012471981">Coleman and Sim, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098012471981">Fyfe and Bannister, 1996</xref>), yet insufficient attention has been focused on the role of BIAs.</p>
<p>Recognising that not all BIAs have the same resources or identical ideas about how to address crime (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098012471981">Lippert, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098012471981">Cook, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098012471981">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012471981">Ward, 2007</xref>), we demonstrate that BIA involvement in implementation of public video surveillance programmes across Canada has not been as uniform as urban studies literature on neo-liberalism and security in the city might suggest. BIAs share the ‘clean and safe’ mantra as a start point, with the aim of making consumption districts amenable to competitive commercial ventures and fostering what have variably been referred to as neo-liberal cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098012471981">Peck and Tickell, 2002</xref>), competitive cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012471981">Kipfer and Keil, 2002</xref>) and revanchist cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098012471981">Smith, 1996</xref>). Yet differences in local and regional policy contexts engender variation in BIA involvement with the implementation of security measures such as public video surveillance. Especially relevant in the Canadian policy context is a unique set of privacy guidelines that shapes public video surveillance implementation. Provincial Information and Privacy Commissioners (OIPC) publish privacy protection guidelines, which recommend best practices for video collection, data storage and transfer, and system stewardship. Camera proponents, including BIAs, interpret guidelines in ways that lead to variation in system design and deviation from fair information principles themselves.</p>
<p>To shed light on the diversity of BIA involvement with public video surveillance in cities across Canada, we argue that some BIAs have assumed the role of lead partners, in charge of video surveillance operations, while others take on the role of junior partners, lending their support for policy but not involved in the day-to-day administration of systems. In this sense, some BIAs are only policy partners while others are full implementation partners (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098012471981">Davies, 1999</xref>). There are also reluctant partners: BIAs not in support of public video surveillance and that may speak against monitoring initiatives but nonetheless are drawn into a network of agencies implementing camera systems on city streets. Literature on neo-liberalisation of public space thus misconstrues how varied BIAs can be in their approach to urban security (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098012471981">Lippert, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Our contribution to the literature on BIAs is thus three-fold. First, we add to sociological understandings of BIAs by showing how BIAs in smaller Canadian urban centres pursue policies related to revitalisation. Secondly, we contribute to urban studies literature on BIAs by showing how varied their position on urban crime control and surveillance can be despite sharing a ‘clean and safe’ mantra. Thirdly, we show how BIAs play varying roles in public video surveillance policy and implementation partnerships. Part of this last contribution entails demonstrating how BIAs interpret and apply privacy protection guidelines in video surveillance partnerships in Canadian cities.</p>
<p>This article is organised in four parts. First, we situate our research in relation to literature on BIA partnerships, as well as literature on privacy protection guidelines in Canada. After a note on method, we analyse data regarding four BIAs that fall into one of the three categories of BIA involvement in public video surveillance: lead partners, junior partners and reluctant partners. We conclude with a discussion of what our findings mean for literature on BIAs, neo-liberalism and urban studies.</p>

<title>BIAs, Public Video Surveillance and Privacy Protection Guidelines in Canada</title>
<sec id="section3-0042098012471981">
<title>Business Improvement Associations, Policy and Partnerships</title>
<p>Originally formed in Canadian cities during the early 1970s to create opportunities for private governance of business zones, the BIA concept took off in the US in the 1980s in the downtown areas of major urban centres. Wherever BIAs emerge, a density of commercial tenants is required, since the revenues to cover administrative costs for the BIA are generated by district-specific levies. As one interviewee put it<disp-quote>
<p>How a BIZ is formed is that within a district 50 per cent of the businesses agree to forming a BIZ [it has to be 50 plus one per cent], plus they must be paying over 50 per cent of the business tax in that area. Then the City collects an additional levy on the business tax that is forwarded to us.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Those who pay in to the BIA usually contribute to the policy of the BIA <italic>vis-à-vis</italic> board meetings and annual meetings. In return, they expect enhanced service for their membership: “The City has a graffiti-removal programme but because people are in our district they get a quicker service because we have our own graffiti removal”. BIAs co-operate with other policing and social service agencies to remove graffiti, drug use and street crime. Some BIAs employ teams of ambassadors that liaise with municipal police to generate a consumption-oriented order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098012471981">Lippert and Sleiman, 2011</xref>), creating zones of quasi-private governance in cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098012471981">Morçöl and Zimmerman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098012471981">Clough and Vanderbeck, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Some large cities in Canada are home to multiple BIAs (for instance, the City of Toronto now has 72 BIAs). However, BIAs are by no means limited to downtown cores of metropolitan areas. What is significant about the proliferation of BIAs in Canada is that BIAs have become prominent players in urban governance in smaller cities and towns. When BIAs exist is smaller cities, there is variation in how they pursue ‘clean and safe’ initiatives, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098012471981">Ward (2010)</xref> refers to as the unevenness of BIA policy. While Ward’s research has focused on BIAs in smaller municipalities across the UK and the US, we focus on BIAs in large and small municipalities across Canada.</p>
<p>The role of BIAs in the implementation of public video surveillance remains unexplored in urban studies (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098012471981">Lippert, 2012</xref>). Although public video surveillance was common in the UK as far back as the 1980s, the creation of BIAs in the UK only commenced in the mid 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012471981">Ward, 2007</xref>). Many Canadian cities have featured BIAs since the 1980s, but only since the early 2000s has public video surveillance become a common crime control initiative. Unlike in the UK, where BIAs were introduced by central government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098012471981">Cook, 2009</xref>), neither federal nor provincial governments in Canada have triggered the rise of BIAs. Instead, BIAs are marked by a level of autonomy in urban governance partnerships, drawing together stakeholders to achieve targets related to urban revitalisation (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098012471981">Lippert and Sleiman, 2011</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098012471981">Wolf, 2006</xref>, on the limits of BIA powers). This partnership orientation facilitates the policy and implementation networks that emerge in favour of public video surveillance. Indeed, crime deterrence is a major BIA organisational goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098012471981">Cook and MacDonald, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098012471981">Brooks, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012471981">Hoyt, 2004</xref>) and there is a growing synergy between BIA revitalisation attempts and video surveillance use on Canadian streets. However, not all BIAs hold the same position in these partnerships or have the same approach to video surveillance as a means of creating ‘clean and safe’ urban areas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0042098012471981">
<title>BIAs and Public Video Surveillance</title>
<p>Two main questions motivate our study. How do BIAs in Canada become involved with public video surveillance implementation? How are BIAs enabled and constrained by government privacy protection guidelines? Public video surveillance is most strongly associated with Home Office funding of these monitoring initiatives in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098012471981">Webster, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098012471981">Norris <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). The Canadian context differs from the UK case in three ways. First, there has been no centrally organised funding for cameras in Canada, which can be contrasted to the UK Home Office Challenges. Between 1994 and 1999, over £38 million was made available for 585 public video surveillance systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098012471981">Norris <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In Canada, government funding for public video surveillance has only been available since 2008 and only in small amounts in the provinces of British Columbia and Ontario through special programmes offered by Offices of the Solicitor General. Secondly, Canada has official privacy advocates in the form of federal and provincial privacy commissioners. As we explain later, however, the impact that privacy protection guidelines have had on the design and diffusion of public video surveillance in Canada is counter-intuitive. Thirdly, the proponents of public video surveillance are often BIAs and anti-violence community groups. Partnerships between police, municipalities and BIAs result in policy networks, some of which would be considered public and others private according to federal and provincial privacy commissioners’ definitions.</p>
<p>The literature on public video surveillance systems takes many forms. Most public video surveillance literature has focused on local police, federal police (such as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), in Canada) and municipal public bodies, not BIAs. A small body of research has also started to investigate the policy context that informs how monitoring systems are designed and applied. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098012471981">Webster (2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098012471981">2004</xref>), although monitoring programmes in the UK were initially developed in the absence of privacy laws, standard approaches to regulation of operations developed through policy networks of service providers, police and civil servants. We draw from this literature on policy contexts to explore how BIAs interpret privacy guidelines in their revitalisation partnerships across Canada.</p>
<p>The public video surveillance policy context in Canada relies on the promotion of non-binding guidelines. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC), along with provincial Offices of Information and Privacy Commissioners (OIPCs), adopted guidelines in 2006 to encourage best practices in public video surveillance. In Canadian provinces, the OIPCs publish privacy protection guidelines for both public and private bodies using video surveillance in public places. Although ‘public’ is not explicitly defined in the guidelines, it is noted that public video surveillance is not covert, workplace or police video surveillance such as that used in stake-outs. Local camera proponents consult the provincial guidelines as well as the federal Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada <italic>Guidelines for the Use of Video Surveillance of Public Places by Police and Law Enforcement Agencies</italic> when making policy. One stipulation in the privacy protection guidelines is that<disp-quote>
<p>A video surveillance system should only be considered after other measures to protect public safety, detect or deter, or assist in the investigation of criminal activity have been considered and rejected as unworkable.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A second stipulation is that<disp-quote>
<p>The use of each video surveillance camera should be justified on the basis of verifiable, specific reports of incidents of crime or significant safety concerns.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Public video surveillance should be validated according to demonstrated need and efforts must be taken before video surveillance is pursued.</p>
<p>Because privacy protection guidelines are advisory and non-binding, a pragmatic approach to planning for public video surveillance has emerged. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012471981">Hier (2010)</xref> argues that the guidelines have unintentionally facilitated further video surveillance diffusion and variation in system design. Hier focuses on public police and municipal governments in public video surveillance policy-making and implementation, but we argue that the same holds for BIAs. BIAs in Canada incorporate privacy protection guidelines into their policy work, leading not only to variation in system design but also differences in the extent to which BIAs support public video surveillance.</p>

<sec id="section5-0042098012471981" sec-type="methods">
<title>Research Design and Method</title>
<p>Since 2005, we have investigated how public video surveillance systems are designed and implemented across Canada. We have conducted over 500 interviews with police officers, city councillors, privacy advocates and other stakeholders, including BIA representatives. For this article, we focus on interviews with BIA representatives. First, we analysed transcripts from interviews with BIA representatives in 12 cities. Interviews included one-on-one sessions with BIA directors and focus groups, as well as interviews with former BIA members, for a total of 27 interviewees. Our interview schedule included questions about partners, cost, privacy protection consultation, communications with provincial agencies and system design. Secondly, we selected four illustrative case studies from these 12 cities. Here we analyse how BIAs become involved with public video surveillance in Williams Lake (population 11 500, province of British Columbia), Winnipeg (population 684 100, province of Manitoba), Peterborough (population 78 698, province of Ontario) and Orillia (population 30 259, province of Ontario). We report on interviews with managers and members from the Downtown Williams Lake Business Improvement Area, the Peterborough Downtown Business Improvement Association, the Winnipeg Exchange District Business Improvement Zone and the Downtown Orillia Management Board (steered by the BIA). In addition to analysing these transcripts, we draw on documents pertaining to BIA involvement with video surveillance in each city to examine how BIA interpretations of the privacy guidelines are translated in video surveillance policies. These documents were obtained through negotiating access on-site or through follow-up consultations by phone.</p>
<p>We draw on data from these four cities for three reasons. First, system proponents in each city were aware of the Information and Privacy Commissioner (OIPC) privacy protection guidelines in their respective provinces, and they based system design on the guidelines. Secondly, the sample is composed of programmes that represent the diversity of BIA approaches to public video surveillance in Canada, ranging from lead to reluctant partners. Williams Lake provides an example of a lead partner where the BIA is in charge of policy-making as well as implementation and administration of the system. Peterborough provides an example where a BIA attempted to be a lead partner on a public video surveillance project but then, for reasons we explain, became a junior partner in support of the policy. Winnipeg and Orillia provide examples where BIAs had criticisms of video surveillance. The variation in terms of policy partnerships versus implementation partnerships (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098012471981">Davies, 1999</xref>) is also evident with our sample, insofar as some BIAs remain involved only by publically supporting policy while lead partners drive the implementation process. Thirdly, these cities began to design programmes after 2000, allowing us to observe policy-making patterns, notably the issue of how crime control funding offered by the Offices of the Solicitor General in British Columbia and Ontario enables BIAs to become lead and junior partners in public video surveillance implementation.</p>

<title>BIAs, Public Video Surveillance and Canadian Cities</title>
<sec id="section7-0042098012471981">
<title>Lead Partner: The Williams Lake Central Business Improvement Area</title>
<p>Williams Lake is located 600 km north of the City of Vancouver in the province of British Columbia (BC). Between 2006 and 2008, Williams Lake was known for having one of the highest crime rates in BC and one of the highest crime severity indexes in Canada. National news media reported that Williams Lake was Canada’s crime capital. Concerns about crime in the downtown core were used to demonstrate the need for cameras, although the crime rate in Williams Lake has declined since 2008. Williams Lake provides an example of how privacy guidelines have the unintended effect of promoting BIA-led public video surveillance.</p>
<p>Public video surveillance is an initiative of the Williams Lake Central Business Improvement Area (WLCBIA). This BIA has only one paid staff member. Their office is in a newly renovated former gas station beside a community police station on the main street. Shortly after forming, the BIA set up a sub-committee to deal with crime prevention. As the BIA manager put it<disp-quote>
<p>I think the BIA almost formed to try to deal with the problem … it formed a BIA, they formed the Crime and Safety committee, and they identified the cameras right away. It’s driven totally by the members.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>They brainstormed crime control ideas in 2007, including video surveillance for the downtown. In January 2009, a new City Council had been elected and the first major issue they addressed was crime. A few weeks later, a meeting was set up with the Solicitor General of BC to pursue one-time provincial funding that was made available to municipal bodies for crime control.</p>
<p>The BIA claimed that the cameras would help to deal with a lack of policing in the downtown area<disp-quote>
<p>There’s always been a request for more RCMP and it’s an on-going battle with the provincial government that the City is always trying to get more. Out of our own coffers we can’t afford more … We service out to remote lakes and the officers are often called out of town. The saturation of RCMP in the downtown core can be fairly light.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The provincial government funding was confirmed in March 2009. The programme was BIA-driven, but the funds could not be released to the BIA until the policy for data retention and storage was formalised.</p>
<p>A retired RCMP officer was hired to develop the policies and the purchasing procedure. The City provided a grant of CA$5000 to the BIA to hire the consultant to create the policy and correspond with the BC OIPC about the guidelines. Because the BIA was the lead partner, they fell under the jurisdiction of different provincial privacy legislation, the <italic>Personal Information Protection Act</italic> for private bodies instead of the <italic>Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act</italic> for the public sector. The consultant and the BIA turned to the <italic>Public Surveillance System Privacy Guidelines</italic> for public bodies but also the <italic>Guidelines for Overt Video Surveillance in the Private Sector</italic>. As one BIA member noted, “Our consultant had a large part to play to determine which area we fell under”. There was ambiguity because, although the BIA is technically a private body, they planned to use video surveillance in a public place. The BIA created the policy through correspondence with the BC OIPC. The consultant indicated that the OPIC was helpful in assisting the WLBIA to determine what privacy legislation the agency fell under. He also stressed that the Williams Lake cameras are unique insofar as privacy protocol designed for inside private domains is being used to regulate video surveillance outside in a public space.</p>
<p>The consultant was aware that creating a public video surveillance policy for a BIA was not common in Canada. He wrote to the City contact in July 2009<disp-quote>
<p>If the intention of the City, the WLCBIA and the RCMP is for the WLCBIA to own and manage the CCTV system and the other parties [to] utilize the service as required, then it should be correct to proceed under the PIPA.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He goes on to write that<disp-quote>
<p>The PIPA process to establish a system appears marginally easier than the FIPPA process to complete and yet the management of personal information is quite similar … this uniqueness of the adopted approach here places the system under a different provincial statute, PIPA, specifically geared to the private sector, including organizations such as the WLCBIA.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The BIA was aware of the differences in the guidelines. As one BIA member put it<disp-quote>
<p>We have put guidelines in place under the Private Entity portion of the privacy law … we fall into a grey area, so the privacy commission was unsure how to deal with us. After some discussions, we were classified as a private entity and had guidelines that were less onerous than if we had been classified as a public entity. This was fortunate because our budget could have been impacted if we had been classified as public because the guidelines are more stringent for public bodies.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this way, the privacy protection guidelines are starting to enable private bodies to use video surveillance in public places.</p>
<p>These developments mean that the WLCBIA is officially a private body operating video surveillance in a public place. Williams Lake is one of the first places in Canada where public video surveillance is fully managed by a BIA. The consultant and the WLCBIA read all guidelines for public and private bodies, but because the guidelines for private bodies are less onerous the WLCBIA designed the system to be in compliance with these despite the location of cameras on city streets. According to the official policy<disp-quote>
<p>The WLCBIA will be the sole owner of all the digital recordings made by this system, the WLCBIA will be fully responsible for the care, control, storage, and destruction of all digital images viewed on or recorded by the ‘system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012471981">WLCBIA, 2011</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rather than the RCMP or the municipality being the system steward, here the BIA is bestowed total stewardship for the system. The terms of system design come from the guidelines, including the grant of access to individuals to recorded information about themselves. Privacy guidelines thus shaped video surveillance policy and implementation in Williams Lake, reinforcing variation in public video surveillance partnership roles as the BIA was the lead partner for policy and implementation.</p>
<p>For WLCBIA members, it was important that they maintain leadership. For one BIA member<disp-quote>
<p>The RCMP <italic>are</italic> at arm’s length from this camera project. That is a mutual decision. We’ve involved them as far as input, asking them for camera locations, we’ve kept them abreast of developments, kept them posted in terms of estimated time lines, but again the contribution has been limited, it is a BIA initiative.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The original statement of need in terms of regulating crime should have been considered satisfied given an already declining crime rate, meaning that the element of need was addressed only rhetorically to justify system expansion (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098012471981">Lett <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). As the BIA manager put it, “I’m hoping the next step will be to create more of a net and just keep expanding it out. Start watching more of the town”. In this way, the guidelines enable the BIA to be a lead partner in advocacy for public video surveillance. And new provincial funding schemes enable BIAs to become involved in designing and administrating urban surveillance projects.</p>

<p>The City of Peterborough is located in the Kawartha cottage region of central Ontario, approximately 2 hours from Ottawa and Toronto. The Peterborough example shows how BIAs may support video surveillance but fail as lead partners due to questions of legitimacy regarding BIA steering of urban governance and whether BIAs can represent community interests.</p>
<p>The City of Peterborough had operated a public video surveillance system of 12 cameras since 2001, focused on the local marina and surrounding park. In June 2003, the OIPC received complaints that the City failed to adhere to privacy protection guidelines. The OIPC sent inspectors to Peterborough to examine the system, where they learned about plans to expand the system to include downtown video surveillance. On 9 December 2003, the Peterborough Restaurant and Bar Association, in accordance with its zero-tolerance policy for anti-social behaviour, recommended implementation of downtown video surveillance. A motion to bring a proposal before City Council had been passed by the Peterborough Downtown Business Improvement Association’s (PDBIA) Board of Management and Vandalism Committee comprised of BIA members, police officers and municipal politicians.</p>
<p>In February 2004, the Executive Director of the PDBIA presented a proposal to City Council calling for the expansion of video surveillance to deal with downtown vandalism. The PDBIA offered to pay CA$85 000 to purchase equipment and install cameras at five intersections in downtown Peterborough. The proposal called for 24-hour coverage of the business and entertainment district. Although the PDBIA was expected to pay for the initial expense, the report to Council stipulated that taxpayers would cover all operational and maintenance costs. The proposal was approved in principle. Concerned about cost, effectiveness and privacy, however, city councillors appointed the city’s Central Area Facilitator to provide recommendations to council for the expansion of public video surveillance in Peterborough.</p>
<p>Local interest-groups began to mobilise. Resistance to the business-led camera initiative came from the Stop The Cameras Coalition (STCC). The STCC invited members of the PDBIA to debate the merits of public video surveillance. Members of the STCC also collected a petition opposing the cameras. The STCC developed a website that greeted viewers with blinking eyes and a caption reading: “Do you like feeling as if you’re being watched all the time?”. The site encouraged readers to voice their concern. As one BIA member put it<disp-quote>
<p>I think we were putting forward $80 000 dollars. We’d committed that up-front, then people rallied against it and were speaking against council, then council didn’t support it. We couldn’t even get a letter of support from the police. We couldn’t get them on our side so that’s where the whole process fell apart … we couldn’t get the support.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Faced with dissent, as well as Council’s unwillingness to endorse the cameras, the PDBIA considered implementing a private surveillance scheme that would be paid for by local merchants. The Central Area Facilitator’s recommendation was to assemble a committee of stakeholders from the City, DBIA and STCC. This new committee would be responsible for defining the need for monitoring downtown. As of July 2009, the committee had met once and failed to reach agreement.</p>
<p>In early 2010, the system was revisited when the Solicitor General made provincial funding available through an on-going proceeds from crime programme. This time, the police and the municipality were the lead partners, while the BIA took on a role as junior partner supporting and commenting on the policy (including camera location). The provincial privacy guidelines were the main instrument used to inform and legitimate the policy. As one BIA member put it<disp-quote>
<p>I think from 2005 to current, more people with their cell phones, with private property cameras, it’s just becoming the norm. Plus the policy guidelines put out by the government have eased a lot of people’s concerns.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The PDBIA example shows how the privacy guidelines have the effect of promoting public video surveillance, insofar as the guidelines legitimate the partnerships that lead to implementation (as with the example of Williams Lake). Another PDBIA member reiterated<disp-quote>
<p>They didn’t have any policy that they needed to put together because they were relying on the privacy guidelines … I don’t think there was much more policy that they had to create on how to use it internally.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although the BIA here is relegated to a junior partner when they could not garner support, they continued to frame their advocacy for video surveillance in terms of the privacy guidelines. To justify the policy, impact statements from BIA members were taken about graffiti and vandalism. These stories about graffiti and vandalism were used rhetorically to demonstrate ‘need’ as per the guidelines in presentations to City Council.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the reduced status of the PDBIA in the 2010 policy partnership, one BIA member said<disp-quote>
<p>Before, when we were pitching to put the cameras in, we didn’t have the support, so it came off our radar. We were trying other avenues, and that’s when the police approached us that they knew other communities used this funding to get the seed money for the cameras. That’s when it got back on the table and they approached us so now they have the support of the City and the support of the police because there is grant money out there.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another BIA member reiterated<disp-quote>
<p>The fact that the police are spearheading this one is a big difference … That they’re spearheading it and we’re supporting it, it’s opposite to the way it was, and the police needed the support of the BIA initiative in 2005 the same as now. That’s one difference. And it’s not costing taxpayers money because it’s funded by the provincial government.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this case, the PDBIA was relegated to the status of a junior partner in 2005 after their initial efforts at creating an implementation partnership failed. As a private entity, the PDBIA was not viewed as a legitimate provider of urban security. Thus, the video surveillance initiative stalled until endorsed by local police. The Peterborough example shows how local and regional contexts, including local resistance and police involvement, shape the way that BIAs become involved in video surveillance policy and implementation.</p>

<title>Reluctant Partners: The Winnipeg Exchange District Business Improvement Zone and the Downtown Orillia Management Board</title>
<p>Winnipeg is the provincial capital of Manitoba, located 7 hours north of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Winnipeg has had higher rates of crime and violent crime per capita relative to other Canadian cities for many years. As a result, Winnipeg Police Service (WPS) put 131 more officers on the streets between 2005 and 2008. There are several BIAs spanning the downtown area. The initial idea for video surveillance emerged in the late 1990s. In 1998, the West End BIZ convinced a camera supplier to put video surveillance on top of a business, which remained for 9 months. The West End BIZ requested CA$45 000 from the City to keep video surveillance going and to install additional cameras, but were not successful. In February 2001, the West End BIZ claimed that their cost for a 20-camera network would be CA$10 000 a month. Neither the City, the WPS, nor the West End BIZ wanted to invest.</p>
<p>The City considered video surveillance again in 2008. In January 2008, council directed the WPS to test the feasibility of a pilot camera project for high-crime areas. In response, the WPS said they would support public video surveillance but could not pay for it. The partnership of agencies had originally planned video surveillance to be a corporately sponsored ‘interunit strategy,’ meaning that it would not be WPS-led. City Council requested an implementation plan after supporting the WPS feasibility report, although it was still not clear who the system steward would be.</p>
<p>A steering committee was established in spring 2008. The BIZs were part of the steering committee. The Downtown BIZ and the West End BIZ were proponents. With gangs, sex work and street crime, the Downtown BIZ and the West End BIZ voiced concerns about different needs compared with the Exchange District BIZ, which did not experience the same issues. In summer 2008, the committee did not think the cameras would be a WPS-administered system. The Downtown BIZ wanted to mix private mall and public park cameras, an example inspired by a system in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Upon hearing of this plan, the Manitoba Ombudsman (responsible for privacy in the province) placed a representative on the steering committee and introduced the guidelines (from Ontario, as well as the federal guidelines) as the main policy instrument. The Downtown BIZ had wanted to host the cameras, but after the privacy guidelines were circulated the WPS were handed stewardship of the project. (The Manitoba Ombudsman subsequently published their own version of privacy protection guidelines in a quarterly newsletter.) As with the earlier examples, privacy protection guidelines for video monitoring were the main instrument used to create the WPS policy, illustrating how privacy guidelines configure debates over public video surveillance in Canada.</p>
<p>The WPS planned an initial pilot comprised of five phases. The first phase involved the steering committee consulting together on video surveillance to identify the project scope. The second phase of the pilot was community consultation during the fall of 2008. Consultation was conducted with the West End BIZ, the Downtown BIZ, the Exchange District BIZ, the Point Douglas Neighbourhood Association, the Spence Neighbourhood Association and the William White Residents Association. The third phase was implementation in early 2009. The principle objectives of video surveillance were to enhance public safety, to deter and detect crime, and to identify criminal suspects.</p>
<p>Nearly all the cameras are located in the Downtown BIZ area. The cameras are positioned throughout the downtown area; however, the Exchange District BIZ is one downtown area not covered by video surveillance. The Exchange District only had 54 calls for service to police in 2009, therefore they were not interested in video surveillance. The BIA manager stated<disp-quote>
<p>Our position was, if we were going to have CCTVs installed in the Exchange District, we would have them installed for the types of crimes that it has been proven to deter, and those are thefts from motor vehicles. Studies have shown that the crimes people think CCTVs prevent, like robberies, your fights and things like that, stabbings and stuff like that, a lot of those are alcohol fuelled so a lot of these people that are intoxicated aren’t even thinking about the CCTV. It may be an aid in apprehending the suspect, but it doesn’t prevent the crime.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The manager, a former police officer, spoke to the WPS and argued that they should only use cameras for preventing theft from cars in parking lots. As the BIA representative put it<disp-quote>
<p>We did not recommend them or need them down Albert Street, because the majority of the things that happen are just people asking for money and drunks walking along. We’re not getting people robbed left, right and centre. We don’t have a huge amount of drug dealing and, again, studies have shown that you may just displace these issues.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Exchange District BIZ manager is more concerned about displacement of crime because the cameras are on three sides of the BIZ district<disp-quote>
<p>It hasn’t happened yet, and hopefully it doesn’t. But what you’ll find with a lot of the other areas and this is maybe a social economic issue is that you have a higher density of lower-income residential on the outskirts of downtown … Any of our residential here is like $300 000 to over a million. We have some lower-income residents, but they tend to be the arts community … so they are more law-abiding down here.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Exchange District BIZ was thus critical of the effectiveness of video surveillance and the potential for displacement.</p>
<p>The Exchange District BIZ therefore was only a reluctant partner due to concerns about expense and efficacy. For example, there is an overarching Winnipeg BIZ association where the BIZs discuss common issues. The Exchange District BIZ did not agree with the positions of the other BIAs at the partnership meetings. As the BIA representative put it<disp-quote>
<p>We talk. Doesn’t mean we agree on it. I’m not going to speak for the Downtown BIZ, but they may have a different opinion and their needs may be different. Same with the West End BIZ. They have large residential gangs, prostitution problems, drug problems, so you may go to them and they may say, we want cameras. Having said that, you’ve got to be aware of why you’re putting cameras in. It’s expensive to do properly.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In February 2010, an interim WPS report was released. It found that surveillance images were rarely used and the videos were seldom requested. The ‘pilot’ stretched beyond the originally proposed end date. On 15 December 2010, Winnipeg City Council ruled that the video surveillance project be extended through “adaptation of processes initiated in the pilot mode”. Despite little evidence about the effectiveness of video surveillance, Winnipeg City Council called for camera use to continue. In May 2011, there was a full report on the pilot. The report notes several problems that emerged during the pilot, such as equipment failures in Winnipeg’s frigid winters. This WPS report ends by suggesting that money from other sources is needed to operate video surveillance: “given the current staffing restraints, the Service is unable to dedicate resources necessary to administer or maintain daily operations”. The authors also suggest that it is unreasonable for existing staff to continue to run the project. In the 2011 budget, the WPS absorbed CA$129 898 for maintenance costs and a camera staff member.</p>
<p>Findings from the WPS report vindicate the Winnipeg Exchange BIZ position on video surveillance and their reluctance to promote video surveillance implementation. The BIA manager had criticisms of video surveillance as a crime control tool (i.e. expensive, ineffective) and thus the Winnipeg Exchange BIZ was only a reluctant partner. The Winnipeg case is significant as it illustrates the uneven support for camera surveillance by BIAs within Canadian cities. The Exchange District hold-out is notable in the case of a general consensus with other BIZs in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Whereas Winnipeg provides an example of how video surveillance cameras were implemented without the support of a BIA, Orillia provides a case where the BIA was active in critiquing the implementation of public video surveillance. Orillia is located roughly 100 km north of Toronto in the province of Ontario. The city is situated between two lakes, on the way to ‘cottage country’ that many Torontonians frequent each summer, which results in increased traffic through the city. This ‘traffic’ brings with it people who visit the bars downtown and the parks and marina along the waterfront.</p>
<p>The Orillia police services board had been vocal supporters of video surveillance. The police services board Chair is a provincial appointee and a former police officer. According to the Chair, the issue of public video surveillance first emerged after some ‘local people’ made a request to the police services board for cameras in the downtown. The Chair and members of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) in Orillia went to Quinte West in August 2009 and had a tutorial on video surveillance with the OPP. OPP Quinte West had recently installed public video surveillance. The downtown and the waterfront of Orillia were selected for cameras. The Chair likened the main street of Orillia to the main street of Quinte West, which is small but could be covered by a few cameras.</p>
<p>The police services board Chair raised the issue of video surveillance in September 2009. The police services board decided to place this item on the agenda. The issue of public video surveillance was formally introduced in the budgetary discussions for the City of Orillia in October 2009 when the police board gave a presentation to City Council. In lieu of a feasibility report, the police service board had security companies perform technology demonstrations for City Council. The Chair said there had never been a serious crime in Orillia, but the OPP office closes at night. The Chair argued that video surveillance would address the lack of policing at night in Orillia.</p>
<p>Public video surveillance was not approved in the budget in October 2009. It was rejected by council, as there were concerns about privacy raised by citizens. At the time of the 2009 meeting, the Ontario OIPC sent a copy of the provincial privacy protection guidelines to the City. The OIPC letter indicated that video surveillance should only be considered as a last resort. The OIPC stressed the need for full public consultation. The issue was raised again during budgetary discussions in January 2010 and the police board came back to give a presentation in favour of video surveillance, this time with OPP Quinte West officers as guest presenters. In both 2009 and 2010, there was no clear support for video surveillance on council. At this time, the Solicitor General of Ontario made provincial funding available through an on-going proceeds from crime programme. Despite the new funding, the police services board and the OPP had difficulty enrolling municipal civil servants and the BIA into the project.</p>
<p>The Orillia Downtown Management Board that is steered by the BIA was critical of downtown revitalisation. For instance, when the City had built a new library downtown displacing the farmers’ market, which had been located in that space for over 100 years, the ODMB filed an official complaint. The ODMB had also been complaining about the streetlights, yet there had been no changes. Noting that a few windows had been broken over the years, the manager of the ODMB mentioned<disp-quote>
<p>I think there’s probably some enforcement issues, we know what bars these guys come out of, we know what bar the kids come out of at 2, 3 a.m., and they come up here to the Pita Pit which is open at three in the morning. It’s not rocket science. A lot of the crime we have is more spontaneous or inebriated than arch criminals coming in and trying to pull a fast one. Most of the things are not rational, and if we’re not live monitoring I’m not sure it would help.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The former ODMB manager said that the OPP had not attempted other means of addressing the perceived vandalism problem or demonstrated need as per the privacy protection guidelines.</p>
<p>We attended a public information meeting about video surveillance in Orillia during January 2010. There were several dissenting voices. The former ODMB manager was not in favour of video surveillance. He argued the police services board was trying to “ram the issue through”. As he put it<disp-quote>
<p>They’re jumping the queue going right to cameras, when they should employ these other things, not the least of which is lighting. We’ve been screaming about the lighting on Main Street, and when I came out of City Hall I looked there are three lights in a row out. That’s the stuff we try to quantify. We send it to Public Works, and say there’s lights on the street that are out.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Most business owners did not want video surveillance, evidenced by their opposition at the public meeting.</p>
<p>The ODMB manager introduced us to a member of the board for the ODMB, who argued that the turn to video surveillance by police is misguided. He also felt that video surveillance would detract from the heritage character of downtown Orillia. He said that the CA$100 000 for the cameras would be better spent on lighting, nightly police foot patrols and a downtown community policing office. Contrary to what is stipulated in the OIPC privacy protection guidelines, video surveillance was being advocated without considering other options first<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know if that provincial grant is camera-specific or just community-safety specific. I would chirp in about improving other elements, like lighting, like police presence in the evening, establishing a community police office … it’s expensive and probably not efficient to run, but it [the camera system] is about appearances.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Also in early 2010, the ODMB wrote a letter stating that they do not support the cameras in downtown Orillia and that the money could be better spent on lighting. The case of Orillia provides an example where the BIA was a video surveillance opponent. As in Winnipeg, sections from the privacy protection guidelines such as the ideas of need were used by the ODMB to formulate their critique of the video surveillance policy.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>This article contributes to urban studies literature on BIAs by demonstrating how varied BIA positions on crime control and surveillance are, despite sharing a ‘clean and safe’ mantra (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098012471981">Lippert, 2012</xref>). We have also illustrated how diverse BIA policies can be. BIA advocacy for public video surveillance varies considerably depending on the local and regional context. We have made three specific contributions to literature on BIAs. First, not all BIAs are equally interested in public video surveillance as a means of pursuing ‘clean and safe’ spaces. In some cases, as in Winnipeg, BIAs are only reluctant partners. Secondly, given the local and regional contexts in which BIAs operate, not all BIAs are able to be lead partners in implementation partnerships. BIAs may support the initiative but cannot be perceived to be too involved due to questions of legitimacy regarding BIA participation in urban governance processes and whose interests they represent, as in Peterborough. Thus, some BIAs are junior partners not by choice but because the local and regional policy contexts in which they are embedded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098012471981">Cook, 2008</xref>) shape their ability to pursue revitalisation projects. We have also noted how new provincial funding schemes enable BIAs to become lead and junior partners, which was not common previously. New provincial government funding in Canada appears to legitimise implementation of video surveillance in public by BIAs, as the example of Williams Lake shows. Thirdly, we have argued that BIAs interpret privacy protection guidelines in diverse ways. Overall, privacy protection guidelines have the unintended effect of promoting public video surveillance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098012471981">Hier and Walby, 2011</xref>) and encouraging some BIAs to become primary stewards of public video surveillance systems. Yet some BIAs use privacy protection guidelines to critique public video surveillance advocacy, as in Orillia. In these ways, the privacy protection guidelines contribute to the variation found in public video surveillance design and use by BIAs in Canada.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098012471981">Ward (2010)</xref> notes, the literature on BIAs tends to focus on large cities and in the US and the UK. We have supplemented the literature regarding BIAs by focusing on smaller cities and towns in Canada. This focus on smaller cities and variation therein raises a broader issue about urban studies and the limits of dichotomies such as public and private or preconceived notions of the interests of BIAs. We have not aimed to defend BIAs or the ‘clean and safe’ mantra. Far from it. Indeed, urban sociologists and geographers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098012471981">Lippert and Sleiman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098012471981">Cook, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012471981">Ward, 2007</xref>) have raised critical questions about BIAs and revitalisation strategies. Yet BIAs can be quite diverse, especially in smaller cities and towns where BIAs do not think of themselves as representing neo-liberal and corporate understandings of space. The work of BIAs intersects with public bodies, funding and laws, as our examples show. The public/private dichotomy is therefore difficult to apply even in seemingly clean-cut cases such as those involving BIAs and businesses. The partnerships that form in relation to video surveillance, then, are contingent and dependent on local and regional policy contexts. In urban studies, a trend has been noted towards creation of neo-liberal cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098012471981">Peck and Tickell, 2002</xref>), competitive cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012471981">Kipfer and Keil, 2002</xref>) and revanchist cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098012471981">Smith, 1996</xref>), private interests and neo-liberalism being the drivers of a marketisation of city living. While we cannot deny this general drift, underneath it there are eddies and exceptions that urban studies must also document and investigate.</p>
