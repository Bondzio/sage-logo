<p>Race remains pivotal to any explanation of American residential housing patterns. Carol Lynn McKibben makes this point abundantly clear in <italic>Racial Beachhead: Diversity and Democracy in a Military Town</italic>, the groundbreaking study of Seaside, California, an integrated post-war military suburb ideally situated on Monterey Bay. McKibben describes how this once white working- and middle-class area for vacationers became transformed by the presence of Fort Ord, the first desegregated military training base in California. Ford Ord was the largest training base on the West Coast. Thousands of U.S. infantry were trained there during and after World War II; and during the Vietnam War, draft dodgers would be tried there.</p>
<p>As Monterey became dependent upon the fishing industry, Seaside became a desirable residence for former military officers from Fort Ord, especially African and Asian Americans barred through restrictive covenants from living in surrounding towns like Carmel, Pacific Grove, Pebble Beach, Big Sur, and Monterey. Although Seaside too had evolved within a context of widespread housing segregation, the desegregated context of Fort Ord compelled many minority residents to band together and actively participate in political action, economic development, and the social and cultural life of the city. Seaside boasted numerous community and civic organizations, churches, and cultural and social events.</p>
<p>According to McKibben, policies of racial integration were played out in local democratic politics as the city incorporated during the early 1950s. Seaside “was multiracial in the fullest sense” (p. 85). She argues that it was military rank rather than “race” that fundamentally divided Seasiders. Urban scholars have noted that segregation should be lower in domains known to value racial equality, such as military installations. But the towns adjacent to these installations have been largely overlooked by community and urban scholars as well as by military historians, who have highlighted the North/South divide and ignored the West Coast altogether. In fact, California alone has some twenty-one towns and municipalities that had at one time been located near military installations.</p>
<p>Still, despite Seaside’s interracial ethos, the schools remained segregated, and local politics remained channeled through racially-based organizations like the NAACP, the JACL (Japanese American Citizens League), the Filipino-American Community Club, and the all-black Seaside Civic Voters League. And while no single racial or ethnic group held majority status in the post-war era, Seaside became widely known as a black settlement and carried a unique community identity that has persisted over time. To this day, Seaside is most known for the Monterey Jazz and Blues Festival, which began back in the 1970s.</p>
<p>The Pentagon’s Base Realignment and Closure Commission, which authorized the closing of Fort Ord, along with dozens of other military facilities across the nation after 1995, brought stark demographic changes. Indeed, some 60 percent of the closings occurred in California. By the mid-1990s, the former military base had become home to the California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB), the Monterey College of Law, and city-owned golf courses. Yet, we still know little about towns like Seaside and their role in shaping desegregation in America. <italic>Racial Beachead</italic> captures an important period of transition in race relations and in the organization of American communities that remains with us today.</p>
<p>Over the past thirty years, the demographic map of the nation has shifted dramatically. According to researchers, about thirty of the largest hundred U.S. metropolitan regions now contain more racial minorities than whites. Washington is among eight big-city metropolitan regions in which minorities became a majority in the past decade. Some of these cities have also had military installations. Nearly twenty-six million Americans have served in the military, and most have spent time at more than 450 military installations across the nation.</p>
<p>According to historians like McKibben, “minority-majority” cities have emerged in California as the new frontier of ethnic and race relations. In 2000, New York City and other metropolitan centers became dominated by non-whites, joining the ranks of such minority-majority cities—a term coined by Stanford historian Albert M. Camarillo to characterize West Coast cities like Compton and East Palo Alto, which were once home to a majority of white residents but became dominated by non-white minorities. McKibben contends that Seaside shares important characteristics with other minority-majority Californian post-war areas like Oakland, Southgate, and Monterey Park. Yet white and black populations in Seaside reached forty-year lows in 2000, making McKibben’s study timely while raising questions concerning the different historical forces shaping the demographic trajectories of cities like Monterey Park.</p>
<p>While at times the book is repetitive and cries out for more sociological analysis, <italic>Racial Beachhead: Diversity and Democracy in a Military Town</italic> fills an important gap in our understanding of the history of social change in minority-majority towns that have been shaped by the military. It makes a compelling case for how military towns have served as racial beachheads in the battle for social equality and should be widely read by scholars of military history, race/ethnicity, and urban and community sociology.</p>
