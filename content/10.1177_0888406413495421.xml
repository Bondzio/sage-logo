<abstract>
<p>In this article, the authors report findings from a self-report survey completed by 125 preservice elementary, secondary, and special education teachers. The purpose of the study was to identify aspects of university coursework and assigned field experiences that contribute to their ability to define, identify, and implement inclusion. Results indicated a lack of consistency across teacher preparation programs within one college and a disconnectness between knowledge of inclusion as presented through university coursework and students’ real-world field experience observations of inclusion. Preservice special educators’ perceived lack of confidence in their ability to implement inclusion in practice was also noted in the analysis of results. The article also addresses implications of the findings for teacher education programs.</p>

<p>Twenty-first century Federal mandates such as the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 and the most recent reauthorizations of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Acts of 1997 and 2004 place an increased emphasis on improving results and functional outcome for students with disabilities in general education curriculum and general education classrooms. Preparing teachers for success in increasingly diverse general education classrooms is a challenging task for teacher education programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0888406413495421">Conderman &amp; Johnston-Rodriguez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0888406413495421">Shade &amp; Stewart, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0888406413495421">Spandagou, Evans, &amp; Little, 2008</xref>). As a result of these trends in education, special and general educators must be prepared to teach in diverse contexts where they are expected to immediately demonstrate competency and improve student learning across varying structures and implementations of inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0888406413495421">Berry, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0888406413495421">Griffin, Kilgore, Winn, &amp; Otis-Wilborn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0888406413495421">Idol, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0888406413495421">Washburn-Moses, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Teacher education programs now place a decided focus on <italic>inclusion</italic> or <italic>inclusive education</italic>. In an inclusive school, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0888406413495421">Idol (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0888406413495421">Voltz, Brazil, and Ford (2001)</xref>, students with disabilities are accepted by their peers, participate in the academic and social community of the school, and have the necessary human and material resources that give them the opportunity to succeed in Least Restrictive Environments (LREs). The Council for Exceptional Children defined <italic>inclusion</italic> as an ideology that assumes all children should be educated in the school or classroom he or she would otherwise attend if not identified as an individual with a disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0888406413495421">Huber, 2009</xref>). Additional aspects of inclusion as defined in the literature include consultation and collaboration between general and special educators; materials and curriculum adaptations and perhaps even support personnel provided in the general education classroom; along with social as well as academic interactions between all students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0888406413495421">Idol, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0888406413495421">Kilanowski-Press, Foote, &amp; Rinaldo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0888406413495421">Shade &amp; Stewart, 2001</xref>). The manner in which schools and school districts interpret and implement inclusion, however, may muddle educators’ and teacher educators’ ability to recognize aspects of inclusion across various settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0888406413495421">Kilanowski-Press et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0888406413495421">Sherill, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0888406413495421">Snyder, Garriott, &amp; Aylor, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Decades after initial attempts to implement this sometimes rather elusive philosophical change to more inclusive education, research gauging the effectiveness of the preparation of general and special education teachers to teach in inclusive environments has begun to emerge. Much research has focused on preservice teacher attitudes toward inclusion but less attention has been paid to how well teacher candidates are able to define inclusion and how well they are able to recognize and implement inclusion. Therefore, a deeper and more thorough examination of the relationship between the content of teacher preparation coursework and preservice teacher recognition and implementation of inclusion in practice holds great promise for more effectively aligning teacher preparation experiences to current classrooms. Findings related to these aspects of teacher knowledge serve the purpose of identifying approaches to program design that may improve teachers’ ability to define, recognize, and competently implement inclusion in their classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0888406413495421">Symeonidou &amp; Phtiaka, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0888406413495421">Washburn-Moses, 2009</xref>). The research whose findings are reported here sought to (a) explore preservice teachers’ knowledge of inclusion based on their coursework and field experiences prior to student teaching and (b) determine alignment of coursework and field experience expectations.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>As researchers examine the effectiveness and relevancy of teacher preparation programs and students’ perceptions of inclusion, an understanding of the relationship of coursework and field experiences to preservice teachers’ knowledge of, and ability to recognize and implement, inclusion becomes critical given the current emphasis on inclusive classrooms. To allow them to immediately become successful at demonstrating effectiveness, teachers in training must acquire not just pedagogical knowledge but also authentic experiences that expose them to the increasingly wide range of student needs found in today’s classroom settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0888406413495421">Conderman &amp; Johnston-Rodriguez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0888406413495421">Kim, 2011</xref>). In addition, research to date has already led teacher preparation programs to examine possible differences across various certification areas to ensure that special, general, elementary, and secondary teacher candidates acquire the knowledge, information, and experiences necessary for them to succeed in inclusive classrooms.</p>
<p>A small number of recent research projects have reported findings after examining teacher program coursework and field experiences in relationship to aspects of inclusion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0888406413495421">Hodkinson (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0888406413495421">2006</xref>), who takes a position that the practice of inclusion extends beyond those individuals identified with a disability, examined the understanding of 80 newly graduated teacher candidates. He found that “trainees” had a good understanding of the theory of inclusion but that their “knowledge and skills related to the practical delivery of an inclusive education were limited” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0888406413495421">Hodkinson, 2005</xref>, p. 25). Follow-up data gathered from a small percentage of these original respondents indicated that novice teachers remained satisfied with their undergraduate training related to inclusion, but experienced barriers related to the implementation of their intended practices. As a result, they appeared to have adopted a more pessimistic, less confident outlook regarding their ability to implement inclusion in their settings after having been in the field for a short amount of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0888406413495421">Hodkinson, 2006</xref>). The work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0888406413495421">Van Laarhoven, Munk, Lynch, Bosma, and Rouse (2007)</xref> also focused on improving teacher preparation for today’s inclusive classrooms by embedding less theoretical and more practical content into their teacher preparation program. Adding an enriched hands-on experience (in the form of the delivery of a co-taught lesson in an inclusive classroom) for a cohort of 53 special and general educators resulted in a measurable increased ability to implement some of those teacher skills deemed necessary for effective teaching and learning in inclusive classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0888406413495421">Van Laarhoven et al., 2007</xref>). Although focused on teacher candidate attitudes toward inclusion rather than their actual knowledge of inclusion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0888406413495421">Kim (2011)</xref> found that 110 students enrolled in 10 different teacher preparation programs reported widely varying experiences in their coursework and field experiences in regard to the education of students with disabilities. Preservice students from combined (dual certification in special education and general education where curricula were interwoven) and separate programs (dual certification programs where curriculum for certifications was separate) had significantly more field experiences with students with disabilities than did teachers from general education, single certification programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0888406413495421">Kim, 2011</xref>). Given such discrepancies in course content, field experiences, and opportunities for practicing inclusion within teacher preparation programs, the relevancy of program components should become an essential focus of systematic study of preservice teacher training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0888406413495421">Harvey, Yssel, Bauserman, &amp; Merbler, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Other research sought more detailed information about possible differences across specialty areas within individual university teacher education programs. In a large-scale sampling of 326 teacher candidates in three different universities, differences in preservice teacher perceptions of inclusion were detected between groups of special educators, general educators, and individuals pursuing dual certification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0888406413495421">Shippen, Crites, Hutchins, Ramsey, &amp; Simon, 2005</xref>). A critical finding was that dual certification programs appeared to produce teachers more capable of implementing inclusion as measured by specific, observable teacher practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0888406413495421">Shippen et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0888406413495421">McHatton and McCray (2007)</xref> found differences between elementary and secondary teachers in terms of their perceptions of the positive outcomes of inclusion. Their analysis of data from surveys completed by 161 preservice teachers revealed a significant difference between the two groups, with secondary educators holding less positive beliefs about inclusion being a desirable educational practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0888406413495421">McHatton &amp; McCray, 2007</xref>). In other teacher education research that supported these findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0888406413495421">Cooper, Kurtts, Baber, and Vallecorsa (2008)</xref> examined the existence of core competencies related to inclusion across their own university’s undergraduate programs and found that courses and faculty in Secondary Education programs (SED) addressed such competencies to a lesser extent than did those in Elementary Education programs (EED). Last, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0888406413495421">Conderman and Johnston-Rodriguez (2009)</xref> surveyed 46 beginning teachers regarding their perceptions of the effectiveness of their preservice preparation for inclusion settings. They reported differences between the knowledge and skill levels of general and special educators, as well as between elementary and secondary teachers, as new teachers reflected back on their teacher preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0888406413495421">Conderman &amp; Johnston-Rodriguez,2009</xref>). Given the current emphasis on inclusion and the results of these studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0888406413495421">Cooper et al. (2008)</xref> issued a challenge to all teacher education programs to methodically examine their existing programs for consistency across disciplines, faculty instruction, and course content.</p>
<p>The research reported in this paper adds to this emerging body of knowledge. We first examined our own program syllabi for standards and outcomes most related to inclusion prior to reviewing existing means of evaluating preservice teachers’ ability to not only define inclusion but also to recognize components of inclusion in practice. We examined the source, breadth, and depth of knowledge of 125 elementary, special, and secondary preservice teachers across multiple courses of study and field placement settings in a large university in the southwestern United States. Data collection and analysis were guided by the following questions:</p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p>Researchers designed a single-measure self-report study for the purpose of examining preservice teachers’ perceptions of their undergraduate teacher preparation programs as related to defining and recognizing inclusion. The research-based survey items asked them to report on their knowledge of inclusion in relationship to their university experiences midway through completion of their second semester in a four-semester teacher preparation program. A purposeful sample of preservice teachers enrolled in three separate teacher preparation programs in a large university in the southwestern United States completed a written survey consisting of nine Likert-type scale items and two open-ended questions. The design of the research was approved by the university’s Internal Review Board prior to the start of data collection. In addition, survey items were piloted with a small group of Special Education/Dual Certification in Elementary Education (SPE) majors, after which the research team clarified wording and adjusted order of items for the purpose of eliciting more specific information from future respondents. Completion of the research-based survey was voluntary, confidentiality of respondents was ensured, and no rewards or penalties were attached to students’ participation or nonparticipation. Results provided specific information for developing more effective course content and fieldwork expectations across all three programs as well as for aligning program requirements with common practices in the field.</p>

<sec id="section4-0888406413495421">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants in the survey study were 125 preservice teachers at one university enrolled in three teacher preparation programs: SPE, EED, and SED. The number participating in the survey represented 48% of the entire enrollment in these teacher preparation programs during spring semester 2011. Students participating in the study were enrolled in a specific required course within each program, with students in two sections of each SPE and SED courses and one section of the EED course being presented the survey. At this university, students are formally admitted to the teacher education program Semester 5 of a typical 4-year course of study leading to teacher certification. The following program descriptions provide additional context for the study.</p>

<title>Program Descriptions</title>
<sec id="section6-0888406413495421">
<title>EED</title>
<p>Students engage in two semesters of field experience and two semesters of full-time student teaching. Each field experience requires that students spend 74 hr per semester in first- through eighth-grade classrooms while completing assignments related to their concurrent university coursework. The program requires that students take two special education focused courses: SPE 222 <italic>Orientation to Education of Exceptional Children</italic> and SPE 416 <italic>Quality Practices in the Collaborative Classroom</italic>. EED majors participating in the research were completing their second field experience and were enrolled in SPE 416.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0888406413495421">
<title>SPE</title>
<p>As in the Elementary certification program, students here engage in two semesters of field experience and two semesters of full-time student teaching. These students’ first field experience is in an elementary, general education classroom and their second placement is in a special education classroom in either an Elementary or Secondary setting. This dual certification program leads to certification in special education in mild, cross-categorical disabilities and first- through eighth-grade elementary education certification. SPE respondents were completing their second field experience and were in enrolled in SPE 317 <italic>Special Education for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Children and Youth.</italic></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0888406413495421">
<title>SED</title>
<p>The Bachelor of Arts in Education in SED prepares students who wish to teach in 7th through 12th grade in a particular content area. To integrate teacher education preparation with the secondary education requirement for an academic specialization, the teacher education program maintains connections with academic departments across the university. SED majors complete three semesters of 74 hr per semester field experience and one semester of full-time student teaching. In addition, the program requires students to take two special education–focused courses: SPE 222 <italic>Orientation to Education of Exceptional Children</italic> and SPE 417 <italic>Inclusion Practices at the Secondary Level</italic>. SED majors participating in the research were completing their second field placement and were in enrolled in SPE 417.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section9-0888406413495421">
<title>Survey Instrument</title>
<p>The survey format and content derived from a review of several existing instruments targeting teacher perceptions of inclusion and their own preparedness for meeting teacher expectations in inclusive classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0888406413495421">McPeek, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0888406413495421">Shade &amp; Stewart, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0888406413495421">Voltz et al., 2001</xref>). Items most relevant to the research questions posed here were included as we sought specific, focused information. Likert-type scale items asked respondents to note the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with various statements related to inclusion, for example, “In my university coursework, I have received instruction in how to identify an effective inclusion structure in a general education classroom.” See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0888406413495421">Table 1</xref> for complete set of items. Researchers intentionally sought to eliminate a “neutral” forced choice item by offering respondents choices of “strongly disagree,” “disagree,” “agree,” and “strongly agree.” In addition to the Likert-type scale items, respondents were asked to (a) identify factors from your university coursework that have helped you define inclusion and explain how they helped and (b) identify factors from your field experiences that have helped you define inclusion and explain how they helped. The rationale for the inclusion of these two questions was the desire to examine students’ actual knowledge of inclusion based on their ability to provide examples from their experiences and observations.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics in terms of frequencies, means, and standard deviations were prepared for the nine Likert-type scale survey items. In addition, a nonparametric Pearson’s chi-square analysis was conducted for the purpose of identifying possible significant relationships across survey items and programs. In the analysis of the qualitative data collected from the open-ended survey items, data were categorized and coded based on themes that emerged from each of the three groups of respondents. Results were examined within and across cases as per the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0888406413495421">Miles and Huberman (1994)</xref> approach to qualitative data analysis.

<title>Results</title>
<p>In this study, we produced qualitative and quantitative findings related to the knowledge of 125 preservice elementary, secondary, and special education teacher candidates enrolled in teacher preparation programs at one large public university in the southwestern United States. The data analysis exposed difference across programs in terms of (a) the extent to which SEDs reported gaining a preponderance of their knowledge of inclusion from their university instructors and course content, (b) the extent to which EEDs reported an ability to identify positive aspects of inclusion, and (c) opportunities for observing inclusion that varied within and across districts and placements.</p>

<title>Quantitative Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0888406413495421">Table 1</xref> presents findings from the nine Likert-type scale items presented to participants in terms of the percentage of individuals who indicated their agreement or strong agreement with specific statements. Preservice teachers’ general perceptions about inclusion emerged from their responses to Items 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9 on this portion of the survey. Sixty-five percent of SEDs responded that they were able to identify characteristics of effective inclusion (Item 1) and 67% noted that their university coursework had provided them with instruction on how to identify an effective inclusion structure (Item 2). Even greater percentages of SPE (92%) and EED (92%) preservice teachers agreed that they were able to identify characteristics of inclusion, and approximately two thirds of SPE and EED majors also credited their university coursework for their ability to do so. A slight majority of all respondents agreed that their university coursework had provided instruction on how to implement an inclusive structure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0888406413495421">Table 1</xref>); however, results from the inferential statistical analysis exposed a meaningful difference across the groups, with the number of SEDs who stated agreement with having received instruction on how to identify an inclusion structure differing significantly from the SPEs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0888406413495421">Table 2</xref>). A majority of respondents across all groups also agreed or strongly agreed that they were able to identify positive and negative aspects of inclusion. Of statistical significance was the percentage of EEDs able to identify the positive aspects of inclusion when compared with the other two groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0888406413495421">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0888406413495421">2</xref>).</p>

<p>Items 4, 5, 6, and 7 on the Likert-type scale focused on teachers’ recognition of more specific aspects of inclusion in their field experience settings. Forty-four percent of the SPEs and 42% of the EEDs agreed that classroom teachers in their field placements had given them instruction on identifying inclusion while a markedly less percentage of SEDs (12%) reported the same. This discrepancy in findings for SED majors occurred elsewhere. For example, less than one third of the SEDs agreed that, in their placements inclusion consisted of adapting materials, of noting the location where students with disabilities received services, or of observing instances of students with and without disabilities interacting with one another. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0888406413495421">Table 2</xref> results confirm that SEDs responses related to adapting materials (Item 5) and the placement of students with disabilities (Item 6) differed significantly from those of SPEs and EEDs. Last, the 24 EED respondents agreed to a much greater extent than the other two groups that they recognized the adaptation of materials for students with special needs (88%) and had observed students with and without disabilities interacting with one another (79%) in their field placement settings.</p>

<title>Qualitative Results</title>
<p>In addition to the Likert-type scale items, respondents were asked to comment on the following: (a) identify factors from your university coursework that have helped you define inclusion and explain how and (b) identify factors from your field experience placements that have helped you define inclusion and explain how. For analysis of this data set, responses for each group were first examined, emergent themes and categories were identified, and ultimately discrete responses were coded and placed into categories via agreement across members of the research team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0888406413495421">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). Findings were also quantified and were reported within cases, that is, the three groups of respondents, as well as across cases. Not all participants who completed the Likert-type scale portion of the survey provided written responses to both short answer items.</p>
<sec id="section14-0888406413495421">
<title>Coursework</title>
<p>The SED majors responding to this portion of the survey provided 42 separate responses for this inquiry about their coursework. Thirty-nine of these 42 responses fell into one of the following categories: the content of a course in terms of text or topics covered in class (12 responses), an instructor’s knowledge and experiences (10), a specific course that enhanced knowledge of inclusion (10), and responses that provided a definition of inclusion, rather than aspects of their coursework that helped them define inclusion (7). For SEDs, “learning about scaffolding, multiple intelligences, and brain-based lessons” and “participating in an activity together,” having “class discussions, group work, and project presentations” that exemplified textbook definitions, aided in their ability to define inclusion. In terms of their university instructors, students also valued “hearing the teacher’s actual stories” and having an instructor who was “knowledgeable of and experienced in special education classrooms” and so could “provide practical examples.”</p>
<p>EEDs completing this portion of the survey provided 14 short answers, including two individuals who noted that “nothing” in their coursework helped them define inclusion. EEDs listed class discussions, readings from the text, and “having to include accommodations and modifications on lesson plans” as valuable aspects of their coursework (4 comments) along with instructor insights and examples (3 responses). EEDs specifically listed two required courses offered via the Special Education department as sources of information on inclusion (3 comments) and one individual referred to a course for English Language Learners as helpful. Findings for SED and EED majors reflected their program design, that is, the most valuable information was presented in specific courses designed to educate preservice general educators about diverse learners.</p>
<p>For SPE majors, the data appeared richer and more varied. For Inquiry 1, 42 discrete responses were categorized, with 6 of those responses providing a definition of inclusion, another 7 responses indicating that they “hadn’t learned a lot” or “didn’t know” from their coursework, and 1 response noting “interning has been more beneficial.” As the SPEs listed specific coursework that helped them define inclusion, the comments included a broader array of courses than those of SED and EED majors. This would be expected as the SPE program is comprehensively aimed toward future special educators and does not include a specific course focused on inclusive or collaborative teacher practice as do the other two programs. For example, six separate SPEs listed as valuable courses related to classroom management and classroom assessment as well as the introductory Special Education and English Language Learner courses as valuable. Unlike the EEDs and SEDs who provided responses about coursework and their knowledge of inclusion, SPEs mentioned only 3 times that “hearing stories” and having teachers “share their own experiences” were factors that helped them define inclusion, but, similar to SED and EED respondents, SPEs often provided a “textbook” definition of inclusion rather than noting factors in their coursework that helped them define the concept (12 such responses).</p>
<p>When SPE majors commented on their coursework, two new subcategories of responses emerged. First, respondents noted the difference between knowing inclusion as defined by the textbook and implementing inclusion in practice (7). The following statements are indicative of this sentiment: “Coursework has mostly taught me a simple, generic definition of inclusion” or “I’ve learned what inclusion is, but not so much how to set up a successful inclusion model” and “I know that I can define it from the book.” Second, another six of the SPE respondents included comments regarding the acquisition of specific skills necessary for implementing inclusion. They commented on “learning how to make modifications,” “building on the strengths” of students, “being taught the ways inclusion has been beneficial,” and placing students in the LRE. Unlike EEDs and SEDs completing the survey, SPEs expressed concerns about knowing how to implement inclusion, and their responses exposed a realization that doing so would be a part of their responsibilities as special educators.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0888406413495421">
<title>Field experiences</title>
<p>To more accurately determine students’ ability to define and examine inclusion in practice, participants were asked to identify aspects of inclusion related to their field placements. Mirroring their responses to items on the Likert-type scale portion of the survey related to their field experiences, half (16) of the SEDs’ 32 comments indicated that they either were not able to identify any students with disabilities in their field experience settings or that no aspects of their field experiences added to their knowledge of inclusion. Two individuals had experienced placements in co-taught classrooms that they termed helpful. The remainder of their comments (14) related to drawing their own conclusions or assumptions about inclusion based on what they had observed, for example, “a student went to the special education room to take a test” or “including the student in lectures and answering their questions.” For EEDs, their 10 comments could be categorized into two types: what they had observed in terms of students’ LRE placements (4 responses) or comments regarding teacher practice (6 responses). For example, they saw “aides come in to assist students with special needs” and “some students with special needs being pulled out.” As evidence of teacher practice, they noted that their placement teachers “spent time with the special education teacher,” adjusted their lesson plans for students with special needs, and made modifications to curriculum. Unlike the high percentage of EEDs who indicated on the Likert-type scale that they witnessed student interactions in their field placements, no such examples were listed here.</p>
<p>The 38 SPEs completing this item on the survey provided 41 separate responses. Nine individuals referred to being placed in either a self-contained special education school or a self-contained classroom within a school, perhaps partially accounting for their Likert-type scale responses to Item 7. These SPEs readily acknowledged the absence of any interaction between individuals with disabilities and those without in these settings, for example, “My field experience placement hasn’t helped me define inclusion because it is a school of only students with disabilities and each classroom is self-contained.” The categories of the remaining responses included the transitioning of students between settings (14 responses), the interactions between students (6), and evidence of support personnel (5 responses). A preponderance of these preservice teachers’ definitions of inclusion related to where students were placed and their movement between classroom settings based on that placement. In some settings, the “push-in” or mainstreaming model was apparent: “In my classroom, the students participate in Specials with the general education classroom” and “The school allows students to eat lunch with the general population.” In other settings, “pull-out” appeared the norm: “[We] see students twice a day but always send them back to the general education classroom” or “students spend most of their day in the general education classroom.” The comments (6) related to observed interactions between students as evidence of inclusion were descriptive, for example, “Being able to experience the interactions students have together is amazing!” and “my teacher set up an extracurricular club (with special ed and general ed students).” Last, five individuals noted that the presence of an aide or a co-teacher was an aspect of their field experience from which they had gained knowledge of inclusion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Findings from the study exposed differences in preservice teachers’ knowledge of inclusion that depended on the level at which they chose to teach (elementary or secondary), their area of certification (special education or general education), and the design of service delivery in field placements. In addition to identifying strengths and weakness in programs, findings also identified areas in which teacher preparation programs can assist students in bridging the chasm between theory and practice as preservice teachers.</p>
<p>Considering those aspects of teacher preparation programs that significantly contribute to teacher candidates’ ability to define and identify inclusion, the results of this study indicate that preservice teachers are confident of their ability to define inclusion as presented via course content. EEDs and SEDs were able to identify specific courses—primarily the two courses offered by the special education department—that contained content, readings, and in-class activities that helped them define inclusion. In addition, SEDs especially valued university instructors who were able to relay “real world,” personal experiences relevant to inclusion of students with disabilities in general education classrooms. This is not surprising given that SED majors reported few opportunities in secondary level classrooms to experience inclusion. EEDs reported more exposure to adapting materials in their field experience classrooms, more of them witnessed students with disabilities interacting with students without disabilities in their settings, and many more of them were able to identify positive aspects of inclusion. Such findings support the conclusion that opportunities to experience inclusion and that models of inclusion differ markedly across classroom settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0888406413495421">Kilanowski-Press et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0888406413495421">McHatton &amp; McCray, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0888406413495421">Snyder et al., 2001</xref>). Results also seem to indicate that preservice teachers across programs are not consistently provided with sufficient instruction in recognizing those aspects of inclusion that reach beyond the mere placement of students in general education settings. They need to know that inclusion also comprises the use of resources such as personnel and adapted materials, as well as teacher-to-teacher, teacher-to-student, and student-to-student interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0888406413495421">Idol, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we produced somewhat unsettling information regarding the preparation of the SPE majors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0888406413495421">Shippen et al. (2005)</xref> found that their group of Dual Certification majors perceived themselves as very prepared for implementing inclusion in their future practice whereas the SPE majors in this study expressed their lack of preparation to do so. SPE respondents appeared able to voice concern that they were missing those skills; however, these are the teachers who should be the most prepared to implement and advocate for inclusion as appropriate in any setting. Surprisingly, a larger percentage of EED majors could identify the positive outcomes of inclusion and appeared to have experienced inclusion in their field experiences to a greater degree than did SPE or SED majors.</p>
<p>A major impetus for the research was that, informally, Special Education preservice and graduated teachers expressed concerns about their teacher preparation not fully aligning with common practices and typical service delivery models in local school districts. Findings reported here give credence to their anecdotal statements and prompt teacher educators to more closely examine expected student outcomes within the current program design. Despite federal legislation emphasizing teacher knowledge and experiences related to inclusion, the SPE majors in our study reported (a) little guidance from their field placement teachers in terms of implementing inclusion and (b) little more than the opportunity to notice students moving from less to more restrictive environments as inclusion. Special Educators must be prepared for the complexity and diversity of their anticipated roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0888406413495421">Washburn-Moses, 2009</xref>). SPEs in this study recognized a troubling disconnect between university coursework requirements and common practices in the field regarding inclusion of students with disabilities in general education curriculum and settings. A subsequent focus of inquiry has begun and includes a closer examination of local district approaches to inclusion.</p>
<p>Last, as evidenced by this study, preservice teachers struggled with the transition from theory to practice. The initial sequence of learning for preservice teachers in this study could be aligned to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0888406413495421">Mezirow (2000)</xref> described as Instrumental Learning. Instrumental Learning occurs when individuals have the ability to rotely remember facts, perform a prescribed set of skills, and/or recite information learned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0888406413495421">Mezirow, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0888406413495421">Mezirow &amp; Taylor, 2009</xref>). The EED, SPE, and SED respondents in the study appeared confident that they had acquired knowledge of inclusion in their university classrooms; however, when their ability to recognize inclusion in their field placement settings within the context of their newly acquired knowledge was more closely examined, they were not as consistent and definite. Therefore, a next logical emphasis for education of preservice teachers becomes enhancing their ability to recognize elements of inclusion in practice, with an ultimate goal of them being able to critically examine and improve the inclusion structures they experience in the field. Acting and reacting in this manner would reflect a level of learning and growth referred to as Transformative Learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0888406413495421">Mezirow, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0888406413495421">Mezirow &amp; Taylor, 2009</xref>). This level of learning would be evidenced by students embedding themselves in their learning experiences and subsequently feeling confident in their ability to promote inclusion in a variety of real-world settings. All teachers are responsible for the academic success of diverse groups of students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0888406413495421">Berry, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0888406413495421">Conderman &amp; Johnston-Rodriguez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0888406413495421">Idol, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0888406413495421">Shade &amp; Stewart, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0888406413495421">Spandagou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0888406413495421">Washburn-Moses, 2009</xref>). By exiting teacher preparation programs with the ability to define, recognize, and feel confident in implementing inclusion, all new teachers would react in a manner that connects university experiences with current teaching practices.</p>

<sec id="section17-0888406413495421">
<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>First, results reflect findings from a relatively small number of teacher candidates within the design of one particular university’s teacher education program. Therefore, results may not be generalizable to other programs and contexts. Second, nearly half the total number of teacher candidates at this university during one particular semester completed the survey and all those presented with the in-class face-to-face survey completed the items, although fewer respondents provided responses to the open-ended items on the tool. Of note is that the selection of the specific course sections that were presented with the survey was purposeful rather than random. Course syllabi are certainly aligned across all sections of particular courses at this university; however, in the design of this study, researchers could not control for individual differences in terms of the experiences and teaching style of specific university instructors and their perspectives and definitions of inclusion and its implementation. Respondents’ information related to knowledge acquired through university coursework, then, could certainly vary depending on the course instructor. Third, within the design of this teacher education program, students’ field experience assignments with local school districts are made randomly while following state guidelines for eventual recommendation for teacher certification. Yet, this study gathered no information from or about the experiences and teacher dispositions of individual practicing teachers with whom teacher candidates were placed. Again, differences across these individuals, schools, and districts could certainly influence the experiences and knowledge of teacher candidates as acquired in local classrooms and schools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0888406413495421">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>The research reported here sought to examine how successfully one university’s teacher education programs provided preservice teachers with adequate knowledge of inclusion along with experiences intending to support that knowledge. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0888406413495421">Van Laarhoven and her associates (2007)</xref> stated that “enhancing” existing programs was the most realistic and immediate answer to improving the knowledge and skills of all teacher candidates given current mandates for more inclusion of students with special needs into K-12 classrooms. Within this context, implications for teacher education include the need for systematic collection and analysis of data related to (a) the level of students’ acquired knowledge, (b) the effectiveness of course content and field experiences in increasing that level of knowledge, and (c) the degree to which teacher education program requirements meet the needs of local school district expectations for general and special educators.</p>
<p>As did <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0888406413495421">Idol (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0888406413495421">McHatton and McCray (2007)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0888406413495421">Berry (2010)</xref>, the study reported here found apparent differences across Elementary, Secondary, and Special Education teacher preparation experiences at the undergraduate level. Such findings indicate the need to further examine the tasks and activities related to inclusion across programs while taking into account the varying opportunities to observe and implement inclusion across grade levels and differing school contexts. For instance, SED majors had fewer opportunities to observe students with special needs in their field experience settings. Therefore, their coursework now requires them to interview a special education teacher and write a description of indicators of inclusion they noted in their field placement settings. Although findings reported here support the work of others, numbers were small and findings relate most specifically to the design of a particular teacher education program in one large public university.</p>
<p>EED, SED, and SPE preservice teachers reported varying experiences in their ability to bridge the gap between theory and practice in relationship to inclusion. Nevertheless, their experiences in the field appeared to expand their knowledge of inclusion to a greater degree than did their university coursework. For the SPE majors in the study, however, field placement experiences in self-contained settings limited opportunities for growth and learning with respect to inclusion. Such placements are no longer viewed as appropriate or useful for individuals receiving Cross-Categorical and Elementary teaching certification. In addition, SPE coursework will include assignments that require students to design effective strategies to promote inclusion within a variety of settings as they prepare themselves for a range of roles and responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0888406413495421">Griffin et al., 2009</xref>). For all programs, designated courses now include application and evaluation assignments that enhance students’ ability to relate textbook definitions of inclusion to specific aspects of inclusion as evidenced in real classrooms.</p>
<p>Further research related to teacher education program improvement will also include the development of an effective tool to measure not only preservice teachers’ knowledge of inclusion but also their ability to recognize inclusion in the field and put into practice those concepts learned in higher education classrooms. As an additional result of findings reported here, program development focuses on providing preservice teachers with a less fragmented, “bunch of disjointed experiences” related to inclusion and instead presents inclusion as a complex, contextual concept that may be implemented in varying degrees across schools and classrooms.</p>
