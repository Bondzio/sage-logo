<title>Background:</title>
<p>Alterations in the sleep–wake cycle, including daytime napping, are consistently reported in persons with dementia (PWD). A dysregulation in the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, indexed by elevated evening cortisol, may offer one explanation for these alterations. Alternatively, excessive daytime sleeping may alter cortisol rhythm and increase intraindividual variability, potentially contributing to increased environmental reactivity and behavioral symptoms. The purpose of this substudy (<italic>N</italic> = 12) was to examine the association between daytime napping and basal cortisol diurnal rhythm in nursing home residents with dementia.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Method:</title>
<p>In this within-individual longitudinal design, saliva samples were obtained daily for 5 consecutive days upon waking and 30–45 min, 6 hr, and 12 hr after waking to obtain a cortisol diurnal rhythm. Behavior and sleep–wake state (nap/no nap) were observed and recorded every 20 min for 12 hr per day for 5 days.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Participants were categorized as high nappers (HNs) or low nappers (LNs). There was a significant difference in evening cortisol levels (<italic>t</italic> = −2.38, <italic>p</italic> = .032) and continence (<italic>t</italic> = 3.37, <italic>p</italic> = .007) between groups, with HNs exhibiting higher evening cortisol levels. There were no other significant differences in resident characteristics between the two groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>These data suggest a link between excessive daytime napping and elevated evening cortisol in PWD consistent with findings in children. Elevated evening cortisol is an indication of a dysregulation in the HPA axis. These preliminary data support a close association between the sleep–wake cycle and HPA-axis regulation in PWD.</p>

<p>Researchers consistently report alterations in the sleep–wake cycle, such as daytime napping, and circadian-rhythm disruption in nursing home (NH) residents with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1099800411420861">Gehrman et al., 2005</xref>). Caregivers frequently view napping during the day for NH residents with dementia as positive; however, they may not be familiar with the potentially negative consequences of extended napping.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1099800411420861">Tamaki, Shirota, Hayashi, and Hori (2000)</xref> showed that napping for &lt;30 min between 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. had positive effects on alertness and performance for community-dwelling older adults. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1099800411420861">Monk, Buysse, Billy, Rose, and Carrier (2001)</xref> found that napping between 1:30 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. for 58 min resulted in earlier wake time and decreased sleep efficiency in healthy elders. While some daytime napping may be attributed to physical limitations, researchers have found napping more than 1.5 hr in the afternoon to be associated with unintended negative consequences such as increased falls and hip fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1099800411420861">Avidan et al., 2005</xref>), increased nighttime awakenings, and increased mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1099800411420861">Stone et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies have shown that sleep disturbance is a 24-hr condition in the NH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1099800411420861">Jacobs, Ancoli-Israel, Parker, &amp; Kripke, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1099800411420861">Pat-Horenczyk, Klauber, Shochat, &amp; Ancoli-Israel, 1998</xref>), such that over the long term, the pattern of excessive daytime napping increases sleep disturbances. While few studies have examined associations between biological endogenous rhythms, such as cortisol, and sleep disturbances in NH residents, investigators have examined these associations in community-dwelling elders. They found that excessive daytime napping is associated with altered temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1099800411420861">Monk, Buysse, Billy, Rose, &amp; Carrier, 2001</xref>), cortisol, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) diurnal rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1099800411420861">Vgontzas et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, it is likely that excessive daytime napping in NH residents contributes to an altered cortisol diurnal rhythm.</p>
<p>Physical inactivity can also contribute to circadian-rhythm disturbance. NH residents nap in bed or in a chair 26–40% of their day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1099800411420861">Martin et al., 2006</xref>). They spend an average of 13 hr in bed at night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1099800411420861">Fetveit &amp; Bjorvatn, 2002</xref>), with an additional 2 hr in bed during the day. Thus, a typical NH resident spends only 9 hr per day out of bed. Although physical activity is a less potent cue than light–dark for circadian entrainment, lack of physical activity likely contributes to circadian-rhythm disturbance in the NH setting.</p>
<p>Circadian rhythms are 24-hr biological and behavioral cycles (e.g., body temperature and rest/activity) that exist for virtually every homeostatic function of the body. Normally, cortisol has a distinct diurnal rhythm that typically peaks 30–45 min after wake time in healthy individuals then decreases over the course of the day to a low point in the evening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1099800411420861">Posener, Schildkraut, Samson, &amp; Schatzberg, 1996</xref>). Several studies have documented HPA-axis dysregulation in persons with dementia (PWD) via findings of elevated evening cortisol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1099800411420861">Ferrari &amp; Magri, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1099800411420861">Wilkinson et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Findings have, further, linked alterations in the sleep–wake cycle with HPA-axis dysregulation in young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1099800411420861">Backhaus, Junghanns, &amp; Hohagen, 2004</xref>) and in NH residents with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1099800411420861">Woods &amp; Martin, 2007</xref>). In fact, daytime sleeping may alter the HPA-axis rhythm over time by entraining the individual to an alternative rhythm, potentially increasing intraindividual HPA-axis dysregulation, resulting in negative health consequences such as depression, altered adrenal function, decreased glucose tolerance, decreased insulin sensitivity, and increased evening cortisol levels, as have been found in young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099800411420861">Balbo, Leproult, &amp; Van Cauter, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1099800411420861">Martin et al. (2006)</xref> did examine sleep disturbance in NH residents who exhibit excessive daytime napping; however, few studies have included other circadian-rhythm variables, such cortisol rhythm, in studies involving NH residents.</p>
<p>While sleep disturbance in some PWD in NHs may be due in part to deterioration in the superchiasmic nucleus (SCN), several additional factors in the NH contribute to these disturbances in NH residents. These factors include medical comorbidities, medications/polypharmacy, environmental factors (e.g., noise and light during the night, low daytime indoor illumination, and little time spent outdoors), and behavioral factors (e.g., physical inactivity, extended time spent in bed, and excessive daytime napping).</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the association between daytime napping and basal cortisol diurnal rhythm in NH residents with dementia. We tested the hypothesis that more daytime napping in NH residents with dementia is associated with an elevated evening cortisol level compared to those residents with less daytime napping.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>We included in this substudy 12 NH residents (10 females and 2 males; aged 80 to 93, mean age 86.8), who met the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition</italic> (<italic>DSM-IV</italic>) criteria for moderate-to-severe dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1099800411420861">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>), as reported in their medical records. Briefly, the parent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1099800411420861">Woods, Bushnell, Kim, Geschwind, &amp; Cummings, 2009</xref>), in which we examined the association between genotype and behavioral symptoms of dementia (BSD), included 38 residents of a Los Angeles NH ≥65 years of age, who had been stabilized on medication for ≥1 month and had resided in the NH for ≥2 months. In the current substudy, we examined functional status, cortisol and sleep–wake variables in those participants for whom we had evening cortisol data. We used a score on the mini-mental state exam (MMSE) <underline>&lt;</underline> 25 (scores range from 0 to 30; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1099800411420861">Folstein, Folstein, &amp; McHugh, 1975</xref>) to confirm cognitive impairment. NH staff screened residents for participation in the study using the brief agitated rating scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1099800411420861">Finkel, Lyons, &amp; Anderson, 1993</xref>). Screening and enrollment procedures are described more fully in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1099800411420861">Woods, Beck, and Sinha (2009)</xref>. We used the Katz activities of Daily living (ADL) scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1099800411420861">Katz &amp; Akpom, 1976</xref>) to score six activities: bathing, dressing, going to the toilet, mobility, feeding, and continence. Scores for each activity range from 1 (<italic>no disability in basic functions</italic>) to 3 (<italic>disability in all basic functions</italic>), with a total possible score of 18.</p>

<title>Behavioral and sleep–wake observations</title>
<p>We used the modified agitated behavior rating scale (mABRS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1099800411420861">Woods &amp; Dimond, 2002</xref>) to directly observe six behaviors: restlessness, searching and wandering, escaping restraint, tapping and banging, pacing and wandering, and vocalization. We scored each behavior on a scale of 0–3 for intensity, with 0 signifying an <italic>absence of the behavior</italic> and 3 <italic>signifying the greatest intensity</italic>. We also scored sleep–wake state as 0 (<italic>sleep</italic>) or 1 (<italic>wake</italic>). We defined sleep as eyes closed and resting head on the back of a chair or wheelchair or lying in bed. We recorded behavior and sleep–wake state every 20 min for each 12-hr observation period. For each period, the maximum sleep–wake score per participant was 36.</p>

<sec id="section6-1099800411420861">
<title>Salivary cortisol</title>
<p>Salivary cortisol is a well-established, noninvasive, reliable, and valid reflection of biologically active cortisol with high correlations to the unbound hormone in serum, plasma (<italic>r</italic> = .805), and urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099800411420861">Hellhammer, Wust, &amp; Kudielka, 2009</xref>). The ability to use saliva, rather than plasma, to measure the marker of interest is an important benefit when working with NH residents due to the decreased stress of sampling, the ability to collect multiple samples noninvasively, and the stability of the sample for up to 2 weeks at room temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1099800411420861">Malamud, 1992</xref>), which eliminates the need for immediate freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1099800411420861">Woods &amp; Mentes, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section7-1099800411420861">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>We obtained approval for this study from the UCLA Institutional Review Board and the ethics committee of the NH. We obtained proxy consent from family members. Trained research assistants (RAs) abstracted demographic data from resident charts and completed the ADL scale and the MMSE for each participant.</p>
<p>RAs collected salivary samples upon participants' waking and 30–45 min, 6 hr, and 12 hr after participants' wake time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1099800411420861">Edwards, Evans, Hucklebridge, &amp; Clow, 2001</xref>) for 5 consecutive days using a Sorbette<sup>®</sup> (Salimetrics, LLC, State College, PA). We considered a participant to be awake if her or his eyes were open while in bed. After establishing that 5:00 a.m. was the usual wake time for most residents, RAs arrived at the NH by that time. After explaining the procedure to the resident, RAs obtained saliva samples by asking the resident to open his or her mouth, placing three Sorbettes under his or her tongue for 1 full min and then transferring the Sorbettes to a clean prelabeled Salivette™ (Sardsedt Inc., Newton, NC) and then into a cooler prior to transfer to the university laboratory. We centrifuged the Salivettes and stored them in a −70 °C freezer for 2 weeks prior to shipment in dry ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1099800411420861">Woods, Kim, &amp; Yefimova, 2011</xref>) to the Women’s Health Research Unit at the University of Alberta for analysis. Laboratory personnel used cortisol enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Salimetrics LLC, State College, PA) to determine cortisol levels. This assay uses 25 µl of saliva to capture salivary cortisol levels ranging from 0.003 to 3.0 µg/dl (.03 ng/ml–3.00 nmol/L) and has a calibration range of 0.012–3.000 µg/dl. Coefficient of variation (CV) was 6.41% across 12 runs with an intra-assay variability CV of 3.65% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1099800411420861">Woods, Beck, &amp; Sinha, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Trained RAs recorded scores for behaviors and sleep–wake state on a Palm Pilot personal digital assistant (PDA; PalmOne Inc, Milpitas, CA) using a section of the mABRS, every 20 min from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. for 5 consecutive days (more fully described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1099800411420861">Woods et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To ensure the validity and reliability of behavior and sleep/wake observations, RAs completed a 2-hr training session on the coding system during which they viewed videotapes of an NH resident and scored both behavior and sleep–wake state using the modified mABRS in a location outside the NH. The protocol is more fully described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1099800411420861">Woods et al. (2008)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1099800411420861">
<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>We aggregated within-person sleep–wake (napping) activity separately into three time periods for each day: morning = 10:00 a.m.–12:59 p.m., midday = 1:00 p.m.–3:59 p.m., and evening = 4:00 p.m.–bedtime. We summed napping activity for each participant within each time period and across 5 days and total within-person napping activity across 5 days.</p>
<p>Based on napping activity, we divided participants into two groups: HNs and LNs. We defined HNs as those residents who were scored as “asleep” during &gt;15% of the daily observations between 10:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., which is equivalent to being asleep &gt;1.5 hr/day and &gt;6 hr in 5 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1099800411420861">Martin, Alam, Harker, Josephson, &amp; Alessi, 2008</xref>). We calculated means and standard deviations (<italic>SD</italic>s) of napping activity for each group. We performed Student’s <italic>t</italic> tests to explore the differences between the HN and LN groups overall and during the three time periods of morning, midday, and evening. Since restlessness accounted for the highest proportion of behavioral symptoms observed, and since there was no significant difference in napping between groups during the midday time period, we conducted a post hoc analysis of restlessness to detect any behavior difference between groups at this time. We aggregated restlessness separately into three time periods for each day using the same time periods described above for napping and calculated mean within-person restlessness for each time period across 5 days.</p>
<p>We calculated within-person mean and <italic>SD</italic> of evening cortisol (4:00 p.m.–bedtime) across 5 days. We discarded levels &gt;3.0 µg/dl due to the possibility of contamination, based on the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>

<p>Mean napping time was significantly different between HNs and LNs for both the morning (<italic>t</italic> = −2.73, <italic>p</italic> = .02) and the evening (<italic>t</italic> = −2.84, <italic>p</italic> = .02) time periods but not for the midday time period (<italic>t</italic> = −.838, <italic>p</italic> = .422; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1099800411420861">Table 2</xref>). Total hours spent napping over the 5-day period ranged from 8.3 to 14.2 for HNs and from 1.6 to 6.6 for LNs.</p>
<p>Restlessness constituted 56.2% of all agitated behaviors observed across all participants, followed by vocalization (24.5%), tapping and banging (10.2%), pacing and walking (5.3%), searching and wandering (2.3%), and escaping restraints (1.5%). Post hoc analysis of behaviors observed during midday, when napping was equal in the two groups, showed that the LN group exhibited significantly greater mean restlessness than the HN group across the 5-day period (<italic>M</italic> = .277, <italic>SD</italic> = .49 vs. <italic>M</italic> = .197, <italic>SD</italic> = .32, respectively; <italic>p</italic> = .012).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study is the first to specifically examine the association between excessive daytime napping and evening cortisol levels in NH residents with dementia. Our findings suggest that there is, indeed, a link between excessive napping and evening cortisol, potentially indicating a marked phase delay in the circadian rhythm or an HPA-axis dysregulation in the HN group. However, due to the correlational nature of the study, it is not possible to ascertain whether excessive daytime napping influenced evening cortisol levels or higher evening cortisol levels, indicative of an altered circadian rhythm, influenced daytime napping. The finding of higher evening cortisol levels in the HN group is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1099800411420861">Ward et al.’s (2008)</xref> findings of an association between disruptive napping patterns and higher cortisol levels among children.</p>
<p>Our findings also suggest a close association between the sleep–wake cycle and HPA-axis regulation in NH residents with dementia since elevated evening cortisol may suggest HPA-axis dysregulation. However, given the neuropathology of dementia, it is also possible that daytime napping is, in part, related to an already altered circadian rhythm. Prior studies have suggested both a relationship between wake time and HPA diurnal profile and an association between the sleep–wake cycle and cortisol secretion among NH residents with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1099800411420861">Woods &amp; Martin, 2007</xref>). In an earlier study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1099800411420861">Hatfield, Herbert, van Someren, Hodges, and Hastings (2004)</xref> showed that cortisol levels are associated with sleep–wake cycle disorders among PWD.</p>
<p>In terms of group differences in ADLs, mental state, and medical history, the only between-group difference we found was that the HN group experienced significantly greater incontinence and lower ADL compared with the LN group. By contrast, Hatfield et al. found significant differences in MMSE score, number of comorbidities, and number of psychoactive medications in home-dwelling persons with moderate dementia with elevated 4:00 p.m. cortisol levels and sleep–wake disturbances compared to those with mild dementia. The differences in our findings are likely due to our small sample size.</p>
<p>The only difference we found in agitated behaviors between the groups was a difference in the level of restlessness during the midday time period. Restlessness is one of the behaviors associated with agitation that occurs most frequently and with the highest intensity among PWDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1099800411420861">Woods et al., 2011</xref>). The significant difference between the two groups was driven by 2 of the 5 LN-group participants who exhibited high-intensity restlessness at midday. Given that there were no significant differences between groups in medication or MMSE, the reason for this difference remains perplexing.</p>
<p>The primary limitation of the present study was the small sample size. Consequently, while the findings suggest interesting relationships, we must exercise caution in their interpretation. Though we intend to confirm our results using longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes, the effect sizes in the present small sample do suggest a robust relationship between excessive daytime napping and evening cortisol levels.</p>
<sec id="section11-1099800411420861">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Excessive daytime napping may have a physiological impact among NH residents with dementia, though as discussed above, the causal direction is unclear. Elevated evening cortisol levels may alter IL-6 levels, contributing to further sleep disruption and maintaining an already disrupted sleep–wake rhythm. Moreover, elevated evening cortisol can promote an increase in the proinflammatory actions of IL-6, contributing to an increase in nonrestorative sleep and a decrease in the levels of growth hormone necessary for the maintenance and repair of tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1099800411420861">Vgontzas et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>NH staff or caregivers can alter daytime napping behavior in residents with a variety of interventions, such as increased physical activity and planned programs to increase the PWD’s engagement with the environment. Interventions that maintain a more normative sleep–wake cycle may help the PWD to maintain a more normative cortisol diurnal rhythm. Increased daytime activities can potentially decrease excessive daytime napping and mitigate further HPA-axis dysregulation.</p>
