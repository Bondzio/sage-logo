         <abstract>
            <p>The objectives of this study were to benchmark patient recruitment and retention practices across recently completed global clinical trials from a working group of biopharmaceutical companies. The data collection focused on recruitment and retention tactics used by companies as well as detailed information about the size and scope of the global trials conducted. In-depth organizational information regarding patient recruitment and retention structure and functions was collected. Despite numerous tactics available, participating companies indicated using a small number of patient recruitment and retention tactics. In addition, companies reported that 32% of studies did not implement any tactics. Traditional tactics were most widely used, including physician referrals (16%), newspaper advertisements (16%), and radio advertisements (13%). The relationship between use of recruitment tactics and enrollment data was explored and a positive association was found between use of nontraditional recruitment tactics and enrollment rates.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Despite more than two decades of focused attention and improvement efforts, patient recruitment and retention are among the largest challenges facing the clinical research enterprise today and among the greatest contributors to delays in drug development. These challenges and delays have been documented extensively in the peer-review and trade literature.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512453040">1</xref>
            </sup> For example, Sung et al,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512453040">2</xref>
            </sup> in a seminal 2003 article in the <italic>Journal of the American Medical Association</italic>, described patient participation in clinical research as 1 of the top 4 challenges facing the clinical research enterprise. Glass<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861512453040">3</xref>
            </sup> found that patient recruitment was viewed as one of the top factors in investigator dissatisfaction with clinical trial activities. Getz and Wenger<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512453040">4</xref>
            </sup> noted that the growing difficulty that investigative sites have recruiting and retaining study volunteers is associated with rising protocol complexity. Specifically, an increasing number of procedures performed and dramatic growth in the number of inclusion and exclusion criteria per protocol have contributed to increased study durations and higher dropout rates.</p>
         <p>In response, biopharmaceutical companies have devoted substantial resources to patient recruitment and retention initiatives. The strategies and practices implemented by research sponsors, contract research organizations, patient recruitment providers, and investigative sites encompass a wide range of activities, and yet, to date, there are few published data that document each activity’s effectiveness. Such data would greatly inform understanding and help improve practices in order to drive more successful patient recruitment and retention performance.</p>
         <p>Following a systematic review of recent scholarly literature, Lai et al<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512453040">5</xref>
            </sup> noted that there is a gap in evidence-based data on effective tactics to recruit underrepresented populations in cancer trials. Several others have reported that there is very limited quantitative information containing industry metrics on site activation and enrollment rates.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861512453040">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861512453040">7</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Given the lack of evidence available about the efficacy of patient recruitment and retention practices and the critical need for data in this area, Tufts CSDD conducted a study in 2011 to gather robust data on patient recruitment and retention activities supporting actual global clinical trials.</p>
         <p>It is our hope that the results of this study provide benchmark data that can be used by professionals for a variety of purposes from planning and forecasting patient recruitment and retention effectiveness to managing and implementing patient recruitment and retention strategies and tactics. Additionally, the study results can be used as a basis for further study and to promote dialog within the industry on the establishment and adoption of more rigorous methods of assessment in this area.</p>

         <title>Methods</title>
         <p>Participating companies—under the direction of the Tufts CSDD study team—formed a working group to collaborate on the design of the overall method and the data collection tool. This data collection tool consisted of two parts: The first asked respondents for descriptive information about the structure, role, and practices of their patient recruitment functions within their respective organizations. Participating companies provided information about the size of their patient recruitment and retention function; number of years the function has been operating; and reporting flow within their organization. Participating companies indicated whether the function played a centralized or decentralized role and delineated their function’s major responsibilities, typical timing for patient recruitment and retention plans, and total number of patients enrolled in 2010 to support their phase II to IV studies.</p>
         <p>Participating companies were also asked to provide the number of centrally managed recruitment and retention tactics used overall and by geographic region. A total of 28 recruitment tactics and 17 retention tactics were identified by the working group. Participating companies indicated which of these tactics were used by geographic region: North America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia/Pacific, Latin America, and “rest of world.”</p>
         <p>The second half of the data collection instrument focused on gathering actual clinical trial performance data from recently completed global studies. Data on unique clinical trials completed in 2008, 2009, and 2010 were collected. Completed studies were defined as those studies that had ended enrollment between 2008 and 2010. Each participating company gathered data from among its phase II to phase IV studies and provided 14 studies on average per company. The studies were selected from 5 major therapeutic areas: cardiovascular, central nervous system, metabolic/endocrine, oncology, and respiratory.</p>
         <p>Participating companies also provided detailed information about clinical trial scope and size including number of global regions in which each clinical trial was conducted, number of sites that were activated and the number of enrolled patients, clinical trial enrollment timelines (eg, from first patient in to last patient in), and monthly enrollment rates. Participating companies also provided descriptive protocol information including number of eligibility criteria, treatment procedures, and visit frequency.</p>
         <p>Participating companies were given approximately two months to collect their clinical trial data between August and September 2011. Each participating company was assigned a unique identifier to provide companies with anonymity. All data were reported in the aggregate. The data were tabulated using Excel analysis, and we included both partial and full data in our analysis.</p>
         <p>The <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0092861512453040">appendix</xref> lists the information gathered by the data collection instrument as well as all recruitment and retention tactics that may have been used to support centralized recruitment activities.</p>

            <title>Characteristics of Study Data Provided by Participating Companies</title>
            <p>Twelve companies provided data for 151 global clinical trials consisting of approximately 15,965 sites ready to enroll patients. An overwhelming majority of the studies (96%) provided by respondents were from phase II or phase III and 97% were prevalence studies from cardiovascular, central nervous system, metabolic/endocrine, oncology, and respiratory therapeutic areas. Patients were primarily adult or older populations, and trials were conducted in 11 countries on average (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092861512453040">Table 1</xref>). In all, 90% of sites were activated or were ready to enroll patients. Means were tabulated for the data set on the following: number of eligibility criteria, unique and total procedures, treatment phase length, and number of visits. In all, each participating company enrolled 24,458 patients on average for all of its phase II, III, and IV studies in 2010.</p>

            <p>Despite the numerous tactics available (refer to the list of tactics in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0092861512453040">appendix</xref>), participating companies report using a small number of patient recruitment and retention tactics. In addition, participating companies report that 32% of studies did not implement any tactics. Companies reported that for the vast majority of studies, they used traditional recruitment tactics. A very low incidence of nontraditional recruitment tactic use was reported, and this was largely to support studies conducted in North America. The top 3 centralized, global patient recruitment tactics used (as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0092861512453040">Table 3</xref>) are physician referrals (16%), newspaper advertisements (16%), and radio advertisements (13%).</p>

            <p>Overall, participating companies used a higher number of recruitment tactics in their North American studies than they did in other regions. A higher relative number of recruitment tactics were used to support central nervous system and cardiovascular studies. Oncology studies showed the lowest relative use of recruitment tactics.</p>
            <p>With respect to retention tactic usage, the top tactics reported are phone call reminders (18%), travel reimbursement (15%), and other types of reminder notices (13%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0092861512453040">Table 4</xref>). These tactics were used most frequently in studies that incorporated any retention strategies. Overall, 45% of studies did not use any retention tactics. A higher number of retention tactics were used to support studies conducted in Latin America, while the lowest number of retention tactics were used to support studies conducted in Western European studies.</p>

            <title>Activation Rate, Enrollment Timeline, and Enrollment Rate</title>
            <p>Nearly 9 out of every 10 investigative sites (89%) are activated on average per study. The activation rate is calculated as the ratio of sites enrolling at least one patient to the number of sites engaged or ready to enroll patients. Participating companies report that 11% of investigative sites on a given clinical trial, on average, do not enroll a single patient. Investigative sites in Latin America and North America had the lowest activation rates at 80% and 87%, respectively. Higher rates were reported in Western Europe (93%), Eastern Europe (92%), Asia/Pacific (91%), and the rest of the world (94%).</p>
            <p>Enrollment achievement rates were similarly high. This rate is calculated as the ratio of actual enrollment to the target or planned enrollment level. Overall, participating companies report that globally, investigative sites achieve 89% of their target enrollment level. Investigative sites in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and the rest of the world had the lowest enrollment achievement rates at 69%, 75%, and 57%, respectively. Higher enrollment achievement rates were reported in North America (98%), Asia/Pacific (107%), and Latin America (104%). The results also indicate that respiratory and metabolic/endocrine studies had the highest enrollment rates relative to plan.</p>
            <p>Participating companies report that a high percentage of their clinical trials must extend the study timeline to accommodate patient enrollment. Actual enrollment timelines exceed planned enrollment timelines 52% of the time. Timelines were calculated for each therapeutic area and for the overall sample of studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0092861512453040">Tables 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0092861512453040">6</xref>). Nearly half of the studies (48%) took significantly longer to meet their timelines.

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>The results of this study provide a complex picture of recruitment and retention practices and their impact. Companies are using a limited number of recruitment and retention tactics that are largely traditional in nature despite the variety and number of new solutions available. Traditional approaches including use of physician referrals, radio advertising, and television advertising are most prevalent, whereas social media are not being used on a global basis. Centralized recruitment support in North America is the only area where use of nontraditional tactics was observed. Follow-up interviews with participating companies indicate that they are just beginning to incorporate nontraditional methods into their recruitment tactics. This phenomenon is influenced in part by concerns regarding regulatory and safety risks. Other factors are lack of corporate and regulatory guidance and concerns about patient privacy and adverse event reporting. Recent draft guidance released by the FDA on social media is limited to guidelines regarding off-label information and declines to address use of social media for patient recruitment.<sup>

         <p>The recruitment and retention tactics used are contributing to a high percentage of investigative sites meeting their enrollment requirements. But these tactics are not assisting investigative sites in meeting their enrollment timelines. The majority—89%—of sites are activated and enroll at least one patient; 11% of investigative sites do not enroll a single patient. And 85% of investigative sites will eventually achieve the target enrollment level. This finding—that an overwhelming majority of sites are enrolling patients—runs contrary to the prevailing notions within the industry that only a few sites enroll the majority of patients.</p>
         <p>The greatest challenge appears to be time-related. Half of investigative sites (48%) fail to meet the enrollment timeline, forcing sponsors and contract research organizations to significantly extend the duration of enrollment timelines. Wide differences were observed in enrollment speed by therapeutic area. Specifically, investigative sites involved in central nervous system and metabolic/endocrine studies had the longest actual enrollment timelines relative to plan. Therapeutic area differences are likely due to a number of factors including relative protocol complexity; higher competition for patients and designs focused on more targeted patient populations (eg, prior treatment failures or newly diagnosed patients); and variance in recruitment implementation effectiveness. Regional differences in enrollment speed were also observed. We found that sites in Eastern and Western Europe, Asia/Pacific, and the rest of world had higher investigative site activation rates. This finding is partially consistent with enrollment rates being faster in emerging regions, although sites in Latin America reflect lower activation rates in our study. We did find, however, that sites in Latin America and Asia Pacific had the highest percentages of actual to target enrollment by region.</p>
         <p>A surprising finding was that use of various methods by companies could not be tied to success in recruiting and retaining patients. Many participating companies do not consistently measure recruitment and retention effectiveness, and they are not using systematically gathered quantitative evidence to guide their identification and selection of tactics to implement in support of their programs. Participants’ responses to open-ended questions about gauging success elicited few responses. Other than using internal metrics, participants reported using more qualitative indicators such as gathering feedback from sites and shared insights from “lessons learned” meetings. The results of this study suggest a major need to establish a standard approach and metrics to better track and evaluate patient recruitment and retention performance and effectiveness.</p>
         <p>Nearly one-third of studies were not linked to any specific recruitment strategies, and an even greater proportion of studies did not report the use of any retention tactics. We can speculate that specific tactics were not known by responding companies or they were not used at all for a subset of studies. It is also possible that site level tactics may have been used that were not part of a sponsor-initiated strategy.</p>
         <p>As studies were selected by each company that focused on 5 therapeutic areas, further exploration into additional therapeutic areas would be valuable. Although the researchers acknowledge the limitations here, the study provides valuable insight into company use of recruitment and retention practices and strategies across over 150 trials.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>The results of this study highlight the need for additional metrics in the patient recruitment area and shed light on some of the challenges in gathering these metrics. Further study, however, is needed to explore both the use of tactics in measuring success and to examine nontraditional methods that companies are beginning to use.</p>
