<p>This is a multifaceted book. It is based on what the authors call ‘New Managerialism as a Political Project: The Irish Case’ (Chapter 1), but the analysis and discussion extends beyond the normal framework of new managerialist critiques and has a relevance and interest far wider than the specifics of the Irish case. It builds upon Kathleen Lynch’s previous work on the <italic>carelessness</italic> of neoliberalism and on <italic>affective equality</italic>.</p>
<p>Part I of the book consists of an account of the project of new managerialism in Irish education. This operates at two levels, one is political and is made up of the confrontation between neoliberal governments and teachers’ unions, the other is personal and begins to explore the ways in which managerialism ‘gets under your skin’ (p. 22). That is, the ways in which practice becomes increasingly focused on the product rather than the person, and the ways in which what the authors call a ‘culture of carelessness’ (p. 22) is established. The second chapter articulates this project with ‘[t]he long legacy of hierarchical and male control’ (p. 33) in Irish education – managerialism is gendered. Further aspects of <italic>carelessness</italic> are identified.</p>
<p>Part II of the book draws on the Senior Appointments in Education Project, which was undertaken at the Equality Studies Centre in University College Dublin and funded by the Gender Equality Unit in the Irish Department for Education and Science. The project was based on intensive case studies of 23 senior education appointments made between 2001 and 2005 and a subsequent examination of the media coverage of the major themes emerging from the initial study. Despite the increased formality and regulation of educational appointments the researchers find that <italic>homosociability</italic>, local logics and authenticity were the key values in leadership selection. Few women were appointed (Chapter 5). They are ‘defined by their care roles in a profound manner that does not apply to men’ (p. 101) and at the same time the manager is defined as ‘a non-relational being’. The time demands and personal demands of new managerial positions ‘are assumed to be care-free’ (p. 102).</p>
<p>Part III of the book examines the experience of being a newly appointed senior managerialist, beginning with the ‘emotional work of managing identities’ (Chapter 6). The managers were expected to perform a particular form of visionary, dynamic, energetic, and holistic ‘super leadership’ (p. 111). The emotions arising from stress, depression, and being overwhelmed and constantly extended were sublimated. The managerialists were required to craft an ‘elastic self’ (Chapter 7). This crafting is again gendered in a variety of ways. Women managers had to both ‘do’ and ‘undo’ their femininity as dictated by circumstance, but still found themselves ‘other’ to the hegemonic masculinist, performative culture of their organizations – although as the authors note not all their male respondents found themselves comfortable with this hegemony. Women fared differently and related differently to their job depending on whether or not they had dependent children. In complex ways, the study shows, doing management and doing gender (caring) are juxtaposed in ways that create a <italic>care ceiling</italic> that works to exclude many women (and some men) (Chapter 8).</p>
<p>Part IV, Chapter 10, of the book goes in a slightly different direction. It picks up on references in the interviews to the role of the media in shaping public perceptions of and political pressures on education. This is perhaps the least original aspect of the book and deflects somewhat from the core concerns of the monograph. It finds media coverage to be a site of struggle over representations of education in contemporary Ireland. Complex and difficult educational issues are translated, often with the complicity of practitioners, into a form that oversimplifies and ‘blames’. Educators and politicians dance to the rhythms of media production schedules and the already overbearing focus of attention on outcomes and demonstrable improvements is reinforced. What this book portrays is the calculative inhumanity of new managerialism. In the name of public interest and public value the interests of managers themselves are ignored, the values of service and well-being are cast aside. Management does not care and is careless; emotions are residualized; gendered inequalities are compounded; policy commitments to equity and process are circumvented. The enormous value of the book is that it brings together and demonstrates the close and complex relationships between neoliberalism, managerialism, gender, carelessness and inequity. It is a salutary, sad and stirring read.</p>
