Tissue samples were embedded in paraffin according to standard histologic technique. For histologic evaluation of the inner and middle ears, 50 serial sections were produced representing the posterior, middle, and anterior aspects of each inner ear. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE), Grocott’s methenamine silver (GMS), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), and Alcian blue (pH 2.5).

A granulomatous inflammation consisting of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages affected the endolymphatic and perilymphatic spaces of the vestibular and auditory systems. The inflammation partially obliterated the perilymphatic space near the vestibular window. The saccular membrane was lined by hypertrophied epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985812451623">Fig. 3</xref>) and was segmentally fragmented. Throughout the inner ear and in association with the inflammation, numerous extracellular and intrahistiocytic yeasts, morphologically consistent with <italic>Cryptococcus sp</italic>., were found. The yeasts measured 10 to 15 μm in diameter. The yeast wall was 1 μm thick and PAS and GMS positive, and the capsule was 5 to 8 μm thick and Alcian blue positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985812451623">Fig. 3</xref>, inset).</p><p>A variable amount of cellular debris, fibrin, and proteinaceous material was in the vestibular and cochlear perilymphatic and endolymphatic spaces. Cochlear inflammation and granulation tissue extended from base to apex. The boundaries between the scalae tympani, vestibuli, and media were disrupted or indistinct. Portions of the scala tympani and scala vestibuli perilymphatic space were obliterated by granulation tissue. The scala media had total loss of the organ of Corti (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985812451623">Fig. 4</xref>). Reissner’s membrane was lined by hypertrophied epithelium and disrupted by the fibroplasia and inflammation of the scala vestibuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985812451623">Fig. 5</xref>). Semicircular canals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985812451623">Fig. 6</xref>) had subtle leukocytic infiltration, proteinaceous fluid, and yeasts in the perilymphatic space. Occasionally, the epithelial cells lining semicircular ducts appeared mildly reactive.</p><p>The middle ear and external ear canal were not affected. Occasional mild lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic infiltrates were in the cerebral leptomeninges. A single, 1 mm in diameter, focus of inflammation with 3 yeasts was detected in the thalamus. No fungi or inflammation was detected in other tissues, including the cerebellum, brainstem, spinal cord, nasal cavity, lungs, and other major organs.</p></sec><sec id="section4-0300985812451623"><title>Discussion</title><p>This cat had chronic bilateral otitis interna, with cochleitis, sacculitis, and utriculitis, accompanied by degeneration and loss of sensory receptors. The damage to sensory structures of the vestibular and auditory systems affected the cat’s balance and hearing, respectively. The composition of the inner ear fluids is tightly regulated and essential for normal function of otolith organs and cochlea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300985812451623">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300985812451623">9</xref></sup> Inflammation, even in the middle ear, can alter the inner ear’s fluid composition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300985812451623">5</xref></sup> Due to the limited regenerative capacity of vestibular and cochlear sensory cells in adult mammals,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300985812451623">3</xref></sup> severe injury, as seen in this cat, can lead to permanent impairment of balance and auditory function.</p><p>Clinical signs of bilateral peripheral vestibular disease include wide head excursions and loss of balance to either side in the absence of postural asymmetry or nystagmus. In contrast, unilateral peripheral vestibular disease typically causes postural asymmetry, circling, and nystagmus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300985812451623">1</xref></sup> In this case, the cat had loss of balance to both sides and skewed head posture. Although its auditory functional status was not reported, it was probably affected as well based on the degree of cochlear lesions.</p><p><italic>C</italic>.<italic> neoformans</italic> var. <italic>grubii</italic> is the most commonly isolated <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> species in domestic animals and people worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300985812451623">8</xref></sup> This pathogen is also a common cause of feline systemic mycosis and can manifest as focal or multifocal cutaneous nodules, upper respiratory infections, meningitis, or otitis media/interna.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985812451623">4</xref></sup> Cryptococcal infection typically occurs through inhalation followed by adhesion and invasion of respiratory epithelial cells. Thereafter, <italic>C</italic>.<italic> neoformans</italic> can infect other organs hematogenously or via leukocyte trafficking or direct extension.</p><p>The route of inner ear infection in this case was probably hematogenous. No histologic evidence of infection was detected in the external ear canals, middle ears, auditory tubes, or vestibulocochlear nerve roots. The perilymphatic duct that provides communication between the inner ear and meninges could not be visualized, but its location, the posterior cranial fossa, was also free of inflammation or yeasts. Thus, infection via this structure appears unlikely. The detection of yeast by PCR in multiple organs also indicates that yeasts may have undergone hematogenous spread at some point during the infection.</p><p>Detailed histologic examination of the inner ear is rarely reported in the veterinary literature, even in animals with gait and vestibular abnormalities due to cryptococcosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300985812451623">10</xref></sup> The auditory apparatus is morphologically complex,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300985812451623">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300985812451623">7</xref></sup> so examination of the inner ear is time-consuming and requires meticulous trimming for histologic processing and examination of serial sections. Nevertheless, detailed histologic examination of the vestibule and cochlea is diagnostically important in cases with known inner ear disease or suspected neurologic disease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Dr James Collins and the Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory staff, Ms Rhonda Aho and Mr Edgar d’Almeida for technical support, and Mr Min-Kuang Lee, BC Centre for Disease Control Public Health Microbiology and Reference Laboratory, for molecular diagnostic work.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn1-0300985812451623"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The author(s) declared no conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn2-0300985812451623"><label>Funding</label><p>The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-0300985812451623"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>de Lahunta</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Glass</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group>. <article-title>Vestibular system: special proprioception</article-title>.
