<p>This editorial needs to be neither long nor complex. <italic>Human Relations</italic> is in great shape, thanks in no small part to the leadership and sense of direction provided by Stephen Deery. His comments on the strength of the journal need no repetition. I do not plan to change the course of the journal in any fundamental way, but, to use the recently popular term, there is one nudge that I would like to give it, and a couple of ways of putting the nudge into effect.</p>
<p>The journal is distinctive in standing between the generalist management journals and the highly specialist ones. It used to signal this with the strap line of ‘towards the integration of the social sciences’. This was abandoned on the correct grounds that ‘integration’ of all the social sciences was an over-ambitious and perhaps impossible goal. But the importance of connecting research on life in and around organizations, which is our core empirical focus, to wider debates in the social sciences remains central. The nudge is therefore to encourage papers and special issues to draw out the relevant connections. Doing so does not need to be very elaborate but it is sometimes helpful to make the links explicit. I am particularly sensitive to this issue as I was trained in industrial relations, a field often criticized for its empiricism and lack of theory. In my view, it often has theory, but this is not always made explicit. The journal has the potential to connect directly to the social sciences, both in terms of testing theory and feeding back results so as to refine and elaborate that theory. It is open to all the social science disciplines, and scholars from disciplines that have not featured prominently are especially encouraged to submit papers and ideas for special issues.</p>
<p>In putting this nudge into effect, the editorial team will be considering some particular steps that will be announced in due course. But authors may now want to think about the social science links of their work. There is no requirement in every case to make an issue of this, and papers will continue to be reviewed as at present. But, where relevant, authors are encouraged to make the connections. They may also want to think a little more broadly as to how they interrogate their data so as to generate a different kind of paper.</p>
<p>The second way to implement the idea is in relation to special issues. We welcome proposals, usually from teams of two or more scholars, on themes central to the journal that deserve a special spotlight. Proposals that draw out the social science links are especially welcome.</p>
<p>The editorial team will also be reviewing some of the broader ways of improving the journal’s reach, building on such innovations as the recent and very popular podcasts. We look forward to working closely on this with our colleagues from SAGE.</p>
<p>Two members of the team have completed their terms of office: Stephen Deery as Editor-in-Chief and Kevin Daniels as Associate Editor. Both have made great contributions that are much valued. The success of the journal means that we need to increase the size of the editorial team by one. I am delighted that Neil Conway and Nick Turner joined with effect from 1 January 2012 and that Mathew Sheep joins the team in April. Following Stephen and his predecessors is a challenging task; we have a strong and committed team to make the journal even more successful.</p>
