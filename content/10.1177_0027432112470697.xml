<p>Previous generations applauded grant-funded programs that brought living composers into the lives of K–12 music students. The current economic climate, however, limits opportunities similar to those enjoyed in the past. We designed a virtual composer-in-residence experience that uses technology to overcome the barriers of funding limitations and geography. This article describes ways such a program can be implemented in an elementary or high school classroom. Included is information about technological considerations, criteria for finding a composer, and some ideas on planning, implementation, and evaluation.</p>

<p>Using technology, a school classroom can host “virtual visits” from a composer at a reasonable cost and with many benefits to all involved.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Over the last fifty years in the United States, several opportunities existed to bring living composers into the classrooms and lives of music students. In 1959, the Ford Foundation sponsored the Young Composers Project, designed to bring composers under the age of thirty-five into public school classrooms as composers-in-residence. Within three years, thirty-one composers had been placed, and the Ford Foundation awarded MENC (now the National Association for Music Education) a grant of more than $1 million to create and continue the project under the new umbrella of the Contemporary Music Project for Creativity in Music Education (CMP). By 1968, forty-six additional composers had participated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0027432112470697">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are numerous benefits for all participants by programming a composer-in-residence experience. The opportunity to work with a composer and witness the perspective and process of a professional musician can be meaningful for numerous reasons: Students might ask the composer questions not only about the creation of music itself, but about career and educational trajectories. They have the opportunity to interact with a musician without fear of consequences imposed by a grading system, freeing them to express themselves musically. Additionally, experiences working with living composers who help students to realize their creative music-making and improvisation may bridge the gap between prior informal musical knowledge and formal musical knowledge. When integrating creative activities, students are often able to draw on formal and informal musical concepts that encourage what music education scholar Marie McCarthy refers to as <italic>bi-musicality.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0027432112470697">2</xref></sup> In other words, the creative process often provides a vehicle for musical learning that is outside our daily instrumental rehearsals, fostering an educational connection between both school music and the music on students’ iPods. Composition presents opportunities for students to think and reflect differently about their musical experiences. To paraphrase arts educator and scholar Elliot W. Eisner, we can help students learn not only what music has been written, but also how to construct our own meanings and our own music.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0027432112470697">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Large, well-funded music programs continue to commission works for their ensembles, but the current economic climate limits opportunities for our students to gain the benefits we described from working with composers. Additionally, geography continues to serve as an obstacle for many teachers who would otherwise plan for composition experiences linking their students with the larger musical community. Many rural schools are located too far from densely populated places with communities of professional artists or large universities with composition faculty. Other schools face the obstacle of outside perceptions of their neighborhoods as unsafe, keeping otherwise willing musicians away from working with our wonderful students. We designed a creative approach to the composer-in-residence experience, using technology to overcome the barriers of some funding limitations and geography. At the time of this project, Adria Hoffman was employed as a middle school band teacher while Bruce Carter served as a music education faculty member at a university located a few hours’ drive from the school. We collaborated over the course of an entire school year. All sixth- through eighth-grade band students enrolled in Adria Hoffman’s classes participated in the composition project and had the opportunity to meet with Bruce Carter, the virtual composer-in-residence. The less experienced music students created melodic and rhythmic motifs, while the more experienced students composed mini-compositions. These smaller compositions were included in an original work commissioned for the spring concert. In this article, we share what we learned when incorporating a virtual composer-in-residence, including technological considerations, criteria for finding a composer, planning, implementation, and evaluation.</p>

<title>Technological Considerations</title>
<p>Music educators have many technological resources available to us now that did not exist in many schools just five years ago. Faster Internet speeds, increased access to the Internet, increased availability of computers in schools, and larger percentages of students who have computers at home make the use of online learning experiences more available to us. We no longer need to rely on music notation software programs. Although we can find student versions of some programs for as little as $10 per license, there are now web-based notation programs that allow individuals to create accounts for no cost. Students can write one or multiple parts, play them back, edit them, and post online for others to view.</p>
<p>In addition to these tools, free software programs provide the opportunity to create original motifs using a recording tool without any additional computer devices. Students can record their performances, play them back, and share them with others. Students can also use popular software programs to record multiple parts and then edit them to create layered harmonies, melodies, and unpitched rhythmic motifs. For those wanting clearer, more professional recordings, digital audio recorders can be purchased relatively inexpensively. Teachers can digitally record students’ improvisatory attempts, use the devices to covert the data to MP3 files, and play them on any MP3 player or computer by transferring them simply via a USB cable. These are just some of the tools available to us that make creative musical experiences easier than ever before. Many of our students are more technology savvy than we are, having grown up with these tools around them. They can often use them easily and share ownership of the learning experience by showing teachers how to better adapt to changing technological advances and musical media.</p>

<title>Choosing a Composer</title>
<p>When selecting a composer to engage with you and your students, it is important to consider a few simple criteria and conditions. First, contact your local college or university to inquire about faculty or graduate students who might be interested in working with your students on this project. While the emphasis of this project is to provide a virtual composer, it might be possible and meaningful to have the composer visit your school. If it is not possible for a composer to visit, you might provide him or her with information about your curriculum, the students who attend, their musical experience outside of the school, and other information that may help the composer know about the students. Second, interview the composer and ask for references that can speak to positive social interactions. It is important to establish an open and honest dialogue with the composer you choose.</p>
<p>When working with composers who have not had a lot of experience working with young people, you will have actively remind the person of the limits of young instrumentalists. For example, preprofessional or professional composers often forget that young musicians struggle to notate music in conventional ways. It is important to work with the composer to construct projects that meet the individual needs and abilities of your students. Musically and socially, you will need to be diligent and bridge any gaps in understanding that may occur between composer and student. For instance, students may suggest a fast tempo without possessing the skills to play certain passages as quickly as they would like to hear them. The composer might be able to arrange a student-created motif so the quickly moving sixteenth notes pass between sections or a syncopated rhythm is divided between sections, making it more accessible for student performance. On the other hand, sometimes students create pieces of music for multiple parts through improvisatory activities but not yet have the knowledge to notate all of it. Through the use of a digital audio recorder, the teacher and composer can help the students to realize their work in musical notation and allow the students to edit the notation for the final product.</p>

<sec id="section3-0027432112470697">
<title>Planning</title>
<p>Before we designed this project, we determined what tools were accessible to us and what funding might be available. First, take inventory of what technology is available. Some schools might have webcams; others do not. Ask your school and district administration what might be available that you did not previously know about. We recommend a digital audio recording device, a computer for the teacher’s use, computers for student use, a music notation program accessible to all students at all times, a webcam so students can meet with a composer in real time, and a projector so all students in a classroom can see the composer. If you happen to know a composer you believe would work well with your students, by all means, contact this individual. After taking inventory of available resources, we suggest a reexamination of your approach to classroom music-making.</p>
<p>As musical directors, we tell our students how to interpret preexisting music literature without asking students to call upon their creative acumen. Providing our students with a creative music-making experience, however, necessitates the transfer of ownership to the learners. If we direct students through detailed step-by-step instructions, they do not have the opportunity to communicate original ideas. Instead, they will simply follow someone else’s directions. There exist inherent challenges using notation programs with younger learners for the purpose of shaping a space for creative musical thought. In order to use a web-based notation program, we felt compelled to provide some parameters and guidelines because students’ knowledge of notation is limited (due to their formal musical experiences and ages). Therefore, we planned for both musical creation through notation software and improvisation on available instruments, such as the instruments played in the classroom setting, keyboards, auxiliary percussion, and voices. Using instruments allows for students to produce musical sounds without notation or technological constraints or the limitations of their own musical literacy at beginning stages.</p>

<p>As we thought through these concerns, we also considered how our students might conceive of this project. What would be the end goal? They needed to be able to answer the big question, So what? We outlined a plan in which the students would learn to use the Noteflight online technology, record improvisatory attempts, and share their work with us via the Internet. The first author, the classroom teacher, was to introduce aspects of the music technology in the classroom, serve as an in-person facilitator, and send the second author, the virtual composer-in-residence, digital recordings of the students’ work. The virtual composer-in-residence could then create one large musical work comprising the students’ mini-compositions for a spring performance. In addition, we planned for composition and improvisation clinics led by the composer prior to the composition of the final arrangement. As a virtual composer-in-residence, he could communicate to the students via e-mail and a web-based musical notation program. Additionally, students could meet the living composer either in person or through the use of free online meeting programs. Contact the technology supervisor at both your school and school division to inquire about ways you might meaningfully integrate the technology in this project.</p>

<sec id="section4-0027432112470697">
<title>Implementation</title>
<p>Thinking about composition requires both the idea of giving ownership of the musical learning experience to your students and the necessity of setting appropriate parameters. Depending on your classroom climate, your personal comfort, and the freedom you have as a teacher in your particular school, you might want to leave the ways in which students create their music open-ended. However, for many trained in traditional secondary performance curricula, this might be uncomfortable. We suggest that instead of setting clear musical goals, you might want to provide your students with prompts, or suggestions for the development of musical ideas.</p>
<p>In our project, once students could successfully copy an excerpt of their music into a web-based notation program, demonstrating their ability to use the technology, the music teacher prompted them to create two to four measures that “sound cool.” Other prompts included suggestions to create a melody with either a “beat” (rhythm) or harmony part, to create a duet for themselves and a friend, to make a piece of music one would dedicate to the presidential inauguration (for example), and to express an emotion communicated in a particular poem read in class.</p>
<p>As the students began experimenting with the web-based musical notation program, they concurrently began experimenting on their instruments. For instance, after a group of seventh-grade band students played a unison excerpt from their book, one student told the teacher that he did not like the way the piece ended. The teacher responded by asking the students to work together to create a different ending by changing only the final pitch or the final two to three pitches. Percussion students worked together first to mimic “beats” they heard the high school drum line perform, and then added their own variations. They then worked together to create their own pieces following prompts to “make that minor scale into something interesting and rhythmic” or to “create an introduction with just one or two of those instruments.”</p>
<p>As the music teacher introduced them to the web-based musical notation program and e-mailed digital recordings to composer, the students could edit and save their work online. The composer then listened to the recordings, reviewed the written music online, and chose excerpts of the music that would later become ostinato patterns or melodic motifs for a larger work. The students then had the opportunity to perform their own music (realized and arranged by the virtual composer-in-residence) during the spring concert. As we used digital recording throughout this project, we were able to record the concert as well. We used a digital audio recorder to convert the WAV files to MP3 files that we uploaded to a school computer with only a USB cable. We then posted them on a school website for everyone in the school community to hear.</p>

<sec id="section5-0027432112470697">
<title>Evaluation</title>
<p>As stated earlier, there lies an inherent dilemma in placing creativity in the confines of a formal classroom setting. Not only do students expect to follow directions, complete assignments, and find a clear correct or incorrect answer, but teachers are similarly held to objective measures of teaching and learning. Truly creative learning activities are often limited by these parameters. We remain skeptical of a correct answer in a creative musical dialogue. That said, we understand and respond to the demands of our administrators who demand objective evaluation measures.</p>
<p>Initial attempts to use web-based musical notation programs or musical software present opportunities for objective assessment measures. Students may demonstrate their knowledge of the program tools, fulfilling state and national music standards regarding technology use in classrooms. Without placing constraints on young musicians’ ideas, we asked them to evaluate their own musical creations through listening activities. Using the classroom computers and digital audio recorder, the music teacher played the initial attempts back to the students, asking them to describe what they heard in terms of tone, timbre, or clear entrances and releases. Using the online musical notation program, students routinely listened to the scores they were composing, asking both their music teacher and the composer for feedback. We asked students to describe their thoughts as they began the composition and improvisation process. The students were able to reflect on their ideas and ask their peers for assistance in the creative process.</p>
<p>Unlike performing what some students called “someone else’s music,” our students listened to the performance of their own work with increased awareness. When we provided them with a performance assessment rubric while listening to a recording of the final product, their performance on the spring concert, they eagerly reflected on their performance. They described, in detail, the ways in which musicianship might have been improved and how missed entrances, unbalanced sections, and articulations were performed less clearly than they would have preferred. These students wanted to engage with the music from beginning to end, conceptualizing the piece from the initial motifs through the final performance.</p>
<p>We believe that the benefits of this type of project are countless. Thanks to the technology available to teachers today, nearly everyone can provide to music students the experience of working alongside a living composer. The “Available Technological Resources for Virtual Residencies” sidebar provides a list of resources to make this concept a reality in your classroom, freeing yourself from financial and geographical constraints that would otherwise make the joy of having a composer-in-residence just a dream.</p>
