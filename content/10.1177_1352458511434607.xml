<title>Background:</title>
<p>High vitamin D levels may reduce the risk of relapses and disease progression in multiple sclerosis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1352458511434607">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>This 96-week randomised controlled trial was designed to assess the effect of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation on bone mineral density in persons with multiple sclerosis. Supplementation with 20,000 IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> weekly raised median serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25[OH]D) to 121 nmol/L. The modified intention to treat analysis included 35 persons in the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> group and 33 in the placebo group. Participants were age 21 to 50 years and fully ambulatory (median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 2.5). We studied the effect of supplementing vitamin D<sub>3</sub> on the exploratory outcomes annualised relapse rate (ARR), EDSS, multiple sclerosis functional composite (MSFC) components, grip strength, and fatigue.</p>

<title>Results:</title>
<p>After 96 weeks, there was no significant difference between groups in ARR (absolute difference 0.10, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.27; <italic>p</italic> = 0.25), EDSS (absolute difference -0.01, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.35; <italic>p</italic> = 0.97), MSFC components, grip strength, or fatigue.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Low vitamin D levels have been investigated as an environmental risk factor for multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511434607">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511434607">2</xref></sup> Furthermore, high vitamin D levels may prevent relapses and disease progression. Variations in relapse rate, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), markers of inflammation, and the number of brain lesions on magnetic resonance images have, with few exceptions, shown a pattern that could be related to the variation in UVR exposure and vitamin D status, thus suggesting a disease modifying effect of vitamin D in multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511434607">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511434607">3</xref></sup> Most convincingly, relapse rate decreased by up to 12% for every 10 nmol/L increase in serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25[OH]D) in a prospective observational study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511434607">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Apart from a possible effect on disease activity, there is reason to assume that vitamin D could improve multiple sclerosis symptoms such as reduced muscle strength and gait control,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511434607">5</xref></sup> cognitive dysfunction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511434607">6</xref></sup> and fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511434607">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>This 96-week randomised controlled trial was designed to assess the effect of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation on bone mineral density in persons with multiple sclerosis. Supplementation with 20,000 IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> a week raised median serum 25(OH)D from 50 to 121 nmol/L, but the intervention did not prevent bone loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511434607">8</xref></sup> Here we report the effect of high-dose vitamin D<sub>3</sub> on the exploratory outcomes annualised relapse rate (ARR), EDSS, multiple sclerosis functional composite (MSFC) components, grip strength, and fatigue.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section7-1352458511434607">
<title>Trial design</title>
<p>This was a single centre, balanced randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 96 week study following a pre-defined protocol for analysis of primary as well as exploratory endpoints. The study was conducted at the Department of Neurology, University Hospital of North Norway, the only neurology service in Troms and Finnmark, the northernmost counties of Norway. The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics. All participants provided written informed consent. The trial was registered in Clinical-Trials.gov (ID NCT00785473).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1352458511434607">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were 18–50 years of age with clinically definite multiple sclerosis according to the McDonald criteria and an EDSS score ≤4.5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511434607">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511434607">10</xref></sup> Exclusion criteria were: inability to walk 500 m or more; history of conditions or diseases affecting bone; pregnancy or lactating during the past 6 months; use of bone-active medications other than intravenous methylprednisolone for treatment of relapses; a history of nephrolithiasis during the previous 5 years; menopause defined by not having regular menstruation; unwillingness to use appropriate contraception. A pregnancy test (HCG in serum) was performed in all female participants at screening. The flow of participants through the study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511434607">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<sec id="section9-1352458511434607">
<title>Randomisation</title>
<p>A statistician at the Clinical Research Centre, who was not otherwise involved in the study, performed the randomisation by blocks of six, stratified by sex, with a concealed, computer-generated randomisation procedure. An identification number and a randomisation number were created for each participant. All study personnel and participants were blinded to treatment assignment for the duration of the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1352458511434607">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>Active treatment was 20,000 IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol) once a week, administered as a capsule of Dekristol™ (Mibe GmbH Arzneimittel, Brehna, Germany). Identical placebo capsules were provided by the manufacturer of Dekristol™ (SWISS CAPS AG, Kirchberg, Switzerland). Dekristol™ capsules were analysed by an independent laboratory. The average cholecalciferol content measured in 10 capsules was 18,120 IU per capsule, which is within the 10% limit accepted by EU authorities.</p>
<p>Participants were allowed to continue vitamin D supplements they used at baseline. All participants received 500 mg elemental calcium daily, administered as a chewable tablet of Weifa Kalsium™ (calcium carbonate, Weifa AS, Oslo, Norway). Participants who had gastrointestinal side effects attributed to Weifa Kalsium™ discontinued the calcium supplement if they had an estimated dietary calcium intake of at least 800 mg/day. If calcium intake was lower, they switched to Calcium Sandoz™ effervescent tablets (calcium lactate-gluconate and calcium carbonate, Sandoz A/S, Odense, Denmark) which were better tolerated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1352458511434607">
<title>Adherence and safety</title>
<p>The participants were offered a reminder to take the study medication by weekly mobile phone text messages. Adherence to study medication was evaluated by capsule counting (Adherence (%) = (number of capsules consumed/number of capsules that should have been consumed) x 100). The participants were considered adherent if they had taken at least 80% of the study medication. Participants were educated about clinical signs of hypercalcaemia, and ionised serum calcium was determined every 12 weeks. Adverse events were assessed every 12 weeks by phone, at study visits weeks 48 and 96 and in the case of hospital admissions. Serious adverse events and unexpected medical events were reported to the Norwegian Medicines Agency and to the Ethical Committee.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1352458511434607">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Study visits were conducted at the University Hospital of North Norway (Clinical Trial Unit and Department of Neurology).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1352458511434607">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>M.T.K., L.H.S. or S.I.M. performed a full physical examination and complete neurological status from which Kurtzke’s EDSS was determined at each study visit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511434607">9</xref></sup> The multiple sclerosis severity scale (MSSS) is derived from EDSS and the duration of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511434607">11</xref></sup> The MSFC was assessed by trained nurses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511434607">12</xref></sup> Strength of handgrip (kPa) was determined using a Martin vigorimeter (Elmed Inc., Addison, IL, USA). Fatigue was assessed by the Norwegian version of Krupp’s fatigue severity scale (FSS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511434607">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>A relapse was defined as a new neurological abnormality or reappearance of a previously observed neurological abnormality lasting at least 24 h and preceded by a fairly stable or improving neurological state for at least 30 days, in the absence of fever or known infections. The participants were instructed to contact the clinic immediately when experiencing new or recurring neurological symptoms. They were also questioned about occurrence of relapses at study visits and in 12-weekly telephone contacts. Only relapses leading to hospital admission could be reliably assessed. Therefore, ARR was derived from intravenous methylprednisolone (ivMP)-treated relapses during the study (April 2008 to January 2010) and, retrospectively, during the pre-study comparative period (April 2006 to January 2008). These relapses were treated with ivMP 1g for three consecutive days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1352458511434607">
<title>Blood tests</title>
<p>Every 12 weeks, routine blood tests including ionised calcium were performed. Serum was collected for measurement of 25(OH)D. All serum 25(OH)D measurements at baseline and at week 96 were performed at the end of winter, in January and February 2008 and 2010, respectively. Laboratory tests, except serum 25(OH)D, were performed at the Department of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital of North Norway. Batch analysis of serum 25(OH)D concentrations by mass spectroscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511434607">14</xref></sup> was performed at the Hormone Laboratory, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1352458511434607">
<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>We assessed the effect of the intervention on serum 25(OH)D, ARR, EDSS, MSFC components, grip strength and FSS over the 96 week study period. Analyses were carried out according to a pre-established analysis plan. The modified intention-to-treat population included all participants who had received at least one dose of the study medication and presented at one follow-up visit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1352458511434607">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Analysis was by modified intention to treat. In case of missing values, the last measurement was carried forward for endpoint analysis. Pearson correlation coefficients (<italic>r</italic>) were calculated for bivariate correlations. Comparisons between groups were made using the Chi-square test for proportions, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test for continuous data, and Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test for data that were not normally distributed. Potential confounders and interactions were considered in linear regression models containing the variables sex and age, and baseline data on BMI, EDSS, 25(OH)D, beta interferon use and duration of multiple sclerosis. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 17.0 for Windows. <italic>p</italic>-values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511434607">Figure 1</xref> shows the flow of participants through the study. Three participants withdrew from the study for personal reasons before the first follow-up examination. One participant in the placebo group discontinued the study medication at week 94 because of nephrolithiasis. Measurements from week 48 were carried forward for endpoint analysis in a woman who left the study because of pregnancy. By capsule count, all subjects were more than 80% adherent (mean 98%, range 80–100%). When entering the study, 38% of the participants used vitamin D supplements, at the study end this proportion was 25%. At week 96, 9/32 participants in the placebo group and 7/35 in the intervention group used a supplement containing 100 to 400 IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. Of those using a vitamin D supplement, eight subjects in the placebo group and three in the intervention group used 400 IU which is provided by a spoonful of cod liver oil. One participant in the placebo group used supplements containing a total of 1210 IU vitamin D and had serum 25(OH)D values of 101 nmol/L at baseline and 98 nmol/L at week 96. The study medication was tolerated without any clinical or biochemical side effects. One participant in each treatment arm experienced an unexpected medical event that was not related to the study medication. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics did not differ between groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511434607">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The proportion of relapse-free subjects did not differ between the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> arm and the placebo arm (respectively, 83 and 88%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.56). Ten patients, four in the placebo group and six in the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> group, experienced at least one ivMP-treated relapse. Five untreated relapses were reported by patients at telephone follow-up or clinic visits and one relapse went unnoticed by the patient, while new sensory deficits were found at clinical examination. 9 out of 14 ivMP-treated relapses, and 12 out of 20 relapses reported in total, occurred in 21 (31%) participants who had a disease duration of 5 years or less at baseline. Not a single relapse was recorded in 19 (28%) patients with a disease duration of 6 to 10 years. Median time to first relapse was 29 weeks in the placebo group and 39 weeks in the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.48). Change in ARR did not differ significantly between the groups. During the study, disease modifying treatment was initiated with beta interferon in one patient in the placebo group and in three patients in the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> group. Treatment was changed from beta interferon or glatiramer acetate to natalizumab in one patient in each group. The change in EDSS did not differ significantly between the two groups, nor did the proportion of patients with changes in EDSS (placebo/vitamin D<sub>3</sub>: unchanged 15/15, increased 7/7, decreased 11/13). There were no correlations between 25(OH)D at baseline and baseline EDSS (<italic>r</italic> = 0.15; <italic>p</italic> = 0.24), MSSS (<italic>r</italic> = 0.19; <italic>p</italic> = 0.12), or pre-study ARR (<italic>r</italic> = -0.03; <italic>p</italic> = 0.82).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we report exploratory outcomes from a 96-week randomised controlled trial which was originally designed to assess the effect of high-dose vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation on bone mineral density in persons with multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511434607">8</xref></sup> A weekly dose of 20,000 IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> increased serum vitamin D to a median level of 121 nmol/L, but did not appear to affect the course of the disease as assessed by measures of disease activity, functional tests, and the fatigue severity score. The study was not powered to properly address clinical outcomes, but none of the results were suggestive of an effect.</p>
<p>Relapse risk was not reduced in participants treated with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> compared with the placebo group. Several authors have reported an association of 25(OH)D levels with relapse risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511434607">2</xref></sup> Based on findings in a prospective cohort of 145 persons with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis who were largely on immunomodulatory therapy, increasing 25(OH)D levels by 50 nmol/L could be expected to more than halve the risk of relapse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511434607">4</xref></sup> In the present study, supplementing high-dose vitamin D<sub>3</sub> did not result in a reduction in relapse rate. However, the pre- and on-study ARR in our patients was considerably lower than relapse rates in typical populations recruited for clinical trials,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511434607">16</xref></sup> though similar to those reported in a natural history study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511434607">17</xref></sup> Findings in a 52-week safety study in 49 patients by Burton and co-workers were suggestive of a relapse-reducing effect of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation (on-study ARR vitamin D<sub>3</sub> mean 0.26 (95% CI -0.06 to 0.53) and placebo 0.45 (0.19 to 0.72), <italic>p</italic> = 0.09; on-study relapses vitamin D<sub>3</sub> 16% and placebo 37%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.09).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511434607">18</xref></sup> In that trial, escalating vitamin D<sub>3</sub> doses up to 40,000 IU/day were administered over 28 weeks, followed by downtitration. Mean 25(OH)D in the group treated with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> was above 130 nmol/L from study week 11 and throughout the trial, with a maximum of 413 nmol/L at study week 29. Comparisons across clinical trials are always difficult, but 25(OH)D levels were higher in the study by Burton and co-workers and the patients in the safety study had six times higher pre-study and on-study relapse-rates than the patients in our study.</p>
<p>EDSS was unchanged throughout the study in both groups. In contrast, Burton and co-workers found that a significantly higher proportion of participants completed the trial with increased EDSS in the placebo group (vitamin D<sub>3</sub> 8% and placebo 38%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.019).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511434607">18</xref></sup> Others found no effect on EDSS of six monthly intramuscular injections with 300,000 IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511434607">19</xref></sup> Most recently, Stein et al. published a 6 month RCT including 23 persons with clinically active relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis, aiming for 25(OH)D serum levels of 130 to 175 nmol/L by supplementation with vitamin D<sub>2</sub>. The participants in the intervention group received at least two capsules containing 6000 IU vitamin D<sub>2</sub> a day, but median 25(OH)D was only 120 (range 89 to 170) nmol/L at the end of the study. This study was negative on the primary MRI endpoints, while exit EDSS and the proportion of patients with relapses appeared to be higher with high-dose vitamin D<sub>2</sub> (exit EDSS vitamin D<sub>2</sub> median 3 (IQR 2-4) and placebo 2 (1-2), <italic>p</italic> = 0.051; on-study relapses vitamin D<sub>2</sub> 37% and placebo 0%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458511434607">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Test results of individual MSFC components did not differ between groups. The tests of extremity function reflect muscular power, coordination and sensory function. A possible action of vitamin D on muscular and central nervous system components involved in gait control has been proposed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511434607">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511434607">21</xref></sup> but was not found in this study. PASAT is a test for higher cognitive functioning that is sensitive for information processing speed and working memory. There is mounting evidence that vitamin D has important functions in the human brain, but data regarding vitamin D status and neurocognitve function are conflicting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511434607">6</xref></sup> We did not find an effect of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation on PASAT results, but data on this outcome were only available for 40 out of 68 participants.</p>
<p>In a longitudinal study, six-monthly MSFC testing over a two-year period in 200 persons with multiple sclerosis, showed considerable variation, but no general deterioration, in the performance of the individual MSFC components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458511434607">22</xref></sup> In this situation, an effect of treatment would require regaining lost functions.</p>
<p>Change in grip strength did also not differ between the two groups; neither were vitamin D levels associated with strength of handgrip in a study of older adults. The authors argued that muscular contraction speed rather than muscular strength might be related to vitamin D metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511434607">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally fatigue, a core symptom in multiple sclerosis, was also not influenced by vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation. The negative finding in this study is in accordance with a study reporting no association between serum 25(OH)D levels and scores on the physical subscale of the Multidimensional Fatigue Subscale, assessed with an interval of no more than 3 months in 59 persons with multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511434607">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Simpson and co-workers found a dose-dependent and linear association between serum 25(OH)D up to 100 nmol/L and risk of relapses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511434607">4</xref></sup> In our study population, supplementing vitamin D<sub>3</sub> did not affect relapses or other multiple sclerosis-related outcomes. Still, a biological response may be most likely when increasing 25(OH)D from insufficient to sufficient levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511434607">2</xref></sup> In our study, 33 participants had deficient or insufficient 25(OH)D levels (&lt; 50 nmol/L) at baseline,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511434607">8</xref></sup> but adjusting for baseline 25(OH)D values did not change the results. For ethical reasons, the patients in this study were allowed to continue use of supplements they used before entering the study. This contributes to comparatively high 25(OH)D levels in the placebo group. Moreover, we cannot exclude the possibility that the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> dose may have been too low. A study to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> as add-on therapy to subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis is currently including patients (<italic>n</italic> = 174 in both treatment arms). In the intervention group, administering vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in a dose of 14,000 IU (350 μg) daily is expected to result in supraphysiological serum 25(OH)D values of around 400 nmol/L.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511434607">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, it is not clear whether all potential benefits of vitamin D can be provided by oral supplementation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458511434607">25</xref></sup> If vitamin D derived from skin exposure to UV radiation was biologically more important than orally ingested vitamin D in multiple sclerosis, the effect of the intervention in this study might be attenuated. In our study, there was no correlation between 25(OH)D levels and EDSS at baseline. In a population-based case control study, increasing disability in the EDSS range from 0 to 9 was strongly associated with lower levels of 25(OH)D and with reduced sun exposure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511434607">26</xref></sup> and similar observations have been reported from a retrospective cohort study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511434607">27</xref></sup> Inclusion in our study was limited to patients with EDSS ≤ 4.5 which implies lack of observations in the higher EDSS range that could be of importance. Neither was MSSS at baseline, derived from EDSS and duration of disease, correlated with serum 25(OH)D. Such a correlation has been found in a population-based study in Tasmania<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511434607">26</xref></sup> and in white Americans,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458511434607">28</xref></sup> but not in African Americans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1352458511434607">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other explanations for the negative results in this trial, apart from the small sample size, are related to the possibility that beneficial effects of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> could be masked by subgroups of non-responders. The possible protective effect of vitamin D may be attenuated or not present at all in individuals carrying the HLA-DR15 multiple sclerosis risk allele.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458511434607">30</xref></sup> Moreover, sex-specific differences between the male and female immune systems and nervous systems could affect the response to vitamin D supplementation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511434607">31</xref></sup> Also, beta interferon-treated patients might or might not respond differently from untreated patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511434607">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511434607">19</xref></sup> Statistical testing revealed no interactions between treatment group and sex or use of beta interferon.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Supplementation with 20,000 IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> weekly increased serum vitamin D to a median level of 121 nmol/L, but did not prevent bone loss and revealed no trends suggesting beneficial effects on multiple sclerosis-related outcomes in this study. The possibility of a disease-modifying effect of vitamin D in multiple sclerosis should be explored further.</p>
