<p><bold>Dear Editor:</bold></p>
<p>I read the article by Wilkins and Bisson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512461608">5</xref></sup> with great interest and would like to congratulate them on their findings. However, it is necessary to outline the following methodological aspect, which is missing in their statistical analysis and which questions the validity of their findings in my view: One crucial issue that might jeopardize the validity of a systematic review and meta-analysis is the so-called file-drawer bias or publication bias, which is the bias attributable to unpublished or unidentified studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512461608">4</xref></sup> These studies often remain in a “desk drawer” because their results are not significant, causing an erroneously high proportion of studies with significant results among published studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512461608">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512461608">3</xref></sup> This file-drawer bias among included studies could have been assessed graphically using funnel plots and mathematically using the Egger weighted regression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512461608">1</xref></sup> I believe that the authors should be commended on putting together this meta-analysis. Nevertheless, a publication-bias analysis is missing in their evaluation and would have significantly improved the meaning of their findings.</p>

<p><bold>Authors’ Response:</bold></p>
<p>We thank the author for his interest in our meta-
analysis and for his insightful points regarding the importance of considering publication bias. We agree that there exists a possibility that one or more prospective randomized trials of nonoperative versus operative management of acute Achilles tendon ruptures was performed but not published due to a finding considered “insignificant” by the investigators. We consider that possibility, however, to be unlikely in this scenario. It is difficult to rationalize exactly what outcome of a randomized controlled trial on this topic would be considered insignificant and not worthy of publication to an investigator. If a trial were to yield a result that showed superiority of either operative or nonoperative management, one would very likely consider this outcome to be significant and to warrant publication. Regarding Achilles tendon ruptures, early level 3 and 4 evidence suggested superiority of operative management with regard to rerupture rates. The purpose of most level 1 studies has therefore been to demonstrate equivalence between the 2 treatment alternatives in terms of rerupture rates. This would encourage authors and editors to publish studies with negative findings on this topic, and it explains the fact that 6 of our 7 included studies actually demonstrated no significant difference in rerupture rates. Only after pooling data and performing careful meta-analysis of these seven studies did the superiority of operative management become evident.</p>
