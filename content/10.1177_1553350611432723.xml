<p><bold>Background</bold>. This study aims to evaluate the effect of laparoscopic skills courses on the knowledge of laparoscopic equipment. <bold>Methods</bold>. A knowledge test on laparoscopic equipment was developed, and participants of 3 separate basic laparoscopic skills courses in the Netherlands completed the test at the beginning and end of these courses. All lectures and demonstrations during the courses were recorded on video to assess the matching of its contents with the items in the test. As a reference, the test was also completed by a group of laparoscopic experts by e-mail. <bold>Results</bold>. In total, 36 participants (64.3%) completed both the pretest and posttest. Overall, the mean test score improved from 60.4% of the maximum possible score for the pretest to 68.4% for the posttest. There were no significant differences in test scores between the 3 separate courses. However, the actual content varied among the courses. The correspondence of the test items with the course content varied from 47% to 69%. Although 30% of the participants had already received training for laparoscopic equipment in their own hospital, 92.5% wanted to receive more training. 28 experts completed the test with a mean score of 75.7%, which was significantly better than the posttest score of the course participants. <bold>Conclusions</bold>. The laparoscopic skills courses evaluated in this study had a modest positive effect on the acquisition of knowledge about laparoscopic equipment. Variance exists among their contents.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Currently, there is increasing use of technical equipment during laparoscopic surgery, and unfortunately, this is accompanied by preventable errors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350611432723">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611432723">2</xref></sup> Verdaasdonk et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611432723">3</xref></sup> in 2007, were the first to quantify the number of adverse events with laparoscopic equipment and reported one or more of them during 26 of 30 laparoscopic procedures (87%). In 2008, Courdier et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611432723">4</xref></sup> published a similar study on a larger series of 116 endoscopic interventions, in which they found one or more problems with the equipment during 45 interventions (39%). Both groups of authors found that only a minor part of the malfunctions were caused by a defect and that human error contributed in most cases.</p>
<p>One of the contributing factors to adverse events is inadequate knowledge of equipment handling and also a lack of understanding of the technology. For instance, several studies have indicated that specialists’ and residents’ knowledge of electrosurgical equipment is insufficient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611432723">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611432723"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350611432723"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350611432723">8</xref></sup> It is essential that surgeons have sufficient knowledge of the equipment they work with because they are often consulted by nurses in case of a problem; moreover, the surgeon is legally responsible for the result of the operation and the potential complications.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, surgical residents are obligated to follow a basic laparoscopic skills course in the first year of their traineeship, before they are permitted to practice laparoscopic surgery as a primary surgeon. Most courses take 1 or 2 days outside the hospital and cost between 500 and 1000 euros a person. It is known that basic laparoscopic courses enhance motor skills<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350611432723">9</xref></sup>; however, there is no substantial evidence that this effect is also achieved for equipment handling in particular. Ideally, these courses should play an essential role in the improvement of knowledge and skills in order to practice laparoscopic surgery safely. A study by Condous et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350611432723">10</xref></sup> showed that there was improvement in knowledge of electrosurgery and the Harmonic scalpel during a hands-on course, but no other essential equipment was evaluated. Moreover, Schaafsma et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350611432723">11</xref></sup> showed that the more technically demanding (motor) skills, such as suturing, often distract attention from other important basic skills during courses, of which equipment handling can be one.</p>
<p>Insight into what the actual learning effect of laparoscopic skills courses is on equipment handling is important to improve future training courses. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of such courses on the acquisition of knowledge about technical surgical equipment.</p>

<title>Test Development</title>
<p>For this study, a theoretical test was designed to assess knowledge of technical laparoscopic equipment. The test was designed by the primary researcher with the support of 4 general surgeons and 1 gynecologist. These 5 specialists all perform advanced laparoscopic procedures regularly and are also experienced program and course directors. The questions in the test were made with the help of literature about equipment, user manuals, and educational literature and Web sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350611432723">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350611432723"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350611432723"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350611432723"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350611432723"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350611432723"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350611432723"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350611432723">19</xref></sup> The specialists approved the final version of the test.</p>
<p>The test considers the insufflator, light source, camera unit, endoscope, and electrosurgical equipment. It consists of 17 multiple choice questions, 12 statements that have to be answered with “true” or “false,” and 3 multiple answer questions in which multiple correct answers should be selected. The questions consider the operating principles of the equipment but also address physiological principles and consequences of insufflation and electrosurgery, possible complications from incorrect use of equipment, and trouble-shooting scenarios. All questions and statements of the test are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350611432723">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1553350611432723">2</xref>.</p>

<title>Participants and Scoring</title>
<p>The test was taken by all participants of 3 separate basic laparoscopic skills courses in the Netherlands at the start of the course (pretest) and at the end of the course (posttest). All 3 courses (A, B, and C) were basic laparoscopic skills courses for residents at the beginning of their specialist training and with no or minimal laparoscopic experience. Courses A and B were aimed at general surgical trainees and course C at gynecological residents. The scores for the tests were calculated as a percentage of the total possible score and corrected for chance of guessing. For each question, the participants could score 1 point with a correct answer. For questions with multiple choice answers, the chance of guessing the right answer is 1 divided by the amount of answer possibilities, so for example, it would be ¼ for a question with 4 choices. Therefore, to correct for this chance, the sum of guessing chances for all questions was deducted from the total score and divided by the maximum possible score minus the sum of guessing chances. The result is the percentage of correctly answered questions, corrected for chance of guessing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1553350611432723">
<title>Course Contents</title>
<p>The content of the courses was also evaluated. For this, all lectures and demonstrations given during the courses were recorded on video and scored at a later time for matching with the items in the test. The same was done for the self-study materials, which the participants received in advance of the courses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1553350611432723">
<title>Questionnaire</title>
<p>At the end of the posttest, all participants were asked to fill out a short supplementary questionnaire considering prior training with equipment and their opinion about knowledge of technical laparoscopic equipment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1553350611432723">
<title>Reference for Test Scores</title>
<p>As a reference for the scores of the course participants, experienced laparoscopic surgeons, working in hospitals throughout the Netherlands, were invited to take the same test. These experts had all performed more than 100 laparoscopic procedures. To assess their knowledge, the test was published as a questionnaire on a secured Web site and the experts were invited by an e-mail with a link to the Web site. During 1 month, 2 reminders were sent to get a good response. The scores for the tests were calculated in the same way as for the course participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1553350611432723">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using SPSS 16.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). For the course participants, the paired-samples <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare the differences between pretest and posttest scores, and the ANOVA test with Bonferroni correction was used to test differences in posttest scores between the 3 different courses. To compare the scores of the course participants with the scores of the experts, the independent-samples <italic>t</italic> test was used. A level of <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To the authors’ knowledge this is one of the first studies to focus in particular on the acquisition of knowledge of laparoscopic equipment during a skills course. The results of this study suggest a modest positive effect of basic laparoscopic skills courses on the acquisition of knowledge of technical laparoscopic equipment. Overall, the knowledge of participants in the 3 courses increased by 8%. This overall significant improvement actually appears to be a reflection of a significant improvement in electrosurgical knowledge. However, scores for the insufflators, and light and imaging parts were already fairly high in the pretest and were therefore harder to improve. The main question is related to the explanation of why only such a small improvement is achieved in overall knowledge of equipment. This could be caused either by insufficient discriminative capacity of the test to measure a difference, or there could be a deficit in the content of the courses.</p>
<p>To measure effectiveness of the courses purely for knowledge of technical laparoscopic equipment, a theoretical test was developed for this study. An official test that specifically focuses on the knowledge of laparoscopic equipment does not yet exist. The subject is addressed in part in the didactic modules and knowledge test of the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) program of SAGES but is not the main focus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350611432723">20</xref></sup> To ensure appropriateness of the content of the test, it was developed with the cooperation of 5 experienced laparoscopic surgeons. This was confirmed by the expert group scoring significantly better than the course participants, which is also proof of the discriminative capacity of the test because experts are expected to have more knowledge than young residents. Additionally, 75% of the respondents indicated the level of difficulty to be good, and more than 80% indicated that they believed that they should be able to answer all questions of the test correctly (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1553350611432723">Table 7</xref>).</p>
<p>The other explanation for the differences could be the course contents. Several deficits were shown in course content. The percentage of discussed test items was equal to, or less than, 50% in 2 of the 3 evaluated courses. It is plausible that these deficits affect course effectiveness. Therefore, optimization of the course contents will presumably result in a larger effect on knowledge of technical laparoscopic equipment.</p>
<p>Another issue is the role of the teacher. For courses A and B, an industrial representative was asked to give lectures about the equipment and also gave a full demonstration of the equipment at the start of the hands-on part of the courses. For course C, all lectures were given by medical faculty, and no demonstration of the equipment was given. Eventually, in courses A and B, more test items were discussed compared with course C (56% and 38% vs 13%). This could be the effect of a proper demonstration or the expertise of the faculty.</p>
<p>The acquisition of knowledge that takes place during basic laparoscopic skills courses is of essential importance. The participants are at the start of their specialist training and are allowed to start practicing laparoscopy as a primary surgeon after completion of the course. Knowledge and understanding of equipment is equally important for safe surgery as surgical motor skills and decision making, and therefore, these topics should be addressed. Furthermore, the organization of these courses usually involves much effort and financial support from multiple parties. For these reasons, it is important that the quality of these courses is evaluated objectively to enable optimization. Therefore, assessment of what is learnt by participants is the key to improvement of courses.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The laparoscopic skills courses evaluated in this study were shown to have a moderate positive effect on knowledge of technical laparoscopic equipment. Moreover, variance exists among their contents. Further evaluation and optimization of these courses is of importance, considering their crucial role in specialist training programs and the amounts of effort and money that is put into them.</p>
