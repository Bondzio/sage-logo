<p>The socio-political and cultural upheavals in the United States and the world since 2000 have pushed religion to the forefront of news headlines and public consciousness, but they have not ushered a paradigm shift in the sociology of religion. The classical Weberian secularization thesis postulating the differentiation of religion from other spheres and the concomitant decline of religious meaning and authority in individual lives and public culture still hovers in the background as the frame from within which many sociologists make sense of religion’s societal presence. The prospect that a new paradigm was emerging in the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094306112457651">Warner 1993</xref>) as a result of the increased prominence of the religious economy model (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306112457651">Finke and Stark 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094306112457651">2002</xref>) did not fully eventuate. Nonetheless, its assumptions of a competitive religious marketplace characterized by nimble, entrepreneurial religious suppliers who cater to particular religious demands and create particular religious niches continue to energize many scholars who use it to explain certain socio-historical instances of religious pluralism and participation, or alternatively to contest or modify its claims.</p>
<p>Religion today presents a Janus-faced reality. This is especially so in the United States where its institutional presence is persistently strong, religious ideas and discourse actively permeate culture and politics, and a large majority of individuals anchor their identity in a religious or spiritual tradition. At the same time, religious beliefs, practices, and affiliations are fluid and malleable, religious authority is contested even by those who are among the most committed to church, and for many, religion is worn like a light cloak that can be discarded at will. Given that overall there has been much steadiness in post-World War II trends in religious affiliation, the doubling by the late 1990s (from seven to fourteen percent) in the proportion of Americans expressing no religious preference was a startling discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094306112457651">Hout and Fischer 2002</xref>). This trend of disaffiliation has continued into the new century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094306112457651">The Pew Forum [2008]</xref> reports 16 percent as unaffiliated). It is not taken as evidence of secularization but as the outcome of the interplay between generational change and the tendency of political moderates to eschew claiming a religious affiliation given the politicization of religion by the Religious Right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094306112457651">Hout and Fischer 2002</xref>). The decline in religious affiliation in the United States, moreover, as has long been the case in far more secular Europe, has not displaced the personal meaningfulness of religious and spiritual beliefs. Enchantment continues; for many it is located in varied natural and metaphysical forces and for some it is blended with rather than confined or attached to mainstream institutionalized religious traditions.</p>
<p>The terrorist events of September 11, 2001, brought Islam to public prominence in the West and highlighted the complicated links among religion, geopolitics and terrorism. Since 9/11, there has been greater focus on the increased presence of minority religious populations in the West and the challenges encountered in publicly accommodating religious symbols and religio-cultural practices that are in tension somewhat with the secular principles institutionalized in Western states. These dilemmas and their resolution have been especially fraught in Western Europe (e.g., France has banned the wearing of the hijab in public places) but also raise questions about the acceptance of minority identities in pluralistic America. The increased awareness of Islam has not, however, changed the sociology of religion to any great extent. Some sociologists were writing about Islam and about religious violence prior to 9/11 and many, too, were actively studying religion’s globalizing flows and processes (especially the impact of Asian religions and Latino religious practices in the United States). This focus has continued but is folded in more generally with already existing research programs rather than with so-called Islamification.</p>
<p>One notable shift post-2000 is Jürgen Habermas’ new awareness of the cultural relevance of religion, a shift that revives interest in secularization processes, contexts, and limits. A preeminent social theorist, and a public intellectual who writes primarily from within the European context, Habermas is concerned about the derailing of the Enlightenment project of modernization, and the varied threats posed to deliberative democracy by the persistent economic and fiscal crises, depoliticization, and the threat posed to the dismantling of democracy in light of the rising power of supra-national institutions (e.g., EU, IMF). He is also particularly concerned by what he sees as the resurgence of religion, religious conflicts, and “the unsettling political role of religious communities” especially Islam and fundamentalist Christianity (2010: 19-20). Habermas’ changing views of how mainstream religion might be incorporated into the public sphere are found in various essays, but a good book in which to encounter his new stance is <italic>An Awareness of What is Missing</italic> (2010). While in the past, Habermas was quite insistent that religion lacked the rational capacity to be admissible into the public sphere, he now views mainstream religion as a public resource that can aid in the revitalization of democracy and ontological security. For him, a “blinkered enlightenment” (2010: 18) unaware of a way forward from its defeatism and the social pathologies of late modernity, may benefit from religious-derived norms, ethical intuitions, and ways of coping. Thus he has postulated the notion of a post-secular society wherein religion’s relevance is affirmed and incorporated into civil society, and its intuitions translated into a secular political discourse. Religion, however, is no panacea and it cannot be imported willy-nilly into the public sphere. Just as Habermas in the past showed a limited awareness of religion, his new position is also problematic because, indifferent to the empirical social realities of religion(s), he construes religion in very narrow, highly cognitivist, artificially demarcated, and undifferentiated terms. Notwithstanding these weaknesses, sociologists should to use their knowledge of religion to refine and incorporate Habermas’ ideas about religion’s relevance in the public sphere into the development of an empirically engaged political sociology of religion.</p>
<p>The subfield’s lack of a paradigm shift either before or after the turn of the twenty-first century should not be seen as evidence of theoretical inertia. Rather, most mainstream sociologists of religion are preoccupied with understanding relatively particularized puzzles and do so through a broad range of interesting qualitative and quantitative studies informed by middle-range theoretical analyses that have yielded an extensive body of empirical findings. The field is thriving, as evidenced by the substantial number of sociologists in the ASA religion section (approximately 672 members in 2011) making religion the 17th largest among ASA’s 51 sections. Additionally, sociologists of religion participate in other professional associations focused on the study of religion including the Association for the Sociology of Religion, and the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, each of which hosts a well-attended annual conference and publishes a well-regarded peer-review journal. There is also a good deal of cross-national dialogue and engagement among sociologists of religion in these fora and through the International Society for the Sociology of Religion. Hence, sociologists of religion are attuned to relevant global issues and processes even as the interpretive and explanatory tasks and practical demands of research necessarily skew their work toward particularized intra-national contexts. Given sociologists’ emphasis on the importance of understanding the context(s) in which social activity occurs, it makes sense that there is a tendency in research, especially on religion which is so context specific, toward privileging local over cross-national and global comparisons. Aggregate cross-national surveys can provide valuable findings. They tend, however, to limit their theoretical contribution by relegating important and substantively interesting national cases that deviate from a more general pattern to a jettisoned outlier status, rather than using them to reassess the theoretical questions at issue.</p>
<p>Sociology of religion is characterized by methodological diversity and theoretical openness. It has its own theoretical freight (secularization, religious economies) but also in recent years shows a greater willingness to actively engage with theorizing in other subfields and disciplines, and to push the boundaries as to what religion is and how it matters. These are strengths, rather than evidence that religion as an area of inquiry has an inherent paucity of theory and interesting questions in its own right. Looking back over the many impressive books published since 2000, it is hard to pick selectively and choose from an array of interesting, stimulating contributions. Two of the books I have chosen give full attention to the content of religious beliefs and the implications for weighty societal issues such as race and pluralism (Emerson and Smith, Wuthnow); another highlights how the content of religious doctrine can be strategically framed in order to forge political alliances amid geographical and theological diversity (Wilde); three spotlight various dimensions of the organizational structure of the religious institutional field (Emerson and Smith, Chaves, Wilde); one chronicles the meaningful religious, cultural, and political activities that occur in religious sites (Chaves); and another uncovers the meaningful religious activity that occurs in ostensibly non-religious sites (Bender). All are methodologically ambitious, empirically rigorous, theoretically rich, and well-written.</p>
<p>The centrality of religion in America’s historical narrative means that it inevitably intersects with other core characteristics of American culture and social structure. Race, or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306112457651">William Du Bois (1903</xref>: 54) infamously called “the problem of the color line” is one such force. Du Bois demarcated it as “the problem of the twentieth century,” and sociological research on race and the many facets of inequality suggests that this is also a, if not the, problem of the twenty-first century. Somewhat surprisingly, the racial dimensions of religious activity have been relatively under-studied by sociologists of religion, a gap that makes the insightful contribution of Michael Emerson and Christian Smith’s book, <italic>Divided by Faith: Evangelical Religion and the Problem of Race in America</italic> (2000), all the more important. They take as their starting point the fact that the United States is a racialized society: “a society wherein race matters profoundly for differences in life experiences, life opportunities and social relationships….[and] that allocates differential economic, political, social and even psychological rewards to groups along [socially constructed] racial lines” (2000: 7). Emerson and Smith present a broad historical overview from 1700 to 1964 highlighting how slavery and evangelical Christianity, the predominant theology among nineteenth-century American Protestants, actively contributed to creating racialized religion, an historical process that saw people shift from racially separate pews to racially separate churches, and to racially separate worship cultures and practices.</p>
<p>Today, the racialization of religion is seen both in the views of racial inequality expressed by ordinary white evangelical Protestants and importantly, beyond race per se, in the ways in which American religion is organized. <italic>Divided by Faith</italic>, therefore, not only historicizes the place of religion in America’s racial context, but integrates micro and macro levels of analysis in its examination of the continuing racialization of religion. In looking at the puzzle of race and religion today, Emerson and Smith draw from a mix of data, including a survey of 2,500 Americans using random sampling methods, personal interviews with nearly 200 non-randomly chosen, mostly white evangelicals in 23 states, and secondary analyses of GSS and other survey data (pp. 18-19, 98), though the data do not crowd the book and this enhances the text’s flow.</p>
<p>Evangelicals’ views—their tendency to explain racial inequality in individualistic or motivational rather than structural terms, and to not see racism as a pressing issue—are according to Emerson and Smith, not indicative of prejudice but of culture. The cultural-theological tool-kit that white evangelicals carry is one which emphasizes individual freewill and accountability for one’s choices, interpersonal relationality (including salvation only through a personal relationship with Christ), and antistructuralism, that is, the inability to perceive or unwillingness to accept social structural influences (pp. 76-77). This tool kit makes certain worldviews more culturally logical or “normal” than others. Thus, for many evangelicals, the race problem is not a race problem but a sin problem; as explained by one interviewee: “It’s human nature to be a sinner…to be not as accepting of a black person” (p. 78). And if evangelicals concede that institutions play a part in racial inequality it is not because laws and segregation impact blacks’ opportunities; rather, it’s because individual sinners work in institutions and in their sinfulness have and display bigoted attitudes (p. 79). Moreover, the glaring racial divide is accentuated rather than diminished among conservative Protestants. Compared to other blacks (and to white conservative Protestants), black conservative Protestants are less individualistic and more structural in the reasons they use to explain racial inequality, leading the authors to conclude that “<italic>conservative religion intensifies the different values and experiences of each racial group, thus sharpening and increasing the divide between black and white Americans</italic>” (p. 97).</p>
<p>The racialized gap in everyday experience that accounts for differences in individuals’ knowledge of racism is largely structured and reinforced by the racially homogeneous social world that white evangelicals occupy (p. 80). Religion, notwithstanding its prophetic strands and emancipatory possibilities, is socially and historically structured. Thus in the United States, the historical racialization of religion structures, reinforces, and creates ongoing racial divisions. And, independent of race, Emerson and Smith argue that the overarching structure of American religion, in particular the strong tendency toward market segmentation and niche marketing that occurs in its pluralistic religious marketplace and the fact that different groups seek different (historically institutionalized and newly reimagined) worship styles, heightens the salience of racial boundaries and maintenance of the status quo (pp. 161, 166-168). In sum, while the “problem of race” has many roots and many institutional and cultural manifestations, religion is a key site through which its encrusted tenacity can be fruitfully studied because, as Emerson and Smith insightfully demonstrate, the macro-organization of the religious field and individuals’ theological-cultural socialization and everyday experiences interpenetrate in multilayered ways that reinforce as well as create and expand racial boundaries.</p>
<p>Racial otherness is taking on an added dimension in the United States with the increasing racial and religious diversity of the population. As the Pew Forum has documented, immigration is adding more diversity to what has long been a diverse religious landscape such that today Buddhists, Muslims, and Hindus are more visible in several American cities and suburbs. This growing diversity, as Robert Wuthnow discusses in his important book, <italic>America and the Challenges of Religious Diversity</italic> (2005), poses significant cultural and practical challenges including the task of rethinking “our national identity” as a Christian nation and the need “to face difficult choices about how pluralistic we are willing to be” (2005: xv). Wuthnow provides a cogent historical account of the evolving understanding of religious freedom in American history, democracy and nation-building, and an interesting discussion of the American missionary movement as well as of the development of comparative religions as a scholarly field, as writers sought to “identify universals in human experience” (p. 25) even as ideas about American superiority, and the superiority of American Christianity, especially Protestantism, persisted (pp. 24-30).</p>
<p>Most of the book is devoted to probing what religious diversity means in America today and how pluralism is negotiated. Wuthnow uses multiple wells of primary data including a specially-designed national survey on religious diversity, in-depth interviews of Americans across the country, interviews with Christian pastors, interviews with leaders and members of Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist worship centers and organizations in purposefully selected metropolitan areas, and interviews with people in inter-religious marriages and with individuals involved in some aspect of interreligious leadership and work. Influenced by Weber, Wuthnow argues that the content of beliefs matters. How people think and what they believe about God, death, salvation, heaven, good and evil, and about their own and other religions impacts and complicates pluralism and specifically influences how individuals construe, evaluate, and interact with others. His findings demonstrate how complicated indeed is the crafting of a pluralistic society. Most notably, Wuthnow’s "exclusive Christians" though they acknowledge others’ freedom to worship, are nonetheless guided by a more compelling conviction that "Christianity is the only way to have a true personal relationship with God." And allegedly mind-broadening experiences such as college education and overseas travel do not seem to dilute such exclusivist beliefs. Based on the experiences recounted in his interviews with American Hindus, Buddhists, and Muslims, Wuthnow concludes that coexistence rather than engaged pluralism is the de facto American lived reality, and he argues that “the heart of the problem is ignorance on the part of the general population about even the rudimentary beliefs and practices of the newer minority religions” (p. 74). Although he suggests that this ignorance may be similar to Americans’ knowledge gap regarding geography, history and science, it may also reflect, he notes, “the view that Christian truth is sufficient unto itself” (p. 74). It is also apparent that this knowledge gap and by extension the understanding rather than mere tolerance of religious minority beliefs is unlikely to attenuate in the near-term. Wuthnow is particularly critical of the "insularity and largely ceremonialized contacts that characterize churches’ responses to religious diversity" (p. 256), and he argues that pastors and "congregations could do a lot better than they currently are in providing interfaith opportunities capable of attracting a significant share of their members" (p. 233).</p>
<p>It is not evident, however, that more routine interfaith opportunities would make much difference to the fostering of inter-religious understanding. Notwithstanding the empirically validated assumption that homogenized social worlds reinforce racial and other forms of prejudice and that everyday living amid diversity increases acceptance of diversity, some of Wuthnow’s findings regarding religious inter-marriage give pause. Just as many Christian pastors use “strategies of avoidance” that enable them to disregard the local presence of temples, mosques, synagogues and their respective participants, interreligious couples tend to avoid discussion of thorny theological differences. They negotiate creative practical accommodations: Christian spouses of Buddhists practicing meditation, Christian spouses of Muslims seeing Jesus as a prophet rather than a savior (p. 283), while largely remaining silent on the fundamental differences that lie beneath and inform their different particularized beliefs and practices. Despite the theological dilution that results (e.g., from seeing Jesus as prophet rather than savior), these adaptive solutions help stave off intra-couple and intra-family conflict and foster cultural diversity while reinforcing the privatization of faith.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the political and cultural forces driving privatization and disaffiliation, faith for most Americans is still expressed through public participation in shared communal worship. This presents a methodological dilemma because although survey research is widely used by sociologists of religion, it is virtually all based on individual-level data. Yet group processes are core to sociology, and congregations as the paradigmatic unit of religious activity are composed of collectivities and group cultures. In the United States, moreover, more people belong to a congregation than to any other social organization, thus making congregations a core site of individual and group identity and practices. There are many excellent published ethnographies of congregations and parishes, but until Mark Chaves embarked on his ground-breaking National Congregations Study (NCS), our knowledge of congregations was on the one hand, highly particularistic (specific case studies) and on the other hand, largely generalized, superficial, and partial (e.g., based on official denominational lists of existing congregations/parishes and their summary characteristics). In contrast, Chaves devised a representative survey of congregations in America, interviewed a key informant in each, and linked Census tract data to each congregation to provide additional geographical and socio-economic context to his study.</p>
<p><italic>Congregations in America</italic> (2004) provides extensively detailed information profiling congregational membership, leadership, finances, and worship, artistic and other cultural activities as well as patterns of congregational involvement in social services and political and civic activities. Writing at a time when politicians and others looked to faith-based organizations to fill the social service gaps in the wake of welfare reform, and despite the (still persistent) common presumption that churches are highly involved in social services, Chaves’ study shows that the vast majority of congregations engage in social services only marginally; theologically conservative congregations do fewer of almost all types of social services (2004: 53 and later), and congregations with particularly high incomes tend to do less social service overall. Chaves underscores that congregations’ social services, and especially those that go beyond emergency needs, are not an alternative to but complement and are dependent on collaborations with secular and government agencies (p. 78). In regard to political engagement, Chaves finds distinct patterns largely structured by religious tradition and race: conservative white Protestant congregations distribute (Christian right) voter guides; black Protestant congregations tend to register voters and open their homes to candidates; Catholic parishes tend to lobby elected officials and organize demonstrations and marches; and liberal Protestant congregations tend to organize discussion groups (p. 120).</p>
<p>Apart from comprehensive and policy-relevant findings, Chaves also fully engages with core theoretical debates in sub-fields beyond religion, especially sociology of culture, and sociology of organizations/organizational ecological processes. Take culture, for example. For many years, sociologists in ASA’s culture section frequently discussed the challenges of meaning and measurement and what exactly a cultural repertoire is and does. Engaging with this literature, Chaves used the NCS to ask about twenty-nine worship elements (e.g., silent prayer, dance, personal greeting, communion, speaking in tongues; p. 132). Singing and sermons emerge as the most prevalent, but beyond simply listing the various elements (which is in itself an important contribution) Chaves examines how different sub-sets of elements are variously grouped together by different congregations in constructing their respective worship events (p.134); and following Bourdieu’s lead, also presents a socio-demographic spatial matrix of variation in patterns of congregational worship practices (p. 138). While not all cultural repertoires can or should be quantified, Chaves’ study points to the rich mix of diverse cultural elements that are available to and used by individuals and collectivities in routine activities such as church participation.</p>
<p>People who do not know much about religion often assume that religious doctrines and institutions are immutable. Sociologists of religion know otherwise but they are less sure about how change occurs. Melissa Wilde’s book, <italic>Vatican II</italic> (2007) asks a fundamental but difficult question to answer sociologically, regarding how institutional change occurred at the Catholic Church’s Second Vatican Council (Vatican II, 1962-1965), a momentous event that saw Catholic Church leaders affirm among other changes, religious freedom, personal conscience, the separation of church and state, and the active participation of the laity in the life of the church. Rather than focusing as sociologists are wont to do on the effects of Vatican II, Wilde examines the event itself, and does a tremendous amount of historical digging to get at the on-the-ground deliberations informing the bishops’ decision-making processes. She uses a wide variety of primary and secondary materials including transcripts of interviews conducted in the 1960s with more than eighty of the most important bishops and theologians at the Council, Vatican-archived documents from the Council including minutes from meetings, letters, other personal correspondence, and petitions; and she managed to secure the records of votes of the approximately 3,000 bishops who voted on the most contentious reforms. The vote tallies identified individual bishops and their dioceses, thus enabling Wilde to investigate intra-church national patterns that had previously been undocumented because the Vatican had made only aggregate vote summaries available to the public.</p>
<p>Having access to this national level data was of particular import to Wilde because she was interested in testing, among other theoretical assumptions, the contrasting implications of competitive and monopolistic religious environments. As Wilde notes, the diversity of the religious marketplace is the key independent variable in the religious marketplace model because it determines the amount of competition religious leaders feel. Yet as she also notes, most research invoking the marketplace thesis neglects to study how competition (market share) actually affects religious leaders (and instead focuses on correlations between pluralism and religious participation; 2007: 42-43), a task she takes on. Her detailed analysis and contextualization of bishops’ voting records across a number of reforms, some that passed (e.g., religious freedom) and some that failed (e.g., elevation of the theological status of the Virgin Mary), brought forth interesting and nuanced patterns. Bishops from Catholic monopolistic environments in Europe (e.g., Spain, Italy) were predictably not open to change whereas those in pluralistic environments in Northern Europe (e.g., Germany) and North America, and those from the “missionary” countries of Africa (e.g., Kenya, Tanganyika) and Asia (e.g., India, Iraq, Korea), most of which supply-siders would identify as competitive environments, were open to change (p. 43). Latin American bishops, however, despite their monopoly status, were among the most progressive of all the bishops, a fact that contravenes the religious marketplace prediction (of lazy monopolies closed to change). Given this anomaly, as well as the evidence that progressive bishops from pluralistic environments were selectively more open to some progressive changes but not to others, Wilde looks to the varied cultural and socio-political contexts in which the bishops operated and the different organizational legitimacy concerns they confronted. She argues, for example, that church teaching prohibiting birth control was a moot issue at Vatican II largely because progressive bishops from North America and Northern Europe (despite pressure from their own laity) did not push for change because they did not feel any ecumenical pressure from their Protestant counterparts in their home countries to do so. Progressive Latin American bishops, on the other hand, did not advocate for change in its status because birth control was not readily available to anyone in their countries and, therefore, they saw no competitive advantage against Protestants in lobbying on the issue. Indian and other missionary country bishops were confronting legitimacy challenges over Catholic opposition to birth control due to concerns about excessive population growth in their countries. However, although they were at the forefront of efforts to change church teaching, comparatively fewer in number, they did not make a strong attempt to mobilize support for change among other progressive bishops (pp. 121-124).</p>
<p>Wilde concludes that Vatican II’s progressive outcomes cannot be explained by such traditional sociological factors as power, resources, interests, or even popular pressure (as the supply-side religious economy model would suggest) but by the ability of bishops to organize into clusters whose legitimation challenges resulted in their occupying differently structured religious organizational fields (p. 48)—some stable (e.g., United States, Germany), some in crisis (e.g., Latin America), some emerging (e.g., Africa, Asia)—and which coalesced to produce their shared stake in working toward progressive change in select doctrines while ignoring others. Wilde does not mention that her study also can be read as a real-time analysis of a trans-national institution, a domain of study that has garnered increased attention as a result of globalization. But this is another of the book’s strengths, showing how a large trans-national actor actually works, in unison, across national divides, and to effect outcomes that are implemented trans-nationally on the ground across many wide-ranging societal environments whose everyday lived realities are highly divergent, and yet with some global (universal Catholic) commonality.</p>
<p>Congregations and religious institutions are sites of wide-ranging sociologically interesting activity. A good deal of religious activity also occurs, however, in places and encounters where we might not typically expect it, given how disciplinary and institutional markers blinker our vision. Moving beyond circumscribed boundaries, sociologists of religion are giving increased attention to the manifold ways in which religious and spiritual meanings are entangled in everyday activities that on the surface suggest a different preoccupation. Courtney Bender’s book, <italic>Heaven’s Kitchen: Living Religion at God’s Love We Deliver</italic> (2003), exemplifies this new direction in theorizing and research. Driven by the hunch that religion happens “in the midst of other important things” (2003: 22), Bender spent over a year conducting intensive ethnographic research (including participant observation, interviews, informal conversations) at “God’s Love We Deliver” (GLWD), a nonprofit—and despite its name, a nonreligious—organization in New York City where staff (including paid chefs) and volunteers prepare daily meals and deliver them to approximately eight hundred homebound people with AIDS, some affluent, some poor. She spent three seven-hour days a week at the agency: cooking in the kitchen, delivering meals, organizing files, dispatching delivery volunteers, and generally helping out as needed (p. 143). Bender makes a strong case for the sociological value of ethnography as a means to get at how people construe and practice religion and the particularistic contexts in which they do so, and an equally strong case for studying religion in naturalistic settings beyond religious institutions and the home. Pushing conceptual boundaries as to how scholars think about religious and other differentiated institutional contexts, she makes the boldly refreshing claim that individuals might assign religious or spiritual meaning to certain secular activities that they find even more spiritually valuable than prayer or church attendance.</p>
<p>As Bender notes, doing a study of religion at a place where ostensibly not much religion happens, can be daunting. But she finds much to write about that has a lot to do with religion and its subtle relevance. The study’s backdrop is the pluralism of GLWD and its kitchen: a nonreligious setting in the heart of a cosmopolitan city where staff and volunteers do not share and assume that they do not share a common religious affiliation or vocabulary. Central to Bender’s inquiry is how people talk about things that they do not consciously share with others such as religion (p. 5), and she refutes empirically what she finds to be a largely misplaced concern, namely that particularistic religious language and references have declined or become diffused or diluted in pluralistic America (pp. 3-4; 136-137). Maintaining and bridging particularism amid pluralism is not easy. But Bender finds much dynamism and also a good deal of particularity in how religion and spirituality permeate the GLWD kitchen. For one volunteer peeling carrots is a meditative act, for another work is prayer, for another who has spent a lifetime caring for others and being cared for, there is something inevitably spiritual about cooking. Some volunteers intentionally import their biographical history of mainstream church involvement and associated church-related experiences into the kitchen, others bring a more eclectic mix drawing on varied religious and spiritual teachings, some discover spirituality welling up unexpectedly and unannounced amid the drudgery and laughter in the kitchen, and still others find that the kitchen and the people gathered around come to constitute “a little religious community” (p. 65). These instances, as Bender notes throughout the book, challenge and stretch the institutional boundaries of where the religious and the non-religious is conscribed and thought to happen, and also challenge the traditional scholarly distinction between religion and spirituality.</p>
<p>Of further theoretical import central to and beyond religion, Bender shows how the complexity of religious talk is made possible and evolves. She argues that commonplace religious talk (conversational references to religious holidays, church activities, passing comments about religious figures and beliefs) is sociologically important because it allows people to assess their footing about whether they can talk about faith and say particular things about religion (p. 91). An offhand reference to choir practice, for example, can become the thread that allows others to make inferences about that person’s actions and beliefs and then take steps toward further conversation (p. 22). Bender argues that it is precisely this sort of commonplace religious talk that makes difficult religious talk possible (p. 133). The everyday dialogue with another conveys certain fragments of information that can then be used subsequently to pursue other and more complicated conversational topics. Thus religious talk can “happen” without any direct reference to religious symbols but through indirect phrasing and allusions or patterned similarities (p. 109). Drawing on Mikhail Bakhtin’s notion of “double-voiced discourse” as a sort of hybrid language which draws from various vocabularies (pp. 108-109), Bender shows that double-voiced religious talk allows for communicating across difference. For example, how and why individuals express outrage can be framed by the sense of fairness and justice that comes from their religious identity and practice, or a volunteer’s talk about “good manners” may be an expression of their particular religious-based sense of “spiritual responsibility…and of the struggle to be gracious and giving toward others” especially in situations where it becomes difficult to do so (p. 111). Bender concedes that it can be difficult to access double-voiced religious talk through observation alone, and that such particularized religious-based understandings may emerge at times only through interviews. She argues, nonetheless, that “Talking with each other about religion, whether in double-voiced ways or in commonplace genres was itself a kind of religious practice” (p. 115), imbued with social meaning about what matters, what is respectable, what or who can be parodied, and so on (p. 116). By the same token, she argues that the absence of direct talk about religion or spirituality (or of politics) in religious, spiritual, (and political) settings should not be a concern (p. 128) because “absence of talk does not make an absence of practice.” While she acknowledges that practice is more than mere talk, talk itself, she argues, is part of the practice of meaningful activity. Religious practice, therefore, is not confined to specific worship acts but encompasses the myriad ways in which particularistic religious and spiritual talk is negotiated and achieved across varied social interactions and contexts.</p>
<p>The six books highlighted in this essay point to some of the many dimensions of religious activity as an individual, collective, institutional, and cultural phenomenon; the multilayered ways in which religion penetrates other institutional domains; and how it intersects with nonreligious social and cultural practices while also retaining distinctive elements peculiar to the fact that religion involves distinctly religious beliefs and practices that cannot be reduced to or seen as proxies for other social processes. There are many pathways of inquiry that a sociologist of religion can fruitfully take in order to discover something worthwhile about the stability and fluidity, the weight and the subtleness, of contemporary religion and in doing so also elucidate the encrusted and emergent character of more general societal and institutional processes. I invite all sociologists to take a look at the books noted here; the result of that effort should make readers think differently about religion, and perhaps prompt some to encompass it as a relevant dimension to their own analytical digging.</p>
