<p>This article seeks to analyze the mobilizations that are currently taking place in Spain as a result of the multidimensional crisis unleashed in 2008. The authors study the ‘15M movement,’ or that of the Spanish <italic>indignados</italic>, by focusing on three analytical axes: the cognitive, emotional, and relational processes feeding the construction of a social movement identity. First, the article refers to the diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational framing tasks performed by 15M participants to define the problematic situation and attribute blame, articulate a solution to the problem and devise strategies to achieve that end, and motivate participants to sustain their engagement and remedy the situation. Second, the article concentrates on the emotions that were ‘mobilized’ by social movement organizations linked to the 15M (e.g. outrage or indignation), and those emotions that emerged spontaneously during the ‘encounters’ that took place in the public space: joy, efficacy, and empowerment. Finally, the article addresses the relational aspects entailed in the process of identity construction, that is, the activation and de-activation of both ‘real’ and ‘imaginary’ ties between 15M members and previous and/or current political and social collectives within the ‘progressive field.’ In following this triple objective, the article describes the process of identity-synchronization that has allowed people with no previous political participation and with different and oftentimes opposing politico-ideological trajectories to feel part of the movement. The data come from 17 in-depth interviews and eight focus groups with key activists, ethnographic observations in camps and assemblies in both Bilbao and Madrid during the summer of 2011, and visual materials displayed in web pages and Facebook accounts associated to the 15M.</p>

<title>Résumé</title>
<p>Cet article a comme objectif d’analyser les mobilisations actuelles en Espagne comme conséquence de la crise multidimensionnelle qui commença en 2008. Le mouvement 15M, aussi connu comme mouvement des ‘Indignados’, est analysé. L’analyse abordent trois dimensions analytiques: les processus cognitifs, émotionnelles et de relation présents dans la constructions de l’identité d’un mouvement social. Dans un premier moment, nous aborderons le travail de diagnostique, pronostique et motivation fait par les activistes du 15M. Ce travail définit la situation problématique et attribue responsabilité, propose une solution au problème ainsi comme des stratégies pour atteindre l’objectif, et motivé les participants à tenir leurs compromis sont élaborées. Dans un deuxième moment, l’analyse sera portée tant sur les émotions ‘mobilisées’ pour les organisations sociales liées au 15M (par exemple, outrage ou indignation), que sur les émotions surgies spontanément des ‘rencontres’ dans l’espace public: joie, efficacité et ‘empowerment’. Finalement, les aspects relationnels présents dans les processus de construction de l’identité seront analysés. C’est-à-dire, l’activation et désactivation des liens ‘réels’ et ‘imaginaires’ entre les membres du 15M et des groupes politiques et sociaux précédents ou actuels du ‘champ progressiste’. Notre travail, à travers ce triple objectif, décrit le processus de synchronisation entre identités qui a permis que individus sans participation politique préalable et avec trajectoires politico-idéologiques différentes, et même opposées, se sentent membres du mouvement. Les données utilisées sont: 17 entretiens et huit réunions de group avec des activistes clés, des observations ethnographiques des campements et des assemblés à Bilbao et Madrid durant l’été 2011, et matériels graphiques des pages web et Facebook du 15M.</p>

<title>Resumen</title>
<p>Este artículo pretende analizar las movilizaciones que actualmente están teniendo lugar en España como consecuencia de la crisis multidimensional que se desató en 2008. Estudiamos el movimiento 15M, también conocido como de los ‘indignados’, centrándonos en tres ejes analíticos: los procesos cognitivos, emocionales y relacionales que están presentes en la construcción de la identidad de un movimiento social. En primer lugar, nos referiremos a las tareas de diagnóstico, pronóstico y motivación realizadas por los participantes en el 15M para definir la situación problemática y atribuir responsabilidad, articular una solución al problema y elaborar estrategias para alcanzar el objetivo propuesto, y motivar a los participantes a mantener su compromiso. En segundo lugar, nos concentraremos en las emociones ‘movilizadas’ por las organizaciones de movimientos sociales vinculadas al 15M (ej. ultraje o indignación), y las emociones que surgieron espontáneamente en los ‘encuentros’ que han tenido lugar en el espacio público: alegría, eficacia y empoderamiento. Por último, abordaremos los aspectos relacionales presentes en el proceso de construcción de la identidad, es decir, la activación y desactivación de lazos ‘reales’ e ‘imaginarios’ entre los miembros del 15M y colectivos políticos y sociales anteriores o actuales presentes en el ‘campo progresista’. Al perseguir este triple objetivo, nuestro trabajo describe el proceso de sincronización identitaria que ha permitido que personas sin participación política previa o con trayectorias político-ideológico diferentes y a menudo opuestas se consideren parte del movimiento. Los datos utilizados provienen de diecisiete entrevistas en profundidad y ocho reuniones de grupo con activistas clave, observaciones etnográficas en acampadas y asambleas en Bilbao y Madrid durante el verano de 2011, y materiales gráficos publicados en páginas web y cuentas de Facebook asociadas al 15M.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The global scenario of social mobilization is rapidly mutating. Periods of relative calm and stability are being abruptly altered by moments of social effervescence that seem to be marking a point of fracture with previous decades. The year 2011 was particularly fruitful in witnessing a series of so-called ‘mobilizations of the indignant’ that sprawled like a raging tide around the world. Reports of these unprecedented global protests have portrayed citizens who articulate new kinds of alienation in a now globalized world dominated by finance capital, who declare feeling scapegoated by various combinations of socioeconomic crises, and who reject the increasing disparities between the rich and poor, the declining mobility of most, and the exclusion and expulsion of many. These citizens repudiate, too, governments and politicians who are perceived as deceitful and corrupt, or negligent and inept, and who, in each and every case, are suspected of brazenly favoring the ‘top 1%’ while remaining astonishingly aloof from popular distress.</p>
<p>Given its multiple sources and diverse manifestations, the task of assessing and diagnosing this current cycle of protest is especially arduous (see Tejerina et al., in this issue). The realities of countries in Northern Africa or the Middle East show relevant nuances among themselves, and also profound differences with the state of affairs in western countries. However, as stated in the Introduction to this monograph issue, two broad mobilizational ‘threads’ can be analytically distinguished within the cycle. First, those mobilizations that have mainly demanded political reforms to initiate or deepen ongoing processes of democratization in the Arab world. Second, the massive displays of discontent regarding the erosion of the welfare state and the political mismanagement of the socioeconomic crisis in Southern Europe and also in the United States. Among the latter are the 15M mobilizations in Spain, the ‘<italic>Indignate-vous</italic>’ protests in France, Italy and Greece, Occupy Wall Street, and other mobilizations spearheaded by young people and students in the United Kingdom, Belgium, and Israel.</p>
<p>Among these mobilizations, however, the Spanish case is particularly significant. Since 15 May 2011, the ‘15M movement,’ as it came to be known for its inception date, or that of the Spanish <italic>indignados</italic>, as its participants were trivially labeled by the mass media, has served as a beacon for mobilizations in Europe, the Mediterranean area, and the United States. Transmitted through the most recent information and communication technologies both by passersby, individual participants and in a more systematic and strategic manner, by its World Extension Teams (WET), 15M mottoes, activities, and organizational traits were quickly broadcast to the world. The WET commission of Acampada Sol (the 15M camp in the Puerta del Sol Square, Madrid) was in fact set up during the first days of the movement with the explicit objective of disseminating and coordinating the <italic>indignados</italic> movement at the global level.</p>
<p>The inspirational character of the 15M alone would encourage social movement scholars to pay special attention to its study. If we however zoom in to analyze the movement’s characteristics and peculiarities, and if we zoom out to encompass the changes that have occurred in the Spanish political arena during the last few decades, and in particular since the inception of the crisis, we find elements that give an additional patina of scientific attractiveness to this movement. In this article we analyze the 15M by focusing on three analytical axes: the cognitive, emotional, and relational processes feeding the construction of a social movement identity. First, we concentrate on the diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational framing tasks performed by 15M participants to define the problematic situation and attribute blame, articulate a solution to the problem and devise strategies to achieve that end, and, finally, motivate participants to sustain their engagement and remediate the situation. Second, we concentrate on the emotions that were ‘mobilized’ by social movement organizations linked to the 15M (e.g. outrage or indignation), and those positive emotions that emerged spontaneously during the <italic>encounters</italic> that took place in the public space. Finally, we will address the relational aspects entailed in the process of identity construction, that is, the activation and de-activation of both real and imaginary ties between 15M members and previous and/or current political and social collectives within the ‘progressive field.’</p>
<p>In following this triple objective, this article describes the process of identity-synchronization that has allowed people with no previous political participation and with different and oftentimes opposing politico-ideological trajectories to feel part of the 15M. We argue that portraying the movement as a ‘<italic>superhero against injustices</italic>’, and as a social movement of ‘<italic>persons</italic>’ concerned with ‘<italic>common problems</italic>’ has strategically blurred potentially alienating axes of fracture and dissent amid a highly heterogeneous base. In addition, we contend that ‘<italic>sharing</italic>’ and ‘<italic>being together</italic>’, both online and offline, has been part of the solution to the problematic situation. Based on a territorialized way of doing politics from-the-bottom-up through the occupation of the public space, and a disembodied political praxis mediated by the possibilities and constraints offered by the Internet and online social networks, 15M participants have been able to universalize their personal experiences, understandings, and emotions related to the crisis and the actors responsible for it. They have also been able to acquire or regain a sense of joy, efficacy, and empowerment, not just of anger and indignation. This politics of the encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392113479743">Merrifield 2011</xref>) performed by 15M members has also allowed them to depart from ‘<italic>old-time politics</italic>’ by temporarily experiencing (not just imagining) the utopia of ‘<italic>doing real democracy now</italic>’, that is, engaging in ‘<italic>common matters</italic>’ in an inclusive, horizontal, non-violent, and participatory fashion.</p>
<p>Before delving into the analysis of the 15M we offer a description of the sociohistorical context, and the cycle of protest amid which the movement emerged. Data come from 17 in-depth interviews and eight focus groups with key activists, ethnographic observations in camps (<italic>acampadas</italic>) and assemblies in Bilbao and Madrid during the summer of 2011, and web pages and Facebook accounts associated to the 15M.</p>

<title>Context of emergence of the 15M movement: Multidimensional crisis and cycle of protest</title>
<p>By late 2007, Spain was blossoming: it had a public account surplus of more than 2% of its GDP, and the economy was growing by 3.5%. Just one year later, the surplus had become deficit, growth had fallen to less than 1%, and the Spanish economy was officially entering recession. Although the economic decline was related to a worldwide financial crisis, it also responded to identifiable domestic facts: the bursting of a decade-long real estate bubble, and the implosion of the associated lending market. Following the lead of other developed countries, the Spanish government rapidly created a €99 billion bail-out fund and began to rescue vulnerable banks. Moreover, in an attempt to weather the socioeconomic effects of the financial storm, the government adopted an economic stimulus plan including an €8 billion investment in infrastructure, the extension of jobless subsidies to the long-term unemployed, and a €2500 ‘Baby Check’ for each newborn child.</p>
<p>Despite these measures, the recession ravaged most Spaniards, with a particularly severe impact on the young. Unemployment rates soared to more than 40% for 20- to 24-year-olds – the highest for younger populations in the European Union, and about twice the already alarming Spanish average for all ages. Those with jobs, however, were not much better off; despite having one or more university degrees, many of them were caught in a system of temporary contracts, and poorly paid, low-status jobs unrelated to the occupations they had been trained for. As such, the Spanish young were forced to relinquish a key trait of adulthood, independence; in late 2011, almost 70% of the 18- to 29-year-olds still lived with their parents. This delayed independence was, in addition, putting further pressure on already tight family budgets and overburdened support networks.</p>
<p>After initially denying the Spanish economy was in trouble, in May 2010 President Rodríguez Zapatero announced a slew of adjustment policies. The pack included wage cuts for civil servants, the end of the ‘Baby Check,’ and the freezing of pension increases. As talks about Greece’s potential economic bailout began to intensify, attention turned on Spain amid worries over its public deficit (60% of its GDP). As a result, the government continued to pass austerity measures, combining them with a considerable rise in value added tax. In addition, a labor market reform was approved in September. Presented as a necessary means towards reducing joblessness, the reform actually made it easier and cheaper for employers to hire and fire workers. In late September 2010 trade unions called for the first general strike in a decade to protest against the measure; however, despite the bleak state of affairs the mobilization’s impact was almost negligible. In January 2011, the government passed a pension reform raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 and thus hindering the ‘replenishing’ of labor posts. This time, surprisingly or not, the unions were on board.</p>
<p>In March 2011 university students joined the tide of mobilizations and called for a general strike. Thousands of students marched throughout the country in protest against the unemployment rate, labor precariousness, the rise in tuition fees, the Bologna Plan, and budget cuts in education. A few days later, the platform Youth Without Future (Juventud Sin Futuro) organized a demonstration against the economic crisis and the bipartisan ‘PP–PSOE partitocracy’ (see Abbreviations section). The slogan was: ‘Homeless, jobless, pensionless, fearless’ (‘<italic>Sin casa, sin curro, sin pensión, sin miedo</italic>’). The long-standing repudiation of the government’s socioeconomic and educational policies was soon to be combined with a novel factor: the rage triggered by a measure that intended to suffocate the ‘free culture’ of the Internet. In early February 2011, the Internet-based initiative #donotvoteforthem (#<italic>nolesvotes</italic>) called to withdraw votes from the political parties that had approved the so-called Sinde Law (PP, PSOE, and CiU; see Abbreviations section) in the following municipal and regional elections. This ‘anti-piracy bill’ aimed at shutting down previously legal websites that enabled the free download of music and film and thus violated copyright laws. The bill was strongly opposed by the Internet collective known as Anonymous, and also by a myriad of bloggers, journalists, and tech professionals.</p>
<p>Spain’s domestic restlessness did not, however, ‘act’ alone; it was boosted by a chain of international factors. Among them were the Arab Spring mobilizations for political reforms and civil liberties, Iceland’s ‘silent revolution’ against neoliberal adjustment policies, and the mobilizations of the Portuguese ‘Desperate Generation’ (see Baumgarten, this issue). The disclosure of WikiLeaks documents showing Spanish government officials to be less than forthright, and Stéphane Hessel’s book <italic>Time for Outrage!</italic> (<italic>Indignez-vous!</italic>) also collaborated in inflaming Spanish passions. Seemingly, there was not a single or final straw breaking the camel’s back; this conjuncture of uncoordinated domestic and international events worked in a synergic fashion, prompting a collective outburst of indignation. In this combustible context, the call issued by the digital platform Real Democracy Now! (DRY, <italic>¡Democracia Real Ya!</italic>) to take to the streets was ‘just’ the spark that ignited the so-called ‘<italic>indignado</italic>’ mobilizations.</p>
<p>Using Twitter and Facebook, DRY incited ‘the unemployed, the poorly paid, the sub-contractors, the precarious, the young people …’ to take to the Spanish streets on 15 May, the week prior to regional and municipal elections. The protest was called under the slogan ‘We are not commodities in the hands of politicians and bankers.’ Despite being silenced by the corporate media channels, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in 50 Spanish cities; small supporting demonstrations were also organized in Dublin, Amsterdam, Istanbul, Bologna, Paris, London, and Lisbon. Coherently with the ‘They don’t represent us’ (‘<italic>No nos representan</italic>’) slogan, the demonstrations were characterized by the absence of partisan or trade union flags and placards.</p>
<p>Triggered by the political and police mismanagement of the May 15 mobilization, in the following evenings the calling for ‘Real Democracy Now’ quickly gave way to an ‘Occupy the Square’ (‘<italic>Toma la plaza</italic>’) movement. Despite the explicit restrictions made by the electoral bodies and the constant threat of evictions, the camps held the squares in several Spanish cities until mid-July; these occupations constituted the movement’s most evident act of civil disobedience. Campers rapidly equipped themselves with organizing commissions, thematic working groups, and assemblies. The commissions dealt with the day-to-day functioning of the camps; they concentrated on issues such as cleaning, infrastructure, first aid, nutrition, respect, action (performances and civil disobedience activities), extension (art and placard-painting), and communication. The working groups, instead, focused on themes such as the economy, sustainability, short-term and long-term politics, international liaisons, etc.</p>
<p>Finally, the camps held their own assemblies, and also general assemblies that gathered campers and non-camping participants. When the camps could no longer be held in mid-June, they gave rise and passed the torch to decentralized assemblies in small town and villages, and neighborhoods within large cities. This movement towards ‘the local’ was characterized by a steep decrease in the number of participants but, paradoxically, it was also accompanied by an internationalization of the protest. The 15M movement was almost instantly copied around the globe; the development and online diffusion of manuals, tutorials, and manifestos allowed for the viral and forthwith replication of its experiences. In addition, 15M activists began to coordinate efforts at the international level, particularly for the organization of Global Action Days. On 15 October 2011, 951 cities in 82 countries witnessed a global non-violent protest guided by the slogan ‘United for global change’ against capitalism and austerity measures. The second Global Day of Action was 12 May 2012, organized by the Occupy movements (see Tejerina et al., this issue) around the world.</p>
<p>Despite these massive popular mobilizations, Mariano Rajoy’s right-wing People’s Party (PP) won a landslide victory in both the May (municipal and regional) and November (general) 2011 elections. As voters punished the outgoing Socialist government for the worst economic crisis in generations and the European Union’s highest jobless rate, Rajoy declared that the public deficit for 2011 would come in at 8% of Spain’s GDP, and that the government would be forced to pass new austerity measures. On December 30 the President announced a cut in the following year’s public spending by €8.9 billion.</p>

<title>A ‘superhero against injustices’</title>
<p>Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011392113479743">Freidin and Perugorría, 2007</xref>) have pointed to the difficulties involved in forging collective identities amid social movements composed of ‘publics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392113479743">Mische, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392113479743">2008</xref>), that is, of interstitial activist forums where participants build relations and pursue joint actions through the equalization and synchronization of multiple identities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011392113479743">1</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0011392113479743">Figure 1</xref> shows a ‘conceptual map of Acampada Sol’ elaborated by the hacker and 15M member Marga Padilla. Conceived as what the author has called ‘an individual contribution to the movement based on her specific know-how,’ the map turned into an interactive and collective ‘product’ after it was posted in various web pages, and 15M members circulated it in different digital networks and even posted it in the Puerta del Sol camp. In a matter of weeks, the map received hundreds of comments expressing praise, making suggestions, and posing critiques that were incorporated by Marga in three ensuing versions. Although the map is intended to ‘depict’ Sol’s camp, we use it here to delve into the process of collective identity construction that is being performed within the 15M. As Padilla puts it, ‘This conceptual map … is only a help to depict what cannot be represented. It is a humble, unfinished map, precarious at its core. And needed all the same …’</p>

</fig>
<p>We understand collective identity as an interactive and shared definition produced by a number of individuals, concerning the orientations of their action, and the field of opportunities and constraints in which such action is to take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011392113479743">Melucci, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011392113479743">1996</xref>). That understanding usually involves a definition of the problematic situation and an attribution of blame (diagnostic framing), the articulation of a solution to the problem and devising strategies to achieve that end (prognostic framing), and a ‘call to arms’ or a fundamental rationale to engage in collective actions tending to remedy the situation (motivational framing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011392113479743">Benford and Snow, 2000</xref>). Collective identities should be understood as a process, that is, as something constructed and negotiated in a dialectical interaction with historical events and networks of groups and individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011392113479743">Melucci, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the 15M demonstration was the spark that ignited the camps and ensuing mobilizations. Although ‘<italic>DRY decoupled from the camp</italic>,’ according to Padilla’s conceptual map ‘<italic>there is continuity in the message</italic>.’ The placards designed by DRY for the 15 May march (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0011392113479743">Figure 2</xref>) help us understand what that message was about: political corruption, capitalist greed, vital (not only labor) precariousness, and special ‘<italic>treats</italic>’ awarded by the Spanish government to banks and the exceptionally wealthy while ‘<italic>common people</italic>’ suffer adjustment measures and the curtailment of their social rights. This diagnostic framing exemplifies what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011392113479743">Gamson (1995)</xref> denominates an <italic>injustice frame</italic>, that is, an interpretive scheme that characterizes the actions of an authority system as unjust and legitimates disobedience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011392113479743">Snow et al., 1997</xref>). As stated in the 15M manifesto <italic>How to Cook a Non-violent Revolution</italic>: ‘<italic>We don’t understand why we need to pay the bills of a crisis whose authors continue to enjoy record benefits. We are fed up with injustices</italic>.’ In words of a 15M member, ‘<italic>The 15M has turned into a collective superhero that goes wherever there is an injustice</italic>’ (interview with Zulo). This framing of injustice provided a common language in which activists from different movements, and persons with no previous political participation, could communicate and find common ground.</p>

</fig>
<p>However, the 15M did not ‘just’ emerge to denounce this injustice, or to accomplish a ‘cathartic’ mission aiming to soothe the anguish and distress deriving from the effects of the crisis. Social movements spring up to alleviate or alter situations that activists identify as problematic; their direct action therefore depends on the identification of the sources of the problem, and relies on <italic>boundary and adversarial framing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011392113479743">Benford and Snow, 2000</xref>). Marga Padilla’s conceptual map allows us to reconstruct the identity work through which 15M participants have crafted a ‘we,’ and a ‘them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011392113479743">Aminzade and McAdam, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011392113479743">Diani, 2003</xref>). The ‘them’ has included those antagonists identified as responsible for the situation of injustice: mainly <italic>thieving and swindling bankers</italic> and corrupt politicians. According to the map (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0011392113479743">Figure 1</xref>), 15M members are ‘<italic>united by their discomfort</italic>’ towards these actors; these are the <italic>enemies</italic> against whom their collective action has been directed:<disp-quote>
<p>We can vote, but we don’t have a voice, and we are frustrated by the politicians’ lack of will to develop mechanisms of direct participation in decision-making processes. Mechanisms that would put an end to corruption and to the lack of transparency in politics and public institutions, and that would place the citizen before the markets and other private interests.

<title>Indignant, but also joyful and empowered</title>
<p>The formation of a collective actor, however, does not only involve cognitive agreements and negotiations – such as those entailed in the framing tasks addressed in the previous section – but also demands affective or emotional investments. Passion and emotions, as much as ideology and interests, push people to mobilize and act together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011392113479743">Goodwin et al., 2001</xref>). Having diagnosed the problematic situation, and identified its sources and those responsible for the injustice, DRY encouraged <italic>persons</italic> to put an end to cynicism and apathy. It called Spaniards to feel, and to act; its slogans read ‘Occupy the street’ (‘<italic>Toma la calle</italic>’) and ‘Be outraged!’ (‘<italic>¡Indígnate!</italic>’). Borrowing from Stéphane Hessel’s viral manuscript, DRY strategically ‘mobilized’ the emotion of indignation to motivate and then broaden participation. In doing this, it turned this emotion into the stepping stone for the construction of the movement’s collective identity.</p>
<p>Several 15M members have concurred with Zygmunt Bauman’s controversial statement: ‘The 15M is an emotional movement’ (interview with Javier de la Cueva). However, in their view, emotions and cognition are not mutually exclusive, but mutually invigorating:<disp-quote>
<p>A friend of mine said during the first days of the camp: ‘<italic>There is no cynicism here. Everybody believes in what she/he is doing</italic>’. … Maybe that’s what Zygmunt Bauman meant when he said the 15M was, above all, emotion. … We are alive, and we are together! There is a change of atmosphere [<italic>clima</italic>], and that has a very strong emotional intensity. And you can sense that in the bodies, in the faces. … But I wouldn’t say that it is just an emotional movement and that there is no thinking involved. There is thought in emotions, and we are thinking a lot. (Interview with Amador Fernández-Savater)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>‘<italic>The 15M is an emotional movement</italic>,’ but outrage was not the sole emotion pushing the 15M forward. Once the uprising was in motion, and people were taking to the streets and occupying squares, indignation would be replaced, or at least complemented, by collective enthusiasm and joy. As a 15M member put it, ‘<italic>The feeling during the 15M demonstration was of happiness</italic>’ (interview with Leila Nachawati). Or, ‘[the 15M] is a cry coming from a society that is tired, fed up. It’s been a cry, but a smiling one’ (interview with Julio Albarrán). Once they were in action, 15M members also felt empowered:<disp-quote>
<p>[With the 15M] We have moved from powerlessness to power, from isolation and competition to being together, to discovering the other as an accomplice and no longer as an obstacle, from cynicism to ‘<italic>we can change things</italic>’ and we can be protagonists of that change. That generates a very strong emotion. (Interview with Amador Fernández-Savater)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the early stages of the 15M, reflex emotions such as outrage and anger, but also fear, anxiety, and uncertainty, were readily ‘<italic>available</italic>’ among Spaniards, and were ‘<italic>managed organizationally</italic>’ by DRY members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392113479743">Goodwin et al., 2004</xref>). When afraid or outraged about something, people may be more likely to join a movement that aims to do something about the perceived source of that indignation and fear, especially when these emotions are collectively shared, as was the case of the 15M. However, these reflective emotions were later spontaneously intertwined with affective emotions (e.g. joy, pride, efficacy, empowerment) connected to positive commitments to people, ideas, and places. By creating bonds that underlie the rational core of self-interest, these affective emotions can engender trust and solidarity, and thus form a solid basis for collective identity and more persistent engagement with the movement.</p>

<title>A social movement of <italic>persons</italic></title>
<p>But, who are the 15M members after all? Or, more specifically, how do 15M members perceive and ‘present’ themselves? As mentioned earlier, the boundary framing performed by 15M participants has identified both a ‘them’ against whom collective action has been directed, but also a ‘we’ bound by bonds of trust and affection. We argue that this ‘we’ has been synthesized in the term <italic>persons</italic>; ‘<italic>persons</italic>’ – not ‘people’ – are at the heart of the process of collective identity construction being conducted within the 15M.</p>
<p>Most 15M members do not portray themselves as activists or militants. In their viewpoint, these terms are associated to the ‘<italic>old way of doing politics</italic>’ (‘<italic>la vieja política</italic>’), based on ideological or partisan affiliations. 15M members reject these ‘<italic>acronyms and flags, because they divide</italic>’ (interview with Miguel Arana). In turn, they think of themselves as members of a community of <italic>persons</italic>; they thus encouraged the development of individual messages and personalized hand-made placards. The centrality of the term <italic>person</italic> can also be observed in the banners utilized during the 14 October 2011 world demonstration for global change (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0011392113479743">Figure 3</xref>), and appreciated in this interviewee’s portrayal of the 15M:<disp-quote>
<p>A movement whose protagonists were not militants, that doesn’t have a codified vocabulary of protest, that was very inclusive, that wasn’t just talking about the Left, that didn’t speak about revolution in a classical sense … that tries to have everybody, anybody, do politics. … Some militant friends used to tell me ‘<italic>they are talking about “persons,” and that is not a political concept</italic>.’ I, on the contrary, saw the power associated to talking about persons: we are all persons, and talking about persons and persons’ problems we can be together, and start talking.

<p>As with injustice frames, talking about <italic>persons</italic> allowed both people with no previous political participation and those with different militant trajectories to feel part of the same collective. This term ‘<italic>synchronized</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392113479743">Mische, 2005</xref>) different and probably opposing political ideologies; it also blurred other potentially alienating axes of dissent: gender, class, religious, and political cleavages along the lines of the Left-Right and Spanish unionism-peripheral nationalism divides (for an analysis of the effect of political cleavages on passive support and active engagement in the 15M, see Perugorría et al.,). The ‘We are the 99 percent’ slogan issued by Occupy Wall Street activists and immediately appropriated by the 15M, synthesized this principle of ‘<italic>inclusiveness</italic>’ in a brilliant fashion. So did the ‘United by common sense’ (‘<italic>Unidos por el sentido común</italic>’) slogan that could be seen in banners all across Spain:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>We are bringing up the fact that we are the 99 percent, that what unites us are problems and ways of thinking that are common to many people, in a very transversal way. … All these things can be common to many different people, people who do not have a clear identity. We need to start thinking over the basis of common problems, in lieu of identities. [15M’s] Inclusiveness has to do with this: it is a movement that is based on problems, and not on identities. We want to begin with concrete problems, not with ideologies. We will arrive at that, or not, eventually. Concrete problems having to do with real life, with everybody’s life; this way the movement will become real, will have to do with the lives we lead and not with lucubrations about the world that then do not bear any relation to practices, to life.</italic> (Interview with Amador Fernández-Savater)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Having ‘<italic>problems</italic>’ instead of ‘<italic>ideologies</italic>’ or ‘<italic>identities</italic>’ as a point of departure marked a path of <italic>inclusiveness</italic> for the 15M since its inception. But these ‘<italic>transversal</italic>’ problems were not limited to the ‘crisis train,’ and weren’t just collective; they also had individual manifestations, and both levels seem to be intertwined in the perspective of 15M members. According to Marga Padilla’s map (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0011392113479743">Figure 1</xref>), the ‘we’ is integrated by persons who feel ‘<italic>discomfort with their personal lives</italic>’ for ‘<italic>doing what they don’t want to do, abiding by rules they don’t want to follow, and working at jobs they dislike</italic>.’ As we show below, collective involvement has provided mitigation to this individual distress for 15M members.</p>
<p>At the collective level, in turn, the ‘we’ is associated to traditional social movements (e.g. labor organizations), new social movements (e.g. feminism, indigenous movements, squatter movements), and, using an interviewee’s terminology, ‘<italic>social movements that are not movements</italic>’ of diverse kinds (e.g. H for Housing, Anonymous, #donotvoteforthem, Youth Without Future). We can also observe ‘events’ (e.g. May ’68 and Argentina 2001) and even books or manifestos (e.g. <italic>Indignez-vous!, Reacciona</italic>). The ‘things that happened before’ section of Padilla’s conceptual map can be interpreted as a social movement genealogy composed of both international and domestic progenitors, of remote, more recent, and even contemporary ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011392113479743">Zerubavel, 2012</xref>). The real and ‘imaginary’ ties linking the 15M to these actors within what could be called the ‘progressive field’ refer to the relational dimension of identity construction processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011392113479743">Melucci, 1995</xref>). This genealogy can be thought of, too, as a ‘narrative of becoming’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011392113479743">Polletta, 1998</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0011392113479743">
<title>Politics of the encounter</title>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, collective involvement in the 15M has provided relief to people’s individual distress. According to Padilla’s conceptual map (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0011392113479743">Figure 1</xref>), Acampada Sol is ‘<italic>made of people who want to be and live together</italic>’ to combat their ‘<italic>discomfort with their personal lives</italic>.’ In the words of an interviewee, ‘With 15M we have recovered that part of “person who is willing to share,” a part we had long forgotten’ (interview with Carolina García). In a previous section we showed that ‘<italic>sharing</italic>’ or ‘<italic>being together</italic>’ gave 15M participants a sense of empowerment, efficacy, and joy. This encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392113479743">Merrifield, 2011</xref>) has motivated participants to get involved in the 15M, and to sustain their engagement even in times of declining activity. This encounter is also at the core of the prognostic framing performed by 15M members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011392113479743">Freidin and Perugorría, 2007</xref>); it is seen as a first step in the bumpy and sinuous road towards finding a solution to the multidimensional crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011392113479743">Benford and Snow, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, 15M members do not ‘just’ want to be together; the movement is not a ‘ludic rendezvous.’ They see themselves as ‘<italic>self-convened</italic>’ persons that ‘occupy the square’ ‘<italic>to do real democracy now</italic>.’ As Padilla’s map shows, democracy is associated to ‘using words, not violence,’ and to a ‘<italic>friendly atmosphere</italic>’ promoted by the act of ‘<italic>listening and respect</italic>.’ It is also tied to ‘<italic>engaging with common matters</italic>,’ with problems that affect society as a whole. Real democracy is achieved with ‘<italic>collective intelligence</italic>,’ described as ‘<italic>heterogeneous and inclusive</italic>,’ ‘<italic>intergenerational</italic>,’ and ‘<italic>unrepresentable</italic>’ – that is, avoiding ‘<italic>acronyms and flags because they divide</italic>.’ As mentioned before, one of the outcomes of this from-the-bottom-up democratic praxis is collective enthusiasm. So is the ‘<italic>growing support</italic>’ in other cities and countries, which in turn ‘gives strength to’ Acampada Sol and the movement at large.</p>
<p>As can be observed in Padilla’s map, real democracy is accomplished (or ‘done’) in two different ways: <italic>presentially</italic>, in camps, assemblies, thematic working groups, and commissions, and in a <italic>disembodied</italic> and <italic>deterritorialized</italic> fashion through the use of online media. The 15M manifesto ‘<italic>How to Cook a Non-violent Revolution</italic>’ (2011) explicitly alludes to this double embeddedness of collective action:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>We recovered and utilize the public space: we occupied the squares and the streets of our cities to meet and work in a collective, open and visible way. We inform and invite every citizen to participate. We debate problems, look for solutions and organize actions and mobilizations. Our digital networks and tools are open: all the information is available on the Internet, in the streets and in the squares</italic>. (15M manifesto ‘<italic>How to Cook a Non-violent Revolution</italic>’)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The 15M <italic>encounter</italic> thus combines online activism with more ‘traditional’ forms of militancy. On the one hand, it embraces the digital age sociability, where ‘everybody is getting together’ in social media and can ‘organize without organizations’ in order to ‘change the world without taking power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392113479743">Holloway, 2002</xref>). This form of activism is inspired by the idea that grassroots organizing no longer needs an organizer, a mediator; it follows the ‘do-it-yourself-with-others’ spirit. On the other hand, the 15M is based on traditional repertoires: camps, assemblies, and demonstrations are characterized by the physicality of bodies being present in a spatial meeting place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392113479743">Gladwell, 2010</xref>). 15M members create group commonality through face-to-face, ‘strong-tie’ offline activism, but also through online ‘weak-tie’ association. Their <italic>territorialized</italic> way of doing politics from-the-bottom-up through the occupation of the public space, and the <italic>disembodied</italic> political praxis mediated by the possibilities and constraints offered by the Internet and online social networks seem to be complementary, and not mutually exclusive. The two flanks strengthen one another; adding speed, a new dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392113479743">Merrifield, 2011</xref>). We contend that this mutual reinforcement is facilitated by the structural affinity of their methods: assemblies and online networks are both characterized by direct participation, horizontality, and open deliberation.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The 15M movement counts on different organizational precursors in the process of social mobilization (Youth Without Future), and in the articulation of forms of online (#donotvoteforthem) or hybrid (online–offline) protests (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Malestar.org">Malestar.org</ext-link>). As we have pointed out, the movement has its immediate origin in the profound discontent regarding the erosion of the welfare state, and the political mismanagement of the socioeconomic crisis. The plural composition of the <italic>indignados</italic> reflects the overwhelming rejection of the most negative consequences of the processes of globalization and neoliberal adjustment: the increased levels of social inequality, and the precariousness of the life conditions of broad swathes of society, especially, but not exclusively, the young. In addition, the 15M movement transfers to the public sphere a long-term discontent with the functioning of the Spanish democracy, and persistent demands for accountability in the administration of public affairs and the prosecution of political corruption. In the perception of 15M members, this situation and this authority system are defined as ‘unjust,’ and it is precisely this injustice frame that has legitimated its disobedience.</p>
<p>Several members agreed with the statement that the 15M is an emotional movement. The emotion of outrage or indignation constituted a central stepping-stone for the construction of a collective identity in the beginnings of the movement. However, once the uprising was in motion, indignation was overtaken by collective enthusiasm and joy derived from the experience of ‘<italic>being together</italic>’.</p>
<p>Although 15M members have tried to build on ‘<italic>common problems</italic>’ in lieu of available <italic>identities</italic>, they have nonetheless performed prognostic, diagnostic, and motivational framing tasks that have begun to craft and shape their own novel collective identity. Their boundary and adversarial framing has demarcated a ‘them’ against which collective action has been directed: mainly thieving and swindling bankers and corrupt politicians. It has also forged a ‘we,’ composed of ‘<italic>persons</italic>’ – not ‘people,’ not ‘militants’ – united by their discomfort towards these actors, but also towards the labels and methods coming from ‘old-time politics.’ Talking about ‘<italic>persons</italic>’ allowed both people with no previous political participation and with different militant trajectories to feel part of the 15M; it synchronized different and probably opposing political ideologies and blurred other potentially alienating axes of dissent.</p>
<p>15M members have also crafted a narrative of becoming; that ‘we’ has a present and a future, but also has a traceable past. This narrative draws on the relational dimension of identity construction processes, and is depicted as a social movement genealogy tying the 15M to both international and domestic ‘progenitors.’ The ties – real and imaginary – composing this ‘family tree’ link the movement to recent and also far-removed struggles, traditional and new social movements, and even ‘social movements that are not movements’ – to use an interviewee’s expression – that belong to what might be denominated the ‘progressive field.’ In addition, 15M members have provided their narrative of becoming with an individual dimension. 15M members are <italic>persons who used to feel a discomfort with their individual lives</italic>, and who now want to ‘<italic>be and live together</italic>’ in a friendly atmosphere. The ‘progressive’ genealogy crafted by 15M members could eventually come into conflict with the all-synchronizing portrayal of the 15M as a social movement of persons, and cause the disaffection of participants who do not sympathize with this ideology.</p>
<p>‘<italic>Being together</italic>’ has allowed 15M participants to universalize their personal experiences, understandings, and emotions, and has given them a sense of joy, empowerment, and efficacy. ‘<italic>Sharing</italic>’ is thus at the core of the prognostic framing performed by 15M members to solve the problematic situation, and at the heart of the motivation drawing them to get involved and sustain participation. This <italic>politics of the encounter</italic> has been facilitated and boosted by a mutually reinforcing offline, ‘strong-tie’ activism and online, ‘weak-tie’ association, both based on an open, horizontal, and participatory philosophy. In the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392113479743">Merrifield (2011)</xref>, squares and digital media have provided a scenario for an illicit rendezvous of human bonding and solidarity, a material, virtual, and emotional topography in which something disrupts and intervenes in the previous paralysis. Nonetheless, 15M members do not ‘just’ want to be together; they gather to ‘do,’ to do ‘<italic>real democracy</italic>,’ interpreted and enacted as an engagement in ‘<italic>common matters</italic>,’ an involvement thought of as inclusive, non-violent, and necessarily direct or unrepresentable. In their ‘political encounters’ 15M members begin to materialize, and experience in their everyday lives, what until then seemed an utopia confined to representative political institutions.</p>
<p>Our study of the Spanish 15M reveals the need to build a bridge across the internal boundaries of cultural or constructivist approaches to the study of contemporary social movements, particularly of those integrating the 2011–2012 protest cycle (see Tejerina et al., in this issue). Our findings show that cognitive, emotional, and relational aspects are unmistakably interwoven into a complex and fascinating fabric: the collective identity that is being crafted by the 15M movement. An in-depth and holistic understanding of this intricate process can only rest on the simultaneous analysis of this triad of underlying fibers.</p>
