<abstract>
<p>In this article, an attempt to identify further directions in research designs that researchers can use to contribute to the relevance of educational research findings, by including teachers’ practicality issues, is presented. Sixty experienced teachers in secondary education read the reporting of modified experimental research findings about an unfamiliar teaching method for promoting students’ conceptual understanding via historical information and filled in open-ended questions that included general opinion, professional judgment, and research interpretation to capture their practicality issues. The teachers’ answers were analyzed to deduce a hierarchy of themes. The results suggest that the teachers’ practicality issues, which included mainly (a) students’ long-term achievement results, (b) the utility of the teaching method, (c) student experiences, and (d) comparison with other teaching methods, can point to a research program that includes teachers’ practicality issues.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past few decades, the relevance of educational research findings has been discussed by emphasizing its nature and principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002831212468787">Berliner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002831212468787">Burkhardt &amp; Schoenfeld, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002831212468787">Feuer, Towne, &amp; Shavelson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002831212468787">Hammersley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0002831212468787">Raudenbush, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0002831212468787">Shulman, 1999</xref>), its scientific character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0002831212468787">Labaree, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0002831212468787">J. R. Levin &amp; O’Donnell, 1999</xref>), and its practical character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002831212468787">Allwright, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0002831212468787">Richardson, 1994</xref>). Particularly the contribution of educational research to the educational practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002831212468787">Burkhardt &amp; Schoenfeld, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002831212468787">Hammersley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002831212468787">B. Levin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0002831212468787">Slavin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0002831212468787">Whitehurst, 2002</xref>) makes the question of how to make research results more appropriate for the educational practice important for educational researchers. This study attempts to contribute to this discussion.</p>
<p>Although the recent discussions about educational research and its relation to educational practice seem to resolve around the distinction between “evidence” and “experience,” between “good and trustworthy research results,” and between “relevant and experienced-based judgments” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002831212468787">Alsop &amp; Tompsett, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002831212468787">Eraut, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002831212468787">Hargreaves, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0002831212468787">McNamara, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0002831212468787">Oancea, 2005</xref>), that was not the objective of this study. The objective of this study was to provide educational researchers with directions for research design that can help them to make their studies also more relevant for the educational practice.</p>
<p>For this purpose, teachers were included in having them state the practicality of research findings regarding a particular topic to them. However, some studies emphasized the problems teachers have with research findings, and these studies suggest that teachers’ main concern lies in translating research findings to improve their practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002831212468787">Grimmett &amp; MacKinnon, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002831212468787">Huberman, 1989</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831212468787">Hiebert, Gallimore, and Stigler (2002)</xref> pointed out that teachers rarely draw from research-based knowledge to improve their practice, despite helpful information (e.g., What Works Clearinghouse) or research information written specifically for teachers. They argued that the knowledge produced by research studies is often not immediately useful for teachers because it is the interaction among features that gives teaching its meaning and character. Therefore, teachers’ professional judgments were included in this study to capture what practicality of research findings means to them. Professional judgments support teachers in knowing how to deal with the problems their students can encounter and in knowing how to arrange for suitable instructional activities.</p>
<p>In this article, an attempt to identify and discuss directions in research design that researchers can use to contribute to the relevance of educational research findings by including teachers’ practicality issues is presented. Before describing the study, the literature on researchers’ search for improving the relevance of research findings is summarized to provide an overview of the different perspectives that exist to further clarify the focus of this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0002831212468787">
<title>The Relevance of Research Findings</title>
<p>The specific character of teaching and its consequences for the relevance of research has led to an increased understanding of what teaching involves. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002831212468787">Kennedy’s (1997)</xref> review about the relevance of research for teachers showed a division in three kinds of study areas: (a) classroom life, (b) teachers’ thoughts about their work, and (c) students’ adaptations to school life. Another example is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002831212468787">Clandinin and Connelly (1996)</xref>, who pointed out the differences between research findings and teachers’ professional knowledge in that the effectiveness of new teaching practices also depends on the context in which teachers work.</p>
<p>To improve the relevance of research findings by taking into account the specific character of teaching, several approaches have been advocated. First, teachers have been invited to collaborate and interact in research. The advantages of collaboration are that the expertise of researchers and the wisdom of practitioners can be combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002831212468787">Anderson &amp; Herr, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002831212468787">Bransford, Brown, &amp; Cocking, 2000</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831212468787">Huberman (1990)</xref> showed that intensive contacts between researchers and practitioners during research studies increased the applications of the main findings, although the effects of a single study decayed unless both parties stayed together for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>Then, collaboration can also provide for difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002831212468787">Clark et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002831212468787">Cobb, 2000</xref>), particularly in role confusion because of unarticulated expectations and a lack of negotiation and because of an equity dilemma in the reporting of results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002831212468787">Cole &amp; Knowles, 1993</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002831212468787">Bickel and Hattrup (1995)</xref> concluded that when mathematics teachers and researchers were working together to build a common learning community, they encountered (a) difficulties in attracting and maintaining researchers and teachers’ interest and involvement in collaboration over time because of differences in occupational tasks and interests, (b) a need for shared leadership via equity in status between research and practitioners communities, (c) a breaking out of traditional roles of researchers as knowledge generators and teachers as translators, (d) that not all teachers could participate, (e) that much time was needed to develop sound collaborations, (f) challenges that often existed between researchers as innovators and practitioners, and (g) differences in institutional cultures.</p>
<p>Second, focusing on the kinds of questions that teachers pose has resulted in a better understanding of the issues and concerns of teachers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002831212468787">Cochran-Smith &amp; Lytle, 1993</xref>), and this understanding can be helpful in improving the relevance of research findings. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002831212468787">Baumann, Allen, and Shockley (1994)</xref> studied teachers’ questions regarding reading and writing in elementary, secondary, and high school. The results revealed a range of questions that were narrowed down to the 10 most frequently cited concerns. Some of the research questions that followed from this list were (a) what is the role of discussion in middle school readers’ development of strategies for aesthetic reading, (b) how will students who are given an opportunity to participate in generating their own curriculum respond, and (c) does developing confidence as a writer encourage confidence as a teacher of writing? Also, investigating the kinds of research questions that experienced teachers ask when writing their research report to obtain a master’s of education degree showed that these teachers were primarily interested in improving student learning by focusing on knowledge acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0002831212468787">Van Velzen, 2012</xref>). However, such results might prove difficult to generalize.</p>
<p>Another way to improve the relevance of research findings is by reckoning with teachers’ questions and issues by conducting design research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002831212468787">Brown, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002831212468787">Collins, Joseph, &amp; Bielaczyc, 2004</xref>). In design research, specific attention is being paid to practicality. Practicality means the user-friendliness of research findings, that is, research findings that are useful for teachers in that teachers can translate them to their own practice. In design research, specific attention is being paid to practicality by solving teachers’ practical problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002831212468787">Cobb, Confrey, diSessa, Lehrer, &amp; Schauble, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002831212468787">Nieveen, McKenney, &amp; Van den Akker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0002831212468787">Plomp, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Also, the teacher-research movement has led to useful concrete knowledge for the teachers involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002831212468787">Allwright, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0002831212468787">Richardson, 1994</xref>), and this knowledge can be helpful in understanding how the relevance of research findings might be improved. However, this knowledge still lacks standards that make evaluating the research in and for their community possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002831212468787">Cochran-Smith, 1999</xref>). For example, regarding a knowledge base for teaching, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831212468787">Hiebert et al. (2002)</xref> stated that practitioners’ knowledge is detailed, concrete, and specific, though integrated in practice. To improve this knowledge, teachers should make their professional knowledge public (i.e., store and share it) and develop standards for verification and improvement. Moreover, teachers differ, which might complicate the developments of standards. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0002831212468787">Schecter and Parkhurst (1993)</xref>, describing the differences in ideology of three teacher-researchers, showed that these teachers’ research was primarily based on teaching beliefs and beliefs regarding university-based knowledge and insights (i.e., adversarial vs. desirable).</p>
<p>To summarize, different avenues are being explored to include teachers and their views regarding the educational practice to improve the relevance of research findings. However, we still know little about how to improve our research studies in terms of contributing to the educational practice by reckoning with teachers’ main concerns and views, that is, <italic>how</italic> we can include important practicality issues of teachers into our research studies.</p>

<sec id="section3-0002831212468787">
<title>Conceptual Framework and Research Questions</title>
<p>To obtain information from teachers regarding their practicality issues, three issues needed to be resolved: (a) a description of the main components of professional judgment, (b) a clear-cut theme for eliciting teachers’ remarks, and (c) a common research study.</p>
<p>First, a description of the main components of professional judgments was required to enable teachers to provide their own responses and interpretations regarding essential characteristics of teaching. The research literature shows that what teachers know and do comes forth from how they interpret information and experiences and how they translate these interpretations into their daily teaching practices (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002831212468787">Borman, Mueninghoff, Cotner, &amp; Frederick, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002831212468787">Bromme, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002831212468787">Darling-Hammond, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002831212468787">Duck, 2007</xref>). Experienced teachers rely on their professional judgments to decide on their professional activities, such as teaching behavior, instructional activities, and so on. Teachers’ professional judgments are defined as teachers’ interpretations and decisions that are based on their professional knowledge and experiences (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002831212468787">Cochran-Smith, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0002831212468787">Shulman (1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0002831212468787">1987</xref>) argued that teachers’ professional knowledge includes subject-matter content knowledge, curricular knowledge, and pedagogical content knowledge. Of these three, pedagogical content knowledge deals with the central aspect of classroom life. That is, pedagogical content knowledge consists of the integration of content knowledge with pedagogical knowledge (i.e., knowing what teaching activities represent the content knowledge best and take into account the possibilities and difficulties students might face when studying the content knowledge).</p>
<p>In this study, pedagogical content knowledge was included because it was reasoned that the integration between the teaching of content and the learning of students provides for essential information about practicality issues and therefore are required for teachers to form their professional judgments. Furthermore, pedagogical content knowledge is a well-studied concept. That is, in Europe this concept is often referred to as <italic>didactics</italic>, which, however, includes other definitions as well (for an overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002831212468787">Hudson &amp; Meyer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002831212468787">Hudson &amp; Schneuwly, 2007</xref>). Therefore the concept of didactics appeared less suitable to subtract components from that encompass teaching aspects that teachers recognize.</p>
<p>The components that comprise teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge are studied particularly in the domains of mathematics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002831212468787">Ball, Lubienski, &amp; Mewborn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002831212468787">Hill, Ball, &amp; Schilling, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002831212468787">Koehler &amp; Grouws, 1992</xref>) and science (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002831212468787">Gess-Newsome &amp; Lederman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002831212468787">Lederman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002831212468787">Loughran, Mulhall, &amp; Berry, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0002831212468787">Magnusson, Krajcik, &amp; Borko, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0002831212468787">Park &amp; Oliver, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0002831212468787">Van Dijk &amp; Kattmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0002831212468787">Van Driel, Verloop, &amp; De Vos, 1998</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002831212468787">Bromme (1994)</xref> decomposed mathematical content knowledge further into content knowledge about mathematics as a discipline, school mathematical knowledge, and philosophy of school mathematics. Moreover, mathematical pedagogical knowledge is further divided into subject-matter–specific pedagogical knowledge and general pedagogical knowledge (e.g., problem solving and pedagogical questions). These areas of knowledge are all, in combination with teachers’ practical experiences, related to teaching behavior. Bromme argued that professional knowledge is acquired in teacher education and then experiences help the teacher to develop experienced-based professional knowledge. As another example, in the science domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002831212468787">Carlsen (2001)</xref> specified pedagogical content knowledge into the specific teaching context (i.e., this classroom and these students) and in the general educational context (i.e., state and nation, the community, the school, and former students).</p>
<p>To summarize, the research literature showed that teachers’ professional knowledge includes different components. However, certain components appeared predominantly in the research literature, such as discipline-specific content knowledge, knowledge about student learning, and knowledge about teaching (e.g., lesson preparation, instructional activities, and assessments). These predominant components were included in this study to elicit teachers’ professional judgments and were labeled <italic>discipline, students</italic>, and <italic>teaching</italic>.</p>
<p>Second, a clear-cut theme was required to elicit responses from different teachers. That is, by having teachers from different teaching disciplines react to an unfamiliar teaching approach, it was expected that reactions regarding practicality would be brought out. The theme <italic>conceptual understanding</italic> was chosen because it is a general teaching concept and therefore appropriate across disciplines. The teaching of conceptual understanding is complex in that it requires that students acquire and retain a network of concepts and principles about some discipline that accurately represents key phenomena and their relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002831212468787">Feltovich, Spiro, &amp; Coulson, 1993</xref>). Particularly, science concepts are often difficult to grasp for students because they do not know how to construct conceptual models of scientific phenomena (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002831212468787">Abraham, Williamson, &amp; Westbrook, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002831212468787">Carey &amp; Smith, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0002831212468787">White &amp; Frederiksen, 1998</xref>), which has led, among others, to the suggestion to integrate history of science in science teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0002831212468787">Matthews, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0002831212468787">National Research Council, 1996</xref>). Several researchers have addressed the teaching of conceptual understanding in the domain of science while using historical information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002831212468787">Jenkins, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002831212468787">Jensen &amp; Finley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0002831212468787">Lin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002831212468787">Lin, Hung, &amp; Hung, 2002</xref>). Still, the explicit use of historical information in the teaching of conceptual understanding is mostly absent in the curriculum. By focusing on conceptual understanding via history, a teaching method was found that appeared applicable to other disciplines than those in the science domain (see also Procedure) and that can be expected to be unfamiliar to the participants. The study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002831212468787">Lin et al. (2002)</xref> was chosen.</p>
<p>Third, a description of a common study was required that resembled typical experimental research findings to elicit both supportive and constraining information from teachers. The study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002831212468787">Lin et al. (2002)</xref> appeared useful for this purpose for several reasons. First, their study provides a clear and understandable explanation of using historical information to support conceptual understanding. Second, their study is about teaching physics, which is an unfamiliar discipline for the participants. In this way, the participants can be treated equally because they all received educational information about an unfamiliar discipline. Third, the main results of their study can be explained without going into too much detail. This means that teachers who are unfamiliar with statistics or the presentation of research results will be able to understand the main results. Fourth, by focusing on the main results of their study it was possible to rewrite the study to a brief effect study. For example, only the final results of the study of Lin et al. were presented. In this way, a representative description was obtained, that is, a modified description presenting a typical quantitative experiment including student achievement in relation to an alternative teaching method.</p>
<p>However, the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002831212468787">Lin et al. (2002)</xref> was written for researchers and not for teachers. This meant that certain parts of the research report might not be suitable for teachers to form professional judgments. Therefore, it was decided to mention only the essentials of the research report, though in a scholarly written form to adhere to researchers’ concerns (i.e., reliable and valid designs and significant results), to elicit teachers’ reactions. The essentials of the research report were subtracted by (a) focusing on general information about conceptual understanding, (b) leaving out the details about physics teaching, and (c) including only the main results to counter overload and confusion. In this way a representative description of a common experimental study was produced that should meet teachers’ unfamiliarity with research reports (see Appendix in the online journal).</p>

<title>Overview</title>
<p>This study was designed as a qualitative methods research study, though a combination of qualitative and quantitative data analyses were used. It was a qualitative study because open-ended questions were used to collect nonnumeric data for exploration purposes. The reason for using solely open-ended questions was to enable the participants to respond in any way that pleased them to learn more about the teachers’ view to research findings. It was expected that when teachers can include subjective, personal, social, and situational aspects in their answers, they would have a feeling of being taken seriously and the data would include the breadth and depth of the phenomenon. Also, the first research question required that qualitative data was obtained. However, the study included quantitative data analyses to answer the second and third research questions.</p>
<p>The design required experienced teachers, that is, teachers who know the teaching profession well enough to provide comprised answers. Also, these teachers should have an open mind about interpreting (modified) research findings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002831212468787">Burkhardt &amp; Schoenfeld, 2006</xref>). These criteria of teaching experience and open mindedness regarding research findings makes purposive sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002831212468787">Johnson, 1995</xref>) the appropriate technique because in this way the teachers who have those characteristics can be located and asked to participate. Teachers following part-time courses to obtain a master’s of education degree meet these criteria because in the Netherlands, where this study was conducted, only experienced teachers are admitted to these courses and these teachers are willing to follow an educational program that includes scientific reasoning and scientific knowledge acquisition.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>In all, 60 experienced teachers of secondary education (22 women, 31 men, 7 unknown; teaching experience range = 1–27 years, <italic>M</italic> = 11.5 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.45) from a group of 106 teachers (51 women and 55 men), following a first-year graduate course in educational psychology at the Applied University of Amsterdam, participated. The teachers’ disciplines and years of teaching experience were L1 (Dutch language; <italic>n</italic> = 10; <italic>M</italic> = 10.5 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.00), mathematics (<italic>n</italic> = 13; <italic>M</italic> = 9.5 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.21), L2 (English, French, German languages; <italic>n</italic> = 6; <italic>M</italic> = 17.0 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.17), history (<italic>n</italic> = 19; <italic>M</italic> = 7.5 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.70), and economics (<italic>n</italic> = 12; <italic>M</italic> = 13.5 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.00).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0002831212468787">
<title>Instruments</title>
<p>The teachers received (a) a description of modified research findings on a teaching method for conceptual understanding by using historical information and (b) open-ended questions. For the modified description of research findings, only the main points of the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002831212468787">Lin et al. (2002)</xref> were used to obtain a text that was written for teachers but that kept the character of an experimental research report (see Appendix). That is, the teachers were provided with: (a) a summary of the theoretical account reviewing the state of conceptual understanding using historical information, (b) the method describing parts of the research design, (c) the results of one of the experiments, and (d) the conclusion that for now the results support the use of historical information. In short, only a general description of using historical information to explain concepts was presented to the teachers, without the explicit examples Lin et al. provided.</p>
<p>The open-ended questions were developed to obtain the participants’ practicality issues. To avoid researcher bias, the questions were stated in such a way that they did not suggest a certain answer. Also, the questions were divided into three parts to increase the trustworthiness. That is, (a) general opinion (GO) questions, (b) teachers’ professional judgment (TPJ) questions, and (c) research interpretation (RI) questions were used to include different theories and perspectives to help interpret and explain the data (see also Analysis). The GO questions were included to capture the teachers’ general attitude toward the research study description. Also, the questions were used to introduce an alternative teaching method in a nonthreatening way. The questions were “What is your first impression of this research study?” and “What is your first impression of using historical information to teach conceptual understanding?”</p>
<p>The TPJ questions were included next, to have the teachers assemble their thoughts by asking them about teaching aspects they have knowledge about. The TPJ questions inquired after the teachers’ teaching knowledge (teaching), discipline-specific content knowledge (discipline), and knowledge about student learning (students). The questions were “What possibilities and difficulties does this study provide for your discipline?”; “What possibilities and difficulties does this study provide for your students?”; and “What possibilities and difficulties does this study provide for your teaching?”</p>
<p>Finally, the RI questions were included to inquire about the research findings the teachers required to form their professional judgments. The questions were “What else do you need to know if you want to use this form of teaching efficiently?”; “What future research questions would you state?”; and “What else would you have wanted to know regarding this study?” Because the participants knew relatively little about scientific knowledge acquisition and by explicitly asking them to replenish the modified description of the study, it was expected that they would focus on practicality issues instead of providing answers that researchers want to hear.</p>
<p>Also, an extra question was included to check the data on discipline-based differences (i.e., “What are the essential differences between your own discipline and the physics discipline in the presented research study?”), and demographic questions were included to collect information about the teachers’ disciplines and their years of teaching experiences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0002831212468787">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Before the teachers read the study overview and filled in the questions, they received an introduction in which the theme conceptual understanding was explained and translated to the different teaching disciplines of the teachers: (a) languages—concepts that explain or describe the rules for grammar and spelling; examples are specific styles of literacy authors such as William Shakespeare or Jules Verne, debates about spelling rules, and writers about specific grammar structures; (b) mathematics—concepts that explain or describe mathematical operations; examples of historical figures in mathematics are Pythagoras and Pascal; (c) history—concepts that explain or describe historical events or periods; examples of historical figures in history are James Watt and Livingstone; and (d) economics—concepts that explain or describe the production and distribution of goods and services; examples of historical figures in economics are John Stuart Mill and Tinbergen.</p>

<sec id="section9-0002831212468787">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The data were analyzed first by using a variety of matrix displays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0002831212468787">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002831212468787">Table 1</xref>). Next, the amount of RI remarks was used to quantify the data to establish hierarchies, and then the teachers’ other responses were analyzed again to check the hierarchies and to rule out alternative explanations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002831212468787">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Results and Conclusions</title>
<sec id="section11-0002831212468787">
<title>Teachers’ Professional Judgments</title>
<p>The GO question about a first impression of the report of the research study elicited 72% positive, 20% doubtful, 3% negative, and 5% blank responses. These responses were categorized as (a) usability (33%), (b) interestingness (42%), and (c) clarity (25%). Examples of usability were “Makes subject matter more accessible to students,” “Useful in acquiring knowledge,” and “Useful to adjust lesson content.” Examples of interestingness were “Can make subject matter less boring for students” and “A nice example of how to introduce subject matter differently.” Examples of clarity were “The description of the study provides a clear overview” and “The provided description could have been supplemented with examples.”</p>
<p>The GO question about using historical information to teach conceptual understanding resulted in 52% positive, 38% doubtful, 7% negative, and 3% blank answers. Examples of positive remarks were “Useful for students to understand concepts or to remember concepts better,” “Useful in teaching literature,” and “Useful in teaching some themes of mathematics.” Examples of doubtful remarks were “Not useful for students” and “Nice idea, though it requires time and knowledge.” Examples of negative remarks were “Not useful for language grammar” and “This will require too much time.”</p>
<p>These results showed that most of the teachers reacted positively to the modified research findings and were able or willing to react to a teaching concept outside their own teaching discipline. Because the teachers were less positive about using historical information to teach conceptual understanding, this result suggests that although the teaching concept appeared interesting and useable, the translation to their own discipline was regarded more critically.</p>
<p>The TPJ question about discipline resulted in 51 possibilities and 42 difficulties. The possibilities that were stated reflected means to explain, address, and vary one’s teaching. Examples were “Useful to provide information to students,” “In this way insights can be explained,” “Nice to use appealing examples,” and “This will motivate some students.” The difficulties included (a) the temporary character of this teaching approach (an example was “Not always feasible in my classroom”), (b) realizable issues (examples were “How to realize this teaching method,” “How to find appealing examples,” and “Requires that teachers know these things”), and (c) opposite effects (an example was “As long as it doesn’t interfere with the curriculum”). To summarize, the main questions raised by the teachers were (a) “When is it the best moment to use this teaching method in my discipline?”; (b) “Is it realizable in my discipline?”; (c) “Are there appealing examples in my discipline?”; and (d) “Which background knowledge is required when I want to teach in this way in my discipline?”</p>
<p>The TPJ question about students resulted in 53 possibilities and 34 difficulties. Regarding student experiences, responses about utility ranged from “Provides students with background knowledge,” “This will increase their understanding,” and “Makes concepts more insightful” to “This will be difficult for students because they will lose the overview,” “This is very different from what is normally expected from students,” “This is not in line with students’ usual goal: passing tests,” and “Students are distracted easily and will not be able to concentrate.” Moreover, regarding engagement the responses ranged from “This will motivate students” and “Invites students to think along, because it is made concrete” to “It will be a burden for them to listen all the time and to receive so much information” and “Requires extra efforts from students.” Regarding student differences the teachers raised only questions such as “Is this suitable for all students?” Also regarding background, questions were raised such as “Does this method work, because of the variation: teaching differently?” and “Does this method work, because the context is added?” No supplementary remarks regarding gender were made. To summarize, the teachers mainly remarked on student experiences, in that they wavered between the increased understanding and the extra efforts this teaching method might evoke in students.</p>
<p>The TPJ question about teaching resulted in 48 possibilities and 49 difficulties. Regarding utility, the teachers were positive about varying one’s teaching method, but they were insecure about its magnitude. An example was “How often do I have to apply this teaching method to be effective?” Regarding means, the teachers reacted that this teaching method seemed suitable for large groups, provided that materials were available. The teachers also worried about lesson preparation, in particular, the time it would take (an example was “This will require extra preparation time”) and teaching skills (examples were “One has to be creative to develop and instruct in this way” and “One has to keep the essence of the subject matter in mind”). Regarding realizable, the teachers’ responses included practical issues. Examples were “How to realize this teaching method,” “How to find appealing examples,” and “As long as it doesn’t interfere with the curriculum.” To summarize, the observed usefulness of this teaching method is clouded by pressure of work and provisions. When teachers consider teaching they include mainly classroom activities, though some remarks regarding school conditions were also made (examples were “Will my colleagues also have to teach in this way?” and “Provided that the school supports this teaching method”).</p>
<p>The RI question about absent information elicited 68 responses. These responses were divided over the categories, students, teaching, and teacher (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0002831212468787">Table 3</xref>). The patterns in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0002831212468787">Table 3</xref> suggest that the teachers’ main interest lies in students’ experiences and differences when the teaching method is considered. Examples were “How do students react to this teaching method?”; “What draws students to this teaching method?”; “How to deal with differences in students’ prior knowledge?”; and “What about differences in achievement level?” Furthermore, teacher experiences were mentioned, though less frequent.</p>

<p>The RI question about future research questions elicited 60 responses. These responses were distributed between students, discipline, and teaching, showing that students’ achievement and discipline results were rated frequently (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0002831212468787">Table 4</xref>). The relevance of achievement was indicated by emphasizing long-term results. Regarding discipline, the teachers remarked that they wanted to know the results in their own discipline.</p>

<title>Discipline-Based Differences</title>
<p>The RI data provided for discipline-based differences by calculating the frequencies of the teachers’ responses per teaching discipline (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0002831212468787">Tables 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0002831212468787">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0002831212468787">5</xref>). The results of these tables showed that the mathematics teachers were primarily interested in students’ achievement. Moreover, they mentioned to require more information about this teaching methods’ utility and instructional materials and activities. The history teachers particularly remarked that they required more information about research results on the relation with other teaching methods. They also remarked that they required more information about students’ experiences and achievement. Finally, the economics teachers reacted mainly about requiring information about this alternative teaching method in relation to other teaching methods and how they could prepare their lessons to obtain the best results. They also mentioned students’ differences and achievement relatively frequently.</p>
<p>The language teachers particularly mentioned students’ experiences. Furthermore, the L1 teachers remarked on students’ differences while the L2 teachers remarked about students’ achievement. Also students’ background was mentioned relatively often. Moreover, the L2 teachers wanted to know more about the usefulness of teaching in this way and how they could realize this alternative teaching method. Noticeably, the L1 teachers reacted in particular about how they would like to learn more about the results of this teaching method in relation to their own teaching method.</p>
<p>Overall, the TPJ questions provided more positive than negative responses. The positive percentages (and the negative percentages in parentheses) were: L1, 55% (45%); mathematics, 56% (44%); L2, 53% (47%); history, 62% (38%); and economics, 58% (42%). In general, all the teachers focused on concrete examples like this would help them to grasp the teaching method. Examples were “For literature lessons,” “For example, Keynes,” and “What are appealing examples of historical figures in my discipline?” In particular, the mathematics, history, and economics teachers mentioned the extra time this teaching method would require. Also, the usefulness of this teaching method was questioned the most by the L2 teachers (examples were “Are students willing to acquire information in this way” and “Students are not accustomed to this kind of teaching”). This result is also found in the first RI question, in which the L2 teachers raised questions concerning students’ experiences, required background information, and questioned whether this teaching method was realizable.</p>
<p>The control question about essential differences in disciplines resulted in 102 answers. Of these, 38 answers were about teaching (i.e., lesson preparation and requested time), 22 answers were about concepts (i.e., which concepts), 21 answers indicated that there were no differences, 16 answers were about discipline (i.e., language and behavioral disciplines vs. science disciplines), and 5 answers were about curriculum (an example was “This teaching method seems fine, though my first priority is covering what the curriculum dictates”).</p>

<title>Structuring the Themes</title>
<p>The data also provided for a hierarchy of the themes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002831212468787">Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002831212468787">Table 2</xref> showed that the teachers responded mostly to the categories students and teaching. The themes that were mentioned relatively often (percentages ≥ 30) were achievement, utility, other, and experiences. Regarding achievement the teachers remarked that they wanted to know whether this teaching method could elicit at least the same achievement results in students as their usual teaching method. Next, the teachers’ remarks on utility were mainly about <italic>when</italic> this teaching method is most effective. Moreover, the theme other was remarked on to know more about the effects of this teaching method in relation to other teaching methods. Also, students’ experiences were remarked on because the teachers wanted to know what the students thought of this teaching method in terms of understanding and efforts. Finally, the remaining themes were, in descending order, student differences and discipline results, students’ background, teaching preparation, teaching realizable, teacher experiences, teaching assessment, and students’ gender.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings of this study showed that the use of a representative modified description of an experimental study across teaching disciplines identified a range of issues that pointed out teachers’ practicality issues. Although these issues cannot be generalized to other teaching methods than conceptual understanding using historical information, overall, the results of this study point to (a) teachers can be included in bringing out important practicality issues for them and (b) teachers’ practicality issues can have consequences for research studies.</p>
<p>First, asking teachers who are willing to consider research findings (i.e., teachers following a master’s program) to react to an unfamiliar teaching method showed that the teachers could apply the provided information to their own teaching. That is, discipline-based differences appeared not to be a major concern for the teachers. Then, of course, they are experienced teachers. That students’ learning and teaching were elaborated on mostly by the teachers is in line with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002831212468787">Kennedy (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0002831212468787">Van Velzen (2012)</xref>. Furthermore, the teachers found the modified research findings useful. Although it can be argued that a modification of research findings might deprive teachers of information, it can also trigger comments that, in this study, resulted in the obtained themes and hierarchies.</p>
<p>Second, findings that were retrieved in this way were that the teachers emphasized students’ long-term achievement results, the optimal time and place to use the alternative teaching method and its relation to other teaching methods, and the importance of knowledge of students’ experiences to understand a teaching method more thoroughly and to be able to support students better. What do these results imply for research studies? The kind of research methods that researchers use regarding certain variables might not provide for the main requirements that the teachers in this study mentioned. First, in the modified description of research findings, the variables <italic>teaching methods</italic> and <italic>student achievement</italic> were studied via a brief (i.e., days to several months) effect study. The teachers’ remarks on <italic>long-term</italic> achievement, however, seemed to suggest that they think in terms of a school year. That is, they considered students’ school learning in light of the results obtained at the end of a school year, probably because it is the teachers’ goal to help their students pass at the end of the school year.</p>
<p>Second, in the modified description of research findings the variable <italic>alternative teaching method</italic> was studied via a control or comparative study. The teachers in this study, however, were particularly interested in knowing when to use the teaching method beside their usual teaching routine to be effective. Although the kind of teaching method used in this study also might have brought out such remarks, it is interesting to know that the teachers were interested in knowing how much time should be devoted to the alternative teaching method and when it should be included in their teaching routine to be most effective. This result also suggests that the teachers considered teaching methods in relation to students’ school learning in light of a school year.</p>
<p>Finally, the majority of the teachers indicated that information about student experiences was important for them, which makes sense when one considers that students’ attention is a first requisite in provoking learning. Moreover, the teachers’ remarks suggest that information about student experiences helps teachers in knowing how to encounter their students when using a different teaching method to ensure students’ understanding and participation in the lesson. Information about student experiences also appeared to help the teachers to understand the possibilities and difficulties of a teaching method more thoroughly and, consequently, how to execute it in the classroom.</p>
<p>Although the modified description of the research findings used in this study presented a quantitative effect study, the main results appear to call for attention to other methodological approaches. That is, because the main results of this study suggest that student learning and the time span of a school year is at the center of the teachers’ attention, the inclusion of obtaining qualitative data seems plausible. Particularly, the teachers’ remarks concerning student experiences could include the obtaining of qualitative data to capture the breadth and depth of students experiencing school learning. However, also the teachers’ request for students’ achievement across a school year could include both long-term numerical data and over-time nonnumeric data on students’ performances to understand students’ learning as something that becomes visible over time. Finally, teachers’ request of information about when to alternate teaching methods can also be addressed by (mixing) quantitative and qualitative approaches to examine student learning when different teaching methods are being used in the time span of a school year. Besides, mixed methodologically approaches might provide for further insights on the elusive relationship between observed teacher and learner behavior and teaching effectiveness.</p>
<p>In addition, the discipline-based differences showed that the main requests for long-term information about achievement results were made by the mathematics teachers while the main requests for information about student experiences were made by the language teachers. In this respect, research on learning literacy and numeracy showed that harnessing a range of theoretical orientations and methodologies can generate insights not otherwise possible (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0002831212468787">Wyatt-Smith, Elkins, &amp; Gunn, 2011</xref>). An example of the use of a qualitative approach concerning student school learning is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002831212468787">Green, Castanheira, and Yeager (2011)</xref>. They discussed that in classroom-discourse studies the focus is on over-time interactions among teacher and students to explore the opportunities for student learning. That is, the ideas, information, and practices that students have access to; how the actions among members of the class support and/or constrain what is possible to know and do; and how and what students take up and are able to use in subsequent learning events are central. This example shows what kind of information about student school learning can be obtained and might be of interest to teachers to frame their professional judgments regarding student learning within the time span of a school year.</p>
<p>What do these results imply about research questions? To answer the teachers’ request for information, differentiating between theoretical and practicality research questions appears useful. Theoretical research questions focus on developing and testing theories and their applications. Practicality research questions focus on teachers’ issues regarding discipline, students, and teaching. Differentiating between theoretical and practicality research questions can help researchers to focus their attention to the two sides of education: Both theoretical and practicality questions can help in explaining what educating is about. For example, the results of this study showed that practicality questions regarding the teaching of conceptual understanding by using historical information should address specifically long-term achievement results and the utility of teaching methods while taking into account students’ experiences and other teaching methods. However, a limitation of this study is that the results relate only to the teaching of conceptual understanding while using historical information as reported in the modified description of research findings. That is, other teaching methods and educational concepts will require different studies, and perhaps several studies, to specify the practicality research questions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, practicality research questions can be included after or at the same time theoretical research questions are raised. Although the combination of theoretical and practicality research questions will not always be feasible, the attempt can provide for certain advantages. Including practicality research questions requires a better understanding of the educational practices, which means that researchers need to better understand teachers, teaching, and student learning. This change in perspective can point researchers to important additions to their research questions in terms of relevance. A second advantage is that new or supplementary questions can arise that can foster our thinking and the development of educational theories. A final advantage is that a better understanding of teaching issues can accordingly help teacher education in developing prospective teachers’ professional expertise.</p>
<p>In concluding, the results of this study showed that teachers can be included in research by asking them to comment on a representative modified description of research findings, though future studies are required to examine the specific contributions of such comments to the relevance of educational research, that is, in what ways teachers might be willing to take up and use such research findings. Also, further research studies are required to understand in what way different methodological approaches can provide for useful information for both teachers and researchers. Overall, the results of this study, taking into account its preliminary character, could point to nuances in research designs. That is, within the relevance of research perspectives, a (re)focus on including teachers’ practicality issues might have been brought out. In addition, improving the relevance of research findings will continue to require thoughtful attention.</p>
