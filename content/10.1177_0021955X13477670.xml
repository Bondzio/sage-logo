<p>This study presents the application of the micromechanical variational asymptotic method for unit cell homogenization (VAMUCH) with a three-dimensional unit cell structure and a coupled, macroscaled finite element analysis for analyzing and predicting the effective elastic properties of microcellular injection-molded plastics. A series of injection-molded plastic samples, which include polylactic acid, low-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and thermoplastic polyurethane, with microcellular-foamed structures were produced and their mechanical properties were compared with predicted values. The results showed that, for most material samples, the numerical prediction was in fairly good agreement with experimental results, which suggests the applicability and reliability of VAMUCH in analyzing the mechanical properties of porous materials. Other findings were that the material characteristics (e.g. brittleness and ductility) influenced the predicted results and that VAMUCH prediction could be improved when the unit cell structure was more representative of the real composition.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021955X13477670" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>For the past 50 years, many analytical methods and mathematical models, either theoretical or empirical, have been developed to predict the effective elastic modulus of composite materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021955X13477670">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021955X13477670"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021955X13477670"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021955X13477670"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021955X13477670">5</xref></sup> Based on these previously established methods, prediction and estimation methods of porous materials can also be derived by treating these materials as a special case of two-phase composites, with fillers of negligible mechanical properties to represent the voids. However, some of these methods are not available or have restrictions for porous materials due to underlying theoretical assumptions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021955X13477670">6</xref></sup> In order to overcome this problem, many experimental and theoretical studies have been done and have led to methods specific to analyzing the effective properties of porous materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021955X13477670">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021955X13477670"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021955X13477670"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021955X13477670"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021955X13477670"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021955X13477670"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021955X13477670">12</xref></sup> Similar to composites, the physical behaviors of a porous material are dependent on the properties of the matrix material, the cell porosity and the cell morphology. To characterize the properties of microcellular-foamed polymers, the correlations between foam morphology, mechanical properties and process conditions were studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021955X13477670">13</xref></sup> Another way to find the effective properties of composites and porous materials is through numerical modeling and simulation of the microstructure through models. For instance, the finite difference method, boundary element method, and finite element method (FEM) have all been used in solving micromechanical models. Among these, the FEM is commonly used for both global behavior and local field analyses.</p>
<p>From the aspect of micromechanics, composites and porous materials are often regarded as continuum since the subject domain is large enough compared with individual phase region dimensions and the matrix and fillers are generally firmly bonded together at the interface. In many analysis methods, the second phase is assumed to be perfectly random in spatial and orientation domains in order to substantiate statistically homogeneous assumptions. A common way to describe these materials is to define so-called representative volume elements (RVE). The unit cell (UC) is defined as the building block of a heterogeneous material and the smallest RVE. The structure of a heterogeneous material can be idealized as a periodic assembly of UCs. By performing a micromechanical analysis of the identified UC, the effective properties of this homogenized heterogeneous material can be computed and used for material behavior analysis on a macroscopic scale. Then, with the feedback of the macroscopic behavior to the micromechanical analysis, the local field variables such as displacement, stress and strain within the UC can be calculated. The flow chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021955X13477670">Figure 1</xref> describes the basic steps of heterogeneous microstructure analysis with the concept of UC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021955X13477670">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021955X13477670">15</xref></sup>

<p>VAMUCH, which stands for the variational asymptotic method for UC homogenization, is a finite-element-based micromechanics program code that can perform homogenization of heterogeneous materials based on the variational asymptotic method. It is a general purpose approach developed by Yu and Tang for computing the effective material properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021955X13477670">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021955X13477670">15</xref></sup> In elastic analysis, VAMUCH calculates the Young’s modulus, shear modulus and Poisson’s ratio for isotropic, orthotropic or anisotropic materials.</p>
<p>This approach is extended from the variational asymptotic method (VAM), a mathematical foundation for simplifying the process of solving physical problems involving small parameters, proposed by Berdichevsky.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021955X13477670">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021955X13477670">17</xref></sup> First, a variational statement is extracted from the three-dimensional continuum formulation of the periodic heterogeneous material for the micromechanical analysis of the UC. That is, a variational statement of the UC is formulated through an asymptotic expansion of an energy function. Then, this variational statement is solved by VAM to find the relationship between local and global displacements in order to predict effective material properties and local fields. These processes are performed by the FEM and built into the program code, VAMUCH, to analyze UC models including uni-dimensional, two-dimensional and three-dimensional domains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021955X13477670">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021955X13477670">15</xref></sup> Due to geometric limitations, for the UC model with a spherical pore, the porosity must be less than 50%.</p>
<p>According to interpretation from VAMUCH developers, there are two essential assumptions for the micromechanical analysis of heterogeneous materials with identifiable UCs.</p>
<p><bold>Assumption 1:</bold> The exact solutions of the field variables have volume averages over the UC. For example, if <italic>u<sub>i</sub></italic> are the exact displacements within the UC, there exists an average variable <italic>v<sub>i</sub></italic> such that
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0021955X13477670"><label>(1)</label><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="math1-0021955X13477670"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Ω</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∫</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Ω</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mtext>d</mml:mtext><mml:mi>Ω</mml:mi><mml:mo>≡</mml:mo><mml:mo>〈</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>〉</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula1-0021955X13477670" xlink:href="10.1177_0021955X13477670-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
where Ω denotes the domain occupied by the UC and its volume.</p>
<p><bold>Assumption 2:</bold> The effective material properties obtained from the micromechanical analysis of the UC are independent of the geometry, boundary conditions and loading conditions of the macroscopic structure, which means that the effective material properties are assumed to be the intrinsic properties of the material when viewed macroscopically.</p>
<p>The mathematical meaning of the first assumption is that the exact solutions of the field variables can be integrated over the domain of the UC. The second assumption suggests that the size and loading effects in the macroscopic analysis can be neglected. Other factors such as internal geometry and distribution of inclusions, specific boundary conditions and the prescribed relationship between global and local fields are beneficial but not essential requirements, as indicated by the developers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021955X13477670">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021955X13477670">15</xref></sup></p>

<p>Conventional and microcellular injection molding processes were performed on an ARBURG-320S injection molding machine to manufacture standard ASTM D638-03 Type I tensile bars from polylactic acid (PLA, NatureWorks LLC 3001D), low-density polyethylene (LDPE, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company Marlex), polypropylene (PP, Basell Company Pro-fax SR256M), polystyrene (PS, BASF Corporation 145D) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU, BASF Corporation 1174D). Both solid and foamed samples were produced in this research. In order to create the microcellular-foamed structure, expandable thermoplastic microspheres (ETM, EXPANCEL 950 DU 120) were added to PLA, LDPE, PP and PS matrix materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021955X13477670">18</xref></sup> These hollow spherical particles contain hydrocarbon as the chemical blowing agent which is encapsulated by a thin acrylic copolymer shell. The weight ratio of EVA (as a carrier) and hydrocarbon is about 35:65. When the microspheres are heated (105–115℃), the thermoplastic shell becomes soft and gas is released from the hydrocarbons. When allowed to expand freely, the ETM containing encapsulated hydrocarbon is able to expand up to 80 µm, about four times its original diameter, when subjected to heat (160–200℃). When the encapsulated gas increases the pressure inside, the microspheres expand and a closed cell structure is formed in the polymer matrix. Since the injection temperature did not exceed the processing temperature range for ETM, which was between 140℃ and 220℃, there were very few broken-up beads observed among the total number of cells.</p>
<p>Various amounts of ETM were compounded with each polymer matrix to produce foamed samples. The pre-dried matrix material pellets and ETM beads were mixed by hand at room temperature in order to avoid ETM pre-expansion at a higher temperature. The weight ratio of ETM for PLA was 2.0%, while LDPE, PP and PS contained 1.5 and 5.0 wt% of ETM, respectively. The injection-molded samples are denoted as matrix polymer–S, −1.5, −2.0 or −5.0 in the following sections and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021955X13477670">Table 1</xref> to represent the solid samples and the foamed samples with various ratios of ETM. For all molding trials, the injection flow rates were 20 cm<sup>3</sup>/s for solid samples and 70 cm<sup>3</sup>/s for foamed samples. The mold temperature was 15℃ and the cooling time was 45 s. Other processing conditions are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021955X13477670">Table 1</xref>.

<p>In addition to solid injection-molded samples (TPU-S), foamed TPU samples were produced by the MuCell microcellular injection-molding process with supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> as the physical blowing agent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021955X13477670">19</xref></sup> The CO<sub>2</sub> gas dosage amount was 2.5% (TPU–C2.5) and the injection flow rate was 40 cm<sup>3</sup>/s. The mold temperature was room temperature 24℃ and the cooling time was 60 s.</p>
<p>The static mechanical properties for each sample group were measured on an Instron Model 3369 tensile tester equipped with a 50 kN load cell at room temperature. The cross-head speed, which followed the recommended material testing specifications, was 20 mm/min for PLA samples, 50 mm/min for LDPE, PP and TPU samples, and 10 mm/min for PS samples. Five tensile bars of each sample group were measured and the average results were collected. To investigate the microcell morphology, the samples were cryogenically fractured with liquid nitrogen. Then, the cross-sectional surfaces were observed using a JEOL Model LEO 1530 scanning electron microscope (SEM) operated at an accelerating voltage of 3 kV. Based on the collected SEM images, the cell sizes, cell densities and skin layer thicknesses of each sample group were measured by the image analysis program UTHSCSA Image Tool.</p>

<p>In microcellular-foamed samples, the structural foam exhibited a layered structure with a microcellular-foamed core encapsulated by solid skin layers. Because of the hybrid, sandwiched structure, the prediction and simulation process included two parts. First, the effective elastic modulus of the microcellular porous part was predicted by VAMUCH with the three-dimensional UC model in microscale. Then, the predicted property of this porous part was incorporated into a finite element model in macroscale to evaluate the elastic modulus of the whole injection-molded sample, which consisted of a foamed core and solid skin layers. In this study, ANSYS 11.0 was employed to run the numerical analysis.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0021955X13477670"><title>Micromechanical prediction of foamed parts by VAMUCH</title>
<p>A three-dimensional UC model was adopted to describe the microstructure of the porous, foamed materials. The average cell size and porosity were two essential geometric parameters, which could be obtained from the cell morphology presented in the SEM images, for constructing the representative UC model for the porous structure. The average cell size was the geometric mean among the recorded cell sizes, which was calculated as

Among the three classical Pythagorean means, the geometric mean was between the arithmetic and harmonic mean. Thus it was applied to obtain a moderately average cell size. The porosity was determined from the area of the pores versus the area of the sample visible under the microscope. This measurement was tenable since the area and volumetric porosities were equal for porous material with random structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021955X13477670">20</xref></sup> The three-dimensional UC applied here was a cube model with a closed spherical void at the center in which the void diameter Φ was equal to the average cell size (cf <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021955X13477670">Figure 2</xref>).

<p>After building the UCs, VAMUCH was applied to calculate the effective elastic modulus based on the finite element mesh of each UC. The six surfaces of the UC were meshed in advance by SHELL 93, the 8-node quadratic shell element, to make sure that the corresponding nodes were established on both positive and negative surfaces to fulfill a periodic boundary condition. Then, the constituent of the UC was meshed by SOLID 92, the 10-node tetrahedral structural element, along with matrix material properties. The bulk material properties of the four polymer matrices were acquired from previous tensile tests of solid samples.</p>

<p>The foamed sample was composed of a microcellular-foamed core surrounded by solid skin layers. The material properties of the solid part were the same as the bulk material properties of the solid sample, while the properties of the foamed part were predicted in the previous section. While building the model of a ‘dog-bone’ tensile bar, the two end regions for clamping could be neglected since the deformation took place at the central portion. Thus, the model was simplified to a rectangular block with the following dimensions: 63.5 by 12.7 by 3.175 mm. In addition, the model could be simplified to one-eighth of the rectangular block due to the symmetrical geometry in the three directions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021955X13477670">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the processes of model simplification for an injection-molded tensile bar sample.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021955X13477670">Table 3</xref> lists the predicted effective Young’s moduli of foamed samples from the numerical simulation and the experimental results from the tensile tests. The difference of the predicted value in comparison with the experimental measurement is also shown. It can be seen that for most foamed samples, the difference falls within a range of 10%. For PLA and PS, the difference was below 5%. Although LDPE-5.0 appeared to have a much higher difference at almost 20%, the predicted result can still be regarded as acceptable given the noted irregularity of the foamed structure and the fact that the mechanical properties of the voids resulting from ETM were totally neglected. The slightly higher difference for foamed TPU, which was up to 13%, was due to the existence of a few largescale voids that could have led to faster structural rupture during the tensile test.

<p>In the tensile test, different cross-head speeds were applied to different material samples according to the material technical manuals. To inspect whether the effect of various deformation rates on the material properties would be significant, pure solid samples of each material were additionally tested under 10, 20 and 50 mm/min tensile rates. The resulting Young's moduli at different cross-head speeds were compared and the differences were plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021955X13477670">Figure 6</xref>. Compared to the Young's modulus at the originally applied cross-head speed (i.e., 10 mm/min for PS, 50 mm/min for LDPE and PP and 20 mm/min for PLA), experimental results showed that the differences were within 15%, which was an acceptable deviation. The results also indicated that the various cross-head speeds may not have caused significant deviations on the Young's modulus since the range of the applied tensile rate was not very wide. Among the four materials, PLA exhibited the least rate-dependent effect, with deviations within 2%, while PP had a difference of up to 15%.

<p>The numerical modeling of the whole sample was established by incorporating both the predicted properties from VAMUCH (foamed part) and the experimental data (solid skin layers). According to observations from the macromechanical analysis above, the computationally effective Young’s modulus was in good agreement with the results of the tensile tests, which indicated the applicability of VAMUCH to three-dimensional UCs in predicting the elastic properties of porous materials. However, the viscoelasticity of materials, which is an important property of polymer materials, was not introduced into the models in this research and should be considered in future studies. Finally, it should be pointed out that the experimental Young's modulus was the slope measured at the initial linear portion of the stress–strain curve, which was based on a small deformation region, which is in consistence with the range used in the FEA analysis.</p>
<p>In addition, the information used in building the UCs was obtained directly from the cell morphology of each sample. The accuracy of VAMUCH prediction improved when the UC structure was more representative of the real composition. This observation also supported the reliability of VAMUCH in analyzing porous materials with known internal geometries.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the prediction difference was smaller for most material types with lower concentrations of ETMs. This was likely due to the fact that a polymer matrix with fewer ETMs is able to let microspheres grow to a fully expanded volume when cell distribution is sparse. When the cell distribution is widely distributed, the measurement of the cell size and quantity can be more accurate, which leads to a more reliable and realistic UC model. Also, a higher cell density increases the possibility of microsphere rupture, which disrupts the closed cell structure and affects the accuracy of the UC model.</p>
<p>Another finding is that among the four polymer matrices, the difference was smaller for PLA and PS samples as compared to LDPE and PP samples. In previous tensile tests, solid PLA and PS presented brittle material characteristics while LDPE and PP were more ductile. This finding indicates that material characteristics can also influence predicted results. For ductile materials, due to the nonlinear stress–strain behavior in the elastic region, it is possibility that the measured Young’s modulus was less accurate than for brittle materials. Also, in PP-foamed samples, the aggregation of expanded ETMs would lead to the same effect as large size voids in a microcellular structure, which would decrease the exact experimental Young's modulus.</p>
<p>One of the limitations of the VAMUCH method with a three-dimensional UC is the applicable porosity. Due to geometric limitations, the porosity of a UC model with a spherical void must be less than 50%. Also, the effects of microscale cell size and porosity on the VAMUCH-predicted elastic properties were studied. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021955X13477670">Figure 7</xref> shows the relationships among the effective elastic modulus predicted by VAMUCH, cell size and porosity. For trials with different cell sizes (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 µm) and fixed porosities (10, 20, 30 and 40%), results showed that the effective Young’s modulus did not change significantly with the cell size. Likewise, the normalized effective Young’s modulus was almost the same under the same porosity, which revealed that the cell size had a minimum effect on the VAMUCH-predicted properties. Other numerical modeling studies also found that microscale cell size had a negligible impact on elastic properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021955X13477670">23</xref></sup> However, in previous studies, the elastic properties of microcellular polymers changed with cell size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021955X13477670">24</xref></sup> Hence, further investigation is needed.

<p>VAMUCH provides an efficient and straightforward numerical approach to predicting a complete set of material properties. Once the identifiable UC of a heterogeneous material is built, the prediction of all effective properties can be obtained within one analysis without any other loading or boundary conditions needing to be placed on the macrostructure. A series of applications of the VAMUCH with three-dimensional UC models were performed in this study. The predicted material elastic properties were also compared with experimental results to evaluate the reliability and applicability of VAMUCH. According to observation, the UC model constructed with more sufficient information of real internal microstructures resulted in the most accurate prediction of mechanical properties.</p>
<p>For most material samples, the numerical simulation of the whole sample body, which incorporated the predicted mechanical properties of the porous part, was in agreement with tensile test results. This suggests the reliability and applicability of using VAMUCH to analyze porous materials. Also, VAMUCH tended to generate more accurate results when analyzing brittle materials as opposed to ductile materials.</p>
