<abstract>
<p>The diversification of firms into new geographic and product markets has received a tremendous amount of attention in the field of management. Charities, on the other hand, have garnered attention among management scholars primarily as social influencers on multinational corporations. However, over the past half-century, charities have become significant diversified entities in and of themselves. At their core, both charitable and for-profit organizations are bundles of routines that struggle to deal with administrative issues related to institutional isomorphism, organizational slack, and resource dependency. However, from a contextual standpoint, one of the primary mechanisms by which the diversification of charities impacts efficiency is the transaction costs associated with seeking out and maintaining external resources from donors in addition to charities’ internal set of capabilities and routines. Using panel data involving 3,616 charities over a five-year period, the authors’ findings suggest that while the main relationship between geographic diversification and efficiency is U shaped in nature, the main relationship between product diversification and efficiency is inverted U shaped. From an interaction perspective, the authors’ results also suggest that while charities that maintain lower levels of product diversification follow a similar U-shaped curve as they increasingly diversify into new regions, this curve is inverted for charities that are engaged in unrelated types of product diversification. Therefore, the study suggests that the extent to which one type of diversification produces positive or negative efficiencies depends significantly on the level of the other type of diversification. Such findings have theoretical implications for both the charitable and for-profit sectors.</p>

<p>While multinational corporations may struggle to identify new geographic and product market needs in seeking out profitable growth opportunities, charitable organizations have no such shortage of unmet social needs in regions throughout the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206311398135">Drayton, 2005</xref>). Rather, the engagement of charities in diversified activities to pare the already prodigious pile of global social needs, such as those created by poverty, illiteracy, and environmental degradation, is constrained primarily by their ability to garner donor and volunteer resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206311398135">Froelich, 1999</xref>). However, heightened competition for funding has caused such resources to become increasingly scarce and costly to acquire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0149206311398135">Scott, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Historically, donors have focused almost exclusively on measures of social effectiveness when evaluating the performance of charitable organizations. However, increased donor skepticism surrounding the percentage of their funds being spent directly on charitable activities, as opposed to administrative overhead and fund-raising, has led to an increased focus on financial efficiency as an important indicator of performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206311398135">Bennett &amp; Savani, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206311398135">Moore, 2000</xref>). Recent studies have indicated that charities perceived as inefficient tend to experience lower future financial funding from stakeholders who are no longer willing to support such organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0149206311398135">Thornton, 2006</xref>). Thus, the strategic focus of charities is being forced to shift away from unchecked growth and more toward maintaining a level of geographic and product scope that reflects an efficient allocation of resources as judged by the stakeholders upon whom the organization relies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206311398135">Fox &amp; Brown, 1998</xref>). Unfortunately, there has been very little theoretical or empirical work undertaken to explore how the increasingly heterogeneous set of activities within charitable organizations impacts their levels of efficiency.</p>
<p>The relationship between efficiency and the diversification of organizations into new geographic and product markets has previously received a tremendous amount of scholarly attention in the field of for-profit management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206311398135">Hoskisson &amp; Hitt, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0149206311398135">Werner, 2002</xref>). Such research has highlighted the potential benefits of geographic diversification such as the exploitation of firm-specific resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206311398135">Bartlett &amp; Ghoshal, 1989</xref>), achievement of greater economies of scale and scope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206311398135">Kobrin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0149206311398135">Kogut, 1985</xref>), and exploitation of location advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206311398135">Dunning, 1988</xref>). Similarly, scholars have identified potential costs associated with diversification related to the liability of foreignness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206311398135">Hymer, 1976</xref>), the liability of newness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0149206311398135">Stinchcombe, 1965</xref>), and the increased requirement for mechanisms of strategic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206311398135">Doz &amp; Prahalad, 1991</xref>). Thus, for-profit management scholars have focused primarily on the internal capabilities of firms to exploit these opportunities and mitigate these costs as the primary mechanisms by which diversification impacts efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206311398135">Chatterjee &amp; Wernerfelt, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>There are many underlying theoretical similarities between for-profit firms and charities as organizational entities. At their core, both can be considered bundles of routines that struggle to deal with administrative issues related to institutional isomorphism, organizational slack, and resource dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206311398135">Brody, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206311398135">Kistruck &amp; Beamish, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206311398135">Nelson &amp; Winter, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0149206311398135">Useem, 1987</xref>). However, from a contextual standpoint, one of the primary mechanisms by which the diversification of charities impacts efficiency is the transaction costs associated with seeking out and maintaining <italic>external</italic> resources from donors and volunteers in addition to their <italic>internal</italic> set of capabilities and routines. As compared to for-profit organizations that often use accumulated earnings and organizational slack in the pursuit of new diversification opportunities, charitable organizations, with their absence of excess profits and full-budget approach to acquired resources, are typically forced to seek out new financial resources for the purpose of diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206311398135">Galaskiewicz, Bielefeld, &amp; Dowell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311398135">James, 1983</xref>). While some for-profit organizations may similarly seek out additional forms of capital by way of equity or debt offerings to fund growth, the use of proceeds of such funds is often much more discretionary than donor funds, which are typically narrow in scope and short-term project-oriented in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206311398135">Kelly, 1991</xref>). Thus, one of the key additional mechanisms to consider when exploring the link between diversification and efficiency in charitable organizations is the extent to which the expanded set of activities would be sufficiently different from the organization’s current activities that new donor funding is required.</p>
<p>Using panel data involving 3,616 charities over a five-year period, our study examined the relationship between geographic and product diversification on efficiency both independently and in combination. Our main effect findings indicate that while the relationship between geographic diversification and efficiency is U shaped in nature, the relationship between product diversification and efficiency is inverted U shaped. However, our statistical results also suggest that, rather than being independent, the effects of geographic and product diversification on efficiency are highly interdependent. Thus, the effect of one type of diversification on efficiency is significantly dependent on the other, and their relative impacts should therefore be examined in combination rather than in isolation from one another.</p>
<p>Our study makes a number of theoretical contributions. First, we contribute directly to the literature on charities by highlighting the underlying mechanisms by which diversification and efficiency are related within the charitable context as opposed to the for-profit context. The identification of such mechanisms provides theoretical justification for why geographic and product diversification exhibit contrasting effects on efficiency, as well as provides practical insight to managers of charities and donors who are seeking information on how these variables are connected. Our study also contributes to broader organizational theory in two ways. First, with the exception of a handful of studies (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206311398135">Hitt, Hoskisson, &amp; Kim, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0149206311398135">Tallman &amp; Li, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0149206311398135">Wiersema &amp; Bowen, 2008</xref>), very little research has been undertaken to explore the interaction of product and geographic diversification within organizations, despite the prevalence of such combinations in both the for-profit and charitable sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206311398135">Boli &amp; Thomas, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206311398135">Hitt, Tihanyi, Miller, &amp; Connelly, 2006</xref>). Our study directly contrasts these two effects and provides a theoretical rationale for the manner in which they interact. Second, our study suggests that higher transaction costs resulting from high levels of resource dependency on external organizations can play an important role, in addition to the more traditionally studied mechanisms associated with internal capabilities and routines, in the link between diversification and performance.</p>
<p>We begin by defining and contrasting charities with for-profit organizations, followed by a description of the historical drivers of diversification in the charitable sector. We then develop our hypotheses related to the main and interaction effects of geographic and product diversification on efficiency in charities. After detailing our methodology, we present our results in tabular and graphic format. We conclude with a discussion of our finding and suggestions for future research directions.</p>
<sec id="section1-0149206311398135">
<title>Definition of Charitable Organization</title>
<p>A charity is defined as “a nonprofit corporate body whose goals are charitable, cultural, scientific, or some other public goal, who make an appeal to the public liberality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-0149206311398135">Wunderink, 2002</xref>: 21). While charities are a subset of the larger nonprofit sector that also includes cooperatives, associations, and unions, charities are unique in that their purpose must be “public serving” rather than private or “member serving” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0149206311398135">Salamon, 1992</xref>). Furthermore, a charitable organization is “precluded by external regulation or its own governance structure from distributing its financial surplus to those who control the use of organizational assets” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0149206311398135">Powell &amp; Steinberg, 2006</xref>: 1). In pursuit of their social missions, charities rely a great deal upon donors and volunteers to deliver a range of different services or “products” such as promoting the arts, combating diseases, or enforcing human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206311398135">Brody, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the obvious nondistribution-of-profits constraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206311398135">Hansmann, 1980</xref>), charities differ from for-profit organizations in a number of overarching ways. While for-profit organizations are paying increased attention to their social responsibility as an adjunct to their pursuit of profit maximization, their primary focus remains to capture economic rents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0149206311398135">Margolis &amp; Walsh, 2003</xref>). Charities, while also being increasingly driven to focus on financial efficiencies, retain a primary focus on effectively addressing pressing social needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206311398135">Moore, 2000</xref>). The traditional market and nonmarket governance mechanisms within much of the for-profit sector, such as stock options, shareholder regulations, and the market for corporate control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0149206311398135">Shleifer &amp; Vishny, 1997</xref>), are contrasted in the charitable sector with primarily intrinsic rewards, extensive stakeholder reporting, and an intense competition for donor resources for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0149206311398135">Rose-Ackerman, 1982</xref>). Charitable organizations tend to use a much more flat than hierarchical structure to accommodate more participative rather than top-down decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0149206311398135">O’Regan &amp; Oster, 2000</xref>), are attracted to weak rather than strong formal institutional environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311398135">Austin, Stevenson, &amp; Wei-Skillern, 2006</xref>), and have managers who are typically less professionally trained than their for-profit counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206311398135">Crittenden &amp; Crittenden, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>However, at their core, charitable and for-profit organizations are similar in terms of their administrative struggles related to institutional isomorphism, organizational slack, and resource scarcity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206311398135">Brody, 1996</xref>). Both charitable and for-profit organizations are a bundle of routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206311398135">Nelson &amp; Winter, 1982</xref>) whose actions are often more practically governed by routinized human behaviors rather than by exogenously determined purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206311398135">Mahoney, 2005</xref>). Indeed, Nelson and Winter’s early study of the evolutionary theory of organizations was grounded in the study of nonprofit hospitals, and both agency theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206311398135">Jensen &amp; Meckling, 1976</xref>) and institutional theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206311398135">DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983</xref>) explicitly speak to the application of their key tenets to both for-profit and nonprofit organizations. With the increased involvement of charities in commercial activities and the increased involvement of for-profit organizations in social activities, there also has been a significant blurring of sector boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206311398135">Dees &amp; Anderson, 2003</xref>). Thus, while the contextual differences between for-profit firms and charities are sufficiently different to warrant unique study, their underlying theoretical foundations are sufficiently similar for diversification research grounded in either sector to be mutually beneficial.</p>

<title>The Diversification of Charitable Organizations</title>
<p>While charities have garnered increased attention in the field of strategic management, this attention has been primarily as small social influencers on multinational corporations rather than as diversified entities in and of themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0149206311398135">Prahalad &amp; Brugmann, 2007</xref>). However, charities now employ more than 7% of the U.S. workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0149206311398135">Sherlock &amp; Gravelle, 2009</xref>) and are considered agents of globalization rather than simply respondents to international forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206311398135">Doh &amp; Teegen 2003</xref>), and the social services they provide have become increasingly heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206311398135">Boli &amp; Thomas, 1999</xref>). Thus, charities have become influential economic actors, and their levels of both geographic and product scope have become extensive.</p>
<p>Around the middle of the 20th century, charitable organizations began to rapidly internationalize their operations into new regions around the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206311398135">Lindenberg, 1999</xref>). As opposed to for-profit corporations that expand geographically for reasons of seeking higher consumer market returns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206311398135">Hymer, 1976</xref>), lower internal transaction costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206311398135">Hennart, 1982</xref>), or access to cheaper labor and other factor markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206311398135">Buckley &amp; Casson, 1976</xref>), charities internationalized because of the willingness of an expanding donor base to supply financial support for the rapidly growing social demands at that time. Such demands included the declining role of the nation-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0149206311398135">Owens &amp; Shaw, 1972</xref>), the collapse of the former Soviet Union and other communist countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311398135">Dichter, 1999</xref>), worldwide economic recessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206311398135">Lindenberg, 1999</xref>), and the increased need for “keeping an eye on” multinational corporations that were similarly experiencing rapid international growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206311398135">Johnson, 1986</xref>). As a result, charities during this period experienced a large increase in both the number of regions in which they were operating and the number of activities with which they became involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206311398135">Boli &amp; Thomas, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Toward the end of the 20th century, however, the number of charities had grown to such a level that extensive competition worldwide developed for the supply of resources from traditional sources of government funding, as well as for private giving from individuals, corporations, and religious institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206311398135">Froelich, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206311398135">Lindenberg, 1999</xref>). In conjunction with this new environment of intense resource scarcity, the focus of donors began to shift from measuring success according to the quality of anecdotal stories of social achievements to administrative efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0149206311398135">Scott, 2003</xref>). As such, donors and charities began to question the degree to which the current levels of geographic and product diversification, resulting from the rapid expansion that occurred over the past several decades, were an efficient use of their increasingly limited resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311398135">Dichter, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206311398135">Moore, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>This focus on financial efficiency continues today. A recent survey of individual and institutional charitable donors indicated that a significant number had discontinued their contributions because they were concerned that the money would not be used efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206311398135">Hall, Lasby, Gumulka, &amp; Tryon, 2006</xref>). Such concerns appear well founded given that one in six charities was shown to spend more on fund-raising and administration than on the delivery of social programs and that one in five spend less than the recommended minimum of $0.60 per $1.00 collected in revenues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206311398135">Donovan, 2002</xref>). Additionally, a recent book on the topic of the efficiency of charities indicated that only 11% of Americans believe that “charities do a very good job of spending their money wisely” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0149206311398135">Light, 2004</xref>). Thus, there remains a number of unanswered questions surrounding the degree to which charities are able to strategically recombine and deploy their resources in order to efficiently grow and adapt to new geographic and product needs.</p>

<sec id="section4-0149206311398135">
<title>The Relationship Between Geographic Diversification and Efficiency in Charities</title>
<p>The charitable sector represents a previously unstudied context in the field of geographic diversification. Geographic diversification is defined as “the expansion across the borders of global regions and countries into different geographic locations, or markets” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206311398135">Hitt et al., 1997</xref>: 767). The term “geographic diversification” has also been used interchangeably with other terms such as “internationalization,” “international expansion,” and “globalization” in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206311398135">Hitt, Tihanyi, Miller, &amp; Connelly, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The mechanisms that drive charities to internationalize differ from those in the for-profit sector, resulting in different behaviors that may impact efficiency levels. First and foremost, charities are primarily socially driven in their decisions of where to establish operations. Thus, as compared to for-profit corporations, which typically limit their geographic expansion to the 40 or 60 most developed countries in the world where financial opportunities exceed entry risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311398135">Contractor, 2007</xref>), charities, by their very nature, are drawn to a much broader diversity of regions, including the least developed regions with weak formal institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311398135">Austin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0149206311398135">Webb, Kistruck, Ireland, &amp; Ketchen, 2010</xref>). Thus, as opposed to following the eclectic paradigm as an internationalization pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206311398135">Dunning, 1988</xref>), charities are often quickly drawn to distant regions in need of social reform rather than those where they are most likely to capitalize on economic ownership, location, or internalization advantages. In the weak institutional environments where charities often operate, higher administrative costs may be incurred to create or maintain internal substitutes for strong institutions as well as to circumvent redundant bureaucratic barriers to foreigners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206311398135">Hoskisson, Eden, Lau, &amp; Wright, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>When entering new regions, charities also tend to establish new facilities to provide social services to local inhabitants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0149206311398135">Quotah, 2004</xref>). Because of their focus on the quality of service delivery, and the desire to build local capacity as part of their social mission, charities often forgo incremental internationalization through modes such as licensing and export and instead jump right to building new on-the-ground facilities in their internationalization patterns. Thus, charities undertake a different route from the traditional Upsalla model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206311398135">Johanson &amp; Vahlne, 1977</xref>) in that they tend to not gradually escalate from more indirect to direct levels of involvement. Using a more on-the-ground entry mode in diversifying into new regions would similarly require costly new administrative structures for service delivery and coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0149206311398135">Kogut &amp; Singh, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>As alluded to previously, charities also differ from for-profit organizations in that the scope of their diversification traditionally has been limited not by their internal capabilities to exploit new opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0149206311398135">Penrose, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0149206311398135">Wernerfelt, 1984</xref>) but rather by their ability to garner new donor resources for an expanded set of activities to meet existing social needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206311398135">Galaskiewicz et al., 2006</xref>). Much like for-profit organizations, expanding into new regions often involves seeking out and interacting with new customers or “beneficiaries.” However, as compared to for-profit organizations where the costs associated with exploring new customer activities are recouped by way of payment for products and services, beneficiaries of charities are typically not a corresponding source of revenues for the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206311398135">Froelich, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Combined with this lack of customer revenues as a source of financial resources, charities do not possess accumulated earnings with which to engage in international expansion efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311398135">James, 1983</xref>), and the capital they do receive is much more narrowly directed in terms of its targeted usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206311398135">Kelly, 1991</xref>). Due to heightened levels of resource scarcity, donors have considerably greater power relative to individual charities as a result of this resource dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0149206311398135">Pfeffer &amp; Salancik, 1978</xref>) and thus are exercising greater control in dictating how their funds are used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206311398135">Carroll &amp; Stater, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206311398135">Froelich, 1999</xref>). The result is that charities seeking to expand into new geographic regions often incur significant transaction costs in seeking out new donor funding as well as learning and executing the reporting requirements that arise as a result of dealing with different donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206311398135">Grønbjerg, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0149206311398135">Peterson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0149206311398135">Powell &amp; Friedkin, 1986</xref>). Therefore, charities looking to expand to different regions would typically be required to search and negotiate with new potential donors representing high <italic>ex ante</italic> transaction costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-0149206311398135">Williamson, 1979</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>ex post</italic> monitoring costs imposed on the charity as a result of transacting with new donors are significant.</p>
<p>Due to their focus on regions with weak institutional environments, their tendency to pursue expensive modes of internationalization at early stages, and the high transaction costs associated with seeking out new donor resources in conjunction with diversification, we would expect a negative relationship between geographic diversification and efficiency as charities begin to expand into new regions. However, as they continue to expand geographically, organizational theory has suggested that organizations can eventually learn through experimentation how to operate on the ground within diverse institutional environments and develop new internationalization capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206311398135">Capar &amp; Kotabe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206311398135">Hitt et al., 2006</xref>). These internationalization processes and routines can be leveraged to create greater efficiencies as the organization repeats the process of geographic expansion into new regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206311398135">Hitt et al., 1997</xref>). Although each new region will be different, the process-based knowledge that exists within the organization offers an existing template that can be adapted.</p>
<p>While diversifying into new geographic regions would likely continue to require soliciting new resources, at higher levels of diversification, the charity will have already formed a broad network of linkages with diverse donors that can be leveraged, thereby lowering search and negotiation costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0149206311398135">Tsai, 2000</xref>). Such funds would increasingly be sought from one of the many existing donors with whom the charity now has existing relationships. Similarly, through previous experience in creating reporting templates and procedures to respond to a diverse set of donor demands for monitoring and reporting, the <italic>ex post</italic> transaction costs of dealing with additional funding requirements similarly decreases as the organization garners <italic>ex post</italic> transactional capabilities across diverse environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0149206311398135">Mayer &amp; Salomon, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>From an internal resources and structural perspective, while smaller, more focused charities often use flat hierarchical structures and managers with less professional training than their for-profit counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206311398135">Crittenden &amp; Crittenden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0149206311398135">O’Regan &amp; Oster, 2000</xref>), as charities become larger and more diversified in the regions they operate, they begin to adapt more hierarchical structures, employ more efficient-minded managers, and engage in more “business-like” processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206311398135">Dart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0149206311398135">Odom &amp; Boxx, 1988</xref>). Thus, in addition to the decreased transaction costs associated with external resource dependency mechanisms in charities, the more traditionally studied internal mechanisms linking diversification to efficiency would also contribute more positively at high levels of internationalization.</p>
<p>Therefore, while during the initial stages of expansion into new regions we expect a negative relationship between geographic diversification and efficiency, at higher levels of geographic diversification we would expect the relationship to become positive.</p>

<title>The Relationship Between Product Diversification and Efficiency in Charities</title>
<p>In addition to extensive geographic diversification on the part of charities throughout the latter half of the 20th century, many nongovernmental organizations also dramatically expanded their level of product diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206311398135">Boli &amp; Thomas, 1999</xref>). Product diversification can be defined as “the entry of a firm or a business unit into new lines of activity, either by processes of internal business development or acquisition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0149206311398135">Ramanujam &amp; Varadarajan, 1989</xref>: 525). The notion of diversification in the context of charities reflects the scope of social programs or activities rather than the traditional notion of “products.” Hence, charities can engage in a host of different social activities such as education and research, religion, health, and so forth.</p>
<p>Although most charities are initially founded with a single-focused social mission, research has shown that many subsequently diversify into additional social activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0149206311398135">Scott, 2003</xref>). However, in contrast to geographic diversification, in which the charity’s initial foray into new regions represents a very dramatic difference in terms of the donor base, institutional environment, and operational undertakings, a charity’s expansion into new services has been characterized much more as a “drift” than a “leap” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206311398135">DiMaggio, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0149206311398135">Jones, 2007</xref>). Thus, the diversification patterns of charities are much more incremental in terms of “product” diversification as compared to geographic diversification, as charities gradually shift away from services highly related to their core missions toward activities more and more unrelated.</p>
<p>It is expected that this distinction will alter the slope of the relationship between product diversification and efficiency as compared to geographic diversification. Because related product diversification involves only minor adjustments to existing activities, charities can leverage positive efficiencies due to the synergies that can be exploited within resource bundles across related activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206311398135">Chandler, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0149206311398135">Penrose, 1959</xref>). Similarly, expanding into similar activities that fit the charity’s overall mission can produce economies of scale and scope for the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0149206311398135">Teece, 1982</xref>). Perhaps of greatest importance, charities that engage in additional activities that are highly related to their existing scope of services are able to do so without incurring the additional transaction costs of seeking out and negotiating with new sources of funding. While existing donors provide fairly specific instructions on how their funds are to be used, there is at least some degree of “wiggle-room” for activities that are highly related to the organization’s stated mission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0149206311398135">Oster, 1996</xref>). Indeed, the limited evidence that has been presented on charities that diversify their missions suggests that, at least at related levels of product diversification, charities are able to produce some positive efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206311398135">Kaplan &amp; Norton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0149206311398135">Nielsen, 1986</xref>). Thus, we would expect that diversification into closely related activities would be positively related to efficiency in charitable organizations.</p>
<p>However, as charities engage in increasingly unrelated diversification, such efficiency gains may be significantly challenged. Diversification into more unrelated activities has been described as a much more “on-the-job training” process, with planning rarely taking place prior to expansion in charities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0149206311398135">Stone, Bigelow, &amp; Crittenden, 1999</xref>). This is particularly problematic given that organization theory suggests that unrelated diversification without appropriate planning and structural design typically produces diseconomies of scale and scope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206311398135">Hoskisson &amp; Hitt, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0149206311398135">Rumelt, 1974</xref>). Additionally, pursuing increasingly unrelated activities to the organization’s core mission requires seeking new sources of funding with a corresponding increase in <italic>ex ante</italic> and <italic>ex post</italic> transaction costs. Therefore, while we would expect a positive relationship between product diversification and efficiency with related diversification, we would anticipate a negative relationship at more unrelated levels.</p>

<title>The Interaction Effect of Product and Geographic Diversification in Charities</title>
<p>Despite their obvious relation to one another, the application of organizational theories to product diversification and geographic diversification has undergone separate but parallel paths of development over the past several decades. However, many charities have become diversified in both their products and geographic locations throughout the latter half of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206311398135">Boli &amp; Thomas, 1999</xref>). Thus, understanding how these two types of diversification interact with one another is important to understanding their net effect on efficiency levels.</p>
<p>By comparing the two main effects hypothesized, the impact of either type of diversification on efficiency is similarly dependent on the degree to which such diversification represents a significant departure from the existing set of organizational activities. In instances where such diversification represented incremental changes from the charity’s existing donor relationships, structural configurations, and routines, the effects on efficiency were positive. However, when diversification was significantly different, new linkages, new structures, and new routines were required, resulting in a negative effect on efficiency. Therefore, while the respective curves of product and geographic diversification on efficiency had different predicted outcomes, the theoretical explanations underlying both types were congruent.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that charities that are relatedly diversified in their set of activities will experience downward pressures on efficiency as they begin to internationalize into new regions. While there would be some efficiency gains associated with minor diversification into new services, prior organization theory has suggested that “the information-processing demands are more complex and greater when firms move into new international markets than when they move into different product markets within the same domestic setting” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206311398135">Hitt et al., 1997</xref>: 773). Thus, we argue that the stronger negative effects of initial geographic diversification will produce net inefficiencies for charitable organizations even when relatedly diversified. However, as relatedly diversified organizations continue to expand into a greater number of diversified geographic regions and leverage their broader set of donor networks and operational routines, the positive main effects of both related product diversification and higher geographic diversification will combine for a net positive upswing. Thus, we hypothesize that relatedly diversified charities will follow a U-shaped curve as they increasingly diversify into new regions.</p>
<p>However, we expect this relationship to be inverted for unrelatedly diversified charities. Charitable organizations that are unrelatedly diversified were at one time forced to seek out and negotiate with new donors, erect new administrative structures, and develop new processes. While such undertakings likely produced negative efficiencies to the organization from a standalone perspective, charities that had already built diverse linkages, structures, and routines by engaging in unrelated diversification may be able to leverage these in the early stages of diversifying into new geographic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206311398135">Kim, Hwang, &amp; Burgers, 1989</xref>). Thus, unrelated levels of product diversification in combination with low levels of geographic diversification can result in increased efficiency for firms as they are able to capitalize on such prior investments representing complementarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206311398135">Hitt et al., 2006</xref>). However, as unrelatedly diversified charities continue to expand into an increasing number of geographic regions, the complexity and lack of absorptive capacity resulting from combining both unrelated product and high geographic diversification will be too much of an administrative burden for charities and result in a downturn in efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0149206311398135">Ramanujam &amp; Varadarajan, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0149206311398135">Zahra &amp; George, 2002</xref>). While external transaction costs with acquiring funding may be much less of an issue to charities with incredibly diverse donor bases that were developed in becoming both unrelatedly diversified and highly geographically diversified, the internal costs of transacting and coordinating are sufficiently high to warrant overall inefficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206311398135">Doukas &amp; Lang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206311398135">Kumar, 2009</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that unrelatedly diversified charities will follow an inverted U-shaped curve as they increasingly diversify into new geographic regions.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The data for this study were drawn from the Charities Assessing and Registration (CARE) database system that was provided by the Canada Revenue Agency for the five-year period from 1997 to 2001. The specific time period was selected for making consistent comparisons across time as there was a change in government reporting requirements in 1997 and then again in 2002. The longitudinal data set contains charities that were diversified geographically as well as involved in a diverse range of services including education and research, social services, and the environment. A large number contained missing data for one or more variables in a year, and the pairwise deletion method was adopted to exclude 220 records from the sample. Previous research has shown that including cases with missing observations using panel data is subject to biased results, even when using a host of value estimation techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0149206311398135">Twisk, 2004</xref>). Our final sample consisted of 3,616 charities and 17,860 observations.</p>
<p>Recent studies have stressed the importance of using longitudinal data to explore the relationship between geographic diversification and efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311398135">Lu &amp; Beamish, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0149206311398135">Thomas &amp; Eden, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311398135">Geringer, Tallman, and Olsen (2000)</xref> also indicated that the effects of both geographic and product diversification on efficiency can vary tremendously over time, and thus a cross-sectional analysis is potentially misleading. However, the overwhelming number of studies examining this relationship has relied on either cross-sectional or pooled data, thereby ignoring the time effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206311398135">Hitt et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, our sample is composed of panel data consisting of multiple observations of the same variables over time to redress these previous shortcomings.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section10-0149206311398135">
<title>Efficiency</title>
<p>Efficiency was calculated by dividing the amount spent directly on charitable programs by the total expenditures of the organization. Highly efficient charitable organizations are expected to minimize administrative and fund-raising expenses, thereby maximizing the percentage of dollars spent on the actual delivery of charitable programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206311398135">Bennett &amp; Savani, 2003</xref>). Thus, our measure attempts to capture the administrative ability of charities to efficiently manage the positive and negative effects of geographic and product diversification.</p>
<p>It is important to note, however, that our measure of efficiency contains no information on the quality of services being produced, a component of charitable performance that continues to be extremely problematic to capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206311398135">Moore, 2000</xref>). However, due to increased pressures on charities to be more efficient, our measure of efficiency remains the most commonly used metric to evaluate the activities of charities by governments, potential donors, and other stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206311398135">Callen, Klein, &amp; Tinkelman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311398135">de Andres-Alonso, Cruz, &amp; Romero-Merino, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206311398135">Glaser, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206311398135">Keating &amp; Frumkin, 2003</xref>). This measure of efficiency has also become the common metric upon which “watchdog agencies” evaluate the performance of charities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206311398135">Bennett &amp; Savani, 2003</xref>). Charities deemed inefficient tend to experience lower future financial funding from stakeholders who are no longer willing to support such organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0149206311398135">Thornton, 2006</xref>). Therefore, while our measure of efficiency may be incomplete as an overall assessment of performance, we believe it provides novel insight into the capacity of charities to manage diversification activities using a metric that their stakeholders, upon whom they rely for their ongoing survival, use to judge the organization’s worthiness.</p>

<title>Geographic diversification</title>
<p>Many operationalizations of geographic diversification have been used in prior organizational theory literature including the percentage of foreign sales as a percentage of total sales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206311398135">Capar &amp; Kotabe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206311398135">Geringer, Beamish, &amp; daCosta, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0149206311398135">Grant, 1987</xref>), foreign assets as a percentage of total assets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206311398135">Daniels &amp; Bracker, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0149206311398135">Ramaswamy, 1993</xref>), and the number of countries within which a firm operates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0149206311398135">Kogut, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206311398135">Lu &amp; Beamish, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311398135">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0149206311398135">Tallman &amp; Li, 1996</xref>). Broadly speaking, these measures have fallen into two categories—geographic scale and geographic scope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0149206311398135">Thomas &amp; Eden, 2004</xref>). While <italic>geographic scale</italic> refers primarily to the depth of strategic focus of an organization’s international activities vis-à-vis its domestic activities, <italic>geographic scope</italic> refers to the breadth of an organization’s activities.</p>
<p>We measured geographic diversification as the total number of regions within which the charities operated. We used a measure that captures geographic scope rather than scale because our theoretical interest was to examine how greater geographic diversity impacts efficiency levels. While increases in geographic scale may simply be capturing greater strategic focus within a single foreign market, the use of a scope measure allows us to capture the increase in the number of different foreign markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311398135">Lu &amp; Beamish, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, our measure of geographic diversification was calculated at the regional rather than country level because scholars have begun to emphasize interregional rather than intraregional differences as more salient to issues of internationalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206311398135">Ghemawat, 2003</xref>; Qian, Khoury, Peng, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206311398135">Qian, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0149206311398135">Rugman &amp; Verbeke, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, geographic diversification was measured using 12 different global regions: (1) United States and Mexico; (2) Central America, Caribbean, and Antilles; (3) South America; (4) Western Europe; (5) Central and Eastern Europe; (6) Middle East; (7) South Asia; (8) China; (9) other Asian countries; (10) Eastern and Southern Africa; (11) Northern, Central, and Western Africa; (12) and Australia and Pacific.</p>

<title>Product diversification</title>
<p>The notion of product diversification in charitable organizations reflects the scope of social activities or causes rather than typical “product” categories. Our sample contains a wide array of charitable activities under the primary headings of social services (A), international aid (B), education and research (C), culture and arts (D), religion (E), health (F), environment (G), and community benefits (H). Additionally, our sample contains a host of subheadings under each primary category. For instance, under the primary heading of culture and arts (D) were museums, galleries, and concert halls (D1); festivals and performing groups (D2); art schools (D3); cultural centers (D4); and historical sites and heritage societies (D5).</p>
<p>Measures of diversification have taken several forms in previous research, including one-dimensional and multidimensional measures. However, the entropy measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206311398135">Jacquemin &amp; Berry, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0149206311398135">Palepu, 1985</xref>) provides a more fine-grained analysis that has been construct validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206311398135">Hoskisson, Hitt, Johnson, &amp; Moesel, 1993</xref>).

<p>where P<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the percentage of emphasis on activity <italic>i</italic>, and ln(1/P<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) represents the weight of each activity. By incorporating relative emphasis, the entropy measure is capable of capturing diversification beyond basic industry classifications. For instance, a charity that was engaged in only two different charitable activities but split 50% of its efforts on each would score higher on the entropy scale than one that was engaged in three different activities with 96% of its efforts on one activity and only 2% on each of the other two.</p>
<p>While prior studies have suggested that there is a high degree of correlation between the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206311398135">Jacquemin and Berry (1979)</xref> objective entropy measure and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0149206311398135">Rumelt (1974)</xref> subjective measure of relatedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206311398135">Baysinger &amp; Hoskisson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206311398135">Hoskisson et al., 1993</xref>), for statistical conclusion validity we conducted a correlation analysis on these two measures within our particular data set. The extent to which a charity’s diversification of activities was judged to be related versus unrelated was a factor of the degree to which the activities listed were included under one primary heading (i.e., A1, A3, and A6) versus under multiple primary headings (i.e., A1, B3, D5). Subsequently, we split the total number of charities in our entropy measure into two groups based on whether they were higher or lower than the midpoint of our measure. We then analyzed the degree to which charities in the lower half correlated with charities categorized as related and those in the upper half correlated with those categorized as unrelated. Our results indicated that those in the lower half correlated much more highly with related (.848, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) than unrelated (.341, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and those in the upper half correlated much more highly with unrelated (.401, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) than related (.215, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>

<title>Control variables</title>
<p>Previous work involving both for-profit corporations and charities has indicated that <italic>organizational size</italic> can significantly impact efficiency levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311398135">Geringer et al., 2000</xref>). Interestingly, charities have been shown in some cases to experience diseconomies of scale at much smaller sizes than for-profit corporations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0149206311398135">O’Regan &amp; Oster, 2000</xref>). Thus, we included the natural log of total assets as a control for organizational size.</p>
<p>We also included a control for the <italic>industry sector</italic> of charities as defined by its primary purpose. Previous studies have shown that different types of charities may experience differing levels of economies of scale and scope that would impact their relative importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206311398135">Callen et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, we created dummy variables based upon the industry that the charity focused the majority of its efforts in, with the choices including social services, international aid and development, education and research, culture and arts, religion, health, the environment, and community benefits.</p>
<p>A control for the extent of <italic>subcontractor monitoring</italic> was also used to account for the differences in charities’ attention to agency costs. While most charitable organizations operate directly in different geographical regions, there is a subset in our data that operates indirectly through local charities. Because our theoretical arguments refer to the transaction costs between the charity and potential donors in relation to diversification rather than downstream monitoring costs between the charity and its potential subcontractors, we wanted to control for this effect. In the forms charities must fill out, they are asked to report on the usage of seven possible subcontractor monitoring mechanisms for their international operations such as “receive a detailed breakdown of expenditures at least annually” and “give prior approval for the specific allocation of funds.” Thus, the total number of mechanisms was calculated for each charity to control for the extent of subcontractor monitoring efforts.</p>
<p>A control for <italic>cultural distance</italic> was also included in our analyses. Much of the extant international business research suggests national culture as a key variable influencing the relationship between geographic diversification and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311398135">Hennart &amp; Larimo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206311398135">Li, Lam, &amp; Qian, 2001</xref>). Because our geographic diversification arguments presented in this article are related more to strength of institutional environment rather than cultural heterogeneity, we included a control for cultural distance. The index developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0149206311398135">Kogut and Singh (1988)</xref> is the most frequently used measure of the cultural distance construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0149206311398135">Shenkar, 2001</xref>). For the purpose of this study, we calculated cultural distance based on the four original dimensions—PDI, IDV, MAS, and UAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0149206311398135">Hofstede, 1980</xref>). The fifth dimension of cultural distance, Long-Term Orientation, was not included in the analysis because too few scores of this dimension were available from the Hofstede index. The composite index was calculated as follows:</p>

<p>where <italic>i</italic> = cultural dimension (1-4 or PDI, IDV, MAS, UAI), <italic>j</italic> = country other than host country (Host country CANADA), and V = variance of the index of the <italic>i</italic>th dimension. We calculated regional scores using all the constituent countries for which information about their cultural dimension scores was available. If a charity worked in more than one region, average cultural distance was used.</p>
<p>A final control variable we included in our models was <italic>revenue shifting</italic>. Although many charities based in the northern hemisphere (i.e., the United States, Europe, and Canada) continue to receive the majority of their funding from government, a growing number are being forced to shift their donor bases as government funding decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206311398135">Boris, 1998</xref>). As a result, charities are increasingly looking to corporations, foundations, private individuals, and even commercial activities to fill this void. Important to our analyses, diversifying into different broad types of revenue sources can be accompanied by additional constraints and administrative costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206311398135">Grønbjerg, 1993</xref>). Because the theoretical arguments we make in this article relate to the increased transaction costs that arise from seeking out new donors in conjunction with diversification, we wanted to control for the natural shift that is taking place between donor types irrespective of diversification decisions. Therefore, we included a variable of revenue shifting as a control in our model by separating funding into three primary classes: private, government, and internal. An entropy score was then calculated to reflect both the existence of alternative types and the relative reliance of the charity on each of the potential types.</p>

<title>Instrumental variables</title>
<p>As prior research has shown, strategic choices related to both geographic and product diversification may not be completely exogenous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206311398135">Campa &amp; Kedia, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206311398135">Hamilton &amp; Nickerson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0149206311398135">Shaver, 1998</xref>). In such instances, a two-stage least squares approach using instrumental variables can be an effective method to address problems related to endogenous repressors, that is, when explanatory variables are correlated with the regression error term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206311398135">Bascle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206311398135">Baum, Schaffer, &amp; Stillman, 2007a</xref>). Under these circumstances, instrumental variables provide a way to obtain consistent parameter estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206311398135">Campa &amp; Kedia, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206311398135">Doukas, Kim, &amp; Pantzalis, 2005</xref>). In order to account for the potential endogeneity in our geographic and product diversification variables, we identified a number of instrumental variables that were correlated to our endogenous predictors but not correlated to our dependent variable. The instrumental variables were (1) board size, (2) number of non-arm’s-length board members, (3) amounts receivable from non-arm’s-length parties, (4) amounts payable to non-arm’s-length parties, (5) number of compensated positions, (6) international expenditures using a contracting approach, (7) international expenditures using a gift approach, (8) international expenditure using other approaches, and (9) quick ratio (please see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0149206311398135">Appendix A</xref> for a more detailed discussion of the theoretical rationale for selecting such variables as instruments).</p>

<title>Analysis and Results</title>
<sec id="section16-0149206311398135">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Our panel data were analyzed using an instrumental variable/two-stage least squares approach in Stata 11. We used the ivreg2 command, which is an extension of the Stata ivreg command created by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206311398135">Baum, Schaffer, and Stillman (2007b)</xref> for use with continuous dependent variables. The ivreg2 command automatically generates Sargan and Basman overidentification statistics, and its estimates are robust to the heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation common with panel data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206311398135">Bascle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206311398135">Baum et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0149206311398135">Sargan, 1958</xref>). The ivreg2 command also allows for linear and nonlinear models in a single framework, which is a key component of our hypotheses. Furthermore, this technique is especially useful in longitudinal studies where the dependent variable under study in any given year is highly correlated with the dependent variable in the prior year, thereby violating a fundamental assumption of traditional methodologies such as ordinary least squares or chi-square tests. This analytical approach thus allows researchers to examine “within” variable differences over time without biasing the results for highly correlated observations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0149206311398135">Appendix A</xref> outlines our step-by-step process for dealing with endogeneity concerns. For illustrative purposes, we present only the regression model with interaction terms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0149206311398135">Table A.1</xref>), but the same process was adopted for analyzing main effects. We also show the first-stage regressions using our instrumental variables for geographic and product diversification separately. The first-stage regressions of our nine instrumental variables indicate that all <italic>F</italic> values were above 10 on either geographic or product diversification (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0149206311398135">Tables A.1.1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0149206311398135">A.1.2</xref>), and the <italic>p</italic> values demonstrate that all instrumental variables were strongly associated with the endogeneous variables used in our analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206311398135">Hahn &amp; Hausman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0149206311398135">Staiger &amp; Stock, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0149206311398135">Table A.2</xref> presents our regression analysis corrected for endogeneity. As the Sargan statistic indicates (0.342, <italic>p</italic> value = .5589) the instrumental variables we included in our model are not themselves endogenous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206311398135">Baum et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0149206311398135">Sargan, 1958</xref>). Furthermore, the Pagan-Hall statistic (2.925, <italic>p</italic> value = .9982) indicates that there is no problem of heteroscedasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0149206311398135">Pagan &amp; Hall, 1983</xref>), and the Arellano-Bond statistic (1.88, <italic>p</italic> value = .06) suggests there is no statistical indication of autocorrelation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206311398135">Arellano &amp; Bond, 1991</xref>). However, as the Arellano-Bond statistic is only marginally greater than .05, we used the robust estimation option of the ivreg2 command to obtain final estimates robust to heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation.</p>

<p>Model 2 was subsequently constructed to test the main effects of geographic and product diversification on efficiency. Model 2 was analyzed using the ivreg2 command with robust estimates. A test for overall model fit indicates that the model is significant (<italic>F</italic> value = 450.71) at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 level. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206311398135">Table 3</xref> illustrates, the relationship between geographic diversification (squared) and efficiency is positive and statistically significant (β = 0.017, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), suggesting an overall U-shaped relationship. Thus, Hypothesis 1 is statistically supported. Model 2 also tests the main effect of product diversification on efficiency. The relationship between product diversification (squared) and efficiency is negative and statistically significant (β = −0.639, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), indicating an overall inverted U-shaped relationship. Thus, Hypothesis 2 is also supported.</p>
<p>Prior to testing the interaction hypothesis, the variables within the model were standardized. Yearwise comparisons also were examined for high variance inflation factors, but no scores of concern were found. It is important to stress the need to include all combinations of linear and quadratic terms within the model to ensure accurate results. Thus, the model contains not only multiplicative terms related to the individual linear terms and individual quadratic terms but also multiplicative terms with the range of linear terms multiplied by the quadratic terms. Model 3 indicates that the interaction effects of product diversification (squared) on the relationship between geographic diversification (squared) and efficiency is significant and negative (β = −0.112, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), which supports our assertion that the U-shaped main effect between geographic diversification and efficiency becomes downward sloping at unrelated levels of product diversification. Thus, Hypothesis 3 is statistically supported.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As our results indicate, the effects of diversification on efficiency in charitable organizations can be very complex. In terms of our main effect hypothesis of geographic diversification on efficiency in Model 2, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0149206311398135">Figure 1</xref> illustrates, while charities that expand into new geographic regions generally experience inefficiencies, as the organizations expand into a very high number of regions they achieve some positive efficiencies as compared to when they expand into a moderate number of regions. This finding supports our first main effect hypothesis that, when holding product diversification levels constant, charities initially experience inefficiencies when diversifying into new geographic regions, as they are forced to seek out new sources of donor capital in addition to building costly new, on-the-ground administrative structures and capabilities. However, at a very high number of geographic regions, charities can produce some improved efficiencies, as their now diverse network of donor sets and global brand, internationalization routines, and hierarchical structures built at earlier stages of internationalization can be more efficiently exploited. However, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0149206311398135">Figure 1</xref> suggests, the positive efficiencies obtained at a very high number of regions are still far below those of charities focused on only a low number of regions. Thus, when holding the level of product diversification constant, while diversifying into a high number of regions can produce some efficiencies as compared to diversifying into a moderate number of regions, expanding a charity’s international scope at any level appears less efficient than remaining focused on a single region.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0149206311398135-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Similarly, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0149206311398135">Figure 2</xref> illustrates, charities that diversify into new related services experience some initial positive efficiencies at very low levels but then very quickly become more inefficient at increasingly unrelated levels. This supports our second hypothesis that, when holding geographic diversification levels constant, charities are able to garner some increase in efficiency by leveraging existing sources of donor funding, internal routines, and structures when initially engaging in highly related levels of product diversification. However, engaging in moderately to highly unrelated types of product diversification leads to a decrease in efficiency as new donors, structures, and processes are similarly required to manage a more diverse scope of activities. However, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0149206311398135">Figure 2</xref> suggests, much like geographic diversification the upward slope in efficiency is minimal, and it quickly becomes downward sloping at most levels of product diversification. Thus, when holding the level of geographic diversification constant in Model 2, while diversifying into a highly related service may produce some minimal efficiency gains for charities, in large part the charities that remain much more focused produce significantly higher efficiencies than those that diversify into even moderately unrelated services.</p>

</fig>
<p>However, as Model 3 suggests, geographic and product diversification do not influence efficiency independently but, rather, act in combination with one another. Therefore, the main effects must be interpreted with caution given that the degree to which one type of diversification will impact efficiency is significantly dependent on the level of the other type of diversification. With regard to the moderating effect of product diversification on the relationship between geographic diversification and efficiency as expressed in Hypothesis 3, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0149206311398135">Figure 3</xref> suggests,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0149206311398135">1</xref></sup> the shape of the relationship differs depending on the level of product diversification. At more related levels of product diversification, the effect is U shaped while at unrelated levels, the effect is inverted U shaped. This inversion does suggest that the new donor linkages, routines, and structures that were developed to deal with the complexity that occurred through engaging in more unrelated levels of product diversification can be exploited by charities in their very early stages of diversifying into new geographic regions to minimize inefficiencies.</p>
<fig id="fig3-0149206311398135" position="float">

<p>Moderating Effect of Product Diversification on Geographic Diversification and Efficiency</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0149206311398135-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0149206311398135">Figure 3</xref> also illustrates that while charities that maintain related levels of product diversification follow a similar U-shaped curve as the main effect in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0149206311398135">Figure 1</xref>, at a very high number of geographic regions such charities are capable of producing similar efficiency levels as those that remained focused on a single region. Rather, it is only at more unrelated levels of product diversification that this curve is inverted and leads to rapidly increasing inefficiencies when combined with higher levels of geographic diversification. Thus, when allowing product diversification to vary rather than be held constant, our results suggest that charities may be able to expand into a large number of regions without significantly damaging efficiency levels. This distinction is particularly important for charities that are not simply trying to maximize efficiency but rather trying to maximize their “social bang” for their “financial buck.” Thus, being able to engage in a set of one or more related social activities in a high number of geographic regions without resulting in significant losses in efficiency levels allows charities to broaden their social reach without damaging their ability to elicit donor funds.</p>
<p>To garner a better understanding of the overall range of interaction effects between geographic and product diversification at a very practical level, we plotted our interaction results in a three-dimensional graph. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0149206311398135">Figure 4</xref> reveals, there is a large range of geographic and product diversification combinations that allows charities to deliver more than one social activity in more than one region without causing dramatic losses in efficiency. Generally speaking, charities can engage in low to moderate levels of one type of diversification without significantly harming efficiency so long as the other type of diversification is also at low to moderate levels. Additionally, charities can provide a highly unrelated set of activities without damaging efficiency as long as they remain focused on a single region and, similarly, can provide services to a very high number of regions as long as they remain focused on a single product. However, combinations in which the charity is focused on more unrelated products and a higher number of regions simultaneously do produce significant inefficiencies within charitable organizations, given the administrative strain to manage such complexity.</p>

</fig>
<p>Such findings not only provide prescriptive guidance for managers of charitable organizations but also make several contributions to organization theory in general. While prior research conducted by organizational theorists has suggested that the main effects of geographic diversification and product diversification on efficiency are very similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0149206311398135">Tallman &amp; Li, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0149206311398135">Wiersema &amp; Bowen, 2008</xref>), we propose that their main effects may follow very different patterns. While similar in our assertions that more disparate types of diversification often require new external resources, structures, and capabilities that cause inefficiencies within the organization, the levels at which these inefficiencies occur in product and geographic diversification can be very different. While even low levels of geographic diversification may represent the need for new resources, structures, and capabilities, related levels of product diversification may not. Thus, this contrasts the slightly upward and significantly downward sloping initial trends in the two types of diversification as main effects. However, while the expanded resource networks and experiences in geographic diversification eventually produce some small efficiencies at higher levels of internationalization, all but highly related levels of product diversification result in greater <italic>inefficiencies</italic>. It seems then, that while initially entering new product markets may represent lower costs and complexity than initially entering new geographic markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206311398135">Hitt et al., 1997</xref>), engaging in higher levels of product diversification represents more managerial complexity and internal transaction costs than operating in a higher number of geographic markets. While some prior research has suggested that very high levels of geographic diversification may produce similar inefficiencies within organizations, our post hoc test for an S-shaped curve as a type of “three-stage” model of internationalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311398135">Lu &amp; Beamish, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0149206311398135">Thomas &amp; Eden, 2004</xref>) proved nonsignificant (<italic>p</italic> = .266).</p>
<p>While charities and for-profit organizations possess similar mechanisms that would be expected to influence the curvature of these relationships—structural design, internal capabilities, and the nature of institutional environment—the charitable sector’s extreme dependency on donors as opposed to customers as the primary source of ongoing resources presents an additional external mechanism related to the transaction costs incurred with increased diversification activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206311398135">Froelich, 1999</xref>). Thus, in addition to similar costs associated with establishing new organizational structures, routines, and internal governance capabilities when engaging in diversification that is significantly different from the organization’s existing activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206311398135">Hitt et al., 2006</xref>), charities have the additional transaction costs of searching for and reporting to new donors, given the restricted discretion over donor funds and absence of accumulated earnings upon which to draw. Thus, while the mechanisms that have received the greatest amount of focus in the for-profit research domain on diversification revolve around internal capabilities to exploit potentially profitable opportunities, one of the most important mechanisms in the charitable sector is the external transaction costs.</p>
<p>While previous for-profit studies have incorporated transaction cost arguments to predict diversification outcomes such as diversification type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206311398135">Chatterjee &amp; Wenerfelt, 1991</xref>), vertical boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206311398135">Hennart, 1982</xref>), or horizontal boundaries based on internal capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206311398135">Hitt et al., 1997</xref>), the charitable context allows us to integrate resource dependency with transaction cost perspectives to understand how relationships with external actors underpin the relationship between diversification and efficiency. Although this additional external transaction cost mechanism is certainly much more prominent in charitable as opposed to for-profit organizations, there are certain types of for-profit organizations in which these mechanisms may play a larger role than discussed in prior diversification literature.</p>
<p>For instance, empirical studies of for-profit corporations that are small in size have similarly found support for a U-shaped relationship between geographic diversification and efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206311398135">Coviello &amp; McAuley, 1999</xref>). The existing rationale provided for this linkage is that smaller organizations are more likely to incur higher initial levels of liabilities of foreignness and newness, compared to larger organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206311398135">Lu &amp; Beamish, 2001</xref>), and like charitable organizations, much of the adaptation of smaller firms occurs during the geographic diversification process itself rather than through careful planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0149206311398135">Ruigrok &amp; Wagner, 2003</xref>). However, smaller organizations, much like charitable organizations, are also less likely to possess sufficiently large accumulated earnings with which to fund geographic diversification activities. As a result, the transaction costs associated with seeking out new external sources of financial capital for small, geographically diversifying firms from angel investors, venture capitalists, and so forth may also play a significant role as a theoretical mechanism underlying the empirically supported U-shaped relationship.</p>
<p>Furthermore, empirical studies of service-based for-profit organizations have also exhibited a U-shaped relationship as compared to manufacturing firms that diversify geographically, because, much like charities, service-based firms are more likely to establish expensive on-the-ground modes of internationalization as opposed to indirect modes such as licensing or export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206311398135">Capar &amp; Kotabe, 2003</xref>). Again, not only may engaging in more expensive modes of internationalization impact the efficiency of service-based firms by way of increased operating costs, as suggested in previous studies, but such firms may also be more likely to incur external transaction costs to raise the larger amount of financial capital required to engage in more direct modes of internationalization.</p>
<p>Our findings of an inverted U-shaped relationship between product diversification and efficiency are also somewhat similar to many organizational studies involving for-profit corporations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0149206311398135">Palich, Cardinal, &amp; Miller, 2000</xref>). However, much of the theoretical rationale provided for the initial increase in efficiency levels in the strategic management field has centered on the risk-mitigating properties of diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0149206311398135">Ramanujam &amp; Varadarajan, 1989</xref>). Charities, which are primarily driven to diversify into new activities for social reasons rather than for the mitigation of financial risk, are still able to achieve positive administrative efficiencies by engaging in related diversification. This suggests that the resource-based theoretical arguments related to product diversification remain valid even in the absence of the risk benefits put forth by portfolio theorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311398135">Lubatkin &amp; Chatterjee, 1994</xref>). However, it appears that in charities, as well as in for-profit corporations, the complexities of engaging in unrelated activities place overly high transaction costs and administrative burdens upon the organization.</p>
<p>Our results also contribute to the ongoing debate among organizational theorists regarding geographic and product diversification as complementary or contradictory activities when used in combination. With the exception of a handful of studies, very little research has been undertaken to contrast the theoretical rationale underlying the link between performance and these two types of diversification simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206311398135">Hitt et al., 2006</xref>). There have, however, been several empirical studies that have attempted to bridge the geographic and product divide to examine their joint effects on efficiency. While a subset of these studies has failed to find any statistical support for an interaction effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206311398135">Geringer et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311398135">Geringer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0149206311398135">Tallman &amp; Li, 1996</xref>), most can be grouped into two broad categories—those that find support for a positive interaction effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206311398135">Hitt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206311398135">Kim et al., 1989</xref>) and those that support a negative interaction effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206311398135">Doukas &amp; Lang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206311398135">Franko, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206311398135">Kumar, 2009</xref>). The theoretical arguments underpinning the “positive group” are that the structures erected for one type of diversification are leverageable by the other, and engaging in both types of diversification allows for even greater mitigation of risk. Arguments supporting the “negative group” are that the strain on the organization’s resources, such as absorptive capacity, caused by engaging in both types of diversification are too high, and the internal transaction costs and complexity of combined diversification is overwhelming to the firm’s managers. Again, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0149206311398135">Figure 3</xref> illustrates, increased levels of product diversification not only result in a changing of the U-shaped geographic diversification curve but in fact invert the curve at high levels of unrelated product diversification. Thus, while prior studies examining the interaction effects of geographic and product diversification have tended to fall into either the “positive complements” or the “negative substitutes” camp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206311398135">Kumar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0149206311398135">Wiersema &amp; Bowen, 2008</xref>), our study suggests that the effect can be both positive and negative depending on the specifics of their interaction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because for-profit organizations, compared to charitable organizations, tend to be more hierarchical and top-down in their decision-making structures and typically have more professionally trained managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206311398135">Crittenden &amp; Crittenden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0149206311398135">O’Regan &amp; Oster, 2000</xref>), we suggest that the complementarity of geographic and product diversification may be even greater in corporate firms. For-profit organizations also typically seek out more culturally similar and geographically proximate locations with strong institutional environments for international expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311398135">Austin et al., 2006</xref>) that would lessen the overall administrative burden when coincidentally engaging in product diversification. And of course the ability of for-profit organizations to rely upon internal financial resources or more discretionary sources of external capital would reduce the dual transaction costs that can exist when engaging in both geographic and product diversification. Thus, we would expect the complementarity of product and geographic diversification may be even greater in for-profit forms of organization.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Diversification has been a topic of intense scholarly debate for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0149206311398135">Wiersema &amp; Bowen, 2008</xref>). Although the majority of earlier work involving both product and geographic diversification focused exclusively on large, U.S.-based manufacturing corporations, the field, over time, has expanded to include different organizational sizes, industry classifications, and corporations headquartered in foreign countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311398135">Geringer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206311398135">Hitt et al., 2006</xref>). We have attempted to broaden the field even further by exploring diversification in the context of charitable organizations. The drivers of diversification, the location and product choices, and the level of resource dependency all differ from those of for-profit corporations, thereby providing a unique setting in which to explore the theoretical tenets regarding the link between diversification and efficiency.</p>
<p>While our study has attempted to make a significant contribution by examining diversification in the context of charitable organizations, we hope it will also spur a number of future research directions. Although efficiency is an increasingly important constraint on charitable scope, it is important to reemphasize that it is an incomplete measure of overall charitable performance. While efficiency as measured in our study provides an indication of the ability of charities to maximize program spending on charitable activities as opposed to fund-raising and administrative overhead, it provides very little information about the quality of social output being produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206311398135">Moore, 2000</xref>). Unfortunately, attempting to measure this aspect of charitable performance continues to be extremely problematic within the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206311398135">Herman &amp; Renz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0149206311398135">Sawhill &amp; Williamson, 2001</xref>) and is beyond the scope of our study as well. While researchers and practitioners alike continue to rely upon efficiency measures in their evaluations of charitable performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206311398135">Bennett &amp; Savani, 2003</xref>), we strongly encourage future studies to try to capture this elusive component and particularly its relationship to diversification activities.</p>
<p>As mentioned in our study, while there are a number of different types of nonprofit organizations such as trusts, private foundations, and cooperatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206311398135">Hall, 2006</xref>), the scope of our study was limited to charitable nonprofits. Future studies examining the variance in both diversification patterns and performance outcomes of different types of nonprofit organizations may further contribute to our knowledge of geographic and product diversification. In particular, studies involving nonprofit hospitals and educational institutions that rely on fee-for-service rather than donative revenue models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206311398135">Goodrick &amp; Salancik, 1996</xref>), as well as social enterprises as emerging organizational hybrids spanning the for-profit and nonprofit sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206311398135">Mair &amp; Marti, 2006</xref>), may be particularly interesting for bridging the intersectoral and intrasectoral domains.</p>
<p>Additionally, cross-sector partnerships between the charitable and for-profit sectors have been growing rapidly over the past two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0149206311398135">Selsky &amp; Parker, 2005</xref>). While many such partnerships represent only a loose association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206311398135">Austin, 2000</xref>), a number of them are much more strategic and involve instances of joint geographic and product diversification. For instance, many multinational corporations are increasingly interested in exploring base-of-the-pyramid market opportunities as new regions for economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0149206311398135">Prahalad, 2004</xref>). However, research has suggested that partnering with charities to enter least-developed markets may prove advantageous given their experience in operating within such institutional environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0149206311398135">Webb et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, many for-profit corporations, in their efforts at engaging in corporate social responsibility, are codeveloping new socially relevant products and services with the charitable sector as a means of achieving both financial and social gains. Thus, further integration of diversification research combining both the for-profit and nonprofit sectors could provide a great deal of theoretical and practical insight.</p>

<p><italic>Note</italic>: GD = geographic diversification; PD = product diversification. <italic>F</italic> value &gt; 10 indicates that the instrumental variables we used are strong.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<sec id="section21-0149206311398135">
<title>Logic for the Selection of Instrumental Variables</title>
<p>The following variables were selected as instrumental variables based on the logic provided below:</p>
<sec id="section22-0149206311398135">
<title>Board size</title>
<p>Charity board members are generally unpaid and thus do not represent direct administrative costs to the charity. They are also typically selected not for functional skills (i.e., accounting, marketing, etc.) but rather for their passion for social causes and willingness to serve. However, larger boards are more likely to represent a greater diversity of social interests, and thus a larger number of board members in positions of authority increase the direct likelihood of diversification into different social interests (either in different services or different geographic regions or both).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0149206311398135">
<title>Number of board members not at arm’s length with each other</title>
<p>Again, boards that have fewer members who are related to one another are most likely to represent a greater diversity in social interests. Such diversity would impact efficiency not necessarily directly but, rather, indirectly through the pursuit of more diversified activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0149206311398135">
<title>Amounts</title>
<p>receivable from individuals and organizations not at arm’s length from the charity</p>
<p>These are typically related parties who have committed to donating funds to the charity but have not yet deposited the funds. As opposed to this new donation changing efficiency levels of existing activities directly, it more likely indirectly impacts efficiency through diversification in that individuals or organizations are more likely to bring their own set of social interests, which if somewhat different from those of the initial group would result in increased levels of diversification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0149206311398135">
<title>Amounts payable to individuals and organizations not at arm’s length from the charity</title>
<p>Conversely to the above argument, these are related parties who are owed funds. While this may not directly influence efficiency levels, it may cause such related parties to become more financially interested in the organization and less risk averse in the pursuit of the charity diversifying into new activities before their funds are repaid. Thus, this may have a negative direct effect on diversification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0149206311398135">
<title>Number of compensated positions</title>
<p>A greater number of compensated positions does not necessarily mean that the organization is more or less efficient in terms of the direct relationship. As opposed to for-profit organizations, charities do not necessarily exhibit any economies-of-scale relationships with a greater number of employees. However, in echoing the above logic, a great number of compensated positions would indicate a greater financial investment on the part of organizational decision makers who may be more inclined to avoid increased diversification at the risk of having their compensation negatively affected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0149206311398135">
<title>Funding through international contracts</title>
<p>While most charities diversify internationally through on-the-ground efforts, there remains a portion that contract indirectly through local charities. As such, this funding serves more as a flow-through mechanism and would not be expected to significantly impact efficiency directly. However, operating such contracts may increase the likelihood, through exposure, of the charity diversifying directly into the region in the future.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0149206311398135">
<title>Funding through international gifts</title>
<p>Similar to the arguments above, such transactions are a more flow-through mechanism that would be expected to have minimal effects on efficiency but significant effects on the likelihood of direct diversification by the charity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-0149206311398135">
<title>Funding through other international means</title>
<p>Again, this variable covers the remaining category of charities in the data that are indirectly involved in international activities that would be more likely to significantly impact diversification than have a significant direct effect on efficiency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-0149206311398135">
<title>Quick ratio</title>
<p>The quick ratio (current assets minus current liabilities) represents a charity’s ability to immediately retire its debts. While we would not expect this balance sheet effect to have a strong direct effect on how efficiently the organization performs from a gain and loss perspective, it is likely to affect the likelihood of diversification if the organization is facing bankruptcy pressures. However, we feel that this is a different effect than the broader measure of organizational slack, given that quick ratio is a measure of short-term liquidity while organizational slack is a much broader measure of asset underutilization, which would be related to the long-term impacts of diversifying into new products or geographic regions.</p>
