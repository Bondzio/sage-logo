<abstract>
<p><italic>Mimosa pudica</italic> (Linn.) (<italic>M. pudica</italic> L.) is a plant used in some countries to treat anxiety and depression. In the present study we investigated the effects of an aqueous extract of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. on mouse anxiety-like behaviour using the elevated T maze, and on regulation of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neuronal activity using an in-vitro mouse brain slice preparation. Acute treatment with <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. extract had an anxiolytic effect on behaviour in the elevated T maze, specifically on inhibitory avoidance behaviour. Acute application of the extract alone had no effect on the activity of DRN 5-HT neurones. However, when co-applied with the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist THIP (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-<italic>c</italic>]pyridin-3-ol), the extract enhanced the inhibitory effect of the THIP on DRN 5-HT neurones. These observed effects of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. on both behaviour and GABA modulation of 5-HT neuronal activity are similar to the effects of diazepam, the established anxiolytic and positive modulator of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor. This study suggests that the aqueous extract of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. contains a positive modulator of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor function and provides impetus for further investigation of the neuropharmacologically active constituents of the extract.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Mimosa pudica</italic> (Linn.) (<italic>M. pudica</italic> L.) is a species of plant belonging to the family Fabaceae, which is common to moist ground in tropical areas across the world. Extracts of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. are reportedly used in traditional medicine in Africa, South America, and Asia to treat a wide variety of human diseases. In Mexico, aqueous extracts from dried leaves of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. are used to treat depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881111398686">Del Amo, 1979</xref>). In Cameroon, a similarly prepared aqueous extract of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. is used both acutely and chronically to treat a variety of problems including headaches (migraine), insomnia and, most commonly, anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>Despite the widespread use of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. there is very little known about the neuroactive substances it contains and the neurobiological substrates targeted. That said, the anecdotal evidence of its efficacy in the treatment of anxiety and depression does suggest that certain neurotransmitter systems may be targeted. Thus, the neurobiologies of anxiety and depression involve a number of different neurotransmitter systems and brain areas. Neuroimaging studies in patients with anxiety and depression indicate abnormalities of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111398686">Akimova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881111398686">Drevets et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, whilst the role of 5-HT in anxiety and depression is unclear, disruption of 5-HT neurotransmission in humans (tryptophan depletion) as well as rodents (5-HT lesions and 5-HT depleting drugs) has been shown to change the profile of anxiety and to produce depressive-like behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111398686">Akimova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881111398686">Faria et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881111398686">Ludwig and Schwarting, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881111398686">Sena et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881111398686">Tonissaar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881111398686">van Veen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881111398686">Young et al,. 1988</xref>). Finally, serotonergic drugs (e.g. the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) have proven efficacy in the treatment of anxiety and depression. A second transmitter system which may be the target of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. is the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system. GABA has an established role in anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881111398686">Kalueff and Nutt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881111398686">Malizia et al., 1998</xref>), and enhancers of GABA function are amongst the most effective anxiolytics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881111398686">Nash and Nutt, 2005</xref>). More recently, GABA has also been postulated to play a role in depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881111398686">Gao and Bao, 2011</xref>). Thus, 5-HT and GABA neurotransmitter systems are potential candidate targets for <italic>M. pudica</italic> L.</p>
<p>5-HT neurones projecting to the forebrain originate largely from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and median raphe nucleus (MRN) of the midbrain. The dorsal raphe nucleus is the larger of the nuclei and activity of 5-HT neurones in the DRN has been shown to be closely coupled to 5-HT release and 5-HT neuronal transmission in the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881111398686">McQuade and Sharp, 1995</xref>). DRN 5-HT neurones express a number of regulatory receptors; these include excitatory α<sub>1</sub>-noradrenergic (the main tonic driver of 5-HT neurones), and inhibitory GABA<sub>A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors, and are sensitive to a number of ligands with affinity for these receptors and anxiolytic drugs such as benzodiazepines, SSRIs and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881111398686">Gallager, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881111398686">Hajós et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881111398686">Judge and Gartside, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we investigate the effects of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. on anxiety-like behaviour in mice and on the firing activity of 5-HT neurones and their regulation by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Thus, we use an in-vitro mouse brain slice preparation to investigate the effect of an aqueous extract of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. on DRN 5-HT neuronal activity and use the elevated T maze (ETM) to investigate effects on mouse anxiety-like behaviour. We believe that the results of the study may help to identify novel modulators of 5-HT neurotransmission, which may ultimately be exploited therapeutically.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Adult Male C57/BL6 mice (27–33 g) (Charles Rivers, UK) were maintained under a normal 12-h light cycle (lights on 250 lux, 07:00) in a temperature/humidity-controlled environment (23 ± 1°C/55 ± 5%). Food and water were provided ad libitum before and during behavioural experiments. Animals were housed in groups of up to eight. All procedures were carried out in accordance with the <italic>UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986</italic>.</p>

<title>Mimosa pudica L. extract preparation and drug administration</title>
<p>Fresh plants of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. were collected from Oliga neighbourhood in Yaoundé (Cameroon), and dried in a shade room for 1 month before being powdered (as per traditional practice for the plant’s use in Cameroon).</p>
<p>For extraction, 30 g of powder was dissolved in 1 litre of purified water and heated to boiling with stirring. After cooling the mixture was centrifuged and filtered. The aqueous filtrate was freeze-dried and produced 1.95 g of dried material (yield 6.5%).</p>
<sec id="section5-0269881111398686">
<title>Behavioural study</title>
<p>All drugs were prepared on the day of experiment and administered intraperitoneally in a volume of 10 ml/kg, 30 minutes before testing on the ETM. <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. was administered at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg (of dried extract) in distilled water. Diazepam (Sigma) was administered at the dose of 1 mg/kg in distilled water. Control mice received water vehicle.</p>

<title>Elevated T maze</title>
<sec id="section8-0269881111398686">
<title>Apparatus</title>
<p>The apparatus used in this work is similar to those previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881111398686">Graeff et al. (1993)</xref>. The ETM was made of wood, and had three arms of equal dimensions (50 cm × 12 cm). One arm, enclosed by walls 40 cm high, was perpendicular to two opposed open arms. The whole apparatus was elevated 1 m above the floor and was placed in a small, closed room with an illumination of 500 lux. The experiments were performed with an observer inside the experimental room and were video recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0269881111398686">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The experiments were carried out in two successive steps within 2 days.</p>
<p>On day 1 (24 hours before the test) each animal was individually exposes to the open arms for 30 min (enclosed arm access was restricted by a barrier). This modification was introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881111398686">Teixeira et al. (2000)</xref> and used to reduce the influence of exploratory activity.</p>
<p>On day 2 the mice were administered the drugs, <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. (test group), diazepam, or distilled water (control group) and 30 minutes later exposed to the maze under the following protocols.</p>
<sec id="section10-0269881111398686">
<title>Inhibitory avoidance protocol</title>
<p>The mouse was placed at the distal end of the enclosed arm of the maze and the time taken to enter one of the open arms was recorded. There was a cut-off time of 300 s on the enclosed arm of the maze, after which the mouse was removed to its home cage. Once the mouse entered the open arm (or 300 s had elapsed) it was removed from the maze and placed back in its home cage for 60 s before the next trial. These trials were repeated until the mouse had experienced three successive trials. Between trials the apparatus was cleaned with alcohol.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269881111398686">
<title>Escape protocol</title>
<p>Sixty seconds after the last inhibitory avoidance trial, the mouse was placed at the distal end of one of two open arms, and the time taken to leave this arm was recorded. Once the mouse had left the open arm (again with a cut-off time of 300 s) it was removed from the maze.</p>

<title>In-vitro electrophysiology</title>
<sec id="section13-0269881111398686">
<title>Slice preparation and recording procedure</title>
<p>Electrophysiology experiments were carried out on different (drug and maze naive) groups of mice. On the morning of the experiment the animal was removed from its home cage and killed by cervical dislocation, and the brain rapidly removed and placed in oxygenated sucrose slush containing in millimoles: sucrose 200, HEPES 10, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 7, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.2, KCL 2.5, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 2.5, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5, <sc>d</sc>-glucose 10, pH 7.4. The caudal portion of the brain was then mounted on a block using cyanoacrylate glue and submerged in oxygenated ice cold sucrose slush in the chamber of a Vibratome. Coronal sections 350 µm thick containing the DRN were collected and mounted on a piece of lens tissue in an interface perfusion chamber, and perfused with oxygenated aCSF. PE (3 µM) was added to the perfusion medium to induce firing of 5-HT neurones. The perfusion chamber and aCSF were maintained at 36°C.</p>
<p>Extracellular recordings were made from presumed 5-HT neurones in the DRN with a glass electrode (1.5 mm OD; 1–3 MΩ impedance), filled with 2 M NaCl. The signal was passed through a 150–14,500 Hz band-pass AC differential amplifier (×1000) into a PC via a micro1401 (CED, Cambridge, UK) digital interface. A pulse discriminator (CED, Cambridge, UK) was used to facilitate the discrimination of single units and data were recorded using Spike2 software (version 4, CED, Cambridge, UK). 5-HT neurones were selected on criteria previously used in studies on rats, that is, their firing rate (slow 1–4 Hz regular rate), shape (broad biphasic or triphasic action potential) and their sensitivity to inhibition by perfusion of exogenous 5-HT. Initially, 5-HT (25 or 50 µm) was applied to all neurones recorded to confirm sensitivity to inhibition by exogenous 5-HT. Neurones not inhibited by 5-HT were not studied further. Drugs when given alone were applied for 2 min with a minimum of a 2 min wash-out between applications. When testing for enhancement of the THIP response, diazepam and <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. were applied for 3 min before and 2 min during THIP application.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0269881111398686">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>For ETM, the latencies to leave the enclosed arm (avoidance) were statistically analysed by two-way (trial number and treatment) analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc one-way ANOVA and least squares difference (LSD) tests. The latency to leave the open arm (escape) was analysed by one way ANOVA and post-hoc LSD test. Data are presented as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM).</p>
<p>For electrophysiology, data were analysed offline from the firing rate data collected on Spike 2, and neuronal activity presented in the form of firing rate histograms. The number of spikes in the 2 min immediately before drug application was used as a measure of baseline activity (basal firing rate). The number of spikes in the 2 min during drug perfusion was used as a measure of drug response. Basal and drug response firing rates were then compared. The change in firing was calculated as the difference between the basal firing rate and the firing rate during the application of drug, and expressed as a percentage of basal firing rate. Responses in the absence and presence of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L., THIP, diazepam, NMDA and AMPA were compared. The dose responses to <italic>M. pudica</italic> L., and THIP, NMDA and AMPA were analysed by one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Dunnett <italic>t</italic>-test (comparing to basal firing). The effect of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. and diazepam on the THIP response was analysed by paired <italic>t</italic>-test. All reported values are mean values ± SEM.</p>

<title>Basal firing rate and effect of 5-HT</title>
<p>During the course of the study, 40 presumed 5-HT neurones from 27 animals were recorded and analysed. The mean basal firing rate of these neurones (in the presence of 3 µM PE) was 1.60 ± 0.13 Hz (which varied between a minimum basal firing rate of 0.26 Hz and a maximum basal firing rate of 4.16 Hz) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269881111398686">Figure 3</xref>). The percentage coefficient of variation of the interspike interval for these neurones ranged from 9% to 49% (mean 23%), indicating that the neurones fired in a regular pattern.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study we have shown that an aqueous extract of leaves of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L., a plant used in some countries to treat depression and anxiety, is anxiolytic in the mouse and also enhances GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated inhibition of 5-HT neurones in the DRN. In the behavioural studies, the ETM was used to examine two different behavioural parameters: inhibitory avoidance and escape response. Inhibitory avoidance, or the time taken to leave the closed arm of the ETM, is proposed to be a measure of generalized anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111398686">Graeff et al., 1998</xref>). Escape response, or time to leave the open arm of the ETM is proposed to be a measure of panic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111398686">Graeff et al., 1998</xref>). <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. appeared to have an anxiolytic effect on mouse behaviour in the ETM. Thus, in mice pretreated with <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. and exposed to the ETM, inhibitory avoidance latencies were decreased. However, escape latencies were unchanged. The studies using the in-vitro brain slice preparation to investigate some of the neurobiological effects of the extract revealed that whilst <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. applied alone had no effect on the firing activity of 5-HT neurones in the DRN, when co-applied with a GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist, <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. enhanced the GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated inhibition of these neurones.</p>
<p>As described above, the ETM was developed as an experimental tool with which to quantify underlying levels of anxiety in rodent models and also quantify effects of anxiolytic and anxiogenic treatments. In particular it was designed to model and differentiate between generalized anxiety disorders and panic disorder. To date the ETM has been used extensively in studies using rats, but there are fewer studies using this model in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881111398686">Carvalho-Netto and Nunes-de-Souza, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881111398686">Gomes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881111398686">Jardim et al., 1999</xref>). In the present study we measured avoidance over three consecutive trials and escape over a single trial. Importantly, we found that the mice acquired inhibitory avoidance over the three trials as evidenced by the increase in latency to leave the closed arm with consecutive trials. Although, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881111398686">Jardim et al. (1999)</xref> showed no inhibitory avoidance acquisition over three trials and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881111398686">Carvalho-Netto and Nunes-de-Souza (2004)</xref> found that at least five trials were required in order to acquire inhibitory avoidance, our protocol differed from theirs. Thus, we pre-exposed the mice to the open arm of the maze 24 hours before testing in an attempt to increase the development of avoidance behaviour. This pre-exposure has previously been employed in the ETM in rats in order to increase the sensitivity of the escape task to pharmacological manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881111398686">Teixeira et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study we found that acute treatment with <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. decreased the latency to leave the enclosed arm, suggesting the impairment of inhibitory avoidance. This effect was evident at the lower dose tested and there was a similar (though non-significant) trend at the higher dose. <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. did not affect the latency to leave the open arm of the ETM at either of the doses tested. For comparison we examined the effects of an established anxiolytic, the benzodiazepine diazepam. Diazepam decreased avoidance latencies in all three trials and like <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. did not affect escape latencies. This finding is consistent with previous studies which demonstrated that diazepam selectively impairs inhibitory avoidance acquisition in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881111398686">Graeff et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881111398686">Viana et al., 1994</xref>), and also indicates that the ETM of the dimensions used in this study is sensitive to detecting anxiolytic effects in mice. This profile of activity in the ETM is shared by other anxiolytic drugs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111398686">Graeff et al., 1998</xref> for a review). One exception to this is the SSRI fluoxetine, which when given to mice acutely decreased and increased inhibitory avoidance and escape latency, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881111398686">Gomes et al., 2009</xref>). However, to date the ETM has been used largely for the study of anxiety in rats and not in mice. Indeed its effectiveness in discriminating between avoidance behaviour and escape behaviour in mice has been questioned. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881111398686">Carvalho-Netto and Nunes-de-Souza (2004)</xref> reported that whilst the ETM appeared to be useful for studying inhibitory avoidance in mice, it was less useful in studying escape responses and, in fact, escape responses in mice were not sensitive to anxiogenic drugs. Therefore, in the present study the results of the escape component of the protocol should be interpreted with caution. This said, the unchanged escape latency does indicate that it is unlikely that the decreased avoidance latency is due to a simple locomotor effect of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. Thus, if <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. were affecting locomotor activity, escape latency would also be decreased.</p>
<p>It is not clear why <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. at the higher dose did not significantly affect avoidance latencies but one possibility is that at the higher dose substances within the <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. extract are counteracting any anxiolytic effects seen at lower doses. Given the hypothesis that inhibitory avoidance of the open arms (representing learned fear) models generalized anxiety, our data support the use of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. in the treatment of generalized anxiety. One caveat, however, is possible toxic effects of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. Whilst there are no reports <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. causing toxicity in humans, mimosine, a known ingredient of <italic>M. pudica</italic>, has been reported to cause toxicity in some agricultural animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881111398686">Hammond, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we also determined the effect of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. on the firing activity, and regulation of firing activity, of presumed 5-HT neurones in the DRN, using an in-vitro slice preparation. In the presence of the α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoreceptor agonist PE, putative 5-HT neurones in the DRN were selected on the basis of their firing rate (0.5–3.5 Hz), their biphasic action potential of 2–3 ms in duration, slow regular pattern of discharge, and sensitivity to exogenous applied 5-HT. These criteria were based on previous studies in the rat in which it has been long established that 5-HT neurones in the DRN are excited by α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoreceptor agonists and inhibited by 5-HT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881111398686">Aghajanian and Wang, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881111398686">Aghajanian et al., 1987</xref>), as well as more recent reports showing similar characteristics for DRN 5-HT neurones in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881111398686">Blier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881111398686">El Yacoubi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881111398686">Gobbi et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, the concentration range in which 5-HT inhibited the neurones in the mouse was very similar to that previously observed in the rat (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881111398686">Gartside et al., 2007</xref>). Here in addition we showed that the firing activity of the mouse 5-HT neurones is increased by application of both NMDA and AMPA and decreased by the GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist THIP. Again, this is consistent with studies in the rat DRN, in which we have previously shown NMDA, AMPA and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor regulation of 5-HT DRN neurones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881111398686">Gartside et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881111398686">Judge et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The benzodiazepines are one of the main classes of anxiolytics in therapeutic use. These drugs are positive modulators of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor which enhances the GABAergic effects of direct receptor agonists by binding to a distinct site, the so-called benzodiazepine binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881111398686">Choi et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881111398686">Macdonald and Barker 1978</xref>). Another important class of anxiolytic drugs is the azapirones (e.g. buspirone, gespirone and ipsapirone). These drugs possess affinity for the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor and have been shown to decrease 5-HT neuronal firing activity, presumably via the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881111398686">Sprouse and Aghajanian, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881111398686">Trulson and Trulson, 1986</xref>). Indeed it has been proposed that they may in part owe their therapeutic activity to stimulation of the somatodendritic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881111398686">Leonard, 1992</xref>). As noted above, in the 5-HT neurones in the DRN, application of exogenous 5-HT or THIP decreased the firing rate. The inhibitory effect of 5-HT is mediated via the somatodendritic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881111398686">Aghajanian and Lakoski, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881111398686">Blier et al., 2004</xref>) whilst the THIP response is mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881111398686">Judge et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether an extract of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. has either 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> or GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated effects, we investigated its effect on the firing rate of 5-HT neurones in the DRN. When given alone, <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. extract had no effect on the basal 5-HT neuronal firing rate, suggesting that it is unlikely that the extract contained a 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor agonist or a direct GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist. However, our studies do suggest that the <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. extract contains a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-positive modulator. Thus when the <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. extract was applied in combination with the GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist THIP, the inhibitory effect of THIP was enhanced. The effect of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. was concentration dependent and at the higher concentration tested amounted to a 100% enhancement of the effect of THIP. For comparison, we showed a similar enhancement of the THIP-induced inhibition with diazepam, the established GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-positive modulator and anxiolytic.</p>
<p>The presence of GABAergic interneurones within the DRN is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881111398686">Gamrani et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881111398686">Wang et al., 1992</xref>) and the identification of GABAergic inputs into the DRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881111398686">Gervasoni et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881111398686">Kirouac et al., 2004</xref>) suggest that GABA plays a key role in the regulation of DRN 5-HT neuronal activity. The results of this part of the study indicate that, similar to classical benzodiazepines, an aqueous extract of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. is capable of facilitating GABAergic transmission in the mouse DRN and potentially elsewhere in the brain. The observation that the <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. extract had effects on its own in the behavioural study but only had effects when combined with the GABA<sub>A</sub> agonist in the in-vitro electrophysiology study, most likely reflects a difference in endogenous GABAergic tone between the in-vivo and in-vitro preparations.</p>
<p>From the results of the present study it is not possible to determine whether the <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. modulation of GABAergic regulation of 5-HT activity does contribute to its anxiolytic effect. However, given the important role that DRN 5-HT projections play in anxiety behaviours it could be speculated that effects on 5-HT neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex, amygdala and periaquaductal grey may be involved in any anxiolytic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881111398686">Deakin and Graeff, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881111398686">Lanzenberger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881111398686">Nash et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study the <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. extract was prepared by boiling a preparation of water and dried leaves of the plant. This is similar to the means of preparation of the plant for its therapeutic use in both Mexico and Cameroon. The process of freeze drying the aqueous solution, whilst not carried out in its traditional use, is an important step in this study in order to standardize doses and concentrations used. The main outcomes of the study, the findings that <italic>M. pudica</italic> L. does indeed possess anxiolytic effects in mice and identifications of a possible neurobiological substrate for these anxiolytic effects (GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulation), provide impetus for further detailed studies of the neuropharmacological active constituents of <italic>M. pudica</italic> L.</p>
