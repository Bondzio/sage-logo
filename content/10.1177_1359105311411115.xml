<abstract>
<p>Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 spousal caregivers to people with a traumatic spinal cord injury and were subjected to interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Here, we present two inter-related master themes: (1) coping with the spousal caregiver role; and (2) putting the pieces back together again. Within these, the analysis describes how regular venting of emotion, social support and focusing on the positive aspects of the situation all promoted coping. Adjustment was reportedly hindered by the introduction of paid caregivers as this represented a loss of privacy and power for the participants. The findings are discussed in relation to the wider literature and recommendations for future caregiver support are highlighted.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) has a profound impact not only on the injured individual themselves, but also on their family members’ lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311411115">Gill, 1999</xref>). Partner caregivers generally experience significant distress, family strain and social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105311411115">Vargo et al., 1987</xref>) in addition to role overload, financial strain, changes in health status and emotional difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311411115">Donelan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105311411115">Vitaliano et al., 2003</xref>). Partner caregivers to individuals with SCI also experience a profound sense of loss, emptiness, grief and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311411115">Dickson et al., 2010</xref>). Despite such findings, there still remains a dearth of qualitative literature which focuses specifically on the lived experience of adjustment to, and efforts to cope with, the unanticipated partner caregiver role in SCI.</p>
<p>This is surprising when it has been acknowledged that caregiver health and well-being are essential for the injured individual’s quality of life and for the SCI service provision system as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311411115">Elliott and Shewchuk, 1998</xref>). In SCI, it is often the family or spouse who becomes the primary caregiver to the injured individual and they therefore take on the responsibility of providing care in terms of dressing, feeding, facilitating transfers and bowel and bladder care. As such, spousal caregivers ultimately influence the ability of the injured person to remain at home. However, spousal caregivers are consequentially vulnerable to ‘burnout syndrome’, where they commonly experience stress, depressive symptoms and a reduction in life satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311411115">Grant et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311411115">Meade et al., 2004</xref>). With ongoing cuts to UK health budgets and a reduction in the length of stay in hospital, such caregiver responsibilities (and burden) are only likely to increase.</p>
<p>The current focus of caregiver literature has tended to centre on caregiving in degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s Disease or dementia and less on SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311411115">Christy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311411115">Mcintyre and Cole, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311411115">Roepke et al., 2010</xref>). The former entail a distinct illness/caring trajectory, characterized by the gradual erosion of the sufferer’s personhood and the constant negotiation of the caring relationship. In contrast, in SCI, a different illness trajectory exists. It is not characterized by degeneration and usually spans a far longer period. Thus it is proposed that the ongoing and indefinite nature of the spousal caregiver role in SCI (where the patient has a minimal reduction in life expectancy) will create a different experience than for other caregiver groups.</p>
<p>A number of factors have been found to be associated with adjustment outcomes in caregivers, namely coping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311411115">Buckelew et al., 1991</xref>); locus of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311411115">Frank and Elliott, 1989</xref>) and social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311411115">Stambrook et al., 1991</xref>). Social support, for example, has been found to be key for maintaining caregiver well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311411115">Sawatzky and Fowler-Kerry, 2003</xref>). Social support reduces feelings of social isolation (normalizing caregiver experiences) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105311411115">Toseland and Rossiter, 1989</xref>) and reduces stress appraisal, depression and burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311411115">Charlifue, 2004</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311411115">Chwalisz (1996)</xref> proposed that caregiver coping strategies may be a better predictor of caregiver adjustment than social support.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311411115">Folkman and Moskowitz (2000)</xref> propose that positive re-appraisal, problem-focused coping and finding meaning through positive events all reduce caregiver stress and facilitate coping. Other researchers have found that focusing on the positive aspects of the situation (e.g. increased patience, pride and competence) promotes coping by minimizing depression and burnout and promoting a sense of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311411115">Kurz and Cavanaugh, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105311411115">Veltman et al., 2002</xref>). Finding some ‘time for oneself’ has also been found to increase caregiver coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311411115">Sawatzky and Fowler-Kerry, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, despite the current literature highlighting the devastating impact of assuming the caregiver role, it has tended to be both quantitative in nature and has focused on degenerative conditions. The literature has also overlooked the lived experience of the caregiver role. Hence, the central focus of this study is the spousal caregiver’s lived experience of being a primary caregiver to an individual with a SCI. The aim was to recruit a broadly speaking homogenous sample and explore the experience of being a caregiver for someone with SCI.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1359105311411115">
<title>Sampling</title>
<p>Eleven spousal caregivers of individuals with an acquired traumatic SCI were recruited via the Queen Elizabeth National Spinal Injuries Unit for Scotland (QENSIUS), Southern General Hospital, Glasgow (<italic>n</italic> = 4) or via an advert published in <italic>Spinal Injuries Scotland</italic>’s (SIS) magazine/website (<italic>n</italic> = 7). Although we recruited ‘partner caregivers’, all 11 participants were spouses to people with SCI and therefore, we use the term ‘spousal caregiver’ throughout the article. The second author’s contact details were provided in order for interviews to be arranged with willing participants.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria were that participants should be adults between the ages of 18 and 75 years who had been: (a) the partner of a patient with an acquired, traumatic SCI which occurred at least a year prior to the injury; and (b) who had been in the caregiver role for at least two years. The time since acquiring the caregiver role ranged from two to 12 years (mean = 6.5 years). Participants were aged between 34 and 66 years (mean = 51.4 years). Participants were 10 females and one male. Participants varied in socio-economic status and were from various geographical locations in Scotland. Of the participants, three were employed at the time of interview, two of which were employed part-time.</p>
<p>The interviews were conducted by the first author (<italic>n</italic> = 2), the second author (<italic>n</italic> = 6) and the third author (<italic>n</italic> = 3). Interviews took place either in a private room within the QENSIUS (<italic>n</italic> = 1) or in the participant’s own home (<italic>n</italic> = 10), depending on which was most convenient for the participant. The interviews lasted for approximately one hour and were recorded on a digital voice recorder. Travel expenses were reimbursed for the one participant who travelled to the QENSIUS for the interview to commence. The person with SCI was not present at any of the caregiver interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1359105311411115">
<title>Procedure and interview</title>
<p>NHS ethical approval was obtained prior to the commencement of the study. An interview schedule was designed prior to the interviews and comprised of open-ended, non-directive questions such as ‘Tell me about your experience of being a partner caregiver to an individual with a SCI’ and ‘In what ways (if at all) has your life changed since you became a partner caregiver?’ A process of reflecting and probing was adopted (e.g. ‘You said there that … tell me more about that’) to ensure that each participant directed the content of their interview. The researchers requested clarification at times to ensure that they were interpreting the participants’ accounts appropriately. Interviews were subsequently transcribed verbatim and were subjected to interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1359105311411115">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The second author conducted the analysis, but it was validated by the first and fourth author, particularly at the point of coding of themes and interpretation. This is in accordance with guidelines by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105311411115">Smith and Osborn (2003)</xref>. The process of analysis involved a number of key stages (as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311411115">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). The extracts presented here have been chosen because they capture the very essence of the theme. For more detail on IPA, refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311411115">Smith (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105311411115">Smith and Osborn (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311411115">Smith et al. (2009)</xref>.</p>
<p>This article presents two inter-related master themes: (1) coping with the spousal caregiver role; and (2) putting the pieces back together again. It is noteworthy that in the extracts which follow, (.) denotes at least one second of pause and (…) represents missing text.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>This article concentrates on the process of adjusting to a new, unfamiliar life as a caregiver and the coping strategies that the participants employed to help deal with their new ‘career’. The term ‘adjustment’ refers to the process of adjusting roles and living circumstances to fit better with caregiver demands and the term ‘adaptation’ refers to changes in function, circumstances and behaviours to improve quality of life in the new caregiver role. We begin by presenting at the micro-level, the particular coping strategies employed by the participants and then move on to consider the wider context (or more macro-process) of adjustment to the spousal caregiver role.</p>
<sec id="section7-1359105311411115">
<title>Coping with the spousal caregiver role</title>
<p>A number of strategies to help participants cope with the demands of the caregiver role were reported on a day-to-day basis. They ranged from the venting of emotions, to relying on support from others to time out and focusing on the positive aspects of the situation. These strategies will now be discussed in turn.</p>
<sec id="section8-1359105311411115">
<title>Venting emotion</title>
<p>Many participants reported a need to vent their frustrations, to ‘rant and rave’ and to ‘let it out’:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If there’s anything I’ve learnt it’s that if I am feeling frustrated, angry, or depressed I can’t keep it to myself … That’s the worst thing you can do. It really is, because it doesn’t go away, it just festers. Well, in me anyway and it festers until I explode and get it all out. I mean I can explode and have a crying fit that lasts all morning, say for three hours but then that’s it. It’s gone and you are completely drained for a while and then you think ‘that’s it, I’ll pick myself up’ and go until the next thing, the next time it happens and it does happen. Not frequently but it does happen, less now than it used to. (Megan)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Megan, the release of pent-up caregiver frustrations is essential for her well-being. There is a sense here that she is highly volatile at times; as though she were a bomb waiting to be detonated. This catharsis emphasizes the emotional burden that the partner caregiver experiences. Over time, Megan has learned how to manage this pent-up frustration. Her constant use of the personal pronoun (‘I’) perhaps reinforces the personal benefit of this strategy – that it works for <italic>her</italic> but might not necessarily be the same for others. It might also suggest a sense of personal responsibility, self-efficacy or mastery of her ability to cope with her role.</p>
<p>While Megan openly vented her emotions, a few of the participants reported doing this more privately. This was partly to protect the injured person from observing their distress but was also because they did not want to acknowledge to other people that they were struggling to cope at times: ‘I cried, but never in front of anybody else, only in the bedroom, on my own’ (Rose). Despite a number of strategies facilitating coping on a day-to-day basis, it appears that at times, coping with SCI seems an insurmountable task for the spousal caregiver.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1359105311411115">
<title>‘Time out’</title>
<p>Many of the participants reported keeping busy (which served as a distraction from caregiver burden) and taking each day as it comes as being important for both adjustment and coping. ‘Time out’ (e.g. visiting friends, going to work) was considered most important for coping on a day-to-day basis. Many participants reported this was a chance for them to forget their own ‘ills’ for a while: ‘After a while I was just grateful to get out and get my shopping in, you know, get some breathing space myself’ (Iona). Here, Iona’s metaphors illuminate her situation. She appears suffocated by her caregiver duties and <italic>her</italic> shopping facilitates some sense of space and time alone.</p>
<p>For other participants, ‘time out’ required more of a sense of escapism from the caregiver life in its totality and a temporary need to return to their former, pre-SCI normality. For some participants, a longer period of time away from the home was necessary in order to provide a proper sense of respite. Like a magnification of Iona’s shopping trip, this ‘time out’ allowed some participants a chance to focus purely on their own needs as opposed to their partner’s needs:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I ended up going away with my friend for a week abroad and as much as I felt guilty as hell for leaving them, they were absolutely fine and I had a great week where I didn’t have to think about access, wheelchairs, ramps, sliding boards, anything. I just got a week I didn’t have to think of any of that, it was absolutely great. (Neve)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, ‘time out’ appears to offer Neve a real sense of freedom – it reinvigorates her and she can relax and be her ‘old self’ again. Once more, there is an essence here that time away from the caregiver role allows the participants to <italic>live</italic> their lives as opposed to simply existing, to focus on their own needs rather than sacrificing these for those of the injured individual. It also seems, however, that the caregivers could not escape their caregiver roles entirely, with many consumed by guilt when away from their partner.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1359105311411115">
<title>The role of support</title>
<p>The participants emphasized the need for support in coping with their caregiver role. Many discussed a lack of financial support, physical support (e.g. lack of occupational therapy or physiotherapy for the injured person) and emotional support (from family and friends):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think I would feel like I was drowning if I didn’t have my friends and some carers to help me. It’s so hard to keep your head above water initially. You really need all the help you can get and I’m sure that there are lots of people who are not getting that help. (Iona)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Iona’s description of the overwhelming nature of the caregiver role is reinforced by the image of being completely submerged by caregiver burden – without help and support, there is a feeling here that she would not survive. Iona, like many of the participants emphasized the importance of receiving good support for coping with the role. Despite this, however, the majority of the participants reported having to ‘fight’ for any help or support that they had received. As Erin describes below, there are burdensome additional administrative roles as a spousal caregiver. This fuelled a profound sense of frustration as the participants felt that this battle for support was one that they simply did not have the energy to pursue:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You’re tired and you’ve got enough to do without phoning up this person and being passed to that person and filling in this form or that form or getting a letter from the hospital or your doctor. It’s never ending. It’s just such a mammoth task that you can’t get the energy to do anything. Everything is more complicated than it needs to be. They certainly don’t make life easy for us carers, that’s for sure. (Erin)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1359105311411115">
<title>Focusing on the positive aspects of SCI</title>
<p>In contrast to the negative impact of assuming the spousal caregiver role, participants identified a number of positive factors that arose from their caregiver role. These included feeling an increased empathy for other carers, adopting a more accepting outlook on life, becoming a stronger person and becoming closer to their partner post-injury. Perhaps this focus on the positive aspects of the situation also helped the participants to cope:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There are loads of positives in a bad situation (..) It’s a negative situation but within that are plenty of positives in as much as we have a nice home, we have a vehicle, we have a life, we have friends, we go on holiday, am ... we laugh, we do a lot more things together than we ever did because we’re forced into that situation but that’s been good as well. Yeah, there are lots of positives within the … [negative situation] does that make sense? (Amy)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although Amy identifies a number of positive factors in her caregiver life, there is a sense that this process may serve as a distraction from the negative factors that the caregiver role brings – acting as a mechanism to prevent her from feeling ‘low’. This may also relate to the positive re-appraisal that participants emphasized as being important for adjustment.</p>
<p>Other participants reported that being a spousal caregiver to someone with a SCI had changed their outlook on life somewhat and had made them more appreciative of the simpler, more basic and taken-for-granted things in life:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think maybe just making you realize … to appreciate life a bit more and don’t take things for granted that you would have done before. You always take it for granted that you can run up the stairs and run down the stairs, you can go up the street, you can come down the street and that doesn’t always follow now. (Lucy)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, some of the participants reported an increased strength of character and an improved relationship with the injured individual. Coping with SCI appeared to give them an inner strength and a sense of achievement – they had been as ‘low’ as they could be and they had survived. This seemed to promote a sense of confidence in the caregiver’s own coping abilities which in turn, may have promoted resilience and coping further:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We’ve now got to the stage where we know whatever comes along we can get through it, you know. We’ve had a few knocks in the past and we’ve got there and then this one came along and we got through this [SCI], so what else can happen that can throw a spanner in the works? I really don’t think there’s anything else, I think we’ve weathered the storm and we’ve come out of it quite well. (Neve)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In summary, this section has focused on emotion-focused strategies that the participants adopted to help cope with their new and ‘unanticipated careers’ as spousal caregivers. We now move on to centre on the wider context and more macro-processes of what can be called adjustment to the spousal caregiver role following SCI.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section12-1359105311411115">
<title>Putting the pieces back together again</title>
<p>Overall, many of the participants reported that they had adjusted to their new partner caregiver role relatively successfully. For most, this adjustment process was an active one; they reported making conscious changes to their lifestyles in order to facilitate the process. For some participants this involved reducing their working hours, for others accepting financial strain and the introduction of paid carers into their homes. More specifically, this adjustment seemed to require an acceptance of the fact that life would never be as it was prior to the SCI. Moreover, it demanded a focus on the ‘here and now’. The adjustment process was sometimes described as ‘living life in a different way’ and was considered to be key for ‘putting the pieces back together again’:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You have to learn to change your normal … and until you do that you don’t really get very far in dealing with it, you know? And your ‘normal’ changes all the time (…) it changes with every different set of circumstances that you find yourself in. You have to change your normal and you get very good actually of moving those goalposts and ‘okay, now this is normal now’. Another coping mechanism I suppose. (Amy)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Amy’s account illustrates a particular dualism; the need to be adaptive and responsive to the particularities of situations as they arise; yet also the need to have some sense of stability (e.g. the baseline or benchmark of ‘normal’). For Amy it is the somewhat <italic>paradoxical</italic> flexibility of these benchmarks such that seems to facilitate her coping. This adaptation sometimes led to an increasing disparity between life as experienced and life expected. The extract below signals some sense of the imposition of such changes, some sense of resilience in the face of adversity and even some sense of pride in her and her husband’s responses: ‘You just have to change your life. It’s not how you imagined your life would be but you just have to make the best of what you have. And I think we did, you know?’ (Leah).</p>
<p>Like Leah, many other participants reported that positive re-appraisal of the situation was one way to deal better with their burdensome caregiver role. Yet this adaptation was not easy or straightforward. The following extract is reminiscent of the narratives of other people facing traumatic life experiences such as drug or alcohol dependency in that it describes a key milestone of reaching ‘rock bottom’ before adaptation and coping could begin: ‘You get to the stage, you get as far down as you possibly can and the only way is up. We went forward from then on’ (Leah).</p>
<p>Many of the participants dwelt on the losses they had encountered. There was a sense of them mourning their former lives. Yet, as we have seen, this was almost always countered with a more positive re-appraisal of the situation and adaptation to a new life as a spousal caregiver. This was a choice that one participant (Iona) believed ‘just comes naturally’. For other participants, a sense of fatalism underpinned the process:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We still had an awful lot of living to do … but we just had to make the best of where we were in life. You know, this is what life has given us; we’ll just have to make the best of it. (Rose)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Irrespective of how difficult this process of adjustment may have been, the participants did, over time, appear to adjust to their caregiver role successfully: ‘It’s not difficult now, it’s just life, it’s just the way we live, but at the beginning, it was terrifying, it really was so scary, but it’s not as bad as I expected’ (Neve).</p>
<p>In summary, the participants gave an account of the process of adaptation to the caregiving role. This was understood as a complex and distressing series of ongoing adjustments and the renegotiation of key benchmarks and expectations. Importantly, there was a sense of the joint work, or shared journey, that both the participants and their partners had completed in order to get to the point in time where the individual participants could offer their retrospective accounts.</p>
<sec id="section13-1359105311411115">
<title>Your life’s not your own, nothing is private anymore</title>
<p>Participants reported a number of factors which hindered their adjustment to the caregiver role; namely biographical disruption, loss of identity and loss of control. These have been reported in our previous article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311411115">Dickson et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, participants spontaneously reported the role of paid caregivers in both facilitating and inhibiting their adjustment. The success of adjustment was reported as being largely dependent on the nature of the paid caregiver and whether they were deemed as being ‘good’ or ‘bad’ by the participants. It is possible that paid care impeded to some extent the maintenance of a sense of personal control and self-efficacy in the spousal caregiver, as discussed in the previous section. The following extract from Erin outlines some of the key issues involved. The nuances of her language use draw our attention to the specific nature of her distress. Her shift from personal pronoun (‘I’) to the generic ‘you’ is perhaps symptomatic of the alienation she is describing. The sense of invasion by an unspecified ‘somebody’ seems to render her ‘home’ a mere ‘house’. Critically, in her account, time also provides no respite; these interchangeable guests will never leave:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I have real difficulty with home carers coming in and out of the house because I … your life’s not your own, nothing is private any more. Somebody comes in every morning and every night for the rest of our lives. (Erin)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The constant interruption to Erin’s private life leaves her feeling frustrated and dubious of her caregiver role and she appears to mourn the solitude and sanctuary of her former home. Despite difficulties accepting the imposition of paid caregivers, the participants counterbalanced this with the necessity of having them:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I can’t do it [caring] full time so we have to use the facilities that we are offered and the funding that we are given to have somebody in to do it. But with that goes the ‘oh God’ you know, ‘they’re in my house again’. (Amy)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ultimately, many of the paid carers were considered as something of a necessary evil by the participants. While having a carer in the home afforded the participants the opportunity to leave the house and have some ‘breathing space’, some participants no longer felt comfortable in their own homes. The nature of the formal care was imperative here:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Somebody who comes in and treats you like you’re a human being and if you explain something to them if they’ve not been in before, you explain how to work with you, that is a good carer. Somebody that comes in like a bull in a china shop, pulls you about this and that, that is a bad carer. They treat you like, if you haven’t got a mind of your own and I’ve had a couple of them. (Ruby)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clear, open communication seems to be key for a successful partner caregiver–paid caregiver relationship. Often, the participants reported power struggles with the paid caregiver and felt that they often abused their homes. This was one fight that the participants did not appear to have the energy to pursue.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This article highlights the underlying adjustment process in spousal caregivers to an individual living with SCI as well as identifying a range of coping strategies which facilitate the adjustment process. To date, the current caregiver literature on SCI has focused more on the impact of assuming the caregiver role and less on the process of adjustment and coping. Even those studies which have explored adjustment and coping in spinal cord injury (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311411115">Hui et al., 2007</xref>) have tended to focus on family caregivers as opposed to spousal caregivers. The current study extends the existing caregiver literature in SCI by highlighting the apparent utility in being flexible with changing ‘norms’ and expectations and the role of positive re-appraisal (benefit finding) in facilitating the adjustment process. Ultimately, these strategies made coping with the day-to-day burdens of the caregiver role more bearable and it appeared that, over time, coping became easier for participants. Perhaps the successful engagement with their new ‘career’ as a spousal caregiver simply becomes the participant’s new ‘norm’. This study also highlighted the hindrance that unsuccessful relationships with paid, formal caregivers could pose for caregiver adjustment and coping. To our knowledge, this is the first study to indicate this, and this carries a number of implications which will be discussed later.</p>
<p>In terms of coping, the participants predominantly adopted a variety of emotion-focused strategies to help moderate caregiver burden and promote adjustment. These reflect those of the wider caregiver literature and include a need to vent emotion, receiving ‘time out’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311411115">Sawatzky and Fowler-Kerry, 2003</xref>), gaining social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311411115">Folkman and Moskowitz, 2000</xref>) and focusing on the positive aspects of the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311411115">Kurz and Cavanaugh, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105311411115">Veltman et al., 2002</xref>). Being flexible and adjusting their lives to incorporate the caregiver role also helps here. Positive behaviour (reported elsewhere as ‘positive reinterpretation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311411115">Chandler et al., 2007</xref>) or ‘benefit finding’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311411115">Kortte et al., 2010</xref>) or ‘post-traumatic growth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311411115">Pollard and Kennedy, 2007</xref>)) promotes self-efficacy and minimizes depression and stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311411115">Cheshire et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311411115">Mock and Boerner, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The reduction in working hours, introduction of paid caregivers and adapting lifestyles may all be forms of problem-focused coping employed by the participants. From this perspective, these coping strategies may offer a means of taking instrumental action to solve presenting caregiver problems. However, these tended to be employed in the initial post-injury phase and a temporal dimension may prevail here. Problem-solving interventions targeting caregiver concerns over time are worthy of evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311411115">Craig et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311411115">1999</xref>).</p>
<p>There are a number of clear messages from the current study. The most obvious is that there is a definite need to develop and deliver interventions for spousal caregivers to people with SCI. It is imperative that it is not ‘assumed’ that the spouse of an individual with a SCI will automatically embrace the primary caregiver role. Rather, the spousal caregiver should be considered a vital and central part of the wider healthcare system, who will require ongoing support and care themselves. Difficulties adjusting to the caregiver role may be alleviated by improved access to, and greater provision of, community resources and services. Indeed these can only be improved by consultation with the spousal caregiver, for example, in programme reviews and policy development. This would ensure that such services and resources were better tailored to meet the actual needs of spousal caregivers. Ongoing formal assessment to identify adjustment and coping in spousal caregivers at various points in time is also warranted.</p>
<p>Given the participants’ emphasis on the importance of social support for coping, it is suggested that spousal caregivers should be encouraged to access local caregiver support groups. Social support has been found to be key for coping in SCI caregivers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311411115">Sheija and Manigandan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105311411115">Vrabec, 1997</xref>). Indeed, local support groups may promote adjustment by endorsing the heightened sense of normality that many of the participants in the current study were striving for. Such support groups may also offer the caregiver an opportunity to vent emotion, to realize the ‘positives’ of the situation and provide them with ‘time out’ (all of which were considered vital for coping in the present study). This, coupled with an accessible, psychological support service, may promote better adjustment to the caregiver role. Cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) enhancing role adjustment may be effective in this respect also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311411115">Craig et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311411115">1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, one aspect of support which was often considered to hinder adjustment and coping was the introduction of paid formal caregivers to the participants’ homes. The participants found it difficult to accept help with duties which they felt they should be carrying out themselves. Perhaps greater preparation for the spousal caregiver is required as to what to expect from formal carers. Again, caregiver support groups may offer spousal caregivers potential solutions to difficult formal caregiver situations.</p>
<p>Finally, we consider the limitations of the current study. Regarding recruitment, it is possible that a selection bias operated in those individuals who participated. They may have been better adjusted to their caregiver role than those individuals who did not partake in the research. Also in this regard, those individuals who were recruited via SIS may have been more assertive in seeking social support and may have established better social support networks than those individuals who did not participate. Second, like much of the extant caregiver literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311411115">Brannen and Petite, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311411115">Lee, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105311411115">Tang, 2009</xref>), the majority of participants in this study were female. Future research should consider a focus on the male spousal caregiver perspective in SCI. Longitudinal qualitative research exploring the process of adjustment and coping over time is warranted in the SCI spousal caregiver population.</p>
