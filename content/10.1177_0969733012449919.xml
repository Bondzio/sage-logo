<p>Soodabeh has been teaching undergraduate and postgraduate nurses for more than 20 years, and from the beginning, her concern has been about ethics.</p>
<p>In her endeavour to disseminate an ethical culture in clinical settings, she realized that patients, doctors or nurses were not consulted in the compilation of a patients’ bill of rights that had been posted around hospital wards, and none of them were fully aware of those rights. She set about studying the documents, the needs and understanding of nurses, patients and doctors, of those rights. In 2010, her PhD dissertation on the subject of patients’ rights won her the prestigious Avicenna Award of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), given for outstanding education and research activities. It also propelled her into health policy work and cooperation with the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Sciences.</p>
<p>From that time, Soodabeh has focused her research projects and publications, as well as her academic and clinical work, on the rights of patients. She has led innumerable formal and informal sessions, workshops, seminars and courses to promote nursing ethics and patients’ rights in both faculty and clinical settings all over Iran. She has done this by negotiating with managers and leaders everywhere to prepare and train nurses as patients’ rights advocates. This is not an easy job for a nurse in a paternalistic health-care context.</p>
<p>Soodabeh has cooperated with international research, has translated English textbooks and other material into Farsi and has travelled as widely as her work situation permits, always learning from other settings and advocating patients’ rights and human dignity generally.</p>
<p>She and a number of colleagues from the university’s teaching hospitals were the first team to start work on a code of ethics for Iranian nurses, based on her research and wide discussions and consultations in the country. This work was published in a renowned medical ethics journal. It also led her to work with other organizations, notably the Iranian Academy of Medical Sciences, in establishing the code. In cooperation with other research centres, a composite version of the code of ethics has now been adopted by the Ministry of Health for all nursing personnel.</p>
<p>From 2010, a new comprehensive Iranian patients’ bill of rights has been in force, legally binding in all health-care facilities, and Soodabeh is busy introducing and presenting it to nurses and health-care providers up and down the country. As one of the best-known academics in her country, she is a pioneer in nursing ethics, constantly called upon when any issues of patients’ rights and nursing ethics are under consideration.</p>
<p>With all of this, Soodabeh is also the director of Nursing Continuing Education (NCE) of TUMS, and as such she is responsible for designing and running NCE programmes for nurses for the whole country. She is also the head of the Nursing Management Department of the Faculty of Nursing, and with this very high workload in postgraduate and management education, she still teaches nursing ethics to undergraduate and graduate nursing students in various courses.</p>

<title>Citation for Barbara Parfitt</title>
<p>One of Barbara Parfitt’s supporters for the Human Rights and Nursing Awards described her as ‘a multi-linguist, networker, leader, and cutter of Gordian Knots. She is also a delight to work with, a real encourager of new ideas and innovations, and an inspirational figure to several generations of nurses around the world’. This sums her up, but the details of her work and achievements are even more fascinating.</p>
<p>Barbara trained as a nurse and midwife and soon found herself working in Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan and Turkey as a nurse practitioner and midwife. In 1979, she started studying at the School of Tropical Medicine in Liverpool, and her PhD studies explored international primary health care, focusing on the impact of western values of nurses on primary health care in developing countries. As a leading member of the Nurses Christian Fellowship, she takes a keen interest in the importance of spirituality within the healing process and the values that underpin the caring role.</p>
<p>She was dean of the School of Nursing, Midwifery and Community Health at Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU) for 15 years, director of the WHO Collaborating Centre (WHOCC) for Nursing and Midwifery Education, Research and Practice at GCU and the Secretary General for the Global WHOCCs for Nursing and Midwifery. At that time, she also led a major nursing research and development programme in Tajikistan. In January 2007, she was awarded a CBE (Commander of the British Empire) in the Queen’s New Year’s honours list, for services rendered to international health development, and in the same year, she stepped aside as dean to become the new director of Global Health Development in GCU, continuing with projects in South Africa and Central Asia.</p>

<p>These positions gave Barbara the possibility to influence health care and nursing education far and wide: Tajikistan, Scotland, Norway, Spain, Romania and Moldova, South Africa and Central Asia. Everywhere her concern is to promote empowerment for women, women’s rights and the health-care rights of people who are sick, poor or dying. She has shown a deep concern for nurses to become aware of their vital role, not only as health-care professionals with a recognized status within their own nations but also as actors on the national and international stages to advocate and institute programmes for the betterment of the health of their local and national communities.</p>
<p>Barbara’s current work and concern is in Bangladesh. There she has established the Grameen Caledonian College of Nursing, in collaboration with The Grameen Health Care Trust and GCU, to empower young women through nursing education as leaders, decision makers and change agents, and to break the cycle of poverty resulting from early marriage, early pregnancy and early death. Students are educated to an international level through the provision of the highest quality education and research. The lack of trained health-care professionals in Bangladesh is seriously hindering health development. The college is now training 50 nurses per year and plans to increase total student numbers to 500 over the next 5 years offering Diploma, BSc and Masters programmes.</p>
