<abstract>
<p>Federal mandates more than a decade old require the use of evidence-based practices in schools, and an abundance of meta-analytic evidence for reading instruction exists; however, the long lamented research to practice gap in education gives reason to explore whether this evidence has translated to classrooms. This study examined the extent to which a national sample of kindergarten, first- and second-grade teachers (<italic>n</italic> = 534) reported using evidence-based reading curricula. Results indicated that very few curricula teachers used have been evaluated using research designs that meet federal guidelines. In addition, teachers reported supplanting their core reading curricula with other materials. Results of the survey indicate the need, despite a federal push for evidence-based practices, for new models of developing, testing, and disseminating evidence-based curricula.</p>

<title>The Promise of Response to Intervention (RtI)</title>
<p>RtI frameworks have the potential to decrease inappropriate referrals to special education and improve achievement of students already identified with disabilities by increasing the use of scientifically validated instructional practices in core general education instruction. RtI research has demonstrated that early intervention in the general education classroom is critical for preventing academic failure and referral to special education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0888406413489838">Vellutino, Scanlon, Small, &amp; Fanuele, 2006</xref>). The foundation of RtI is built on the strength of the first tier, which in most models falls under the domain and responsibility of general educators. RtI literature recommends that Tier 1 include implementation of a scientifically based reading curriculum with high levels of fidelity and continual professional development (PD) for teachers to ensure quality instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0888406413489838">Bursuck &amp; Blanks, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0888406413489838">Johnson, Mellard, Fuchs, McKnight, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0888406413489838">Vaughn, Wanzek, Woodruff, &amp; Linan-Thompson; 2007</xref>). Current legislation (Individuals With Disabilities Improvement Act IDEA] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0888406413489838">U. S. Department of Education, 2004</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0888406413489838">No Child Left Behind [NCLB], 2001</xref>) also requires the use of scientifically based practices, and consideration of a student’s response to scientifically based instruction when determining whether disability is present (IDEA). In theory, when evidence-based reading instruction implemented with fidelity is in place, it <italic>should</italic> eliminate instruction as a reason for students not making adequate progress.</p>
<p>The majority of RtI research has been focused on reading, likely because the majority of students with learning disabilities (LDs) are identified because of reading deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0888406413489838">Stewart, Benner, Martella, &amp; Marchand-Martella, 2007</xref>). Several studies demonstrate that the quality of Tier 1 instruction can improve academic achievement of students at risk of failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0888406413489838">Fuchs et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0888406413489838">Stewart et al., 2007</xref>). In particular, high levels of certain instructional characteristics including explicitness, engagement, monitoring, and planning are shown to be most effective in Tier 1 instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0888406413489838">Foorman et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Tier 1 Reading Curricula</title>
<p>Surveys of elementary teachers spanning 25 years have shown that commercial basal or core reading programs were the most frequently used methods to teach reading in general education classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0888406413489838">Baumann &amp; Heubach, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0888406413489838">Canney &amp; Neuenfeldt, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0888406413489838">Chall &amp; Squire, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0888406413489838">Farr, Tulley, &amp; Powell, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0888406413489838">Miller, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0888406413489838">Stein, Stuen, Carnine, &amp; Long, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0888406413489838">Tyson &amp; Woodward, 1989</xref>). Research on reading curricula suggests that some elementary teachers use commercial reading programs “judiciously,” while others select, adapt, or ignore components based on personal preference, perceptions of students’ needs, or teaching style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0888406413489838">Baumann &amp; Heubach, 1996</xref>). Most teachers reported that they were allowed flexibility with the implementation of their reading curricula; but many teachers also reported that basal reading curricula were useful instructional tools.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, federal policy including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0888406413489838">NCLB (2001)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0888406413489838">U.S. Department of Education (2002)</xref>, and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0888406413489838">IDEA (2004)</xref>, along with the RtI literature has emphasized using “scientifically-based” reading instruction with fidelity. Many states have interpreted this to mean commercial reading curricula. Since the 1990s, however, no investigations of how reading curricula are used in light of NCLB, IDEA, and Reading First have been published. In addition, most states have enacted RtI initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0888406413489838">Zirkel &amp; Thomas, 2010</xref>), providing yet another reason to examine how elementary teachers are using reading curricula.</p>

<sec id="section3-0888406413489838">
<title>Teachers’ Implementation of Reading Curricula</title>
<p>The PD literature suggests an even more critical reason to investigate the implementation of reading curricula. Many PD studies have shown that simply <italic>adopting</italic> programs and practices is not enough to promote consistent implementation of any practice that will lead to improved student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0888406413489838">Yoon, Duncan, Lee, Scarloss, &amp; Shapley, 2007</xref>). Other research has shown that consistent, correct implementation of any new curricula can take years of intensive work within a school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0888406413489838">Buzhardt, Greenwood, Abbott, &amp; Tapia, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0888406413489838">Klingner, Vaughn, Hughes, &amp; Arguelles, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Critical to the success of Tier 1 instruction are skilled and knowledgeable teachers who are able to implement instruction in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0888406413489838">Holdheide &amp; Reschly, 2008</xref>), but many studies have suggested that elementary teachers lack the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively teach children at risk to read (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0888406413489838">Lyon &amp; Wieser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0888406413489838">Moats, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0888406413489838">Podhajski, Mather, Nathan, &amp; Sammons, 2009</xref>). Specifically, many teachers lack deep content knowledge of the key components of reading, meaning they can typically identify <italic>what</italic> each component is at the surface level, but cannot describe the individual structures within each component or how they relate to overall reading development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0888406413489838">Lyon &amp; Wieser, 2009</xref>). Observations of elementary teachers’ reading instruction have also often shown low levels of academic engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0888406413489838">Foorman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0888406413489838">Kretlow &amp; Bartholomew, in press</xref>): little evidence of explicit, systematic instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0888406413489838">Foorman et al., 2006</xref>; Kretlow &amp; Bartholomew), and emphasis on curricular components that do not match the instructional needs of the learners in the class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0888406413489838">Cunningham, Zibulsky, Stanovich, &amp; Stanovich, 2009</xref>; Kretlow &amp; Bartholomew).</p>

<sec id="section4-0888406413489838">
<title>Definition and Importance of Fidelity of Implementation</title>
<p>Using results from a comprehensive literature review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0888406413489838">O’Donnell (2008)</xref> constructed a five-component framework for defining fidelity: (a) adherence—delivering instruction as designed; (b) exposure—whether the number of lessons taught, the length of time spent on content, and the type of concepts and skills delivered match the intent of the curriculum; (c) program differentiation—the existence of “critical features” that distinguish the curriculum from other standard curricula; (d) quality of delivery—the extent to which a teacher implements the curriculum consistent with the “theoretical or pedagogical ideals” and techniques embedded within the unit; and (e) participant responsiveness—the extent to which student involvement/engagement in the curriculum activities matches the intent of the curriculum. Very few studies examining <italic>any</italic> of the five components exist, in particular studies investigating the relationship between fidelity of core curricula to student outcomes (i.e., only five studies identified in a comprehensive literature review; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0888406413489838">O’Donnell, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Some emerging fidelity research, however, shows that adherence to evidence-based curricula can improve student achievement. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0888406413489838">Azano et al. (2011)</xref> compared language arts achievement outcomes from students with “high fidelity” teachers and “low fidelity” teachers. Students instructed by “high fidelity” teachers had statistically significant higher achievement than students instructed by “low fidelity” teachers. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0888406413489838">BennerBenner, Nelson, Stage, and Ralston (2011)</xref> reported that fidelity of implementation of the Corrective Reading Decoding® program accounted for 22% of the variance in basic reading gains and 18% of the variance for reading comprehension gains. Studies have also shown that teachers’ beliefs about their students, their own expertise, autonomy, and time can result in varying degrees of fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0888406413489838">Anzo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0888406413489838">Lawrence, 2010</xref>), which leads to the need to examine teacher-level variables surrounding fidelity.</p>

<title>Unanswered Questions About General Education Reading Instruction Fidelity</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0888406413489838">Burns and Ysseldyke (2009)</xref> conducted a national survey to determine the frequency with which special educators and school psychologists used evidence-based practices when instructing students with disabilities. Results showed that respondents used evidence-based practices for students with disabilities (e.g., direct instruction, applied behavior analysis, strategies instruction) with high levels of frequency, but that they also used practices with little empirical support with the same levels of frequency (e.g., modality training, social skills instruction). These data are helpful in determining the research-to-practice gap in settings in which special educators have primary responsibility for instructing students with disabilities; however, a large percentage of student disabilities (84%) spend the majority of the school day in the general education classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0888406413489838">Kitmitto, 2011</xref>). Therefore, the link between the low performance of students with disabilities and the extent to which evidence-based core reading instruction is occurring must be investigated.</p>
<p>Given the importance of early reading instruction in preventing reading difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0888406413489838">Strickland, 2002</xref>), it is particularly critical to unpack the variables surrounding the implementation of reading curricula in kindergarten, first, and second grades. Understanding what a national sample of K-2 teachers are doing when teaching reading is critical in helping researchers, teacher educators, curriculum developers, school leaders, and staff developers in the adoption, initial PD, and ongoing support of evidence-based reading curricula. Therefore, the general purpose of this survey was to examine the ways in which teachers use commercially developed reading curricula in Tier 1 instruction.</p>
<p>The survey was anchored in evidence-based practices for Tier 1 reading instruction in the following three ways: (a) content (i.e., the “Big Ideas” of reading per the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0888406413489838">National Reading Panel [NRP], 2001</xref>, including phonological and phonemic awareness, alphabetic principle, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension), (b) instructional design (i.e., the delivery of the “Big Ideas” per the recommendations of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0888406413489838">NRP, 2001</xref>), and (c) fidelity of implementation. Because this study used a survey design, teacher-reported “adherence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0888406413489838">O’Donnell, 2008</xref>) was the only aspect of fidelity that could reasonably be measured.</p>
<p>In addition, much of the current RtI literature supports a standard treatment protocol approach to Tier 1, meaning teachers use a structured core reading curricula rather than a set of “practices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0888406413489838">Burns, Appleton, &amp; Stehouwer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0888406413489838">Fuchs, Mock, Morgan, &amp; Young, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0888406413489838">Stewart et al., 2007</xref>), and most elementary teachers have reported reliance on core or basal programs for the majority of reading instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0888406413489838">Baumann &amp; Heubach, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0888406413489838">Canney &amp; Neunfeldt, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0888406413489838">Stein et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, this survey primarily asked questions about reading <italic>curricula</italic> (i.e., published reading programs); however, questions related to instructional design and content also give insight into the extent to which teachers reported using evidence-based “practices” (i.e., specific research-based strategies). The research questions addressed in this study were as follows:</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>A random sample of 1,500 K-2 teachers was used for this study. The sample was stratified in two ways, by geographic region and by grade level. A total of 500 kindergarten, 500 first-grade, and 500 second-grade teachers were randomly selected, with 250 surveys sent to teachers in each of the following regions: (a) Northeast, (b) Southeast, (c) Midwest, (d) Plains, (e) Northwest, and (f) Southwest. Teachers within this stratification were randomly selected using school listings from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Greatschools.net">Greatschools.net</ext-link>. Teachers’ names, school mailing addresses, and e-mail addresses were then exported from public school websites. One teacher per school was selected, to try to maximize the variability among responses.</p>
<p>A total of 534 teachers returned the surveys, resulting in an overall response rate of 35.6%, which is generally accepted as a moderate response rate based on a meta-analysis of 50 years of survey research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0888406413489838">Dey, 1997</xref>), and is similar to other recent national education surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0888406413489838">Burns &amp; Ysseldyke, 2009</xref>) of the same topic. In general, the respondents were female (95.6%), with an average of 14 years of experience. Of the teachers, 35.7% had been teaching 10 or fewer years, 29.6% had been teaching between 11 and 20 years, and 34.7% had been teaching between 21 and 40 years. In all, 30.1% taught kindergarten, 36.4% taught first grade, and 30.1% taught second grade. Of the teachers, 48.2% held a bachelor’s degree; 50.4% held a master’s degree, and 1.4% held an EdS, EdD, or PhD. Of the teachers, 46.3% taught at a Title I school, 53.6% teachers taught at a non-Title I school. Of the respondents, 9.6% were from the Northeast, 23.6% were from the Southeast, 10.6% were from the Southwest, 26.5% were from the Plains, 19.3% were from the Midwest, and 10.4% did respond to the question regarding location.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<sec id="section9-0888406413489838">
<title>Survey design</title>
<p>Researchers created a 15-item survey, composed mostly of closed-ended questions. Questions related to reading content and instruction were derived directly from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0888406413489838">NRP (2001)</xref> report. The first question asked teachers to name the reading curricula they used to teach reading. The second question asked teachers which components of the program they used and how often, with choices “daily,” “3-4 times per week,” “1-2 times per week,” “occasionally,” “never.” Teachers were given a list of components typically included in core curricula including teacher manuals, phonemic awareness materials, phonics and alphabetic principle materials, leveled readers, scope and sequence of phonemic awareness and phonics skills, student workbooks, “big books,” literature, sample scripts, student textbooks, and assessment tools. Teachers could write in any additional items not listed.</p>
<p>The third set of questions were related to the frequency with which teachers used specific evidence-based practices, including systematic, explicit instruction in the five components of reading identified by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0888406413489838">NRP (2001)</xref>. The questions also included other instructional approaches (e.g., discovery learning, whole language instruction, eclectic approaches). Teachers could choose “daily,” “3-4 times per week,” “1-2 times per week,” “occasionally,” and “never.” The fourth set of questions asked teachers <italic>if</italic> and <italic>how</italic> they deviated from using the core curricula, and how often and by whom they were observed implementing it (i.e., fidelity observations). The fifth set of questions asked teachers to describe how recently they had received PD related to their core reading curricula. In addition, four demographic questions were included related to the respondent’s years of experience, highest degree held, setting (i.e., Title 1/Non-Title 1), and state.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0888406413489838">
<title>Content validity</title>
<p>Two experts in the field of reading research reviewed the surveys and provided feedback as to whether the questions asked were critical to the field in regard to Tier 1 reading instruction (i.e., qualitative content validity examination). Experts were given a 4-item open-ended questionnaire related to the survey’s content and overall clarity, and were also asked to provide any additional feedback. When both experts agreed on changes to questions, the questions were revised accordingly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0888406413489838">
<title>Dissemination procedures</title>
<p>Once the participant pool was formed, surveys were mailed to teachers along with cover letters and self-addressed stamped envelopes to return the completed surveys. The surveys were not coded in any way that would allow identification of an individual teacher. Two follow-up e-mail reminders were sent to each potential respondent 3 weeks after the initial mailing.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0888406413489838">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Given the exploratory nature of the research questions, descriptive statistics were primarily used during data analysis. The first research question asked about the frequency with which teachers use an evidence-based reading curriculum. Teachers listed 63 different reading programs. We initially used the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0888406413489838">Institute for Education Sciences, 2011</xref>) guidelines for evidence in evaluating the evidence for each program. The WCC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/">http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/</ext-link>) was created by the Department of Education to promote informed decision making through a set of databases and reports on specific reading curricula. The WWC rates evidence for interventions that have been examined using a true experimental research design or a quasi-experimental research design with a comparison group deemed by the WWC to match the experimental group. We searched the WWC to determine whether the curricula reported by the survey respondents were included in this database. Of the 63 reported programs/practices, 84% were not found on the WWC, 9.5% were found but did not have studies that met the specific WWC research standards needed for review, 4.8% were found and determined to have no discernable effects on student learning, and 1.7% (Success for All; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0888406413489838">Slavin &amp; Madden, 2011</xref>) were found and determined to have positive effects on student learning.</p>
<p>Since the majority of curricula (84%) had not been evaluated by the WWC, we broadened our investigation of evidence to two other research clearinghouses that evaluate reading programs, including the Best Evidence Encyclopedia (Johns Hopkins University) and the Promising Practices Network (RAND Corporation). The results were almost identical to what was found on the WWC. Of the 63 reported curricula, 80% were not found on the BEE or the PPN, 10.2% were found but did not have studies that met the research design standards for review, 6.9% had low evidence for student learning (Open Court), and 2.9% had moderate positive effects on student learning (Success for All; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0888406413489838">Slavin &amp; Madden, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the limited empirical evidence available on three clearinghouses, the search was broadened to include a content evaluation of each curriculum. The evaluation included examining the webpage for each of the 63 curricula to determine the extent to which the program <italic>purported</italic> adhering to the five components of reading instruction (i.e., phonological and phonemic awareness; alphabetic principle, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension). This “face value” evaluation in no way makes a statement about evidence of effectiveness; however, knowing more about the specific curricula was essential to interpreting teachers’ responses. We were able to locate specific websites for 44% (<italic>n</italic> = 28) of the curricula. Of the 28 programs we found, 50% (<italic>n</italic> = 14) mentioned all five components, 3.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 1) mentioned four, 25% (<italic>n</italic> = 7) mentioned three, 10.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 3) mentioned two, and 10.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 3) mentioned one. Two of the websites provided reports of academic research. Harcourt Treasures’ and Open Court’s websites include links to outcomes research by state (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.macmillanmh.com/reading/">http://www.macmillanmh.com/reading/</ext-link>). The research is primarily single-group pre-test/post-test and/or ex post facto.</p>
<p>For all curricula with at least 10% reported use, an electronic search for peer-reviewed research examining achievement outcomes for each program was conducted using Education Databases EBSCO Combined Search (EBSCO), which combines Education Research Complete, OmniFile Full Text Mega, Academic Search Complete, and Teacher Reference Center. No studies were found for Harcourt Trophies® (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0888406413489838">Beck, Farr, &amp; Strickland, 2007</xref>), Reading Street® (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0888406413489838">Foresman, 2011</xref>), Harcourt Treasures®, Houghton Mifflin® (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0888406413489838">Baumann et al., 2011</xref>), Harcourt Storytown®, Fountas and Pinnell (or a subsequent search for “guided reading” and “achievement”), or Rigby Literacy by Design®.</p>
<p>One study was found for Open Court®. Researchers conducted a multisite, cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Open Court® with 49 first-grade through fifth-grade classrooms with low socioeconomic demographics. Twenty-seven classrooms were assigned to use Open Court® while 22 used their current reading curricula. Results of a multilevel analysis of classroom-level effects showed a statistically significant positive effect for the Open Court® classrooms.</p>
<p>Given the lack of overall evidence found, a final content evaluation of all programs with at least 10% reported use was conducted. Specifically, both primary investigators examined the teacher’s manual for each of the most frequently reported programs, to determine the extent to which the program included content and instructional design outlined by meta-analytic reading research. For consistency, the first-grade series from each program was chosen, and two full week units were examined from each curriculum using the checklist below (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0888406413489838">Table 1</xref>). Items from the checklist are derived directly from the summary findings of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0888406413489838">NRP (2001)</xref> report. Curricula could receive “yes,” “no,” or “somewhat” ratings for each item on the checklist. A “yes” rating was granted when the lesson specifications consistently adhered to the item in the checklist. For example, if a curriculum provided sample teacher wording or instructions for a systematic, explicit introduction of new letter sounds across both weeks of instruction, the item would be rated “yes.” If the curriculum provided no scope and sequence of letter sound introduction or guidelines for delivering instruction (e.g., modeling, providing student opportunities to respond), the item was rated “no.” If the curriculum provided some evidence of a synthetic, systematic scope and sequence of phonics instruction but no sample teacher wording or directions for delivering instruction, the item would be rated “somewhat.”</p>

<title>Implementation of Reading Curricula</title>
<p>Fewer than half of teachers reported using all components of their curricula daily. Teachers reported the highest frequency with the teacher manual (48.9%) and shared stories/literature (45.2%), and the lowest frequency with the teacher wording/script (19.1%). Very few teachers reported using assessment materials daily (1.9%), but a much higher percentage of teachers (40.8%) reported using curriculum-related assessments 3 to 4 times a week. Only a third of teachers reported using the scope and sequence for phonemic awareness or letter-sound introduction daily (36.8% and 35.3%, respectively).

Teachers reported use of state standards was higher than their reported use of any other curricular materials.

<title>Evidence Base for Tier 1 Reading Curricula</title>
<p>In this study, the extent to which K-2 teachers reported using evidence-based reading curricula with fidelity was investigated. Results suggest that there is not only a gap between research to practice, as has commonly been reported in special education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0888406413489838">Burns &amp; Ysseldyke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0888406413489838">Cook, Tankersley, Cook, &amp; Landrum, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0888406413489838">Espin &amp; Deno, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0888406413489838">Foorman &amp; Moats, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0888406413489838">Greenwood &amp; Abbott, 2001</xref>), but also a “policy to research gap.” Specifically, federal policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0888406413489838">NCLB, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0888406413489838">U.S. Department of Education, 2002</xref>) requires the use of scientifically based instruction. There is limited evidence, however, that the programs used by elementary teachers (i.e., only one program found to be moderately effective on the WWC, the BEE, or the PPN) are scientifically based. Most curricula found to be used had not been evaluated in terms of impact on student learning. Most of the programs teachers reported using do not have evidence-based studies supporting their use, nor do they meet the WWC criteria. It is important to note that there are reading curricula on the WWC with evidence of effectiveness for improving K-2 reading (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0888406413489838">Table 8</xref>). Most of the programs with at least small evidence would be categorized as intervention programs, rather than core curricula (e.g., Reading Mastery®, Reading Recovery®).</p>

</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>The majority of teachers, however, reported using curricula that appear to be “evidence-informed,” meaning they generally adhere to the qualities found effective in meta-analytic reading research. This begs the question of whether curricula that are “evidence-informed” must then undergo rigorous testing, such as randomized control trials, to be considered “evidence-based.” Reauthorizations of NCLB and IDEA should address this concern.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if curricula that are “evidence-informed” need a second level of experimental testing, federal efforts need to further define and support such research efforts, in particular by considering research designs that do not require randomized assignment, which is difficult when studying larger populations of students who receive core curricula in natural school contexts. The logistical and ethical concerns related to implementing such large-scale RCTs are likely salient reasons why there were very few studies found on the WWC. If RCT remains the main methodology for determining evidence, schools will need support, incentives, and strong partnerships with universities and other agencies to successfully design and implement such rigorous research. A second option would be to broaden the definition of evidence based when evaluating Tier 1 curricula. Other research methodologies could allow for experimental analysis of data that are “nested” (e.g., within district, within school, within classroom), which would be helpful when random assignment is not logistically or ethically possible.</p>
<p>Of greater concern than the lack of evidence for curricula teachers reported using is the large percentage of teachers who reported having <italic>no</italic> reading curriculum. This is not a teacher-level variable, but a district-level variable, and as this survey suggests, perhaps a national concern. The data teachers reported regarding supplemental materials suggest that they are primarily relying on teacher-created materials and internet resources.</p>
<p>One reason why teachers may be supplanting core curriculum materials is because they are not typically included in the curriculum adoption process, which in theory could lead to lower buy-in of materials or perceived usefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0888406413489838">Stein et al., 2001</xref>). Very little research exists related to curricular adoption; however, the available research suggests that adoption is dictated by state and district policy. Stein et al. reported that 22 states conduct curricular adoption at the state level, whereas 28 states allow each individual school district to select curriculum. Typically, state or district level panels review curriculum and select materials based on district or schools’ <italic>perceived</italic> needs. These panels rarely include teachers or school administrators. This method of “top-down” decision-making and dissemination in schools has been shown ineffective in some PD literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0888406413489838">Garet, Desimone, Birman, &amp; Yoon, 2001</xref>). In addition, previous research suggests that adoption committee members tend to evaluate curriculum with limited attention to scientific research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0888406413489838">Stein et al., 2001</xref>). This is particularly concerning given the policy requirements to select scientifically validated curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0888406413489838">NCLB, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0888406413489838">IDEA, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0888406413489838">U.S. Department of Education, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0888406413489838">
<title>Fidelity of Implementation</title>
<p>Overall, teachers indicated moderate fidelity in using some components of their core curricula, such as the teacher’s manual and the corresponding literature. This is consistent with previous survey research on commercially developed programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0888406413489838">Baumann &amp; Heubach, 1996</xref>). Teachers, however, indicated low fidelity with some critical components of curricula, such as the scope and sequence for phonemic awareness and alphabetic principle instruction, and the student practice materials (e.g., leveled readers, decodable books, workbooks, textbooks). Inconsistent implementation of the sequence of early decoding skills could have a detrimental effect on students’ acquisition of fluency and comprehension, as systematic, synthetic phonics instruction was a clear recommendation from the NRP.</p>
<p>Similarly, limited use of leveled and decodable readers could indicate students are not receiving sufficient opportunities to practice reading aloud with feedback from the teacher. Teachers’ responses to questions about phonemic awareness, alphabetic principle, and fluency components echo these concerns, as approximately 40% of teachers reported not addressing phonemic awareness, letter-sound correspondence, or word work daily, and approximately 50% of first- and second-grade teachers reported not addressing fluency daily.</p>
<p>Although teachers reported relatively low levels of fidelity with core curricula, they reported much higher frequency with using their state standards to plan and deliver instruction (60% daily, 80% at least weekly). It also appears that many teachers are delivering instruction on the state standards by supplanting components of their core curricula with teacher-created materials (76.9% at least twice a week, 30.9% daily). These data suggest that teachers may not see an explicit alignment between their core curricula and state standards. It is also possible that teachers focus solely on the standards because they are inextricably linked to end of year high stakes assessments. Fewer teachers reported using internet resources, which is different from previous surveys of teachers that found high levels of internet use in lesson planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0888406413489838">Ohlund, Chong, Jannasch-Pennel, &amp; DiGangi, 2000</xref>). These results also suggest that web-based tools may not be the most salient way to disseminate information about evidence-based practices to teachers.</p>
<p>In addition, very few teachers were provided the opportunity to be observed and receive feedback teaching reading. The majority were observed teaching reading only once a year by school personnel or were not observed at all. An almost identical percentage of teachers rarely, if ever, received postobservation feedback on their reading instruction by an administrator, literacy coach, peer, or district level personnel. The RTI literature places heavy emphasis on fidelity of implementation; however, it does not appear that the many teachers have the occasion to receive any feedback on the fidelity with which they are implementing core reading instruction. This may be directly linked to the reported low fidelity teachers reported in this survey.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0888406413489838">
<title>PD for Tier 1 Reading Curricula</title>
<p>The majority of teachers in this study reported not receiving any PD in reading since the inception of NCLB in 2001, requiring the use of scientifically based instructional practices, or the NRP report in 2001, the most recent meta-analytic research on reading. Even fewer received PD since the last reauthorization of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0888406413489838">IDEA (2004)</xref>, which allowed the use of the RtI model in determining the presence of a disability. These data are in line with previous research in which teachers reported little access to PD related to teaching students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0888406413489838">Greenwood &amp; Abbott, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0888406413489838">Schumaker et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In a meta-analysis on PD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0888406413489838">Yoon et al. (2007)</xref> found that PD opportunities that had the greatest impact on student achievement lasted at least 14 contact hours, included follow-up support, were provided by an expert, and involved instruction on content and strategies. Given that the majority of teachers reported very rarely being observed or given feedback on teaching, it seems unlikely that a systematic structure for providing follow-up support is in place in many schools. Of particular concern is the low number of teachers who reported being observed or given feedback by a literacy coach. One possible reason for this low percentage is that many schools do not have access to instructional coaches whose primary responsibility is to provide ongoing PD and in-classroom support. Other literature shows that many literacy coaches still spend the majority of their time directly working with students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0888406413489838">Quatroche, Bean, &amp; Hamilton, 2001</xref>), thereby limiting the amount of time available to support teachers. Several studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0888406413489838">Kretlow &amp; Bartholomew, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0888406413489838">Kretlow, Cooke, &amp; Wood, 2012</xref>) found that, although the frequency with which teachers’ evidence-based strategies increased after initial in-service training, high and stable levels of accurate implementation did not occur until after teachers received at least one individualized observation, feedback, and coaching session. The findings in this study suggest that models of observation and support, or “coaching” do not appear to be systematically utilized in schools, which could limit the emphasis on fidelity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0888406413489838">
<title>Role of Higher Education</title>
<p>Given that the majority of respondents in this survey reported inconsistent use of reading curricula and inconsistent instruction in key components of reading, and that few programs in use have strong research evidence, the role of higher education in training pre-service and in-service teachers, as well as partnering with schools to close the research-to-practice gap needs to be examined. Very few teachers reported using resources from their undergraduate or graduate coursework. If the majority of teachers are not using an evidence-based approach with fidelity, higher education faculty have a role in improving this statistic. First, a few studies have shown that institutes of higher education (IHE) are not properly preparing teachers to teaching reading. For example, findings from a National Council on Teacher Quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0888406413489838">NCTQ, 2006</xref>) review of syllabi and texts for reading courses showed that (a) the majority of IHEs were not teaching the science of reading, (b) courses claiming to provide a “balanced approach” ignored the science of reading, (c) National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) accreditation did not increase the likelihood that the science of reading would be taught, and that (d) students were not likely to engage in field experiences teaching reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0888406413489838">NCTQ, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0888406413489838">NRP (2001)</xref> reported similar results in its examination of the literature on pre-service and in-service teacher education. The NRP noted that one of the largest unanswered research questions is related to the effects of pre-service experience on in-service performance when teaching reading. The NRP noted, however, that it is important that teachers be educated about how to evaluate different programs, and that teachers be provided with evidence-based pre-service training and ongoing in-service training to be effective reading instructors. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0888406413489838">Scheeler, Bruno, Grubb, and Seavey (2009)</xref> found that even when teachers learn evidence-based methods in pre-service education, they often fail to generalize them to student teaching or induction years in the classroom.</p>
<p>The fact remains that the current model of how evidence-based practices are generated, evaluated, and disseminated is not impacting schools as quickly or intensively as it should. Clearly, innovative methods of providing pre-service and in-service teachers with adequate preparation in selecting and implementing evidence-based practices and programs are needed. The connection between researchers, administrators, teachers, teacher candidates, and other school personnel needs to be tightened and aligned.</p>
<p>The longstanding model in which academics develop and test academic interventions, and then disseminate it at in-services or conferences does not appear to be working. Administrators and teachers do not make decisions solely on information they receive at a presentation, or information they view about “evidence” on an internet website. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0888406413489838">Foorman et al. (2006)</xref> suggested, attitudes and beliefs influence whether an innovation will be adopted and implemented with consistency. In addition, when the typical model of IHEs developing, testing, and disseminating practices is used, researchers (a) often do not test research questions that match the needs of teachers, (b) develop the innovations so slowly that they are out of date by the time they are disseminated, and (c) often fail to use the input of practitioners, who will actually be using the interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0888406413489838">Abbott, Walton, Tapia, &amp; Greenwood, 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0888406413489838">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Several things should be kept in mind when interpreting the findings of this study. First, the response rate, while similar to other published survey research, was relatively low, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Second, the data collected were descriptive and based on responses from elementary classroom teachers across the country. It is possible teachers may have misrepresented or misreported the practices they use in their classrooms. In addition, by the nature of the research design, we were only able to examine the “adherence” aspect of fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0888406413489838">O’Donnell, 2008</xref>). Future research using direct observation would provide more information on the implementation of evidence-based practices, the range and duration of activities, and the specific skills addressed. In addition, although there were some commonalities across the participants, some of the differences may have had an influence on the findings. For example, a different pattern of findings may have emerged if we had compared the data between teachers in Reading First schools and those who are not in Reading First schools.</p>
<p>Finally, the empirical evidence for the reading curricula teachers reported using was severely limited, which led to the need for “face value” content evaluations. The content evaluation using the NRP checklist does not supplant the need for tightly controlled studies examining the efficacy of these curricula.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0888406413489838">
<title>Implications for Research</title>
<p>Much research is needed surrounding the research-to-practice gap in early reading instruction. First, surveys, interviews, and qualitative studies should be conducted to uncover the factors that impact district adoption and implementation of reading curricula. Understanding district level processes will be helpful in determining innovative methods of dissemination about evidence.</p>
<p>Second, more research on the efficacy of PD schools and other innovative university–school partnerships is needed. Researchers need to become more embedded in school contexts. Specifically, studies need to be designed in which teachers and researchers generate collaborative research questions, implement studies in which teachers are interventionists, and dissemination takes places in ways that match school contexts and teacher needs.</p>
<p>Third, more rigorous studies investigating the efficacy of core curricula that are currently “evidence-informed” and being used by many elementary teachers need to be conducted. Again, university–school partnerships will be critical in the success of this effort, given the need for randomization or careful matching of comparison groups or schools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0888406413489838">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>The findings in this investigation lead to several implications for schools and universities. First, teachers and school administrators need to be more actively involved in the curricular adoption process. The teachers in this survey reported supplanting many of the components of their core curricula. If teachers serve as partners in the development and selection of curricula perhaps common “fidelity pitfalls” could be avoided (e.g., curricula not matching student needs, curricula having logistical barriers or confusing directions).</p>
<p>Second, universities and schools should examine innovative models of collaboration that include providing effective PD to in-service teachers and training pre-service teachers to value and evaluate evidence. Though small in size, the body of empirical research on PD has demonstrated characteristics of teacher in-service and follow-up support that can lead to changes in teacher performance and student achievement. First, when learning new methods, teachers need at least 14 contact hours provided by experts and focused on content and strategies to impact student achievement. Second, follow-up support is critical to improving fidelity. For example, the Side-by-Side Coaching model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0888406413489838">Kretlow &amp; Bartholomew, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0888406413489838">Kretlow, Cooke, &amp; Wood, 2012</xref>; Kretlow, Wood, &amp; Cooke, 2009) or the Partnership Instructional Coaching Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0888406413489838">Knight, 2007</xref>) offer instructional coaches practical ways to provide initial PD and follow-up support to teachers.</p>
<p>Equally importantly, pre-service teacher education programs must emphasize fidelity as a critical component to instructional proficiency.</p>
<p>Third, administrators should play a critical role in selecting, implementing, and monitoring curricula (National Association for Elementary School Principals [NAESP]). This study demonstrated that administrators spent very little time observing teachers teaching reading. Administrators are the “lead learners” in a school; it is particularly important that they choose consultants who provide PD carefully, and that they fully participate in the PD sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0888406413489838">Brown, 2011</xref>). NAESP’s rubric for effective “leaderships” states that principals should (a) participate in facilitated PD; (b) participate in extensive, ongoing learning activities that include hands on, problem-based, and multiple practice opportunities; and (c) allocate time to practice specific teaching strategies and receive feedback on the implementation of new skills. The principal assessment instrument developed by Vanderbilt Assessment of Leadership in Education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0888406413489838">Porter, Murphy, Goldring, &amp; Elliot, 2011</xref>) also places high value on administrators’ full participation in ongoing, collaborative PD opportunities.</p>
<p>In summary, the mismatch between federal policy, research, and actual classroom practice is an impetus for considering alternative models of developing, researching, disseminating, and monitoring evidence-based practices in reading. Without innovative changes, the inappropriate identification of students as LD, as well as the poor progress of students already identified LD in reading will be perpetuated. Universities and schools must recognize the critical importance of partnership, collaboration, and PD in improving instruction for students who struggle to learn to read.</p>
