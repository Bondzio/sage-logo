<p>With this volume of <italic>Theology Today</italic>, we initiate a new feature of the Book Review section called “Editor’s Choice” that will occasionally appear in the journal. Recommended books under this rubric will sometimes fall into categories that are not usually reviewed, but worthy of attention, such as dictionaries, second editions, or books representative of a popular genre that are significant for the Church, but not strictly academic. Others will simply be books that we are eager to bring to our readers’ attention. For this bicentennial issue, each book chosen for “Editor’s Choice” has a connection to Princeton Seminary: three of the books were written by PTS faculty—Kenneth G. Appold (History), Gordon Graham (Philosophy), and Luke Powery (Homiletics)—while the editors of the two theological dictionaries include the president of Princeton Seminary, Iain Torrance, and a member of the Bible Department, Jacqueline Lapsley.</p>
<p><italic>The Reformation: A Brief History</italic></p>
<p>Kenneth G. Appold</p>
<p>West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell, 2011. 203 pp. $29.95</p>
<p>This brief history of the Reformation begins with a three-page preface that describes the parameters of the book as well as its particular perspective. In terms of parameters, the book is intentionally <italic>brief</italic>, which means that some important topics are omitted. The Reformation in Britain, for example, is excluded. Also, the author, who is Associate Professor of Reformation History at Princeton Seminary, knows some readers will disagree with the book’s lack of attention to academic theology. (It should be noted that doctrine is not excluded altogether. There are excellent descriptions of conflicts over key doctrinal matters, such as Christ’s presence in the Eucharist and the meaning of justification. Anyone interested in a brief history of Reformation theology would do well to read this book first to review the historical context of the debates surrounding that theology.) Regarding the particular perspective of the book, Appold challenges the view that the Reformation divided Western Christianity, since divisions and a search for church unity occurred prior to the Reformation. Also, the historical account is set in the context of the Christianization of Europe with its competing institutional and ethical dynamics, and Appold gives special attention to the rural culture in which the Reformation occurred and to the “common people” whose lives it effected.</p>
<p>The book has four chapters: (1) “The Different Paths of Medieval Christianization,” (2) “The Luther Phenomenon,” (3) “Reformation Reforms,” and (4) “The Reformation’s Establishment,” followed by an epilogue, “The Reformation’s Legacy.” In providing an “over-arching” narrative account of the Reformation, these chapters unfold in the manner of a compelling story. As with a good novel, I was reluctant to put it down. Throughout the text, the author clearly indicates when he is setting forth a perspective that differs from some historians. Readers, therefore, are not subjected to an unstated bias, but invited into a conversation.</p>
<p>The book could serve well as an introductory text as long as one keeps in mind that, in spite of its brevity, it does not present Reformation history in a simplistic manner. Even though historical details unfold in an accessible and highly interesting manner, the book does not skimp on those details. One would do well to assign brief sections of the book for weekly classroom reading in an introductory course. The book could also be used as a fresh and insightful review of a history that readers may already know. Pastors, scholars, and students in the Lutheran, Reformed, Anabaptist, and Roman Catholic traditions who are interested in looking into an era that set the stage for many contemporary debates may come to a better understanding of the similarities and differences in these various Christian traditions by reading this book.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best compliment I can give to the book is that I was sorry when it came to an end. Fascinated by the brief historical account it offered, I was left wanting more. I highly recommend it.</p>
