<p>The number of military veterans diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has increased over the past decade, and the rate of tobacco use in this population is high. A recent study of military persons with PTSD showed that that those with higher PTSD symptom severity are more likely to view tobacco use as an effective means to control the negative affect states associated with the disorder, suggesting those with PTSD are more likely to turn to tobacco use for relief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390313485907">Calhoun et al., 2011</xref>). Development of efficacious and cost-effective interventions to promote smoking cessation and reduce the risk of tobacco-related disease in this population is critical.</p>
<p>In the article “Building a Tobacco Cessation Telehealth Care Management Program for Veterans With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,” Battaglia, Benson, Cook, &amp; Prochazka report the results of a pilot study designed to evaluate the <italic>feasibility</italic> and <italic>fidelity</italic> of an intervention program to promote smoking cessation in veterans with PTSD. The intervention program is based on the principles of the transtheoretical model of behavior change and motivational interviewing. It was delivered to patients in their home using telephone technology and was included as part of an established telehealth program to improve self-management and health in veterans with PTSD. Because Battaglia et al.’s project was a <italic>pilot study</italic>, the investigators were primarily interested in determining if the study design and methods could be implemented as planned. However, changes in patient smoking behaviors and their satisfaction with the intervention program are also reported.</p>
<sec id="section1-1078390313485907">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The link between PTSD and tobacco use in American war veterans is due to many causes. First, as many as 26% of military personnel serving in Iraq and Afghanistan are estimated to have major mental health disorders, including PTSD, and tobacco use is often initiated during military service. Second, fewer smokers with PTSD have quit smoking compared with all smokers in the United States. Finally, as mentioned above, persons with PTSD use tobacco to control symptoms, and tobacco use can increase PTSD symptoms, leading to a circular effect.</p>
<p>Battaglia et al. argue that veterans with PTSD experience a unique set of barriers to effective smoking cessation programs. Existing smoking cessations programs have not been effective with this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078390313485907">Fiore et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078390313485907">Hapke et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, smoking cessation programs have not been well integrated into mental health care and primary care physicians are limited in their ability to provide longer term smoking cessation treatment and monitoring.</p>
<sec id="section2-1078390313485907">
<title>The Intervention Program</title>
<p>An important strength of the smoking cessation program addressed in this study is that it is based on theory that has been tested and supported by research. Two theories are used to shape the intervention. The first theory, the transtheoretical model of behavior change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078390313485907">Prochaska &amp; Norcross, 2001</xref>) suggests that people can be categorized based on their “readiness to change” a target health risk behavior. The importance of this categorization framework is that to be effective, interventions need to match the person’s current level of motivation to change the target behavior. For example, for those persons who have not considered quitting smoking, interventions need to focus on helping them recognize the health risks associated with their behavior and encourage them to consider change as a viable option. The transtheoretical model was used to guide the content included in the written smoking cessation curriculum, and it guided the interventions used by the nurse interventionist during the weekly telephone counseling session.</p>
<p>Motivational interviewing is an evidence-based behavioral counseling approach that was used in this study by the nurse intervention during the weekly telephone session to help the patient move toward increased willingness and motivation to quit smoking. The nurse interventionist tailored the intervention strategies to match the person’s stage of change and used motivational interviewing techniques to deliver the stage-appropriate interventions. Results of previous studies have shown that motivational interviewing is most effective when used with persons who are not ready to change. In addition, studies have shown that the interviewing approach was more successful in achieving smoking cessation in patients compared with brief counseling or standard care.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-1078390313485907">
<title>Design</title>
<p>This project is described as a pilot study. <italic>Pilot studies</italic> are small and preliminary studies that are conducted to evaluate the study design and methods. A typical study is large and expensive in that it requires extensive planning, time and effort of the many people who agree to participate, complex methods, and costly personnel to collect and analyze the data. A pilot study may be considered a type of dress rehearsal in which all aspects of the study are tested in a small scale. Sometimes pilot tests are referred to as <italic>feasibility</italic> studies. Questions that are often addressed in a pilot or feasibility study include the following: (a) Will it be possible to recruit the number of participants needed to test the research hypothesis? (b) Will participants complete all parts of the study planned even if it extends over many days, weeks, or months? (c) How many participants can be anticipated to drop out prior to the end of the study? Pilot studies do not provide data to answer the research question or test the research hypothesis. Rather, results of a pilot study provide researchers information about the strengths and weakness of their study plan. This information is used to improve the plan before starting the full study. The results of a pilot study also provide investigators with an estimate of quit rates.</p>
<p>Since this study was a pilot study to test feasibility and treatment fidelity, a <italic>nonexperimental</italic>, <italic>single-group design</italic> was used instead of an <italic>experimental design</italic>. An experimental design has three properties: (a) participants are randomly assigned to the experimental condition, (b) the conditions or independent variable is under the control of the researcher, and (c) a control group in included for comparison. This study did not randomize participants assigned to the treatment, and there was no control group. All participants in this study received the experimental smoking cessation program. Because there was only one group, the data collector knew what treatment the patient received. Another way to say this is that the data collector was not <italic>blinded</italic> to the treatment condition. This is important because the data collector could unintentionally introduce some bias that could influence the findings.</p>
<sec id="section5-1078390313485907">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The target sample for this study was 10 to 15 veterans who met the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390313485907">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>) criteria for PTSD and smoked at least 10 cigarettes at the time of enrollment. Veterans were not included in the sample if they (a) used smokeless tobacco, pipes or cigars instead of cigarettes at time of enrollment, (b) were suicidal, or (c) were unable to connect to the telehealth system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1078390313485907">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>The smoking cessation telehealth program consists of two components: (a) written curriculum that was delivered in 90 sessions of 1- to 3-minute duration each by a home telehealth system and (b) a weekly counseling call from the nurse interventionist. The content of both components was tailored to match the participant’s stage of change. The written sessions provided information or questions about quitting smoking. For those in the early stages of change, the sessions were focused on increasing motivation to change behavior, and for those in later stages, the interventions supported behavioral change.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1078390313485907">
<title>Treatment Fidelity</title>
<p>The second aim of this study was to evaluate treatment <italic>fidelity</italic>. Treatment <italic>fidelity</italic> refers to the extent to which the experimental intervention, in this case the smoking cessation program, was delivered to participants as planned. For this intervention, fidelity also included evaluating whether the intervention was delivered in a way that was consistent with the transtheoretical model and the principles of motivational interviewing. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078390313485907">Table 1</xref> provides a detailed description of the strategies used to assess treatment fidelity.</p>

<title>Feasibility Outcome Measures</title>
<p>To evaluate feasibility of the study, measures of participant burden and change in symptoms (depression, PTSD, suicide, pain, and quality of life) caused by the intervention were measured. Other indicators of feasibility included participant satisfaction with the treatment, changes in participant stage of change, and quit attempts.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Battaglia et al. were able to gain an understanding about several important aspects of the study. The results focused on two components of the pilot study: (a) feasibility and (b) treatment fidelity.</p>
<sec id="section10-1078390313485907">
<title>Feasibility</title>
<p>The researchers utilized a panel of experts to review all materials related to the intervention. This panel included mental health providers whose areas of expertise were PTSD and motivational interviewing, tobacco cessation educators/counselors, and the PTSD care coordinators. The panel of experts found the tobacco cessation curriculum and stage-based motivational interviewing counseling manual used by the research nurse as a guide when interacting with participants to be consistent with the theoretical framework. Once approved, the researchers developed and implemented protocols in collaboration with the care coordinators managing the participants PTSD, and joint meetings were held throughout the pilot study to discuss patient-related issues as well as process issues in order to identify problems/solutions early.</p>
<p>Following the approval of the tobacco cessation material, the researchers incorporated the research surveys into the enhanced PTSD home telehealth system, except for two surveys that were completed during in-person research visits. Response burden was evaluated through the satisfaction with the tobacco cessation curriculum survey. Participants did not feel it was a burden to respond to the enhanced program (PTSD, research surveys, and tobacco cessation curriculum). PTSD symptoms were monitored closely throughout the pilot study using the PTSD Military or Civilian Checklist to ensure that participants’ symptoms did not worsen with the tobacco cessation intervention.</p>
<p>Finally, the researchers were able to evaluate if their strategies to recruit veterans were effective. Eleven veterans were enrolled in the pilot study, and seven participants completed the pilot study. One participant voluntarily dropped out, and three participants were no longer able to use the home telehealth system (two participants lost connectivity in their homes and one participant was incarcerated). Discovering the veterans’ obstacles associated with completing the study was helpful in determining the enrollment target for the larger research study currently in progress. This type of information will help determine the number of veterans needed for the full research study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1078390313485907">
<title>Treatment Fidelity</title>
<p>Based on the study design, participants were asked to use the home telehealth device daily and to be available for their weekly scheduled motivational interviewing counseling call with the research nurse. Consistent with the motivational interviewing principles, participants made choices about how and when to <italic>participant</italic> (dose), and not all participants chose to answer the enhanced health management questions each day or to be available for their counseling call. On average, participants required 111 days to complete the full 90-session curriculum. The nurse scheduled motivational interviewing counseling calls with each participant once a week for 12 weeks. If the participant was unavailable at the scheduled appointment time, the nurse attempted to call the participant once more in the course of the week. Consequently, the nurse initiated 220 calls and completed 140 motivational interviewing counseling calls (63.6% of attempted calls). The average number of completed calls was 12.7 (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.3) per participant, and the average length of these completed motivational interviewing calls was 21.0 minutes (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.1).</p>
<p>To determine behavior change, the participants’ responses to the enhanced PTSD health management program questions about their attitudes and behaviors were evaluated. At baseline, 45.5% of the 11 participants reported smoking &lt;10 cigarettes/day, and 54.6% reported smoking 10 to 20 cigarettes/day. At the final assessment, 20% were not smoking, 30% reported smoking &lt;10 cigarettes/day, and 50% reported smoking 10 to 20 cigarettes/day. The mean number of 24-hour quit attempts was 10.3 (range = 0-47) and the mean number of 7-day quit attempts was 1 (range = 0-6).</p>
<p>Baseline measurement of stage of change showed that one participant (9%) was in precontemplation, four participants (36%) were in contemplation, and six participants (55%) were in preparation. At the final assessment, no participant was in precontemplation, three participants (30%) were in contemplation, five participants (50%) were in preparation, and two participants (20%) were in action. At the end of the study, the expired carbon monoxide levels for the two participants who quit smoking were 7 ppm and 8 ppm, indicating that they had in fact quit smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390313485907">Benowitz et al., 2002</xref>). At the end of treatment, a significant relationship (<italic>r</italic> = −.677, <italic>p</italic> = .03) was found between stage of change and number of cigarettes/day smoked; as participants progressed forward along the stage of change continuum, they smoked fewer cigarettes/day. No adverse clinical events occurred during the pilot study.</p>
<p>Participants reported high satisfaction with the home telehealth tobacco cessation curriculum and motivational interviewing telephone calls. All participants thought that the tobacco cessation curriculum was valuable, that it gave them new information, and that it helped them see how they might be able to quit smoking. All participants thought the cessation curriculum and the PTSD program worked well together, almost all thought the curriculum had the right number of questions each day, and only one participant experienced frustration on most days. A majority of participants were willing to recommend the enhanced program to others with PTSD and who smoked.</p>
<p>Participants were also satisfied with the weekly motivational interviewing telephone sessions (mean = 88.1) and stated that they were comfortable talking to the nurse and that the nurse and participant talked in a calm manner. Based on participants’ reports of the telephone counseling interaction, the nurse asked the permission of participants before providing information about tobacco cessation medications, participants learned to take better care of themselves, and their freedom to smoke or not smoke was respected by the nurse. Participants also felt that they were given an opportunity to explore their motivation to quit.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1078390313485907" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study found that the telehealth care management and tobacco cessation strategy was feasible and was delivered with high treatment fidelity. The results showed that it was feasible to integrate tobacco cessation messaging into the existing PTSD health management program and incorporate motivational interviewing telephone counseling into usual care to help participants consider changing their smoking behaviors. The participants engaged in all components of the study and had a high level of satisfaction. The correlation between last assessment of cigarettes smoked and stage of change is suggestive that this intervention will help veterans with PTSD quit smoking and provides evidence that feasibility and treatment fidelity were achieved.</p>
<p>The research team felt that it was important to assess treatment fidelity because this was the first time the principles of motivational interviewing were used in a Veterans Administration home telehealth management program. Furthermore, we wanted to confirm adherence to the intervention by the research nurse and receipt by the patients. We were able demonstrate the motivational interviewing intervention was delivered as intended. Although becoming skillful and competent in motivational interviewing was a challenge, the research nurse gained confidence and learned to make the shift from “I’m the expert” to “the patient is the expert” in knowing their own motivation for making a health behavior change and how best to accomplish it.</p>
<p>We made small changes to the tobacco cessation curriculum based on feedback from participants to make questions more easily understood and less cumbersome. To maximize participants’ daily use of the home telehealth program and availability for scheduled motivational interviewing counseling calls, we engaged participants in a discussion during the enrollment process to help them identify and choose how they would change their daily routine to include these activities.</p>
<p>These processes will be implemented in a future study to maintain treatment adherence. As in the current study, the nurses in our future work will complete a self-assessment tool after each motivational interviewing counseling call. In addition, a motivational interviewing coach will conduct random audits of motivational interviewing counseling sessions to improve the quality of these sessions.</p>
<p>The main limitation of this pilot study was the lack of a control group and the small sample size. Although we were unable to estimate the effect size of our intervention during this pilot study, the results laid the groundwork for a larger randomized control trial currently funded to test the effectiveness of this intervention. We did not account for the use of pharmacological treatment in our pilot study analyses. This will be considered in the currently funded randomized control trial.</p>
<p>Our telehealth care management and tobacco cessation intervention may be applicable to smokers with other chronic diseases, such as those with congestive heart failure, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or other mental illnesses. It is also well suited for smokers living in rural areas.</p>
<p>Clearly, as long as smoking prevalence remains high for veterans with PTSD and other mental illnesses, new evidence-based cessation techniques and translational delivery strategies will be needed. New skills will also be needed for practitioners as they continue to help patients change health behaviors in real-life settings. This pilot study provided an opportunity to use evidence-based patient counseling methods to improve tobacco cessation for veterans with PTSD.</p>
