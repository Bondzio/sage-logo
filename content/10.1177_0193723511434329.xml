<abstract>
<p>On the basis of narrative structure, this exploratory work aims to distinguish the lived experience of a Portuguese sports hero and noted mountain climber, João Garcia. Using phenomenological analyses of biographical interviews lasting over 15 hr in total, the narrative of João Garcia, the Portuguese alpinist who summitted the world’s 14 mountains above 8,000 m, is constructed. The analysis also includes the books written by Garcia himself in which he presents his “public” or “hero” self. This article focuses on João Garcia’s narrative of his life with an emphasis on his body–self experiences and his personal progression as a climber. Through the use of metaphors, the themes of the “one man show,” the transition to an alpine leader or captain and the body–self relationship are explored here, with a particular focus on Garcia’s desire to maximize his psychological and physical capacities in extreme and life-threatening conditions. The article concludes with some preliminary comments on the use of the narrative structure as a methodological tool.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>João Garcia is most likely not well known to the readership of this or other English language academic journals. He was born on June 11, 1967 and lives in Lisbon, Portugal with his partner. His 7-year-old daughter lives in Belgium with her mother. A Portuguese alpinist and mountaineer, in April 2010, he became the 10th man of all time to climb the world’s 14 “eight thousanders” (i.e., mountain peaks over 8,000 m) without the use of bottled supplementary oxygen or the support of Sherpas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0193723511434329">1</xref></sup> Garcia has also climbed six of the seven highest mountains on each continent. Since 1999 and his Everest summit, João Garcia is widely regarded as a national role model in Portugal and an international exemplar for mountaineers more generally. Certainly, his reflections on this and subsequent climbs in <italic>A mais alta solidão</italic> (<italic>The Highest Loneliness</italic>) and <italic>Mais Além—Para Além Do Evereste</italic> (<italic>Going Further—Beyond Everest</italic>) make evident some of the life-threatening situations which faced him including frostbite problems, and the freezing of his hands, feet and nose. Garcia is also a high altitude and extreme conditions cameraman and he has directed several documentaries about his expeditions, most of them broadcasted on Portuguese television. In presenting here some necessarily succinct aspects of the narrative of João Garcia, the goals of this article are threefold: (a) to make a modest contribution to our understanding of individual extreme sportspeople for much of the research on sport is dominated by the elite team sport environment; (b) to raise awareness about sports and sports research in the Lusophone world both of which have been comparatively neglected in English-speaking academic journals, one obvious reason being language barriers; and (c) to explicate aspects of the narrative form of inquiry and the role of metaphors in biographical research to understand the ways in which a solo athlete, in this case an alpinist, ascribes meaning to his practice of mountaineering, becoming an alpinist and what the future holds for him, including his body–self relationship. In other words, this article seeks to promote “new ways of knowing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193723511434329">Smith &amp; Gilbourne, 2009</xref>, p. 1) about embodiment, the body–self relationship and some of the “key turning points, fateful moments, or critical incidents in a life that stabilizes or fractures, changes, or integrates the body-self” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193723511434329">Sparkes, 1999</xref>, p. 27).</p>
<p>The article begins by setting the scene for the use of the narrative structure in biographical research followed by a short methodological discussion about the organization, phenomenological analysis and interpretation of the data generated in this fashion. This paves the way for a thematically organized presentation of the narrative of Garcia centered around phases of temporality: how everything started for his becoming a ”one man show”; how things developed particularly in his transition from a solo climber or one man show to the leader of an alpine support team with delegated responsibilities; and, what has, and will, become of the body–self relationship for him and the desire to maximize his psychological and physical capacities in extreme and life threatening conditions. The article concludes with some comments on the use of the narrative structure as a methodological tool. Firstly, there is the case for the use of storytelling and the narrative structure in sports research.</p>

<sec id="section2-0193723511434329">
<title>The Narrative Structure in Research</title>
<p>Stories envelop us and are a way of life. Indeed, telling stories is neither a choice nor an obligation since to live is to enact a story about the kind of person that each individual takes themselves to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193723511434329">Smith &amp; Sparkes, 2008</xref>). People are born in preexisting cultures that have a ready stock of narratives from which they draw on, appropriate, adapt, apply, and perform in everyday social interaction and through the socialization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193723511434329">Mellick &amp; Fleming, 2010</xref>). Within the storytelling tradition (which has itself a long history beyond academia), the narrative form of inquiry has been taken up by academics and researchers because narrative is an ontological condition of life, that is, narrative inquiry postulates that, as social beings, people live storied lives. In short, narrative is</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the linguistic form uniquely suited for displaying human existence as situated action. We organize our experiences into narratives and assign meaning to them through storytelling. Narratives thereby help constitute and construct our realities and modes of being. Narrative descriptions exhibit human activity as purposeful engagement in the world. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193723511434329">Polkinghorne, 1995</xref>, p. 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although there is much debate around stipulative definitions of what constitutes narrative, most scholars agree that, in its various forms, narrative represents a “fundamental interest in making sense of (the human) experience, the interest in constructing and communicating meaning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193723511434329">Chase, 2003</xref>, p. 273). The narrative mode “deals in human or human-like intention and action and the vicissitudes and consequences that mark their course. It strives to . . . locate the experience in time and place” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193723511434329">Bruner, 1986</xref>, p. 13) but, crucially, “in the very act of telling, people engage in creating and constructing certain kinds of self in specific social contexts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193723511434329">Sparkes, 1999</xref>, p. 20). Put differently then, the human condition entails the active construction of meaning. Thus, to understand ourselves and others it is necessary to explore the meanings that make up the social world.</p>
<p>To do this, one can attend to narratives, as meaning is created, organized and expressed through narrative, and it is a storied effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193723511434329">Bruner, 2004</xref>). The narrative form of inquiry also illuminates a great deal about people’s “internalized” worlds, thereby allowing researchers to explore lived experiences and preserve a sense of the individual person in what some writers have described as the abstracted nature of postmodernism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193723511434329">Smith &amp; Sparkes, 2008</xref>). Importantly, however, as has already been noted, narrative stories are not simply personal. They are also social and cultural in form and in meaning. Studying narratives is invaluable, then, for what it reveals about socio-cultural life, for society and culture are reflected in and through an individual person’s story, and stories are always involved in the construction of personality and identity. Human beings organize their experiences and memories mainly in the form of narrative—stories, excuses, myths, metaphors, and so on—such that narrative is considered one of the first schema through which human existence is made meaningful. In some senses then, it is possible to argue that the human experience is always narrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193723511434329">Bruner, 2004</xref>). Constructing stories, storytelling, and developing narrative is also directly related to temporality and individual people’s distinctive human experiences of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193723511434329">Richardson, 2001</xref>). In fact, time is the key coordinate in enabling a greater understanding of the course, continuity of, and breaks in, people’s lives, that is, people understand themselves either in the past, present, or future. In fact, it is not possible to remain aloof from this anthropological coordinate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193723511434329">Heidegger, 2005</xref>) in which the body–self relationship develops over time, none more so than for elite sports people for whom their bodies and bodily performance are the focus of their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193723511434329">Sparkes, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>There has been a burgeoning literature on the use of narrative research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193723511434329">Squire, Andrews, &amp; Tamboukou, 2008</xref>) and within the field of sports research in particular (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193723511434329">Markula &amp; Denison, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193723511434329">Mellick &amp; Fleming, 2010</xref>). Indeed, studies of physical education teachers and athletes such as Lance Armstrong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193723511434329">Butryn &amp; Masucci, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193723511434329">Sparkes, 2004</xref>) reveal the importance and relevance of the narrative structure for understanding past sports events, athletes’ interpretations of critical life moments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193723511434329">Gilbourne, 2002</xref>), overall life histories or situation-oriented narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193723511434329">Flick, 2009</xref>), and as a reflexive tool. Through narratives it has been demonstrated that it is possible to develop a rich and nuanced understanding of the lives of athletes over time. For example, through sport, athletes inhabit and engage with the world through particular kinds of “high-performance” bodies that have certain characteristics, that is, their bodies are more often than not highly disciplined and shaped by various regimes and technologies designed to ensure corporeal control and predictable performance outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193723511434329">Sparkes, 2004</xref>). Moreover, the body holds particular significance for the athlete whose self identity is constructed and maintained around the possession of an able, pain-free or at the very least pain-tolerant, physically fit and high-performing body. Therefore, the stories that athletes tell through narratives can provide interesting insights into the multiple ways in which self-aging and the physical and psychological maturation processes are perceived and experienced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193723511434329">Phoenix &amp; Sparkes, 2007</xref>). Nowhere, perhaps, is this more relevant than for an athlete like Garcia whose self-constructed narrative acknowledges the limiting impact of the aging process for the extreme physical demands of his particular sport. But, firstly, what of the narrative method?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0193723511434329">
<title>The Narrative Method</title>
<p>The term <italic>narrative practice</italic> characterizes simultaneously the activities of storytelling, the resources used to tell stories, and the auspices under which stories are told (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193723511434329">Gubrium &amp; Holstein, 1998</xref>). Narratives take many forms, are told in many settings, before many audiences, and with various degrees of connection to actual events or persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193723511434329">Manning &amp; Cullum-Swan, 1994</xref>). In constructing a narrative, the first obvious task is to choose the subject of the narrative. In the case of conventional biographies and life histories, the choice can fall on a role model, hero/heroine or successful sports person already recognized as such for his or her achievements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193723511434329">Smith, 1998</xref>). The Portuguese alpinist João Garcia is an ideal choice for these reasons. Indeed, it has been shown elsewhere that Garcia’s mountaineering expeditions represent a symbol of supreme effort to overcome human limits and attain significant and transcendental aims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193723511434329">Pereira, 2004</xref>). The second task in the construction of a narrative is the creation and generation of a data archive, be that an empirical life-writing exercise such as accessing written letters and personal documents, or conducting interviews and observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193723511434329">Smith, 1998</xref>). To construct the narrative of Garcia, this article derives its data from several biographical interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193723511434329">Denzin, 1989</xref>) through which Garcia narrated various experiences, stories, facts, and circumstances. These interviews, comprising four in total, were completed over several meetings in Garcia’s home.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0193723511434329">2</xref></sup> These resulted in the generation of approximately 15 hr of conversations recorded in audio format and later transcribed, coded, and analyzed. Besides the aforementioned interviews, the <italic>corpus</italic> of the data archive for this study included the two books written by João Garcia (The Highest Loneliness and Going Further). These books were an instructive chronological source for Garcia’s climbing career while they also represented Garcia’s views on fateful and significant moments in his life and his own personal reflections on his body–self relationship. In other words, these documents were an important and complementary source for providing “knowledge on different levels” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193723511434329">Flick, 2009</xref>, p. 445) and they enabled the design of subsequent interviews, chiefly in relation to the desire to comprehend which stories were told by Garcia, why, and how they were told by him.</p>
<p>The third task in narrative construction is the choice or selection of the analytical perspective, in this case, the phenomenological approach as it applied to Garcia’s experiences in, and for, mountaineering and understanding his “ordinary actions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193723511434329">Roberts, 2002</xref>, p. 80). The phenomenological approach emphasizes the establishment of the meaning and structure of the lived experience. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193723511434329">Miller’s (2000)</xref> words, “as people live their lives, they are continuously doing ‘biographical work,’ that is, as they move through life they must construct and reconstruct their self-view in response to an ever-changing society” (p. 156). Thus, the biographical narrative presented next centers on Garcia’s voice, itself reflected in the aforementioned sole authored texts and recorded through interviews. This data triangulation was desirable because of the facility to verify analytical themes across these sources and apply “approaches on different levels” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193723511434329">Flick, 2009</xref>, p. 448). Moreover, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193723511434329">Hermans (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193723511434329">Lincoln and Guba (2000)</xref>, this work solicited Garcia’s views on the interpretations and credibility of the analysis presented here for “the narrativist approach . . . concentrates upon the construction of viewpoints of reality that are shared between the interviewee and their interrogator” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193723511434329">Miller, 2000</xref>, p. 155). This verification procedure or “balancing phase” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193723511434329">Hermans, 1995</xref>, p. 184) involved the taking of the interviewee, Garcia, as an expert and theoretician of himself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193723511434329">Hermans, 1995</xref>) and representing the interpretations to him, that is, enabling him to have input into the accuracy, consistency and credibility of the final account. In fact, the interpretation process began from the organization of the interview guides around a “generative narrative question” (Riemann &amp; Schutze, 1987, p. 353 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193723511434329">Flick, 2009</xref>, p. 177) to the ways in which the interviews were conducted using narrative probing, and the role of interviewer in them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0193723511434329">3</xref></sup> Garcia collaborated in this balancing phase for human beings can reflect on experience and, in so doing, come to understand a previous experience, perhaps very differently; or they may have new experiences. In both cases, reconstruction takes place in the sense of something being changed in some way, even if only by degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193723511434329">Conle &amp; Boone, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>According to Bowen (1968, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193723511434329">Smith, 1998</xref>, p. 195), the decisions regarding analytical theme are both part of, and followed closely by, “plotting the biography” and some or all of its component parts such as chronology, humanity, conflict, suspense, and humor. There is also the challenge of constructing “the figure under the carpet” (Edel, 1979, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193723511434329">Smith, 1998</xref>, p. 195) or elucidating the essence of one’s subject. The “mask of life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193723511434329">Smith, 1998</xref>), that is, the appearance, the facade, the overt behavior one sees (or the more or less public self that we find in Garcia’s books or on his official website),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0193723511434329">4</xref></sup> and the underlying “life myth” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193723511434329">Smith, 1998</xref>)—the major inferences into the character and personality of the person being written about—are, in effect, an interwoven tapestry with frontal images and an underlying construction. In this context, the role of the researcher as interviewer, observer, and active listener becomes crucial in revealing these interconnections. The way the researcher conducts interviews and his or her disposition for listening to the story becomes a cornerstone in the final production of a story with a beginning, middle, and end. In the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193723511434329">Hermans (1995)</xref>,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>First the initial situation is outlined (“how everything started”), then the events relevant to the narrative are selected from the whole host of experiences and presented as a coherent progression of events (“how things developed”), and finally the situation at the end of the development is presented (“what became”). (p. 183)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With this in mind, and as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193723511434329">Gubrium and Holstein (1998)</xref> suggested, personal stories and their coherence were considered here as matters of methodological practice by focusing on the relation between the “hows” and “whats” of narration, and on the storyteller (João Garcia) engaged in the work of constructing coherence under the circumstances of storytelling. This orientation to practice reveals the storytelling process as both actively constructive and locally constrained. Using this analytical perspective, it is important to note that the validity of a story or narrative of life is not tied to the veracity of the story told because “what is presented in a narrative is constructed in a specific form during the process of narrating, and memories of earlier events may be influenced by the situation in which they are told” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193723511434329">Flick, 2009</xref>, p. 184). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193723511434329">Bruner (1991)</xref> asserts, “narratives are versions of reality whose acceptability is governed by convention and ‘narrative necessity’ rather than by empirical verification and logical requiredness” (p. 4). Rather than seek the “truth” and “objectivity” in the narrative of Garcia, this work reflected on how he gave coherence to his life, how he spoke about himself, and some of the crucial life moments that were identified by him in his unfolding temporal development. Therefore, the prerogative for truth in the narrative was not directly relevant, not least because there is no permanent and static truth. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193723511434329">Denzin (1989)</xref> contends, narrative research always presents stories about recollected or remembered events as well as the facts (events believed to have occurred) and facilities (how these facts were lived and experienced) used in this reasoning. In this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193723511434329">Moen (2006)</xref> maintains that the most important goal is to capture the voice of the subject of research.</p>
<p>By using these phenomenological and narrative procedures, it was possible to remain faithful to both the facts and facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193723511434329">Denzin, 1989</xref>), and narratives from the research field were developed into a story that is presented below. Given the constraints of publishing and reflecting the constraints of compressing and detailing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193723511434329">Flick, 2009</xref>), “the story is condensed not only because of limited time (or space) but also so that the listener is able to understand and follow it” (p. 179). It presents a thematization of the data and the subsequent interpretation of the narrative around a series of pithy metaphors. Accordingly, what follows next will not read like “traditional” sports research for “accuracy is not the issue, rather narratives of the self seek to meet literary criteria of coherence, verisimilitude, and interest” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193723511434329">Sparkes, 1999</xref>, p. 24). Considering the importance accorded by several authors such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193723511434329">Richardson (1990)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193723511434329">Roberts (2002)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193723511434329">Sparkes and Smith (2005)</xref> to the use of metaphor in narratives, the format presented next is based on three metaphors found to dominate João Garcia’s self told stories. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193723511434329">Richardson (1990)</xref> affirms, the essence of a metaphor means the use of a symbol, image, or figure of speech for understanding and experiencing one thing in terms of another, and this is accomplished through comparison or analogy. As a discursive tool, metaphor is crucial in the ways in which people consolidate and develop ideas about themselves, about their social relationships and about their knowledge of the world. The three metaphors presented here arose directly in Garcia’s self-told narrative. Their use by him demonstrated the meanings that he himself attributed to his objectives and his life choices, based on a high level of self-reflection on his part and consciously chosen modes of communication. The metaphors are interwoven within a time-based narrative about: first, how things started for Garcia, that is, how he became a climber; second, the process through which he developed as a climber including the perception of his body as a high-performance machine; and, third, what became, and will be, or his aspirations for the future. The three metaphors that capture these are as follows: becoming a one man show; the shift from passenger to captain; and, an ambassador. Each of these is now afforded respective attention.</p>

<title>How It All Started: Becoming a “One Man Show”</title>
<p>Garcia’s account of his introduction to climbing around the age of 15 demonstrates the existence of “critical incidents” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193723511434329">Sparkes, 1999</xref>, p. 27) that are regarded as remarkable by narrators in their own lives. He recalls his childhood and adolescence fondly. There was evidently a strong sense of independence to his recollections and a search for individual freedom and fulfillment. From a young age he liked climbing trees and walls, he was involved in scouts’ activities which instigated his interest in ropes and knots, besides being able to camp in the outdoors without worrying his parents. In his words,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I already climbed . . . there were no detached houses here; some were beginning to be built, others were unfinished . . . This front building we can see was under construction, but works were embargoed for seven or eight years and so it was our adventure territory. Me and my buddies broke the bricks to make a stair to get in. We fooled around, had our “wars”; those who controlled the two staircases made it impossible for others to climb or descend . . . This liking also came from the scouting influence (. . .) That was a way of saying: Dad, mum, I’m going camping!; Are you crazy? No, you’re not; I’m going camping with the scouts; Ah! Then, it’s O.K. Just like that! I could go! Scouts led me to interact with ropes for the first time, and taught me how to moor them up to the climbing cliffs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0193723511434329">5</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At school, João Garcia also had the opportunity to climb, thus enhancing his sense of independence and liberty.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was the guy who took the cement from within the bricks to build a scheme boulder behind the sports hall.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0193723511434329">6</xref></sup> The guys used to go and hide there to smoke and I went with a little stone and toc, toc, toc: Is there any teacher coming?; No, there’s nobody; so, I continued tic, tic, tic . . . Everything was done by hand, sort of Rambo style! Well, I think Rambo didn’t exist then, but kind of, I mean, that was the closest version of what I liked, that was to pull my weight, hanging from ropes and climbing them bare handed . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>His “debut” into mountaineering was also undoubtedly a key turning point. The episode described by him was always the same in its emotionality and content, thus revealing its conception and perhaps even rebuilding or reconstruction in his memory. Garcia was 15 years old and went on a trip to Estrela Mountain (Serra da Estrela), a journey that had at least two meanings for him: first, there was an emancipatory symbolism for him on account of the type of travel chosen by him (he cycled from Lisbon, a journey which takes approximately 3 hr by car); and, second, the significance for him of coming into contact with the Mountaineering Club of Guarda (a city near the Estrela mountain). In his words,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I started climbing at the age of 15, in Guarda. I went to Estrela Mountain by bicycle (. . .) That was a great moment! So, at 15, I had autonomy, my parents’ confidence and mine, and I realized I could pedal all the way, 700km by bicycle, 350 to the top and 350 down (. . .) When I arrived in Guarda, they taught me technique and safety procedures. I was like a cat; I could do it better than anyone else. And all this fast progression motivated me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>His trip to Estrela Mountain also inscribed in his life the later challenge of the “eight thousanders.” There, he met and grew to know Gonçalo Velez, another mountain climber well known for being the first Portuguese to climb an “eight thousander” in 1991. In the fashion of an “other” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193723511434329">Tsang, 2000</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0193723511434329">7</xref></sup> Velez had a particular influence on Garcia’s alpine career.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Gonçalo Velez was my climbing partner for some years, since I was 18, 19 years old . . . I met him precisely in Estrela Mountain because he was also a member of the same mountaineering club. He was also the first Portuguese man to reach 7000m, and later the first one to conquer 8000m, the Annapurna.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0193723511434329">8</xref></sup> He inspired me, and as I used to climb with him, I thought: If he can do it, I can do it too! I’m younger and I have more energy than him on the mountain, so, if he does it, I can do it too!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The realization of the importance of training and commitment to climbing led him to adopt a way of life which became the solo alpinist’s way of life. Because Garcia had no other remunerated professional activity that provided him with the financial independence to be able to climb, he completed odd cash-in-hand roles as a means to an end. His employment was, and continues to be, solely associated with mountaineering.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0193723511434329">9</xref></sup> In 2001, drawing on the metaphor of the “one man show” he said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’ve tried to be a professional climber, but in Portugal it is so difficult for many reasons, so I am self-employed in various arts . . . I say arts, because that’s what the heading in Revenue says: “Master in Arts, Sport, and Services.” As such, sometimes I do vertical works that are still well paid. All those services in which we need to hang off ropes or other lighter artificial methods for buildings with too many floors, with glass fronts, or, for example, whose windows need to be repaired.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The reference to his economic activity demonstrates the importance of metaphor in his narrative. Here, the metaphor in question—“one man show”—places to the forefront of this analysis the evolution of a solo sportsman and his transition from an amateur to professional athlete. This same metaphor was used several times by João Garcia to characterize his life and enables a greater understanding of his alpine career, as well as his learning process and personal progression. In 2001, when he considered himself an amateur, he said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Lately, one of the things that has given me much pleasure is to make equipment. I managed to make equipment to try to solve problems that current good brands, in my opinion, are still not able to do, because we can do better. I’ve thought about and I have developed some new equipment. I’ve made it and as it worked, I enjoyed it, because, in the end it means developing “stuff” for mountaineering . . . Basically, I develop specific equipment for climbing (. . .) The first gloves, the first snow trousers, the first sleeping bag . . . Even today I make lot of things. There are tents there on Everest made by me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0193723511434329">
<title>The Transition to “Captain”</title>
<p>Over time, Garcia’s attitude and commitment to climbing developed wherein he moved to professional climbing with a related need to invest in support expertise. In fact, in his first interview in 2001, he associated the status of one man show with his tax status and then later his solo climbing where, as noted previously, he took responsibility for every aspect of a climb, including equipment design and preparation. However, with the necessary specialization required to be a professional climber, it became essential for him to devote his life exclusively to the mountain, thereby ceding some organizational responsibilities to a support team and moving away from the status of “one man show.” Seven years later and demonstrating temporality, he narrates this progression in terms of specialization, his own personal progression and the enhancement of his ability to focus solely on climbing.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Back then I was a “one man show” because I made everything. I was the financial department, the physiology department, the department of communication. I was a “one man show” and also in this starting out period when I went with another alpinist, it was like Hey man, film this, it’s for SIC<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0193723511434329">10</xref></sup> . . . hey man, you don’t know how to handle this image . . . I had to film too! And later, So now, stick this to the ropes . . . hey dude that’s not how to mount the ropes, it will all unfold, no, no, no . . . I was unwilling to delegate work to other people and recognize their abilities to assess tasks. Why am I burning my eyelashes doing the accounts? I’m not a chartered accountant, so someone else has to answer before the Revenue Services. I still write my texts and books, but the coverage of my expeditions is made by a journalist, by a real one. I hired a French kid, Johan Perier, to film the K2 expedition and he made a one hour documentary that is being showed all over the world (. . .) Becoming professional meant restarting with the specialization. I’m trying to free myself from some works to be concentrated on what I have to do, which is climbing. Everyday I’m better focused on climbing mountains. I train and I train for climbing!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Besides this, Garcia reveled in his aptitude to problem solve and the symbiotic relationship between this aptitude and his desire to constantly acquire greater knowledge of his activity. It was the latter in particular that crystallized the transition from what he called a passenger to leader or “captain” and his prioritized treatment of his own body as a high-performance machine. His words, outlined at length here, reflect this.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Even the way I train, it ranged from the triathlon, and then there was a time when I was just a professional, for seven years I only did that. I spent winter in Aconcagua’s, autumn in Island Peak, later springtime in the Alps, later the summer in Kilimanjaro, later again autumn in Island Peak, and later I had a rest in November and I started again in December or January. It means that for seven years I only did that, I mean training and taking people to the mountains. And now, I returned to train again in triathlon, but it’s a better and simplified training. There are a number of silly things that I used to do in a very amateur way, and now I think they are not so far from what the professionals were doing, the few that still exist in the world. And there’s a scientific perspective, I mean, I don’t train like a donkey, like do this just because . . . No, I know why I have to work in a particular way, I’m able to see what and why I have to work out in a particular way. This is how we improve. This update of knowledge allows me to understand my body system. And this little daily knowledge can seem insignificant day to day, but it can be essential once I get to the top (. . .) It all comes down to the upgrade deal, which is like moving from the passenger seat to the captain’s shoes, it’s such a responsibility (. . .) 25 years ago I didn’t have the same responsibility as I have now. I mean, going to Antarctica<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0193723511434329">11</xref></sup> is not the same, it definitely goes beyond certain limits I had some years ago. I need to train my body to become a “high performance machine,” working at full power to burn fat and maximize the energy in every diet ration.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The latter metaphor—the “high-performance machine”—helps us to understand the process by which Garcia manages his body in time and space and in relation to his present and future activities. Moreover, as with any other high-performance athlete, training has principal meaning in his life. Not only Garcia engages in the physiological training required to prepare his body but also ascribes importance to training beyond the training process itself, that is, he revels in the need to test his physical limitations by exposing himself to extreme conditions. For him, this is the only way he can be sure that his “machine,” his body, can better respond to adverse situations inherent in high mountain environments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0193723511434329">12</xref></sup> Certainly, the present and future temporality of his body–self relationship is instrumental for him in preparing his body and mind for extreme conditions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0193723511434329">
<title>Temporality and the Body–Self Relationship</title>
<p>From his first expedition to the Alps when he was 16 years old, Garcia began to immerse himself in the maximization of his physical capacities. Although still an amateur in his eyes, he already trained very hard:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I trained a lot! I cycled like 100 km. I pedalled a lot. In my opinion, pedalling is physiologically and anatomically advisable for alpinists because cycling movements are similar to the climbing ones, both activities use the glutei muscles and all this part of the body. I used to train in exactly the opposite way that is normally required for cycling: a cyclist usually works more on rotation than strength and I did the opposite, that is, low rotation at maximum strength. I just felt better! When I look at the past, I remember that the others always suffered from shortness of breath as if they had a respiratory deficiency and I was hanging on so much better than them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Over time, this body–self relationship has shifted in emphasis and emotionality toward its voluntary if not compulsory ill treatment to maximize the capability of the mind and body to cope with adverse and extreme conditions. This next lengthy excerpt focuses on the extent to which he was prepared to challenge his physical and psychological limits to prepare for the vagaries of any climb.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The body is just a tool, the rest is up here! The real key is in the mind! The body is just a tool for us to do whatever we please; you just need the willpower, determination . . . It is almost like a machine, a tool! As such, control is fundamental to have the “machine” always up and running, at full capacity. Normally, six or seven weeks of expedition, I start suffering from deficiencies, my legs are weaker and I start losing some resources to get the top safely. And if at that point I can eat something that makes me burn fat easily and save muscle proteins (. . .) I don’t train under an inflexible method established by other people; I’m the one who decides how to train. I follow instructions but they just represent 30 per cent of my training. The rest is personally adapted to my feelings, to my experience, lifestyle and daily reality. I don’t ignore other people’s advice, they help me to programme the intensity (. . .) But I’m still in charge of about 70 per cent of what I do. I need to make a personal statement, because if one day during the expedition I see that things don’t work out, I don’t want to blame anybody for that. I have the idea that this is what I’m still doing (. . .) I have to mistreat my body! If I’m always in perfect condition, later I can’t respond when I’m up there. I have to ill-treat my body for it to be used to difficult conditions (. . .) knowing my body limits is something absolutely essential. [Do you train in extreme conditions?] No, no, I don’t! But sometimes I need to make my body remember these circumstances. If I go running just for an hour, I go on an empty stomach! But, on the other hand, to train endurance, you need to train a tired body. You need to avoid a lot of rest (. . .) [the basic elements of your preparation are diet, rest, and training and . . .] And studying to acquire some knowledge . . . Managing the body is not as easy as managing a computer. We need to upgrade, improving the hardware, updating the information. I would like to do that! To upgrade, but it’s not possible. My knees are beginning to tire out, because in the process of knowledge acquisition, I made a lot of mistakes. Some of them irreversible! (. . .) At the moment, I train more, I try to compensate . . . Age is a disadvantage that we can compensate with more training (. . .) I think in 1996 I trained really hard and I was so much stronger. I was young: 30! At that age I was so fit!<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0193723511434329">13</xref></sup> And I trained so hard (. . .) It is like a machine, your body. The more you get to know its potential and limitations, the more you begin to realize that you don’t know enough, and you start feeling curious, and you want to know more and more . . . [You mentioned in the book that at a specific moment you made an expedition because you wanted to test your limitations?] No, that was in terms of daily usefulness and now we are talking about the extreme situation in which you can have a deficiency like an amputated hand. I was not sure about being off for six months, without any activity, three of them in bed, seeing how my legs had “shrivelled” and were shrinking away even more . . . When things don’t move they get rusty. Hinges rust, and it’s the same with the body. It took years and years to get better. So, for the next two, three or four years my hands were like an ice block all the time. I had poor circulation problems. And that meant more chances to get frozen, so I felt colder. In those circumstances I was so disheartened that I needed to test myself and see what happened. I needed to test myself, to keep up the hope that I could go back to what I loved! I had to come back to the mountains! And, metaphorically speaking, the mountains smiled back at me!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this respect, the reconstruction of the meaning of Garcia’s body as an instrumental source of embodied and disciplinary power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193723511434329">Foucault, 1975</xref>) can be seen as a part of himself that enabled the achievement of his goals. For Garcia, the training process is also an objective in and of itself, that is, reaching the summit of the highest peaks is as important as is the physical and mental preparation required to sustain a high altitude climb. Equally, the physical effects and the deep bodily knowledge and awareness gained by him during these climbs was a recurring theme as was his willingness to test his limits in his return to mountaineering following frozen extremities. Climbing Chopicalqui<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0193723511434329">14</xref></sup> under high altitude conditions was indeed a search for transcendence on many levels and indicated to him that he had a future in climbing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0193723511434329">
<title>The Future: Being an Ambassador for Mountain Climbing</title>
<p>The metaphors in Garcia’s narrative are also useful tools to understand the notion of temporality in his life. The first metaphor, “one man show,” supported by the metaphor on his transition “from passenger to captain” demonstrates clearly Garcia’s self-perception of his own growth over the course of time. At present, he considers himself as the “captain” not only of his life but also of the expeditions he organizes. It is therefore not surprising that one of his future projects is related to the organization of commercial high altitude expeditions. This has arisen from having proven to himself that he possesses the necessary psychological and physical capabilities to continue to operate in this extreme environment.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think I can make a “super-product.” I believe that to innovate is possible, and the future depends on it. I’m interested in working with people with money. If they are intelligent, they will realize that by paying twice more they will better enjoy it, and that going with me is three times safer than with other people. I’ll train them to climb the Everest! It is not just that they pay and I make a presentation of what they must do and I go away. I know that for a three year package, I’ll train them and follow-up their work . . . you know? I will provide them not only with training but also with all my know-how that I have acquired throughout my whole life experience. There are lots of guys that don’t have this perspective so they can’t sell such specific service; what they say is pay me and I just help you at the top. Till then, let the Sherpa take care of you. It doesn’t work! I’ll be there for you! I’m training you to help you climb the Everest, with or without oxygen, whatever way you prefer. You pay, you choose, you are the boss! I don’t want people who do not understand that, I prefer not to have them!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The second metaphor, “the high-performance machine,” is also essential to understanding Garcia’s future. As has been noted, the physical requirements of climbing at high altitude have meant that Garcia’s injuries affect his current training program. He is also intimately aware that his body has limits.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I know my body limitations. Even if we can find some rare exceptions like Carlos Sorian who continues climbing 8,000 metre peaks at the age of 72, most climbers normally know when to retire in time from mountaineering. We need to know when to stop climbing because there’s a stage when we begin to be at risk. Every day the risk increases. I know there’s a limit. I have to guarantee my future, and not only the financial one! I won’t worry about my future the whole time; I mean working, and working to ensure my future because I will satisfy my wishes in the future. No! I won’t do that! It’s now, when I have to make my wishes come true now, now that I have my body at full capacity to do it in tune with my biological clock, and later I’ll try another means of subsistence.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this way, his body–self relationship hinges on its constant reconsideration as does his aspirations to be an ambassador for climbing and to secure its future as best he can. In his words,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My idea is to become an “ambassador of sports,” this sport in particular. I see myself as having the João Garcia’s Foundation, in which I could expand this activity by providing installations and equipment, like rock walls (. . .) Unfortunately, we have rock walls for sportive climbing . . . nothing! I would like to create a foundation (if one day my name were so important) with a museum. (. . .) First of all we create the school, later the mountaineering clubs and the scouts, and maybe one day we can have a top sports centre! These clubs that represent us, that represent Portugal in international competitions, must have a place where they can train. Nowadays, they do not have it! They hang out in garages, training in locations with low ceiling heights, limited places with no proper conditions and . . . It doesn’t mean training new João Garcias, who climb Everest, no! It is more a real sense of looking for providing equipment and proper conditions to rock climbing (. . .) [So . . . is it because of this perspective that you want to achieve the 14 highest mountains?] Well, this is like a snowball, you know? One thing leads to another and every time it gets bigger and more and more compact, so . . . But this is not what motivates me to climb mountains. It’s not like let me climb because then I’ll be more influential and have more intervention capacities. No, it isn’t. It’s just that I have this notion and one thing leads to another and . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The securing of a respected and long-term public image of solo climbing as a respectable sport is also a personal and future motivation for Garcia. Far from being a “conqueror of the useless,” Garcia is intimately aware of, and desires, a positive role model status. In his words,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Some time ago, we were seen and considered as “conquerors of the useless,” now we are considered useful people. We are a source of inspiration, examples of motivation (. . .) Nowadays; I think I get to be useful for society at least as a kind of reference. I’m totally human, with weaknesses, someone who makes mistakes but who still goes on. [Do you think you are a reference?] I think so, yes. And I do, every time people ask me for help and they pay me for telling them this kind of fairytale . . . Most of people recognize the kind of person who never gives up from one’s activity, who never gives it up as soon as they come up against a problem, they recognize this tremendous willpower. I think I’m seen like this because they know me from my many achievements, not just one. I’m in this project of conquering the 14 highest peaks in the world (. . .) and they remember perfectly that I went to the Everest and what happened to me there, and they tell me: “But you still continue!” So, I think basically this is the image people have of me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It may be this that is his ultimate personal project and one which can only be understood at some future point in Garcia’s self told narrative. Indeed, as Scott (1998, p. 33 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193723511434329">Roberts, 2002</xref>, p. 80) acknowledges, ‘there are limits to individuals’ knowledge of the contextual structuring of their lives and they may not be fully aware of the unconscious basis and unintended consequences of their own actions’. As a result, this analysis is necessarily preliminary in that it lays the groundwork for future work on Garcia and others, given that narrative is neither simply linear nor chronological.</p>

<sec id="section8-0193723511434329" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article sought to expound and reveal the role of the narrative structure, and metaphors in particular, as a methodological tool in sports research and, in so doing, to promote “new ways of knowing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193723511434329">Smith &amp; Gilbourne, 2009</xref>, p. 1) about the fateful or critical transitional events in Joao Garcia’s life as an alpine climber and mountaineer. Crucially, this involved the rejection of the fallacy that narrative allows the researcher “gain access to factual experiences and events” or “in putting narrative and experience in an analogous relationship” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193723511434329">Flick, 2009</xref>, p. 184). Rather, the objective here was to capture Garcia’s voice through the use of narrative as a reflexive tool. The three metaphors which captured the timeline of Garcia’s life included “the one man show,” “becoming a captain,” and the related shift in his body–self relationship, and “being a future ambassador.”</p>
<p>Using phenomenology as an analytical tool, Garcia’s distinctive experiences of time and temporality were also revealed. His early body–self relationship centered on the surpassing of physical limits and psychological fear while, latterly, it has been possible to detect a gradual if not reluctant acceptance on his part of physiological limits given the aging process. At the same time, his self-told narrative reveals the ways in which he has made sense of his transition from a young aspiring solo climber with little or no responsibilities to one who has assumed personal and professional responsibility for, if not leadership of, his climbing team and his current and future clients. He also aspires to influence the future public image and status of mountain climbing in Portugal and beyond. It is clear that Garcia anchors his life around solo climbing and the reconstruction of his body–self relationship is ongoing in light of the aging process and the related risks of climbing in extreme conditions. It is also apparent that his feelings of self-worth are intimately bound up with alpine climbing such that the cessation of this may lead to a key turning point in his life, notwithstanding his stated objective of preserving and influencing the future of this sport. The analysis presented here is, then, necessarily incomplete given that it focuses on the result of a told life and a life still under construction. “Lives, it is argued, should be studied over time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193723511434329">Roberts, 2002</xref>, p. 171). Therefore, Garcia’s self told narrative will require ongoing analysis.</p>
<p>It is also appropriate to offer some closing empirical observations arising from the contributions of the narrative method to this kind of study. It has been shown here that the presence of personal objectives throughout Garcia’s life has served to influence his daily behavior and go some way toward explaining his status as a national and international role model. Hitherto, the role model status of sports people has been more or less taken for granted in the absence of a detailed understanding of the meanings ascribed by athletes themselves to their own success and whether they feel their lives and stories can be taken as exemplars for younger generations. In other words, fame or having a high public profile may have less or no importance to athletes in the role modeling process than it does for the mass media and the wider public. Therefore, the conscious self-selection of role model status in athletes’ narratives requires further examination. Allied to this is the methodological challenge of relying on the ability of the interviewee to not only articulate his or her narrative but, more importantly, to possess a necessary level of self-reflection to undertake a narrative. The process of self-reflection is an important feature of the personality structure if not a precondition for the successful application of the narrative method. As has been noted elsewhere in the context of studying national identity, “the process of bringing . . . beliefs out into the open distorts them in some way—perhaps by giving them a false clarity, as people tend to abridge the complexities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193723511434329">Liston &amp; Moreland, 2009</xref>, pp. 139-140). While the reader may never “know” precisely how Garcia’s life was actually lived or the intricate complexities of this, the narrative method has enabled the reconstruction of his meaningful memories and has revealed the meanings that he ascribes to his life. It is left to the reader to engage with the narrative of Garcia, to complete this interpretation process and “to grapple with the (future) possibilities and problems of narrative ways of knowing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193723511434329">Sparkes, 1999</xref>, p. 28).</p>
