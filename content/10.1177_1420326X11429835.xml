<abstract>
<p>A new method for detecting hidden moisture damage was tested in a pilot study. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were sampled from within different building structures and the emission profiles were compared using principal component analysis (PCA). When all 60 samples were examined at the chemical group level (i.e. aldehydes, ketones, etc.), the samples separated into two major groups, representing concrete and wooden structures. Alcohols, terpenes, ketones, hydrocarbons, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and a group of unidentified compounds were more strongly associated with structures in which the predominant construction material was concrete, than in structures mainly made of wood. For the 20 samples from wooden structures, 8 chemical groups were more abundant in those sampled in moisture-damaged buildings than in those sampled in the building with no known damage. These were terpenes, phenols, ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, furans, PAH and carboxylic acids. Emissions from moisture-damaged concrete structures were higher than from wooden ones but more chemical groups were emitted from moisture-damaged wooden structures. The results indicate that sampling and analyses of VOCs inside building structures, and using PCA for data analysis, are useful for finding chemical fingerprints for moisture damages but more data are needed to substantiate this.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11429835"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Working in buildings that are moisture damaged appears to increase the risk of poor health. Literature reviews have shown that there is good evidence for a genuine association between dampness and respiratory symptoms (cough, wheeze and asthma). In addition, less specific symptoms, often referred to as sick building syndrome (SBS), seem to be associated with dampness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11429835">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11429835">2</xref>]. However, the scientific literature is not conclusive about the agents that are responsible for the recorded effects.</p>
<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in indoor air originate from many sources including construction materials, human activities and outdoor air pollution. Primary emissions from construction materials are those from the materials themselves; levels are highest in new materials. High moisture content in materials can give rise to degradation processes, resulting in secondary emissions. These may increase over time and may last for a long period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11429835">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11429835">4</xref>]. In a study by Claeson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11429835">5</xref>], it was shown that emissions from most of the construction materials studied were higher when the materials were wet.</p>
<p>In the Nordic countries visible mould on indoor surfaces is rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11429835">1</xref>]. Instead, moisture within building structures is more frequent, and can often lead to extensive hidden damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11429835">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11429835">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11429835">7</xref>]. Microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs) are produced by microorganisms growing on water-damaged building materials. The MVOCs originate either from the metabolism of the microorganisms or from microbiological degradation of the material. In order to be able to use MVOCs as indicators of microbial contamination, specific compounds need to be identified and complex statistical methods must be used to interpret results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11429835">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11429835"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11429835">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) facilitates the detection of differences, similarities and relationships between samples and variables in large and complex data sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11429835">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11429835">12</xref>]. Recent studies by Moularat et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11429835">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11429835">14</xref>] have shown that it is possible to determine a specific chemical fingerprint for fungal development by the use of PCA. In their first study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11429835">13</xref>], they listed 19 compounds that could be regarded as fungal tracers. In their second study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11429835">14</xref>], the mass spectral data was statistically analysed with PCA and 59 ions were found to be specific for fungal development. The model was also able to distinguish between dwellings with proven fungal contamination from those with no signs of mould, based on validation data from 11 dwellings. The PCA has also been useful in distinguishing buildings with and without reports of SBS, based on the chemical composition of the indoor air [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11429835">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11429835"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11429835"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1420326X11429835">18</xref>]. Thus, multivariate analysis is a promising tool when trying to find chemical fingerprints for water- and/or mould-damaged construction materials.</p>
<p>A common approach when investigating indoor air problems is sampling VOCs in the air within rooms. The chemical composition of indoor air, however, is complex and there are many sources of the chemicals present. When the building itself is under investigation, a method more focused on its structures should be used. To eliminate emissions from sources other than the construction materials and to obtain the highest possible levels of individual compounds, the air inside building structures can be sampled.</p>
<p>The aim of this pilot study was to compare emission profiles from different types of building structures, to look for common profiles and to see whether emissions differ between structures with and without known moisture damage.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1420326X11429835"><title>Buildings</title>
<p>The study was carried out in five buildings in the city of Vasa, Finland, and two buildings in the city of Umeå, Sweden. The buildings were situated in two neighbouring countries, but with only 97 km between them, so they experience the same climate. Three of the buildings were schools, three were offices and one was a day care centre. Five of the buildings were known to be “problem buildings” with a long history of moisture damage (Vasa, Finland), one building had previously had moisture problems but had undergone a thorough renovation and one had no history of moisture damage (Umeå, Sweden). The problems with dampness were caused by leaking plumbing, leaking roof structures, rising damp from the ground and moisture incorporated during construction.</p>
<p>Both building-related questionnaires (i.e. open questions about knowledge of previous damage and visible signs) and visual and technical surveys of the buildings were used in the search for structures with and without moisture damage. All surveys were performed by the same trained building engineer. Only structures with cavities (for insulation, etc.) were suitable for sampling. Samples were taken from the cavities in external walls, floors (ground and higher floors) and the roof space, depending on the location of the damage. In the five buildings with a history of water damage, structures were chosen for sampling on the basis of visual signs of damage or known previous damage. In the renovated building, most samples were taken from within floors that had previously been damaged. In the building with no history of water damage, the only structures suitable for sampling were the external walls.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1420326X11429835"><title>Sampling and Analysis</title>
<p>Measurements were taken in spring and autumn 2005 and in winter and spring 2006. The VOCs were collected by active sampling (FLEC constant flow air pumps, Markes International Ltd, UK and Universal constant pressure air pumps, SKC, UK) using stainless steel tubes packed with Tenax TA (Markes International Ltd, UK). A hole, about 6 mm in diameter, was drilled in the chosen structure and air samples were collected, usually within 1 h of drilling. Temperature and relative humidity (RH) were measured, with a Vaisala HMI41 meter, via the same hole immediately after sampling. Each sample was collected over a period of 60 min and the sampling flow was 200 mL·min<sup>−1</sup> in all but one building, where it was 100 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>. When sampling inside the building structures, a stainless steel pipe (about 30 cm long) was coupled to the Tenax tube in order to reach through the thick concrete structures into the insulation layer. A plug of silanised glass wool placed in the pipe opening prevented particles entering the adsorbent tube. Samples were taken in 6–15 different rooms in each building.</p>
<p>The samples were analysed by thermal desorption – gas chromatography – mass spectrometry (ATD-GC-MS; Markes International Unity Thermal Desorber equipped with an Ultra Autosampler and connected to an Agilent 6890/5973 GC-MS equipped with an Ultra-2 column [Agilent Technologies, FI]). The VOCs were thermally desorbed at 225°C for 10 min and separated using a GC oven with the following temperature profile: an initial 5 min at 35°C, then an increase of 10°C min<sup>−1</sup> to 220°C, at which it was held for 10 min, and then an increased of 20°C min<sup>−1</sup> to 240°C, at which it was held for 4 min. The VOCs were quantified as toluene equivalents and the calculated air concentrations were expressed in µg·m<sup>−3</sup>. The compounds were only tentatively identified from Wiley’s mass spectral database, no reference compounds were run. One field blank for every tenth sample and two laboratory blanks for each batch were analysed with the samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1420326X11429835"><title>Data Pre-treatment</title>
<p>The data was pre-treated as described by Sunesson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11429835">16</xref>] so that each individual compound would be allocated the same identity in every run, that is, the data set was manually checked and adjusted based on retention times (RT) and chemical abstract service (CAS) numbers. At the same time, a chemical group name (i.e. aldehydes, ketones, etc.) was assigned to each identified compound. The major chemical grouping system used by the US National Library of Medicine was followed. Misidentifications, for example, CAS numbers with different RTs in most of the samples were assigned as “unknown”.</p>
<p>To be included in the PCA analysis, the compound suggested by the mass spectral library had to have a CAS number and the amount had to be over the detection limit (0.3 ng). Highly volatile compounds are not retained by the Tenax TA adsorbent. Therefore, compounds eluting before methylbutane (retention times &lt;3.9 min) were not included. Of the less volatile compounds included in the analysis, phthalates like diisooctyl phthalate and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were the largest (C<sub>24</sub>) compounds. The chemical group “organosilicon compounds” was excluded because it was found frequently in excessive amounts in the field blanks (&gt;10% of the average sample).</p>
<p>In order to characterise the emissions from different building structures made of different materials, the samples were assigned to four classes according to the two most used construction materials: 26 were of wooden structures with inorganic insulation (wm); 13 were of concrete structures with inorganic insulation (cm); 14 were of concrete structures with organic insulation (co); and 7 were of concrete and wooden structures with no insulation (cw). The buildings were named according to the first two letters in their name: Bo, Is, Ka, Ri and So were problem buildings, Pr was the renovated building and Fo was the undamaged building (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11429835">Table 1</xref>).

<sec id="sec6-1420326X11429835"><title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The PCA is a method for interpreting multivariate data sets by reducing a large number of variables to a smaller number of latent variables (vectors) known as principal components (PCs). A PC consists of two parts, scores and loadings. The scores describe differences and similarities between samples and the loadings explain which variables are responsible for these differences and similarities. The score and loading plots are complementary and a direction in one plot corresponds to the same direction in the other plot.</p>
<p>The statistics for a PCA model are described by <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> and <italic>Q</italic><sup>2</sup> values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11429835">11</xref>]. <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> describes the variation in the data and <italic>Q</italic><sup>2</sup> the predicted variation. Both have maximum values of 1. A high <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> is needed to obtain a high <italic>Q</italic><sup>2</sup> and a <italic>Q</italic><sup>2 </sup>&gt; 0.5 is generally regarded as good (application dependent). The difference between <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> and <italic>Q</italic><sup>2</sup> should be &lt;0.3.</p>
<p>Skewness describes asymmetry from the normal distribution in a set of statistical data. Log-transformation is used in order to normalise positively skewed data but can only be applied to numbers above zero. In cases with natural zero data, a constant can be added so that all numbers will be above zero. Prior to analysis, the data was log-transformed after adding a constant (0.1) to correct for skewness.</p>
<p>In total, our database consisted of 60 observations (samples) and 18 variables (chemical groups). The software Simca-P v.11 (Umetrics AB, Sweden) was used for the multivariate analysis. Simca uses mean-centring and scaling to unit variance as the default but if all variables are of the same kind and their size and intrinsic variation carry information, it could be useful to leave the data unscaled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11429835">11</xref>]. If the data in the PCA analysis are scaled, all variables are given equal variance importance. This is not the case in reality because different building materials emit different compounds and in different concentrations. In addition, previous investigations have shown that emissions increase when construction materials get wet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11429835">5</xref>]. When comparing building structures with different degrees of water damage, it is to be expected that the variance will be large for some chemical groups and smaller for others. When comparing chemical groups without scaling the data, high concentrations and large variances dominate. To gain a picture of the real situation, no scaling was used in this study.</p>

<p>To compare all 60 samples at the chemical group level, a score plot of all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11429835">Figure 1</xref>) was produced. The first PC represents the direction of the largest variation in the data. Because the data were not scaled, the structures with high emissions were separated from those with low emissions along this axis in the plot. Most of the concrete structures (cm and cw) had higher emissions than the wooden ones (wm) and those with organic insulation (co). In order to investigate how the variables influence the formation of these two groups, a loading plot was produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11429835">Figure 2</xref>). Alcohols, terpenes, ketones, hydrocarbons, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the group of unknowns dominated in cm and cw were most responsible for the separation seen in the score plot.

<p>The second PC represents the second largest variation in the data. PC1 and 2 together mainly separated class cw from cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11429835">Figure 1</xref>). Alcohols and terpenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11429835">Figure 2</xref>) dominated in the samples in the upper right-hand corner of the score plot (mostly cw), while hydrocarbons, PAHs and unknowns dominated in the samples in the lower right-hand corner (mostly cm). The presence of ketones did not differentiate cw and cm and they appear to be equally important in both classes.</p>
<p>Samples located in the middle of the score plot (seven co and seven wm along PC1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11429835">Figure 1</xref>) form an intermediate group, possibly with emission patterns reflecting the presence of both wood and concrete. Many building structures also contained structural elements comprising materials other than the two used for our classification. This would explain why some samples appear as intermediates. Four of the intermediate wm samples came from one building (denoted Bo in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11429835">Table 1</xref>). When Bo was considered more closely, we concluded that it was the high alcohol concentrations in these samples that resulted in the building appearing in an intermediate cluster (data not shown). Overall, alcohols seemed to be abundant in moisture-damaged concrete structures. The highest concentrations were found in cm and cw samples, closely followed by the intermediate Bo samples.</p>
<p>The buildings in this study are situated in two neighbouring countries. One of the buildings in Umeå, Sweden, (denoted Fo in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11429835">Table 1</xref>) had wood and inorganic insulation as the main building materials at the sampling sites. These samples are situated at the far left in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11429835">Figure 1</xref> together with the other samples from the same material class (wm). Samples taken from the other buildings in Umeå (denoted Pr in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11429835">Table 1</xref>) belong to the cw and cm classes and are situated to the right in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11429835">Figure 1</xref>. These results indicate that one of the main factors, when comparing emissions from building structures, is the construction materials.</p>

<p>To be able to look more closely at the samples to the left in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11429835">Figure 1</xref> (wm and co), a new model was constructed (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11429835">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11429835">4</xref>). One outlier in the wm class (wm in the lower right-hand corner in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11429835">Figure 1</xref>) is responsible for the high maximum concentrations of hydrocarbons, PAHs and unknowns in the 18 water-damaged buildings column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11429835">Table 2</xref>.

</p>
<p>If we consider the differences between the wooden structures with inorganic insulation (wm, the outlier excluded) and the concrete structures with organic insulation (co), we find that the two are separated along PC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11429835">Figure 3</xref>). Chloro compounds, hydrocarbons, furans and ethers were more abundant in the co samples and phenols, acids and esters in the wm samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11429835">Figure 4</xref>). The co samples were split into two groups, possibly because of different dominant emissions from the structural components (concrete and organic insulation). Both the wm and co classes contained samples with higher and lower emissions, separated along PC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11429835">Figure 3</xref>). The samples with higher emissions were, as in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11429835">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11429835">2</xref>, dominated by alcohols, terpenes, ketones, hydrocarbons, PAHs and, to a lesser extent, unknowns. In addition, they also had higher concentrations of aldehydes and furans.</p>
<p>The samples from the building with no history of water damage belonged to the wm class. A new model was needed in order to investigate the differences in this class further (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11429835">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11429835">6</xref>). To examine whether the samples from the undamaged building (denoted Fo in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11429835">Figure 5</xref>) could be separated from the samples taken from damaged buildings, the new model did not include samples thought to be influenced by the presence of concrete (intermediates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11429835">Figure 1</xref>), that is, the co class and one wm building (Bo) were excluded. Thus, 20 of the wm samples were compared.

<sec id="sec10-1420326X11429835"><title>Construction Material Classes cm and cw</title>
<p>To allow us to look more closely at the samples to the right in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11429835">Figure 1</xref> (cm and cw), a new model was constructed (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1420326X11429835">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1420326X11429835">8</xref>). Classes cm and cw were separated along PC2, as can be seen in the score plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1420326X11429835">Figure 7</xref>). The majority of the chemical groups were more associated with the cw samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1420326X11429835">Figure 8</xref>), only hydrocarbons, PAH and the group of unknowns were more associated with the cm samples. Ketones did not, as in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11429835">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11429835">2</xref>, distinguish the two classes. When the wm and co samples were not present, alcohols also provided no differentiation. Ketones and alcohols were equally important in both classes.

</p>
<p>Both the cm and cw classes contained samples with higher and lower emissions, separated along PC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1420326X11429835">Figure 7</xref>). The samples with higher emissions were, as in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11429835">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11429835">2</xref>, dominated by alcohols, terpenes, ketones, hydrocarbons, PAHs and the group of unknowns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1420326X11429835">Figure 8</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, the results show that the most common chemical groups that had high concentrations were alcohols, terpenes, ketones, hydrocarbons, PAHs and the group of unknowns. The highest concentrations were found in samples from concrete structures with inorganic insulation (cm) and concrete and wooden structures with no insulation (cw; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11429835">Figure 2</xref>), but these groups were also important in the other classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11429835">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Alcohols, terpenes, ketones and PAHs were also important when comparing damaged and undamaged structures in 20 of the wooden structures with inorganic insulation (wm), but phenols, aldehydes, furans and carboxylic acids also contributed to the differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11429835">Figure 6</xref>). Because wood-based building materials were used in the concrete and wooden construction with no insulation (cw), these samples contained many additional chemical groups that were important, like furans, esters and aldehydes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1420326X11429835">Figure 8</xref>). There seem to be many different chemical groups emitted at lower concentrations by water-damaged wooden structures and fewer groups emitted at higher concentrations from water-damaged concrete structures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1420326X11429835"><title>Temperature and RH</title>
<p>Both temperature and RH were measured in the constructions after sampling. Only six sites (10%) had an RH over 70% at the time of sampling: one wm and one cw sample and four cm samples. Three were external walls and three were ground-level floors, all had building envelopes made of concrete. Overall, external walls and ground-level floors had the highest RH readings. The average RH for ground-level floors was 60% (SD 19), for external walls 42% (SD 21), for roofs 32% (SD 4) and for floors above ground level 27% (SD 4).</p>

<sec id="sec12-1420326X11429835"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, no previous studies have described the emission profiles of samples from different building structures and quantified the differences. The results from this study indicate that one of the main factors, when comparing building structure emissions, is the construction material. The construction materials used have been identified as an important factor in previous studies on moisture and mould [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X11429835">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X11429835">20</xref>]. In order to detect differences between moisture-damaged and undamaged building structures, samples from different construction material classes need to be analysed separately. The distinction between ongoing and dried-out moisture damages, as in the study by Pasanen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X11429835">20</xref>], may be another important factor to consider. However, in our study, only six samples (10%) had an RH over 70%. Another important factor could also be the specific sampling location in the building; in our study, we examined ground floors, external walls, roofs and floors above ground level but found no data clustering on the basis of these differences.</p>
<p>Even though the buildings in this study are situated in two neighbouring countries and the samples were taken in seven different buildings, they were primarily grouped according to construction materials. The clustering could, to some extent, be explained by primary emissions from the materials. When comparing materials, it is reasonable to believe that common construction materials (such as mineral wool) are manufactured in much the same way irrespective of country of origin. Often products from the same manufacturers are used in both Finland and Sweden. Even though manufacturer differences are likely to be small in relation to the large differences between material classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11429835">Figure 1</xref>), they can be important when comparing samples within the same material class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11429835">Figure 5</xref>). However, manufacturer differences were probably not significant in this study, when comparing chemical groups and not chemical compounds. Many of the differences/similarities seen in the models can be explained by the materials used in the structures. The cw samples had among the highest concentrations of aldehydes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11429835">Table 2</xref>). Most of these samples came from a joist floor construction built on an old (previously water damaged) concrete floor with chipboard as the surface material. The high emissions of aldehydes, and also terpenes, could therefore originate from these wooden materials. Many of the samples in the cm class came from one building where tarred cardboard had been used in the concrete floors as a damp proof membrane. This was apparent in the emissions because of the particularly high levels of hydrocarbons, PAHs and a large group of unidentified compounds (lower right-hand corner in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11429835">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11429835">2</xref>). In this study, the samples were assigned to four classes according to the two construction materials most commonly used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11429835">Table 1</xref>). The results indicate that other construction materials present also influence the emission profile (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11429835">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11429835">4</xref>) and that all materials present need to be accounted for. These results will be verified by more detailed analysis.</p>
<p>Secondary emissions are probably also partly responsible for the differences seen between the material classes. The secondary emissions are greatly influenced by both present and past environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11429835">3</xref>]. This means that an old dried-out water-damaged building structure can still contain high levels of VOC, even though they are no longer being produced. The VOCs can, when released slowly into the indoor environment, contaminate indoor air for a period of many years. The cw and cm classes both exhibited high alcohol emissions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1420326X11429835">Figure 8</xref>). The two most abundant alcohols were 1-butanol and 2-ethylhexanol (data not shown), two compounds known to be associated with alkaline degradation of PVC flooring. Most of the co samples were taken in concrete floor structures with wooden joists and coal dust, sawdust and construction waste as insulation. The wooden material had been water damaged previously. In the 1960s, a laundry was situated on the fifth floor of the building and the fourth and third floors housed a public sauna. When the building was renovated at the end of the decade to create office space, the concrete floors were not replaced. The previous activities in the building could explain the presence of chloro and fluoro compounds. In addition, the different degree of moisture damage and the mix of organic insulations between floors could explain the differentiation of the co class into two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11429835">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>When comparing samples from the wooden structures, eight chemical groups, that is, acids, alcohols, aldehydes, furans, ketones, PAHs, phenols and terpenes, were more associated with the moisture-damaged buildings than with the building with no previous known damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11429835">Figure 6</xref>). However, the model had weak predictive power. The <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> and <italic>Q</italic><sup>2</sup> values for the model can be decomposed into <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> and <italic>Q</italic><sup>2</sup> values relating to the individual variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11429835">11</xref>]. Only three variables had individual <italic>Q</italic><sup>2 </sup>&gt; 0.1: aldehydes, carboxylic acids and ketones. A variable may be poorly modelled because its variation is mainly noise or because it is not correlated with the other variables. Apparently, there is no value in comparing chemical groups within the material classes. Instead, individual chemical compounds should be compared.</p>
<p>The VOCs were sampled from within different building structures, preferably with our constant flow pumps. They deliver a constant flow, compensating for moderate impedance variations. Our pumps had no difficulties to maintain the flow, which means that there was enough air to be sampled within the structures. However, we cannot know whether some of the volume is due to air leakage from adjacent spaces.</p>
<p>All concentrations reported here are only approximate. The use of toluene equivalents can underestimate the concentrations because of various analytical responses for different compound groups in comparison to toluene. This does, however, not affect the multivariate evaluation, because all samples were treated the same way. When sampling, a stainless steel pipe with a plug of silanised glass wool was used to prevent particles entering the Tenax tube. The plugs had in fact retained particles at different degrees, depending on sampling location (as visually inspected when cleaning the pipes between uses). That means that the plug can be a sink for VOCs and lead to uncertainties in the concentrations, especially for SVOC’s.</p>
<p>The sample volume is a compromise between safe sampling volumes and the largest possible analyte masses. This means that when using 200 mL·min<sup>−1</sup> as sampling volume, breakthrough will occur for more volatile compounds and the concentrations will be underestimated. In a breakthrough test in one of the buildings, heptane (C<sub>7</sub>) had a breakthrough at about 13% for all volumes (50, 100 and 200 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>) and methylcyclohexane (C<sub>7</sub>) 31% at 50 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>, 55% at 100 mL·min<sup>−1</sup> and 69% at 200 mL·min<sup>−1</sup> but no breakthrough occurred for ethylcyclohexane (C<sub>8</sub>) for any of the volumes. We decided to go with the highest flow, not risk losing any data. To overcome this problem, future work would benefit from using multi-adsorbent tubes.</p>
<p>This study involved a small and diverse data set, making it hard to draw conclusions if many samples were removed from the analyses. In addition, the study had only one building without any known damage. However, this is a preliminary study intended to allow us to improve the data analysis techniques, providing insights into improving the study design. When the samples were collected, parallel VOC samples were also collected from air in the adjacent rooms. We intend to conduct data analysis at the compound level, in order to determine which compounds represent the most important emissions from the different building structures and find whether these are also present in air in the adjacent rooms. More material will also be collected in a follow-up study to allow us to produce a larger database.</p>
<p>To be able to establish common emission profiles for both wooden and concrete structures and for both moisture-damaged and undamaged structures, future studies should focus on collecting many samples from buildings with only a few, well-defined material classes. The sampling of matched references is equally important as the sampling in damaged constructions. More samples need to be collected from buildings with no history of moisture damage. The results from screening also need to be verified by individual identifications of the chemicals. Then also MVOC compounds could be used as target analytes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1420326X11429835"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study, common emission profiles were produced by building structures made of the same types of material. Many different chemical groups were emitted at lower concentrations by water-damaged wooden structures compared with water-damaged concrete structures, which emitted fewer groups at higher concentrations. Our study indicates that sampling VOCs inside building structures and using PCA for data analysis is a useful method for investigating moisture-damaged buildings.</p>
