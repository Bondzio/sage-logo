<abstract>
<p>Given current environment protection problems, improvement of energy utilization efficiency is a major focus of compressor research. The presence of high-pressure gas in the clearance volume has an important effect on the efficiency of a Wankel compressor. Overflow pertains to the method that fully utilizes the high-pressure gas in the clearance volume. This method is used in this study, and its effect on the performance of a Wankel compressor is analysed by theoretical and simulation analyses. Compressor performance remains at a high level when the ratio of overflow recess volume to the clearance volume is approximately 2 per cent according to this study. Cooling capacity is improved by about 28 per cent compared with the Wankel compressor without overflow, and the relative deviation between the theoretical and the simulation results is kept within reasonable bounds.</p>

<p>With the increasing demand for mini- and micro-cooling systems, meso- and micro-Wankel compressors have been drawing increasing attention from researchers because of their unique advantages, including structural simplicity, high efficiency, and low noise. A Wankel compressor is a type of rotary machine, for which subsequent developments in rotary machine technology have some reference. Some achievements in research on the micro-Wankel engine and micro-Wankel compressor include prototype development and experimental research on performance [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211423729">1</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211423729">3</xref></bold>]. Martinez <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211423729">4</xref></bold>] and Swanger <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211423729">5</xref></bold>] improved the sealing mode of the Wankel engine, after which the sealing efficiency increased by 10–50 per cent. A numerical simulation study of a rotary compressor was presented, and the friction loss and leakage were comprehensively analysed [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211423729">6</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211423729">7</xref></bold>]. When the dimensions of a Wankel compressor are decreased, the surface-to-volume ratio becomes larger and the surfaces in relative motion cannot be adequately lubricated as in the normal scale. The influence of leakage and friction loss continuously increases, and the efficiency of a Wankel compressor continuously decreases with gradual decrease in design dimensions [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406211423729">8</xref></bold>]. Therefore, strategies for improving the efficiency of Wankel compressors, especially that of meso- and micro-units, are key issues in the miniaturization process of a Wankel compressor.</p>
<p>A Wankel compressor consists of a rotor, cylinder, shaft, a pair of gears, apex seals, and endplates, and three enveloped working chambers. The three chambers independently accomplish one cycle with a certain phase difference; that is, the three chambers are in different stages of a cycle. One of these conditions is that the functions of the exhaust chamber be initiated at the end stage of the exhaust process when those of the other two chambers are in the compression and intake stages. During this time, the gas pressure in the exhaust chamber is significantly higher than that in the compression chamber, and the performance of a Wankel compressor can be considerably improved using overflow. The concept of overflow was presented by Dankwart in 1984 [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406211423729">9</xref></bold>]. Overflow is a method in which the high-pressure gas in the clearance volume is fully utilized. It causes the high-pressure gas to flow into the compression chamber through the overflow recesses, thereby substantially enhancing the pressure in the compression chamber, and tremendously decreasing the pressure in the clearance volume. The effect of overflow on Wankel compressor performance is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211423729">Fig. 1</xref>. The sequence 1–2–3–4–1 illustrates the thermal process of a conventional Wankel compressor, and the sequence 1–1″–1′–2′–3–3′–4′–1 refers to the thermal process of a Wankel compressor with overflow recesses (it is called modified Wankel compressor in this article). The rapid change in pressure caused by overflow is shown by sequences 1″–1′and 3–3′. The cylinder displacement (<italic>V</italic><sub>2</sub>′–<italic>V</italic><sub>3</sub>) and the inspiratory capacity (<italic>V</italic><sub>1</sub>–<italic>V</italic><sub>4</sub>′) considerably improve compared with those (<italic>V</italic><sub>2</sub>–<italic>V</italic><sub>3</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>1</sub>–<italic>V</italic><sub>4</sub>) of the conventional Wankel compressor; thus, the performance of a Wankel compressor is also considerably enhanced by overflow. Related theoretical analysis and practical use of overflow in the design of a Wankel compressor have not been discussed in current literature. To this end, the effect of overflow on Wankel compressor performance is analysed through theoretical and simulation analyses.
<fig id="fig1-0954406211423729" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p><italic>P–V</italic> diagram of the thermal process of a Wankel compressor</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211423729-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The effect of overflow on the performance of a Wankel compressor is examined by theoretical analysis. The simulation of a meso-Wankel compressor with overflow recesses is performed with a dynamic mesh, and rotor movement is controlled by a user-defined function. Under the design conditions given in this article, the effect of the position, width, and depth of the overflow recesses on Wankel compressor performance is analysed by simulation. Finally, the simulation results are compared with the theoretical findings.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec3-0954406211423729"><title>2.1 Overflow of the Wankel compressor</title>
<p>The existence of a clearance volume is inevitable in a Wankel compressor because of the rotor and cylinder profiles, the limitation in machining accuracy, and the need for friction reduction.</p>
<p>The thermal process of a conventional Wankel compressor is expressed as the sequence 1–2–3–4–1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211423729">Fig. 1</xref>). The gas pressure in the compression chamber gradually increases with decreasing volume; this increase corresponds to the compression process (1–2). The compression process is completed, and the exhaust process (2–3) begins when the gas pressure reaches the point of back pressure; the exhaust process ends when the volume of the exhaust chamber reaches its minimum (that is, the clearance volume). The exhaust valve closes and the high-pressure gas, whose pressure is equal to the back pressure in the clearance volume, initiates the free expansion process. During the expansion process (3–4), the gas pressure continuously decreases with increasing expansion chamber volume until the gas pressure is reduced to intake pressure. Only then can the intake process (4–1) begin.</p>
<p>According to the analysis above, the inspiratory capacity of a conventional Wankel compressor is determined from the volume difference between points 1 and 4. The ideal inspiratory capacity is the difference between <italic>V</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>3</sub>. Therefore, the existence of the clearance volume reduces the inspiratory capacity through the difference between <italic>V</italic><sub>3</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>4</sub>. To increase the inspiratory capacity and cylinder displacement, the volume of the expansion chamber at the end of the expansion process (<italic>V</italic><sub>4</sub>) should be as close as possible to the volume at the end of the exhaust process (<italic>V</italic><sub>3</sub>). Two methods that satisfy the aforementioned requirement are adopted: The first is to reduce the clearance volume by modifying the rotor and cylinder profiles thereby improving machining accuracy. The second is to make full use of the high-pressure gas in the clearance volume. The room for reduction of the clearance volume of a Wankel compressor is very small when the classic profile equation of the rotor and cylinder, as well as the present machining accuracy, is used as basis. The improvement in performance is limited in such an approach. Therefore, this article adopts overflow to make full use of the high-pressure gas in the clearance volume and improve Wankel compressor performance.</p>
<p>The two-dimensional (2D) chart of the modified Wankel compressor is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211423729">Fig. 2</xref>. Chamber <italic>V</italic><sub>3</sub> functions at the end of the exhaust process, whereas the other two chambers function at the compression (<italic>V</italic><sub>1</sub>) and intake (<italic>V</italic><sub>2</sub>) processes. During this time, the apex seal between the exhaust (<italic>V</italic><sub>3</sub>) and the compression (<italic>V</italic><sub>1</sub>) chambers turns the overflow recess over (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211423729">Fig. 2(b)</xref>). The high-pressure gas in the clearance volume (<italic>V</italic><sub>3</sub>) flows into <italic>V</italic><sub>1</sub> with the low-pressure gas, causing a rapid decrease in the gas pressure in the clearance volume (3–3′ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211423729">Fig. 1</xref>), and a considerable increase in the gas pressure in the compression chamber (1″–1′ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211423729">Fig. 1</xref>). In the ideal case, the overflow recesses are placed on the internal surface of cylinder, and near the apex seal between the compression and exhaust chambers when the latter reaches its minimum volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211423729">Fig. 2</xref>). The mixing process is assumed to occur instantaneously. To ensure that overflow is completed in the shortest time possible in satisfying the above-mentioned assumption, the overflow recesses are assumed uniformly spread along the height of the cylinder, and the circular channel is chosen for fluid flow. Therefore, a long and circular channel is adopted in the overflow recess design of the Wankel compressor in this study. The sequence 1–1″–1′–2′–3–3′–4′–1 represents the thermal process of the modified Wankel compressor.

<p>Volumetric efficiency and cylinder displacement are two important parameters in the evaluation of compressor performance. The volumetric efficiency of the compressor can be shown by the ratio of the inspiratory capacity to the swept volume, obtained by the difference between the maximum and minimum volumes of the working chamber. The cylinder displacement of the compressor is calculated by taking the difference between the volume of the compression chamber at the end of the compression process and the volume of the exhaust chamber at the end of the exhaust process.</p>
<p>The volumetric efficiency and cylinder displacement of the conventional and modified Wankel compressor are calculated using equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0954406211423729">1</xref>) to (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-0954406211423729">4</xref>).

<p>By the way, in this calculation, the effect of flow resistance is not considered. Based on above parameters, the maximum overflow velocity is about 190 m/s and the Mach number is approximately 0.55. The contribution of the flow resistance to the internal energy is only 3 per cent. Taking the flow resistance and the inertia work into account, the gas pressure of compression chamber is equal to, or slightly larger than those of clearance volume at the end of overflow. Actually, the overflow lasts approximately 0.0003 s when the flow resistance is considered, if the overflow recess width is about 2 mm. On the other hand, the time taken by the rotor sweeping over the overflow recess is about 0.001 26 s. Hence, the flow resistance in the overflow can be neglected.</p></sec>

<p>The volumetric efficiency and cylinder displacement considerably increase after overflow is adopted in the Wankel compressor. The volumetric efficiency in the modified Wankel compressor increases by approximately 16 per cent compared with that of the conventional Wankel compressor. The increase in cylinder displacement is about 22 per cent from 898 to 1100 mm<sup>3</sup>, which results in a huge improvement in Wankel compressor performance.</p>
<p>According to the theoretical analysis, the performance of the Wankel compressor exhibits a large growth potential with the overflow design. The detailed dimensions and position of the overflow recess are simulated as follows.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0954406211423729"><title>3 SIMULATION OF THE POSITION AND DIMENSIONS OF THE OVERFLOW RECESSES IN A WANKEL COMPRESSOR</title>
<sec id="sec7-0954406211423729"><title>3.1 Numerical simulation method</title>
<p>A schematic of the Wankel compressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211423729">Fig. 3</xref>) was drawn in accordance with the dimensions listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954406211423729">Table 2</xref>. The flow field in a Wankel compressor is three-dimensional (3D), and the degree of importance of the 3D effects is related to the position of the inlet and outlet ports, as well as their heights. In this investigation, the inlet and outlet are assumed uniformly spread along the height of the Wankel compressor, so that the 3D effects can be disregarded, and 2D models can be used for the simulations. For a simplified simulation of the Wankel compressor, the following assumptions are made:
<list id="list2-0954406211423729" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The 3D effects of the flow field are disregarded, and a 2D model is used for the simulation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The seals apex come into contact with the internal surface of the cylinder, indicating the leakage among the three chambers is disregarded, and no fluid exchange occurs between the three chambers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The friction between moving parts of the compressor (not considering friction heat) is disregarded.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>All solid boundaries are assumed adiabatic.</p></list-item>

<p>The simulation of the internal flow field of the Wankel compressor is carried out using the fluid dynamic software FLUENT (2D). The governing equations for the simulation are the conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy. A finite volume approach and the implicit difference method based on pressure are used to solve the governing equations. A second-order upwind scheme is selected in discretizing the governing equations, and the SIMPLE algorithm is used for pressure–velocity coupling. The internal flow field is a complex turbulent flow because of the high rotational speed of the Wankel compressor. Therefore, the turbulence model should be added to the solution equations. The renormalization group (RNG) <italic>k–ε</italic> turbulence model is used in the simulation. This model is a modified representation of the turbulent flows with Reynolds number in a large range and a case with curved streamlines in circulation regions. The modified terms in Equation <italic>ε</italic> of the RNG <italic>k–ε</italic> model enhance the dissipation rate in the vicinity of the stagnation region, and prevent the augmentation of the turbulent kinetic energy in this region.</p>
<p>According to the analysis given above, the following boundary conditions are used in the simulation.</p>
<p><italic>Inlet and outlet boundary conditions</italic>: The pressure boundary condition is used for the inlet and outlet. The total pressure and static pressure are determined based on operational conditions. For simplifying the calculation, the cycle is taken as an ideal one, and the evaporation and condensation pressures are chosen as the intake and exhaust pressures, respectively. The intake/exhaust valves are controlled by the gas pressure; for example, the exhaust valve is completely opened when the gas pressure in the compression chamber is larger than the exhaust pressure, otherwise, it will be closed fully.</p>
<p><italic>Wall boundary condition</italic>: The effect of heat transfer stemming from the wall is disregarded, and no slip boundary condition is used for the internal surface of the cylinder and external surface of the rotor. The rotor rotates at a speed of approximately 600 r/min.</p>

<p>The model of the Wankel compressor is meshed with unstructured grid. The meshes near the apex seal are refined to ensure that the minimum clearance has a three-layer mesh, which is the minimum number of mesh layers required in simulating fluid flow. The total number of meshes is approximately 18 400, and the minimum and maximum lengths of the meshes are about 0.076 and 0.46 mm. The operation of a Wankel compressor is an unsteady process. The shape and volume of the working chambers constantly change as the rotor rotates. Therefore, a dynamic mesh should be used in the simulation of a Wankel compressor. A user-defined function is created to define the movement principle and control rotor movement.</p></sec>

The pressure continuously increases with decrease in volume until the pressure in the compression chamber reaches the point of the back pressure and then the exhaust valve opens (the back pressure is approximately 1.2 MPa, and the time is approximately 0.016 94 s in this study). The pressure remains almost fixed at a certain level in the exhaust process until the chamber volume reaches its minimum (the time is approximately 0.025 s). The operation turns into the free expansion process, and the pressure in the clearance volume gradually decreases with growing clearance volume until the pressure reaches the point of the intake gas pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211423729">Fig. 4(e)</xref>; the time is approximately 0.033 57 s).

<p>According to the analysis above, the exhaust time is approximately 0.008 06 s and the corresponding cooling capacity of the meso-Wankel compressor under ideal conditions is approximately 354 W.

The volume is approximately 1160 mm<sup>3</sup> after the pressure in the clearance volume expands to intake gas pressure level, significantly reducing the inspiratory capacity by approximately 760 mm<sup>3</sup> compared with the ideal inspiratory capacity of a Wankel compressor. Therefore, the volumetric efficiency and performance of a Wankel compressor can be considerably improved through the rational use of the high-pressure gas in the clearance volume.</p></sec>

<p>The overflow recesses are used to improve the performance of the Wankel compressor.

<p>The effect of the overflow on the performance of the Wankel compressor is considered in the simulation.

The increasing rate of pressure in the compression chamber and the decreasing rate of pressure in the expansion chamber become visibly larger when overflow occurs.

<p>The high-pressure gas flows from the clearance volume into the compression chamber when the Wankel compressor seal turns the overflow recess over. At the end of overflow, the decrease in pressure is approximately 0.639 MPa, larger than that observed in the conventional Wankel compressor. The pressure in the compression chamber exhibits an improvement (approximately 0.102 MPa) greater than that in the conventional Wankel compressor. The intake and exhaust times show a larger improvement after the overflow recesses of the Wankel compressor are set, considerably increasing the cooling capacity by approximately 28 per cent (from 354 to 455 W).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the position and dimensions (including width and depth) of the overflow recesses impose a significant influence on the effect of overflow. This influence is analysed in the simulation as follows.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-0954406211423729"><title>3.4 Effect of the overflow recess position on Wankel compressor performance</title>

The position of the overflow recess directly affects overflow time, and subsequently changes the effect of overflow on Wankel compressor performance. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211423729">Figure 9</xref> illustrates the position of the overflow recess; point <italic>A</italic> represents the starting point of the overflow, and the linear distance between <italic>A</italic> and <italic>O</italic> (called the positional distance of the overflow recess) is used to mark the position of the overflow recess.

The cylinder displacement, cooling capacity, and cooling capacity per unit cylinder area first increase and then decrease when the positional distance increases. Thus, maximum values are realized for cylinder displacement and cooling capacity at different positions of the overflow recess. In this article, the maximum values of the cylinder displacement, cooling capacity, and cooling capacity per unit area of the cylinder are approximately 976 mm<sup>3</sup>, 455 W, and 0.413 W/mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively.

<sec id="sec11-0954406211423729"><title>3.5 Effect of overflow recess width on Wankel compressor performance</title>
<p>The width of the overflow recess has an important influence over the effect of overflow and the performance of the modified Wankel compressor. If the width is excessively small, overflow ends and the high-pressure gas in the clearance volume is not fully utilized. By contrast, the gas pressure in the compression chamber is higher than that in the clearance volume during the overflow time when the width of the overflow recess is too large; the gas in the compression chamber flows back into the clearance volume. Thus, a critical length is achieved when the effect of overflow reaches its maximum level in terms of the optimum positional distance (1.45 mm) and the assumed value of the overflow recess depth (about 0.5 mm).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954406211423729">Figures 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954406211423729">14</xref> present the pressure variation in the compression and expansion chambers with different overflow recess widths. The pressure considerably changes when overflow occurs. The change rate is visibly higher than those observed in the free compression and free expansion processes. With the increase in the overflow recess width, the overflow time continuously increases. However, the effect on Wankel compressor performance decreases when the width is larger than about 2.0 mm. The pressure in the compression chamber is higher than that in the clearance volume at the end of overflow when the length is larger than approximately 2.0 mm. As a result, the gas in the compression chamber flows back into the clearance volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954406211423729">Fig. 15</xref>). The pressure in the compression chamber has a slight decline and that in clearance volume a slight increase at the later stage of overflow under the interaction between the variations in chamber volume and back flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954406211423729">Figs 13(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954406211423729">14(b)</xref>).

The opening time of the exhaust valve remains relatively stable when the width is in the range 1.8–2.2 mm and when the corresponding volume ratio of the overflow recess to the clearance volume is in the range 1.84–2.21 per cent. The exhaust time, cylinder displacement, cooling capacity, and cooling capacity per unit cylinder area exhibit maximum values when the width of the overflow recess is approximately 2.0 mm. Therefore, 2.0 mm is chosen as the width of the overflow recess. During this time, the cooling capacity is approximately 455 W, which tremendously improves the cooling capacity by approximately 28 per cent compared with the conventional Wankel compressor. The cooling capacity per unit cylinder area also increases from 0.32 to 0.41 W/mm<sup>2</sup>.

<p>The depth of the overflow recess also has an important influence over the effect of overflow and the performance of the Wankel compressor. Full utilization of the high-pressure gas in the clearance volume is not possible, and therefore, it is difficult in improving the pressure in the compression chamber when the overflow recess depth is excessively small and also, the magnitude of pressure in the compression chamber rises to a relatively small extent. In addition, a low overflow recess depth results in a relatively small cross-sectional area of the overflow recess and a large overflow velocity. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0954406211423729">Fig. 18</xref>, the maximum overflow velocity gradually decreases with increasing overflow recess depth. The high-speed gas causes severe shocks on the apex seal of the Wankel compressor, thereby damaging the seal strength.</p>
<p>The overflow recess volume, as well as the clearance volume, increases with increase in the overflow recess depth. This increase has a negative effect on Wankel compressor performance. Furthermore, the overflow recess damages the cylinder strength when the depth of the overflow recess is too large. Thus, the overflow recess design of a Wankel compressor must have a rational depth.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0954406211423729">Table 7</xref> shows that the clearance volume pressure decreases when the depth of the overflow recess increases in the range 0.3–0.7 mm. The corresponding pressure in the compression chamber gradually increases. The pressure in the compression chamber reaches a maximum value whereas in the clearance volume reaches a minimum value when the depth of the overflow recess is approximately 0.7 mm. The pressure remains at a certain level when the depth and corresponding volume ratio of the overflow recess to the clearance volume are larger than 0.5 mm and 2.02 per cent, respectively. The compression chamber pressure is higher than the clearance volume pressure at the end of overflow. The opening times of the exhaust and intake valves are almost unchanged when the depth is larger than 0.5 mm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0954406211423729">Table 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0954406211423729">Figs 16</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0954406211423729">17</xref>). Taking into account the effect of the overflow recess depth on cylinder strength, the depth should be kept as low as possible to satisfy the maximum exhaust time. In this study, therefore, the overflow recess depth is set at 0.5 mm.

<sec id="sec13-0954406211423729"><title>4 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>A reasonable overflow design can improve the operational performance of a Wankel compressor. The simulation and theoretical analyses conducted in this study illustrate some effects of overflow on a Wankel compressor.</p>
<p>The volumetric efficiency (theoretical results) of the Wankel compressor with overflow increases by approximately 16 per cent compared with that of the conventional Wankel compressor. The increase in cylinder displacement is about 22 per cent, from 898 to 1100 mm<sup>3</sup>, which in turn results in a considerable improvement in cooling capacity.</p>
<p>In this study, the cooling capacity of the Wankel compressor reaches a maximum value when the positional distance of the overflow recess is about 1.45 mm. The cooling capacity also reaches an optimum value when the width and depth of overflow recess are approximately 2.0 and 0.5 mm. The performance of the Wankel compressor is kept at a certain level when the width is in the range 1.8–2.2 mm, the depth is larger than 0.5 mm, and the ratio of overflow recess volume to the clearance volume is approximately 2 per cent.</p>
<p>The values 1.45, 2.0, and 0.5 mm are chosen as the positional distance, length, and depth of the overflow recess. The corresponding cooling capacity is approximately 455 W, which tremendously improves the cooling capacity by approximately 28 per cent compared with that of the conventional Wankel compressor. The relative deviation between the theoretical and the simulation results falls within reasonable bounds.</p></sec>

<p>A Wankel compressor consists of three working chambers, and each volume is bounded by the internal surface of the cylinder, rotor, apex seals, and two endplates. The volume of the working chambers can be described as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula6-0954406211423729"><label>(6)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211423729-eq6.tif"/></disp-formula>

<p>The Wankel compressor must have clearance between the rotor and the internal surface of the cylinder because of the limitation in machining accuracy, and the need for friction reduction. Considering clearance, the related parameters in equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula6-0954406211423729">6</xref>) can be approximately calculated using the following equation
<disp-formula id="disp-formula8-0954406211423729"><label>(8)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211423729-eq8.tif"/></disp-formula>

<p>The above parameters are substituted into equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula6-0954406211423729">6</xref>) and the actual volume of the working chamber of a Wankel compressor can be approximately obtained.</p></sec>

<p>Overflow occurs between the high-pressure gas in the clearance volume and the low-pressure gas in the compression chamber.

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211423729">Fig. 1</xref>, the volume (<italic>V</italic><sub>2</sub>′) of the compression chamber of the modified Wankel compressor at the end of the compression process is larger than that (<italic>V</italic><sub>2</sub>) of the conventional Wankel compressor. Thus, the cylinder displacement of the modified Wankel compressor is visibly larger than that of the conventional Wankel compressor. The cylinder displacement is expressed by

<p>The compression process (process 1′–2′ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211423729">Fig. 1</xref>) of the mixed gas in the compression chamber is assumed to be polytropic (<inline-formula id="ilm10954406211423729"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-0954406211423729"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>'</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>'</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup> </mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>'</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>'</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup> </mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), and the mixed gas pressures in the compression chamber and in the clearance volume are the same as those observed (<italic>P</italic><sub>1</sub>′ = <italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub>′) at the end of the overflow. Thus, the volume of the compression chamber at the end of the compression process of the modified Wankel compressor is expressed as
