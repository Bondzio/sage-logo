<p>Colin Turbett’s new book looks at the challenges facing social work practice in rural Scotland. Each chapter contains a helpful opening statement, which outlines the content of that chapter. Chapter concludes with a number of summary points and a recommended reading list. The author has made good use of tables and other demographic information to exemplify his points. Case studies are used throughout to good effect and a detailed reference section is included.</p>
<p>In his introduction the author sets in context gaps in the available literature. He discusses that the context for practice changes in a rural setting. The book looks at the themes, issues and debates that surround social work practice in rural, remote Scotland. Themes such as visibility, social exclusion and access to services are discussed. The author sets out the broad remit of each chapter. Passionate arguments are offered with conclusions that consider the future of rural social work as a genre in Scotland.</p>
<p>In chapter 1 the author considers social work, public services and rurality. He suggests that social work in remote rural areas does not operate in a vacuum, offers a definition of rurality and looks at developments within social work, such as the personalization agenda. He dispels the romantic notion of the Highlands and looks at issues such as an aging population and a changing rural economy. This leads to a helpful discussion about funding mechanisms.</p>
<p>In chapter 2 the author looks at models and issues in rural social work practice. There is a literature review, which charts the difference between rural and urban practice and highlights possibilities as well as problems. The literature tends to overplay the differences in practice. Texts suggest that good rural social work practice is good social work practice. Case studies support that multi-skilling or generalism is a ‘best’ fit approach. References are made to the work of Brawley and community orientated practice.</p>
<p>In chapter 3 the author looks at childcare, family work and child protection. Case studies, such as Orkney, are used to support the points being made. The concept of interconnectedness provides a helping environment, which is very different from an urban setting. The chapter also discusses patriarchal, macho culture while considering feminist perspectives. Patriarchy is a common feature in rural settings, so myths such as domestic abuse as an urban dilemma can be challenged.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 is about working with adults. The Griffiths report is considered and that quality is delivered through the regulation of care. However, choice within a market context is unlikely to exist in a rural setting. The author also looks at personalization, realizing that individualization and choice are important drivers, along with shifting the balance of care. This chapter looks at issues such as integrating health and social care, the development of rural and remote implementation groups and extending the range of services. It also considers criminal justice in a rural community and asks ‘to what extent does social work activity reflect the reality of rural crime?’ There is a high visibility of offenders in rural areas with the rural population more likely to know the offender and therefore worry about being victimized again.</p>
<p>In chapter 5, social work with minorities is considered, especially in relation to Scottish gypsy travellers. Racism can be an issue in rural areas. Since 2004 Poles have migrated into Scotland, people who contribute positively to the economy, but compete with the job market. Rural communities can provide acceptance of minorities and the gypsy traveller nation is a forgotten and invisible minority. Scottish gypsies live with a long history of marginalization, case examples are given to support this, while social workers are encouraged to challenge negative discrimination and recognize diversity.</p>
<p>In the penultimate chapter, the author looks at the use of communication technologies. Developments such as the World Wide Web, emails and home working are considered. It is noted that organizational forms will vary and that good supervision and workload management are key elements.</p>
<p>In the concluding chapter the author uses a case study to look at different approaches to intervention. It is essential that social workers in a rural setting understand the locality, employ generalist skills and develop community orientated, collective approaches. A failure to address rural social work will have a negative impact and it is suggested that practising in rural areas is at least as challenging as practice in urban settings.</p>
