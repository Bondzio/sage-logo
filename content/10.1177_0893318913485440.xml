<abstract>
<p>This article addresses two intertwined aspects of difference that have yet to be deeply examined by organizational communication scholars—language and national identity. Accordingly, in this research, which is taken from a larger study on scientific occupational identity, I use Tompkins and Cheney’s enthymeme as an analytical device to explore the ways that participants reject and simultaneously instantiate discrimination in the workplace. In doing so, I contribute to the theory of occupational control by demonstrating how perceptions of language and national identity are used as part of occupational decision making in order to evaluate “good science” at work. Findings in this article indicate, regardless of the common assumptions that “science does not discriminate,” that the concept of good science is based, in part, on the identity of the embodied subject and his or her English language performance.</p>

<p>When communication is difficult to understand, you are not taken seriously if the listener has to constantly interpret. We had many [foreign-born] scientists, and they rarely rose to even a middle level even if they had good scientific skills. The department director . . . called some of them “Bob” just to not have to learn the foreign names.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Whether in a scientific environment, an accounting office, or just in the grocery store, most people accept that language, and the ability to speak the majority language in a specific setting is fundamental to social interaction. However, speaking a language and being accepted as a fluent member of a language community are very different things. This article, which is a piece of a larger research study on scientific occupational identity, will examine how conceptions of language and national identity are used to develop diffuse systems of occupational control and, in effect, provide the basis for evaluating “good science” at work.</p>
<p>Over the past decades, studies of difference have developed considerably in organizational research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0893318913485440">Acker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0893318913485440">Allen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0893318913485440">Jian, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0893318913485440">Orbe, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0893318913485440">Parker, 2005</xref>). However, two intertwined aspects of difference that organizational communication scholars have yet to deeply examine are language and national identity. Due to continuing political, governmental, and social debates regarding foreign-born workers laboring in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0893318913485440">FAIR, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0893318913485440">Gates, 2007</xref>), language and national identity are particularly timely and important issues to consider. Current research available on language and national identity fails to provide a clear understanding of the barriers faced by highly educated and trained foreign-born workers. There is a focus on the ways in which the foreign-born worker as an individual is <italic>different</italic>, in effect labeling the foreign-born worker as the “problem,” which has subsumed any inquiry into how systems of work organize tasks through difference, and research on language has yet to demonstrate a sustained focus on how language performance is used as a component of occupational and organizational structure. I aim to address these gaps in the literature by invoking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0893318913485440">Tompkins and Cheney’s (2006)</xref> enthymeme as an analytical device to make sense of participant reflections on difference and science. The objectives of this study are twofold: first, to develop and extend the concept of “occupational control” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0893318913485440">Child &amp; Fulk, 1982</xref>) in the workplace and second, to demonstrate that the concept of good science is based, in part, on the identity of the embodied subject and his or her English language performance.</p>
<p>The article is structured as follows. First, I will very briefly characterize the relevant literature on language and national identity. Second, I will discuss my methods including my use of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0893318913485440">Tompkins and Cheney’s (2006)</xref> enthymeme. Third, I will provide a sampling of my analysis and point to the ways that discrimination regarding difference is both explicitly avoided and implicitly instantiated. In closing, I will focus on my theoretical development of occupational control, and offer advice for practitioners in the field.</p>

<title>Literature Review and Theoretical Frame</title>
<p>Scholars studying difference in the United States have established the value of exploring difference at both organizational and occupational levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318913485440">Acker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318913485440">Ashcraft, 2007</xref>) and have demonstrated that aspects of difference, particularly race and gender, play significant roles in institutional and occupational development as well as communicative experience. The majority of research in organizational studies, however, does not study cases of nondomestic difference within a domestic context. In this section, I respectively explore contemporary research on national identity and language to determine what has been established and what can still be contributed.</p>
<sec id="section2-0893318913485440">
<title>National Identity</title>
<p>Scholarship on nation and culture is relatively new to organizational studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0893318913485440">Broadfoot and Munshi (2007)</xref> demonstrate that the overwhelming Euro-American, Western focus in organizational communication has worked to not only ignore present-day globalized organizing but also to silence those outside of the Western mainstream orientation. U.S. organizational scholars interested in research surrounding nation and transnational experiences are still relatively few. Those few, however, have been working to address these silences, amassing a body of research on the relationship between nation and organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0893318913485440">Dempsey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0893318913485440">Jian, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0893318913485440">Nelson &amp; Gopalan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0893318913485440">Reinhart, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0893318913485440">Varma, 2010</xref>). Some have found that national identity<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0893318913485440">1</xref></sup> may serve as a resource for members to rely upon in the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0893318913485440">Alkhazraji, Garnder, Martin, &amp; Paolillo, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0893318913485440">Barinaga, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0893318913485440">Essers &amp; Benschop, 2009</xref>). Contrastingly, others have argued that minority national identity may also be used by those in majority status to alienate individuals in both organizational and social contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0893318913485440">Chakravartty, 2006</xref>), leading to conflicts between national and organizational identity which have been negatively associated with job performance and burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0893318913485440">Das, Dharwadkar, &amp; Brandes, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Nation has also been examined at an occupational level with several important findings. First, national identity appears to have a particularly loaded status within scientific and high-tech occupations. Because of virulent public arguments regarding H1B visa employment and outsourcing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0893318913485440">Rodino-Colocino, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0893318913485440">Washtech, 2009</xref>), national identity is often used as a marker to denote whether an individual has “earned” a job or “stolen” it, as seen in an anti-immigration quote “time is running out [because] America has already lost many of its best jobs to foreigners” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0893318913485440">Chakravartty, 2006</xref>, p. 45).</p>
<p>Second, limited research does suggest national identity affects the occupational experience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0893318913485440">Varma’s (2002)</xref> research provides insight into the ways in which Asian scientists and engineers face discrimination and lack of advancement within their occupations because of their national identity. Stereotypes regarding Asian immigrants as only able to handle “routine, programmed decisions” have created a view of them as “mimetic rather than original . . . [and thus] suited for carrying out other people’s orders and ideas” (p. 355). In addition, concerns regarding language skills are often used as a justification for relegating Asian immigrants to lower positions on the occupational ladder, although the only language-based difference between many Asian immigrants and their U.S. peers is an accent. Varma’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0893318913485440">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0893318913485440">2010</xref>) evidences how occupation and nation are entwined with one another and starts the important conversation about language skill and work in the United States.</p>
<p>Overall, organizational research on national identity and work still focuses primarily on the individual as the site of difference (e.g., foreign-born workers <italic>do this</italic> and <italic>respond this way</italic>) and in doing so fails to critically consider how U.S. systems of occupational and organizational structure work through difference.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0893318913485440">
<title>Language</title>
<p>Language is commonly considered a key aspect of human capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0893318913485440">Lazear, 1999</xref>) that allows for the coordination of behavior, including the ability to access work or trade. One’s ability to leverage this capital is closely tied to whether or not the native language one speaks is also the majority language in their work context (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318913485440">Akresh &amp; Frank, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0893318913485440">Mora &amp; Davila, 2011</xref>). This is because language performance is not simply the correct and appropriate recitation of words; it is an ongoing and embodied performance and representation of cultural competence manifested in verbal, nonverbal, written, and kinesthetic communication. Performances that appear to activate social narratives regarding difference are competence in oral and written communication, noticeable variations in grammar, accent, cadence and emphasis, eye contact, and the use of silence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0893318913485440">Anderson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0893318913485440">Lang, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0893318913485440">Wood, 2012</xref>). These performances trigger associated social narratives that suggest acceptable ranges of divergence in language performance. Those within range are able to “pass” as, or as similar to, dominant group members. Those outside of the range are generally unable to pass and are thus potentially marked as inferior.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, these social narratives reflect that language is a representation of economic, social, and symbolic power. Numerous studies have demonstrated economic differences between those that speak the native language as primary versus secondary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0893318913485440">Dustmann &amp; Van Soest, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0893318913485440">Fry &amp; Lowell, 2003</xref>). Those that speak the native language as secondary routinely find difficulty in gaining stable employment at a living wage. Disturbingly, knowing the majority language in addition to a native minority language is statistically linked to having lower wages than those who know only the majority language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0893318913485440">Pendakur &amp; Pendakur, 2002</xref>). These economic differences signal the power inherent in majority group social systems and hint at the insidious and pervasive mechanisms that function to segregate groups of people by national origin, culture, and race. In addition, because speaking the native language as primary but with a style, tone, or affect that is considered indicative of minority status can function as a social determiner of worth and value (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0893318913485440">Shepherd, 2011</xref>), language performance can also set the stage for organizational decisions about employee development, promotion, and retention.</p>
<p>Studies of language across fields of research have shown the symbolic power of language performance dividing groups and asserting representations upon those groups that are either beneficial or detrimental materially and symbolically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318913485440">Bourdieu, 1991</xref>). Little attention has been paid, however, to how U.S. domestic conceptions of language difference are used to measure the worth of national cultures both organizationally and occupationally. Specifically, current research on national identity does not examine the ways that occupations themselves may promote discriminatory behavior and studies of language rarely consider the ways that U.S. conceptions of language difference play a role in occupational success. In order to address these gaps, I asked the following research questions:</p>

<sec id="section5-0893318913485440">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>This study was conducted as part of a larger mixed methods project on scientific occupational identity and difference. In the first phase of the study, 141 analytical chemists working in a variety of organizations across the United States completed an anonymous survey regarding their occupation. Participants were asked about the makeup of their jobs (e.g., regular tasks, supervisory responsibilities) and diversity in the occupation. Approximately 28% of the participants in this phase had immigrated to the United States which provided a rich source of information regarding experiences of national identity and work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0893318913485440">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second phase of the study and the focus of this article involved in-depth interviews of 22 participants. Participants had previously participated in the first phase of the project and volunteered to be interviewed regarding their occupation and diversity. Because the first phase of the study was anonymous, a volunteer strategy was the most direct way to access willing participants for the interviews. The interviews were scheduled for 60 min and, after consent was given, were recorded electronically. Recorded data yielded 371 single-spaced pages of transcripts.</p>
<p>Interview participants were diverse in education and occupational tenure, age, national origin, and gender. Of the 22 participants, 36% identified as U.S.-born males, 23% identified as foreign-born males, 27% identified as U.S.-born females, and 14% identified as foreign-born females. These percentages (37% foreign-born/63% U.S.-born) indicate a slightly higher representation of foreign-born participants than is represented in the chemistry field as a whole (21%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0893318913485440">Chemcensus, 2005</xref>), which was not considered problematic since the interviews aimed to understand, from myriad perspectives, the experiences of working as and working with foreign-born individuals in U.S. organizations. Participants’ ages ranged from 34 to 64 years, and their occupational titles in the field ranged from Research Associate to Professor to Senior Vice President. Participants identified their national origins as Australia (<italic>n</italic> = 1), Bulgaria (<italic>n</italic> = 1), China (<italic>n</italic> = 3), Egypt (<italic>n</italic> = 1), Germany (<italic>n</italic> = 1), Sweden (<italic>n</italic> = 1), and the United States (<italic>n</italic> = 14).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0893318913485440">3</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0893318913485440">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Survey data gathered in the first phase of the project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0893318913485440">Wells, 2010</xref>) indicated that foreign-born participants felt that differences in language skill and fluency in the United States workplace affected one’s ability to be included as a full member of a group at a higher degree than U.S.-born participants reported. Interview responses in this second phase of the research indicated that both U.S.-born and foreign-born participants saw language as a key issue at work with U.S.-born participants highlighting language issues in great detail. Through the mixed methods approach used in the larger project, a disjuncture between U.S.-born quantitative and qualitative responses regarding the importance of language ability became evident. These differences in findings prompted me to inquire how shifts in participant communication allowed such inconsistencies to coincide.</p>
<p>To access these shifts, I reviewed participant responses to my questions asking about the skills necessary to function as a “good analytical chemist” and whether participants believed issues of difference or diversity ever played a role in the analytical chemistry occupation, and, if so, what role those differences played. Throughout the course of their responses, many participants referred to language and communication as important aspects of the analytical chemistry occupation. Their answers demonstrated: (a) a consistent message regarding the necessity for clear, direct communication in analytical chemistry occupations performed in U.S. scientific teams and (b) a concern that not all analytical chemists could adequately enact that type of communication. Multiple reviews and analyses of the interview data revealed a pattern in participants’ stories. Responses across participants demonstrated a “syllogistic decision-making process” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0893318913485440">Tompkins &amp; Cheney, 2006</xref>, p. 189) regarding communication and difference in science.</p>
<p>After identifying this pattern, I chose to use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0893318913485440">Tompkins and Cheney’s (2006)</xref> enthymeme as an analytical device to further explore and develop findings from participant responses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0893318913485440">Tompkins and Cheney (2006)</xref>, in discussion of organizational identification and control in the workplace, develop the concept of the enthymeme to include two subsets in order to explain the ways employers develop and maintain organizational identification. Enthymeme<sub>1</sub> suggests that throughout primary socialization, individuals learn and internalize socially appropriate expectations and values. Later in life, employers will expect employees to apply these premises to their own decision making regarding work (e.g., Premise: hard work is a valuable trait/Conclusion: I want to work hard for my employer). However, because working individuals have to consider all aspects of their lives when making decisions, employers cannot always assume that employees will apply the premise that will most benefit the employer. As a result, enthymeme<sub>2</sub> is “a syllogistic decision-making process, individual or collective, in which a conclusion is drawn from premises (beliefs, values, expectations) inculcated in the decision maker(s) by the controlling members of the organization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0893318913485440">Tompkins &amp; Cheney, 2006</xref>, p. 168).</p>
<p>Using Tompkins and Cheney’s enthymeme as an analytical device is incredibly valuable for several reasons. First, in matters of difference, people are not often explicit regarding their views. In order to be polite or politically correct, people tend to share their opinions through the unsaid. The enthymeme recognizes this characteristic in human speech and thus aims to look for the implied rather than stated. Second, through analyzing the explicit we see the individual’s ideal worldview evidenced. This component of the enthymeme provides us the opportunity to appreciate the disconnect between the idealized and the actualized. Finally, it provides a mechanism to analyze unobtrusive control in organizations by allowing researchers to pinpoint the ways that beliefs, whether accurate or inaccurate, said or unsaid, can play legitimate roles in workplace decisions.</p>

<title>The Communication-Difference Enthymeme of Science</title>
<p>The premises which occupational practitioners relied on in their reflections of difference facilitated my development of the communication-difference enthymeme of science. This enthymeme, is made up of three parts. It starts with a premise considered true<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0893318913485440">5</xref></sup> by survey and interview participants: (a) Doing good science is all that matters in U.S. organizations. If the first premise is combined with another premise also considered true, in this case, (b) Many foreign-born workers cannot effectively communicate verbally or culturally, then the conclusion can also be considered true (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0893318913485440">Rieke, Sillars, &amp; Peterson, 2009</xref>). Here, the conclusion is (c) Many foreign-born workers cannot always do “good science” in the United States. As with all enthymemes, most participants omitted one premise or the conclusion from their discussions. For instance, some offered in a story that good science has nothing to do with difference. Yet later, in the same story or in an entirely new story, they detailed the ways in which behaviors and beliefs associated with difference impeded good scientific work or affected their decisions about scientists. Many participants (both U.S.- and foreign-born) labored to demonstrate that they did not harbor specific biases against individuals of different cultures or national origins and appeared distinctly uncomfortable when faced with making sense of their occupational practices as related to diversity. Without exerting effort to complete the syllogism, individuals did not have to consider how discourses of difference are woven into science in the United States.</p>
<p>The majority of participants (foreign- and U.S.-born) contributed at multiple levels to the communication-difference enthymeme of science, which implies difference can impede good science in the United States. This finding indicates that social, cultural, and linguistic performances, even though rarely discussed directly in science, have a significant impact on worker experience. Because language discrimination is happening through moments of subtle occupational control, U.S.-born participants might not recognize how ingrained occupational beliefs about language inform their day-to-day decisions about the occupation in ways which contradict their own personal beliefs about diversity. In other words, what they say and what they do may not always coincide.</p>
<p>The following analysis will demonstrate through the communication-difference enthymeme of science that language difference manifests as an issue of power and politics at work that results in privilege for those using dominant forms of communication and oppression for those that do not.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0893318913485440">
<title>Doing Good Science Is All That Matters in U.S. Organizations</title>
<p>A commonly heard expression is that science itself is an international language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318913485440">Benfield &amp; Howard, 2000</xref>), coming from the idea that science operates outside of, or beyond, the “normal” interactional parameters of communication (e.g., 2 hydrogen + 1 oxygen = H<sub>2</sub>O). In contrast to critical theories which assume that all knowledge is based in power relationships and can consequently shift based on context, the field of analytical chemistry assumes that knowledge shifts only through fact-based calculations. Analytical chemistry and similar scientific fields presume that the practice of positivist methods ensures good science. These conceptions of science were a common theme with interview participants. The majority of participants who spoke broadly about the field of science referred both directly and indirectly to this phenomenon, suggesting that through a focus on scientific equations above all else, quality work in the field of analytical chemistry can be done, as one participant put it “ . . . science is more of . . . an international language” (Interview 1,119) or another stated: “ . . . we live in a world of equations and I do everything to promote that particular stereotype . . . I’d like to see more of the highly structured thinking that I think promotes quality work, but it doesn’t always work that way” (Interview 1,130).</p>
<p>Because participants saw science as an international language, as a way of communicating across differences, they suggested that issues of difference would not impact good analytical chemistry. The belief that good science transcends difference makes a case for treating all scientists as “bodyless” and consequently for not examining the role difference plays in scientific occupations. This forms an underlying theory in science that difference does not require examination due to its logical lack of place in the field. The implication of the first premise (Doing good science is all that matters in U.S. organizations) suggests that the occupation functions as a filter; it does not obviously exclude, but subtly limits what passes through. Analytical chemists are placed in the filter, which then allows those who do “good science” to pass through. From this perspective, it seems obvious that the occupation does not discriminate, it is simply the product of a functioning meritocracy where the “important” traits such as intelligence, technical skill, and education are what matter. However, I assert that the concept of “good science” and its attending meritocratic discourses in contemporary U.S. scientific organizations are designed and built in reference to the primarily U.S.-born, White individuals that made them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0893318913485440">Simpson, 2008</xref>). In this way, when the occupation filters for the good scientist it is a particular, unexamined embodied subject that passes through. Crucially, the filtering process appears passive. It seems that things like intelligence, technical skill, and education are simply evidenced neutrally and naturally; but the rules of measurement are not natural at all. Meritocracy and good science are designed through discourses of power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0893318913485440">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Participants’ powerful reflections on “good science” made the importance of developing an explicit definition of the concept crucial. I thus asked about the requirements of being an analytical chemist.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You need to be creative to overcome challenges and very detail oriented which is why they’re called “anal” chemists sometimes, in that you keep meticulous notes so that you can go back and discover where, if something failed why it failed and overcome that challenge. If you don’t take the initiative to solve a problem, it’s probably not going to get solved. It’s just going to keep going and continue to have problems until it becomes catastrophic. (Interview 11,232)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To be an analytical chemist it is essential to be inventive and open to new ideas, but as the participant states, it is also crucial to be “anal” in your attention to detail. It is not surprising then that the combination of skills participants reported possessing (e.g., technical precision and attention to detail) were also identified as promoting good science, and more specifically promoting the practice of good analytical chemistry work. However, when summarizing their occupation, most participants added an important caveat to good work. “. . . A consistently good analytical work ethic and problem solving <italic>and then the ability to communicate that to people</italic> [is what makes a good analytical chemist]” (Interview, 1,215, <italic>italics added</italic>). The practice of good science is predicated on the expectation that it can be communicated well; the “ability to communicate best science is most important” (Survey Data). Good science appears to be as much a matter of language and communication skill as it is a scientific and technical skill. Participants maintained that without the ability to communicate the results that one produces, one’s technical skills become irrelevant. This switch from fact-based calculations to discourses associated with the efficacy of linguistic and cultural performance is critical. Good science is measured not just through calculations but through communication, and those who have the capacity to do the measuring are those dominant in forms of communication, both language and culture, considered appropriate for science.</p>
<p>The concept of good science was expanded upon by participants in multiple interviews. From their reflections it was clear that they believed human differences are immaterial to scientific pursuits. The scientific episteme has no place for consideration of things not objectively manifested in the research process and, as a result, participants were able to suggest that discrimination has no home in the quest for good science. The excerpts provided throughout this section typify references made by participants regarding good science and good scientists.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If you’re a good scientist [then] I think people will respect your opinions and whatnot regardless [of your background]. (Interview 11,182)</p>
<p>You have these people who focus so much on a specific theme [of research] that I can see that [diversity] probably doesn’t play such a big role. (Interview 1,117)</p>
<p>What matters is how smart you are, how well you understand the techniques and how you apply . . . the techniques to what problems. (Interview 11,202)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When asked about the stereotypical image of an analytical chemist, one participant responded, “Don’t know, don’t care. The question is, are they a good analytical chemist?” (Survey Data). These responses, from both the survey and interview participants, exemplify the paradoxical effects of employing the scientific episteme to human bodies. By ignoring differences above all else, participants are practicing what is often preached in discrimination prevention courses: focus on behavior, not on background. This epistemological approach will allow employees to function relatively free from legal problems in the organization. On the other hand, by ignoring all aspects of background in order to retain the concept of good science, those who are different become “veiled” occupational members. This is problematic because if diversity is veiled it is not possible to discuss communicative issues that arise from difference, meaning that those in positions of power will not likely consider communicative difference openly when determining the meritocratic measurement of good science. This concern was evidenced in participant reflections that became the second premise of the communication-difference enthymeme of science—Many foreign-born workers cannot effectively communicate verbally or culturally in U.S. organizations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0893318913485440">
<title>Many Foreign-Born Workers Cannot Effectively Communicate Verbally or Culturally in U.S. Organizations</title>
<p>With a developing definition of “good science,” I asked questions regarding the relationship between communication and science. I found that if I asked about communication issues versus language issues, participants were more apt to discuss their experiences. It seemed that this slight twist of hand which initially drew the performance of communication to the forefront and pushed language (and consequently national origin) to the background allowed the initial theme of “doing good science is all that matters” to remain intact. Articulated as a deficiency in communication, the issue became not about English as a second language, but an issue with individual skill sets; the deficient communicator as the site of difference.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A lady that works for me from China has a great difficulty in writing, of putting prepositions in. And so you have a hard—it’s very disjointed . . . Yeah, [this is a problem] because what will happen is then pressure is on everybody and it may not be a prejudice. It’s if I have a, if I’m sitting here and somebody’s pressuring me [to] get this result in. I’ve got to get this out. And you say I’ve got to go where I can get it the fastest, and so I don’t want to go and talk to “so and so” because it’s going to take me fifteen minutes longer to understand what they’re saying . . . There are people who will go to another person that works for me rather than to the Chinese lady because they don’t want, I just don’t have time to wrestle with it. (Interview 1,215)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The focus on time use as the key problem in this communication provided the participant the opportunity to indicate that the issue was not about prejudice but about expediency in the workplace. The participant did not state directly that English as a second language was the central issue; however, this and the women’s national origin were evident in his story. Additional references to communication in the interviews illustrated the term was being used without inflammatory intent to broadly indicate performance and cultural awareness associated with native-U.S. status were missing.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[Chinese group members] tend to have language communication problems. Not, I don’t know whether to call it of their own making or not, but it’s sometimes very difficult to understand what they’re saying. And so what do you do about that? You know they’re technically sound and, but I’m not quite sure they’ve communicated to me what the result is. So you’re thinking, “What do I do?” It’s, as a manager it’s not quite clear to me, frankly, to say that you need to go back to school and be able to talk more clearly. That will get you further in the company. Because they—everybody just needs to understand what you’re saying more clearly. So they struggle with that. (Interview 1,215)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This participant pointed out that the technical skills of nonnative English speakers were not suspect, but rather that their ability to share the results emanating from those skills in a way that was effective and clear was problematic; the breakdown between technical and communicative ability was the issue. This supervisor believed that increased education would assist the employee, which it likely would. However, suggesting that the solution to the problem is for an individual to take up additional schooling on his own, while not valueless, will likely continue to perpetuate the notion that this is an issue to only be addressed individually. Solutions like this fail to address how U.S. perceptions of language skill are impacting the occupational development of highly intelligent and qualified groups of individuals from different nations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0893318913485440">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Multiple participant stories suggested communication affects good science and appeared to be counter to the claim that science is the international language. If the language of science really functions as “international,” then all analytical chemists (regardless of difference) should have the opportunity to contribute equally. This discord between participants’ claims highlighted a subtle gap in allusions to science as the international language. This gap has, for the most part, been ignored in the Western mainstream and has silenced a key, unstated narrative in the consideration of scientific occupations and difference—that <italic>science may be an international language, but the international language of science is English</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318913485440">Ammon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318913485440">Benfield &amp; Howard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0893318913485440">Watson, 1986</xref>). Scientists from non-English-speaking countries have known this for some time. Scientists who do not speak English, or who speak English as a second language but choose not to publish in English scientific journals, are rarely acknowledged or even known for their scientific contributions in the United States and Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0893318913485440">van Leeuwen, Moed, Tijssen, Visser, &amp; van Raan, 2001</xref>). Participants noted multiple types of material consequences for scientists who do not speak the English language ranging from difficulty publishing and thus obtaining funding and grants to decreased opportunities for promotion and even opportunities to develop new scientific skills. For example, one Chinese participant shared:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think, you know, some Chinese are quite reserved you know. They don’t talk a lot. . . . Here in the U.S., you know, you have to talk a lot I mean. But if you don’t talk too much then you have less chance to get promoted. But if actually, if you let [Chinese scientists] be in charge of a group . . . they can do a very good job. Yeah, but if you don’t talk much you will not get attention and people think why you are not very good at this. (Interview 1,217)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This participant points to one of the domestically appropriate behaviors that indicate scientific engagement in the U.S.—talking a lot. Because this interactional behavior is domestically specific, even though some foreign-born workers are not accustomed or comfortable with the practice, those who do not conform will not get opportunities for advancement even though they may possess the actual skills to perform higher level work. Speaking English, the assumed and practiced international language of science, and performing communication through U.S. cultural standards impacts not only how well one is received by one’s peers, but also the ability to be promoted, regardless of technical and analytical skills. The following example, while more severe than most shared, offers that effects of communication issues can not only be debilitating for occupational development but also be humiliating.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When communication is difficult to understand, you are not taken seriously if the listener has to constantly interpret. We had many oriental scientists, and they rarely rose to even a middle level even if they had good scientific skills. The department director called some of them “Bob” just to not have to learn the foreign names. (Survey Data)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This participant points to a basic aspect of individual dignity being socially stripped if one’s communication skills are not considered domestically adequate; the individual is not taken seriously and any semblance of individuality that they may have previously felt in the workplace is erased. It is accepted that supervisors have the capacity to limit the opportunity, direction, and rate of career development for employees. This example demonstrates that some supervisors may exempt themselves from modeling language performance that they require from all others. The irony is overwhelming; those with language privilege expect that language and accent fluency and neutrality be demonstrated by those speaking English as a second language in order to gain advantages in the workplace. These advantages can be as substantial as a promotion or as simple, yet vitally important, as recognition—such as being referred to by one’s own name. However, those who already have those advantages do not have to demonstrate comparable or even minimal skill in using or even attempting another language; even if this attempt is just trying to pronounce an employee’s name correctly.</p>
<p>The second premise of the communication-difference enthymeme of science has asserted that national origin and culture come to play a role in occupational success through perceptions of one’s in/ability to communicate according to domestic norms. Participants hesitated to point to the English language and/or U.S. culture as the mitigating factors in communication problems, but as stories unfolded, those individuals routinely identified as inhibiting analytical work were the individuals who came from countries and cultures where English was not the primary language and Western culture was not as commonplace. This premise led to the syllogism conclusion—many foreign-born workers cannot always do “good science” in the United States.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0893318913485440">
<title>Many Foreign-Born Workers Cannot Always do “Good Science” in the United States</title>
<p>U.S.-born scientists have been socialized to understand that accessing, analyzing, and utilizing information as expediently and effectively as possible is the ideal standard for work performance. However, outside of the United States, cultures from all over the world generate, engage, and use information in completely different, but equally productive ways. A number of cultures for example view fastidious attention to time, regarding working hours, meeting times, and socializing periods and so forth, as unnecessary and often counterproductive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0893318913485440">Hall, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0893318913485440">Wood, 2012</xref>). The United States values direct eye contact and direct communication, while other cultures and nations find both discourteous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0893318913485440">Martin &amp; Nakayama, 2012</xref>). Similarly within social and/or organizational frameworks, acceptable communicative behavior is bound by cultural and geographic norms. Once a person is immersed in the framework, the bounding has little flexibility.</p>
<p>In interviews, participants did appear to recognize when problems were likely linked to differences in cultural communicative norms, yet awareness did not positively alter participants’ perceptions of the employees’ science. While participants generally did not directly state that national origin or culture prevented good science, a number of them offered examples to this effect. In fact, none of the participants appeared to show pleasure or satisfaction in relating their stories. What they did appear to reflect was the belief that issues related to the performance of culture and national origin adversely impact some aspects of scientific work—that this was regrettable, but also a factual matter. Of the supervisors interviewed, a common theme was the concern that they were not getting accurate or straightforward information from foreign-born employees. Supervisors made clear that they did not believe these difficulties stemmed from a desire to deceive, rather that communication across cultures did not allow for U.S. norms of scientific interaction to be followed, and this was seriously problematic in the workplace.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Indians from India, it’s very, very interesting. They, the males especially, will tell people in authority what they think they want to hear and they don’t regard it as lying. And in a technical situation like at [a large company] or where I might have a group leader developing a product . . . I would say, “How is the work going?” And they’d tell me, “Oh great!” [but] it wasn’t. And so what I would do to get around that is instead of having a meeting just with the Indian group leader, I included the entire group. So the group leader might say, “Oh the work experiment is going great.” And one of the U.S.-techs might say, “Yeah, but it is green and smells funny.” And that was a depth of information that I really needed. So you know if you’re willing to get around that you can, but you have to be aware of the cultures and how they think. (Interview 11,231)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This supervisor did not feel she could trust Indian employees to directly and openly communicate the status of research projects under her purview. To address this issue she informally appointed U.S.-born employees at significantly lower organizational levels to “speak” for their group leader. This supervisor demonstrated in this example that “getting around” cultural issues meant not directly addressing them. The issue this supervisor faced was not based in language per se, but was instead rooted in cultural norms as they related to supervisory hierarchy and associated appropriate behavior. Communication is about more than just words spoken; it is also about the performance and rationale for performance at work. Additional participants took this concern a step further and discussed how cultural and nation-based differences actually impeded the process of scientific inquiry:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . there are some very strong cultural differences that I will find that I run [into]. I’m pretty, I’m open-minded and I like to have my guys call me on stuff and say, “You know, we shouldn’t do this because this is really stupid” or whatever it is. But there’s a level of—they’re unwilling to challenge me because it’s cultural that you don’t challenge the boss if you will. And I think they think of me as a boss as opposed to their leader. And as a result, I’m probably not doing the best thing because I’m basing [my scientific decisions] on my experience, and they might know—you know they have the hands on . . . experience, if you will, with whatever the problem might be. And I might be . . . trying to move things along without really understanding the whole problem that they might understand. And between not being able to communicate it clearly as well as the reluctance to call me on maybe being wrong, which I would encourage, but they wouldn’t accept that or feel comfortable with that . . . So that’s a bigger issue for me then, because the culture, the style is different [so] that I’m not really getting an honest answer, [I’m getting] an evasive answer or something. (Interview 11,301)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This supervisor described frustration with not being able to access direct information about project status due to differences in cultural communication. As a result she was aware that she may have made decisions that had impeded project success. She felt that good scientific inquiry required continual challenges and questions, however; not that she could get that scientific process to function for she felt it appropriate given her relationship with foreign-born employees.</p>
<p>Many of the supervisors who discussed issues with communication-based cultural tensions were U.S.-born; however, several foreign-born participants also provided insight into cultural issues while working in the United States. A supervisor discussed the difficulty of working with another individual from his home country and suggested that cultural differences due to different country-based education systems were equally problematic in U.S. organizations too.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . there is one person, he [does not] report to me directly but report[s] to the supervisor who reports to me. Now he’s Chinese so there shouldn’t be any language issue at all and he get his education in Japan and spend maybe a couple of years doing post-doctoral work there, so he spent six years there. He drove me crazy every time he talked to me. He wants, you know, [to] discuss issues with me. Basically he would talk just like, it’s not to criticize anyone, but I think it’s a cautious thing. I think in Japan they tend to, you know, . . . they want to talk, it’s kind of impolite to go straight to the point so you have to kind of talk [about] other things and try to review the case then, you know, maybe ten minutes later then talk to the main point. And it always drives me crazy because you know he would come to my office and start to talk [about] different things, and I say ‘What’s the point?’ you know, “What do you want help with because I don’t have much time.” And so I think it’s a cautious thing . . . Maybe if I’m working in Japan then maybe that’s the way you should do [it], but in the U.S., it’s different. You know we all say, you know, if you want something just go to the point. We don’t feel offended. (Interview 1,218)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This foreign-born supervisor points to a key issue evident in this research that “in the US, it’s different” and shared that he had been working and living in the United States for 19 years and as such had aligned himself with key communicative behaviors necessary for success in the U.S. workplace. His reference to the United States having particular standards of scientific communication should not imply that other countries do not operate with their own biases and expectations. However, it does suggest that not adopting appropriate cultural performances in the U.S. workplace is problematic for the worker and, in differing ways, for associated work groups. The following story typified responses regarding the problems that are common in cross-cultural communicative interactions.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Indians tend to shake the head when they listen to you intensely. And that can be very disturbing because you know, you interpret as [the person doesn’t understand]. And I had several occasions [where] . . . one of the girls I worked with, she would sit there and she shake her head. And I explain something to her and I rephrase it and she shakes her head and then I realize you know, it was sort of unconsciously going on, but at that time when I realize it, so I had to stop my thought [and say to myself] I know what you’re doing. It was really disturbing. And so I guess you know, there’s a lot of those things that are going on between, interculturally that you interpret something differently than it is meant because it comes from a different context, but it makes it very difficult to have undisturbed communication. (Interview 1,117)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this story the participant shared how the cultural norm of a colleague, shaking her head side-to-side, commonly understood in the United States to represent “no” or “I don’t understand” but represented, the participant believed, “I’m listening” in the colleague’s country of origin, actually stunted the participant’s ability to communicate with her effectively. The nonverbal signals indicating disagreement or confusion from a U.S. perspective were difficult for the participant to intellectually override in order to continue the discussion. While this example displays the symbolic difficulty to communicate across cultures, the consequences of unclear or inefficient communication can also be material. Communication that inhibits good science was discussed as cause not to hire or promote. One survey participant shared that they were “uncomfortable hiring chemists that [they could not] understand due to the fact that English was their second language” (Survey Data) because errors due to miscommunication were costly for the department and costly for the organization. In addition, communication that inhibits “good science” was also offered as a cause to terminate employment.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I have been in multiple situations in laboratories where there is a large Asian group where they’ll be communicating to each other and I’m totally not part of that communication because they’re communicating in their native language. So that does affect the workplace tremendously because then there’s a sense of them versus us sort of thing that gets set up. You’re not really sure, you know, what’s going on . . . I’ve had to lay off people and fire people . . . several of the cases where I’ve had to fire people was related to the language issue because we never could get over the communication barrier and as a result they never could demonstrate that they understood or were able to deliver what was needed to be delivered. (Interview 11,301)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This supervisor pointed to a feeling of alienation as the majority member being excluded from minority member discussion. He pinpointed an experience diverse employees have long understood: communicating in ways that isolate some members from full group participation affects the workplace tremendously. The difference in this case, however, is that as a supervisor this participant had the power to impact those doing the exclusion through employment termination. This and similar narratives shared by participants highlight important considerations of resistance to power at work. By speaking a language other than English at work, foreign-born workers resist dominant modes of communication and thus open up a space to demonstrate (whether purposely or not) the experience of exclusion to English-only speakers. However, because English-only speakers function through language privilege, it is likely they will not see their exclusion as a method of foreign-born worker resistance but rather a demonstration of a lack of English skill thus, legitimizing foreign-born marginalized status and prompting material consequences such as termination or glass ceiling effects.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The above analysis provides a striking picture of the ways that language and national identity work to structure the occupation and, in turn, provide rationale for material consequences for those that do not fit the structure defined. The question then becomes, how do these structures inherent in the enthymeme become rooted in occupational identity? I argue that this happens through a distinct type of control in the workplace—occupational control.</p>
<sec id="section13-0893318913485440">
<title>Occupational Control</title>
<p>Occupational control has been primarily conceptualized as: “the collective capability of members of an occupation to preserve unique authority in the definition, conduct, and evaluation of their work and also to determine the conditions of entry to and exit from practice within occupational parameters” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0893318913485440">Child &amp; Fulk, 1982</xref>, p. 155). It is certain that occupational practitioners exercise occupational control to maintain the boundaries and definition of their work. Based on the analysis, however, I argue that the current definition of occupational control overlooks the ways control is communicatively exercised. As such, I suggest that the definition of occupational control be extended to reflect how occupational decisional premises, which come from expectations, rules, and beliefs emanating from occupational identity,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0893318913485440">8</xref></sup> function to control the behavior of occupational practitioners.</p>
<p>The conceptualization of concertive control (coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0893318913485440">Tompkins &amp; Cheney, 2006</xref>) and unobtrusive control developed from that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318913485440">Barker &amp; Cheney, 1994</xref>) suggest that while there are supervisors present in organizations, the primary method of control in many types of organizations comes from the work group’s collective “agreement” to follow standards of practice. This agreement comes to exist through four processes. First, employees accept that they must “yield” to general organizational values and rules in order to function as part of the group. Second, through collaboration in the organization, employees create ways of knowing and operating that are effective and productive organizationally. The routine application of these standards of operation defines an expected structure of work and implies a corresponding discipline necessary for maintaining that structure. Third, this discipline becomes part of normal everyday interaction among employees and is governed through self and peer monitoring. Fourth, these “disciplinary mechanisms” become powerful through their association with values by/in which employees are motivated/invested.</p>
<p>My analysis of analytical chemists’ experiences at work suggests that occupational control functions similarly to concertive control but with a few small exceptions. First, occupational practitioners yield to rules and values of the occupation that they likely see as in line with their occupational identity. For analytical chemists, the development of this identity stems in part from the substantial training an analytical chemist receives to perform work; advanced education including both the formal and informal inculcation into occupational practices, expectations, norms and beliefs, as well as occupational associations which center specifically on the occupation rather than the organization. Second, occupational practitioners create and follow standards and practices in the occupation itself which can be transferred across organizational settings and are assumed as appropriate and effective in the occupation. For example, analytical chemists follow standard validation practices in the occupation regardless of the organizationally driven project on which they are working. Third, these standards are not coercively controlled per se but are expected to be maintained and followed by individual practitioners in order to do “good science.” In this project, these standards of “good science” in the analytical chemistry occupation are examined for their underlying premises regarding difference. These premises are shown to control practitioner decisions and behaviors about difference in the occupation. This control happens in indirect and diffuse ways, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318913485440">Barker and Cheney (1994)</xref> argue, because expectations of conformity surrounding expected ways of knowing and working become part of everyday, normal interaction. Thus, decisions about difference appear normal and to be “just the way things are” at work.</p>
<p>Finally, disciplinary mechanisms in the occupation associated with “good science” are extremely powerful not only because they are associated with an occupational identity in which the employee is invested, but also because of the substantial stake the employee has in the occupation itself. Highly skilled scientific positions require significant undergraduate and often graduate training. In today’s economy, highly skilled employees are often more committed to their occupations than their organization, knowing that their “trade” is what provides them security.</p>
<p>This theory of occupational control is not, in any way, assumed to take the place of concertive control in the organization. These aspects of control work parallel to one another with occupational control beginning to function early on in a practitioner’s education with the development of occupational beliefs, norms, and expectations (e.g., strong English language skills and U.S. cultural modes of organizing are key markers of “good science” regardless of one’s national origin). In essence, this control develops along with the occupational identity of the practitioner such that the practitioner’s identity is bound up in expected self-disciplinary behavior regarding the right and appropriate ways to perform work (e.g., talk a lot, be straightforward). The disciplinary mechanisms are extremely powerful in this work because effectively conforming to them entails occupational success. When the practitioner gains employment and begins the process of identification in specific organizations, concertive control becomes a parallel dimension in which the employee monitors self and peer for compliance.</p>
<p>Occupational control as extended here provides an understanding of how aspects and conceptions of difference become rooted in occupational identity. This understanding of occupational control is pivotal to appreciating just how embedded discriminatory beliefs and behaviors are in the occupation itself.</p>

<sec id="section14-0893318913485440" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The <italic>communication-difference enthymeme of science</italic> suggests that participants believe that aspects of difference associated with language and national identity can impede the scientific process. The ability to communicate (linguistically, culturally, and socially) within U.S. norms of scientific conduct is seen as a critical component of successful work. From a theoretical perspective, this enthymeme highlights the relevance of the proposed theory of occupational control. Through occupational decisional premises, occupational practitioners can rationalize decisions that may feel personally suspect otherwise. The engaged use of occupational premises provides occupational practitioners the capability to call upon discourses of difference that demonstrate that those who most effectively assimilate and acculturate to U.S. conceptions of good science are good scientists. Those that do not “effectively” assimilate are considered a burden to the group due to strained, inaccurate, or inappropriate language or communicative interaction. This control of the use and meanings of discourse provides the mechanism to shape the occupational identity of those who don’t model U.S. conceptions of science (through negative reflections on image and performance) without having to account for concerns of discrimination or inequity (i.e., they just aren’t good scientists).</p>
<p>This use of occupational control demonstrates that communication is the process and product that performs and constructs power. Having language/communication privilege allows one full occupational membership status which includes the ability to (a) have one’s opinions and ideas be legitimately considered, (b) be sought out for information and data directly related to one’s expertise, (c) be given equal opportunities to present and publish data, (d) be considered for appropriate recruitment, retention, and promotion, and (e) shut down or direct communicative interactions with those of difference in ways that minimize one’s own social discomfort and difficulty regardless of the effects on others. Overall, this research demonstrates that while regularly argued as immaterial in science, perceived “effects” of national identity play substantial roles in the performance of and experience in scientific work.</p>

<title>Advice for Practitioners</title>
<p>The findings in this study indicate a legitimate practical problem that organizational practitioners face in scientific teams. In what ways can practitioners promote individuals to collaborate and lead groups of people from numerous nationalities effectively while operating in intensely competitive environments?</p>
<p>I offer two potential suggestions, complementary but markedly different from one another, to start the discussion. The first is to promote organizational training that highlights the <italic>scientific competitive advantage of numerous nationalities</italic>. A program in this vein would ask employees to reflect on the value of science’s current monolinguistic status and the issues that arise from a total immersion in U.S. cultural norms. This training would highlight that, yes, communication is a component of occupational success but, the way we evaluate that communication through U.S. norms of acceptability does not have to be! To make this meaningful to scientists, trainings could highlight scientific developments and breakthroughs (e.g., formulations and methodological applications) being accomplished and written about in non-English scientific journals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0893318913485440">9</xref></sup> Training of this type would ideally show employees what they have potentially missed in their own field of expertise due to a focus on an English-only orientation and, consequently, help them position the creative scientific space as one that is enhanced by the complexity of language and culture. While this initial suggestion aims to develop an organizational climate of awareness and thus promote a more collaborative orientation, the next suggestion focuses on handling the day-to-day communicative expectations and requirements necessary in the lab. This practice would take significant engagement and commitment by both U.S. and foreign-born employees and would require regular metacommunication regarding how, when, and in what way scientific practices should be communicated among colleagues and supervisors. This may include organizationally sponsored language courses, development of organizational cultural expectations, as well as a redesign of communicative processes (e.g., statements of behavior or outcome are preferable to statements of evaluation) for all lab employees.</p>
<p>These first steps toward potential solutions complement one another and prompt both U.S.- and foreign-born employees to add to and develop their individual and group communicative skill sets in different ways in order to meet the challenges of an extremely competitive industry.</p>

<p>For the definition of national identity, I defer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318913485440">Ailon-Souda and Kunda (2003)</xref> who write that national identity is most regularly researched and understood in the workplace as “stubbornly distinctive behavioral patterns” (p. 1074) that often impede organizational ambitions. Here I do not assert that national identity is an objective fact, but rather that it is treated as one in organizations and occupations.</p>

<p>Of the 14 U.S. participants, one used the designation “Indian American,” the remainder identified themselves as “from the U.S.” with demographic data indicating “White” or “Caucasian.” This language points to the pervasiveness of Whiteness being conflated with being “American” and should continue to be studied in its own right. This aspect, however, was not taken up as the focus of this study.</p>

<p>The enthymeme developed in this project from participant reflections was not bound by or to particular organizations. Of the 22 interview participants, only four (two in one organization and two in another) were associated with the same organization. As such, organizational identification and concertive control were not directly examined in this study. The responses from participants indicated a convergence of premises around the occupation—not the organization. Thus, I aim to shed light on the ways that occupational premises of good science control the actions of occupational practitioners.</p>

<p>It is not only the micro discourses of good science that obscure bias against difference in science. The scientific episteme as a whole has long asserted that science and technology are universal, objective, and rational concepts based in “fact,” “truth,” and “reality” that cannot and will not be augmented by outside influences such as race, nation, religion, or gender. These macro discourses discipline this epistemological perspective into an unequivocal fact. For society as a whole, there is comfort in these discourses. They suggest that the scientists of the world labor <italic>outside</italic> of the political sphere doing “the important” work of humankind. It is likely this ideology that has provided stability in science and technical organizing that demonstrates why scholars have had limited success addressing how these fields are infused with race and nation conceptions.</p>

<p>Not to go unnoticed, the nations most regularly reflected on by participants were China and India. These nations are often considered most different from the United States in terms of language and culture and also have the highest demographic percentages in the occupation other than White, U.S. individuals.</p>
