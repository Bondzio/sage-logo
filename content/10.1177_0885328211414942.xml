<abstract>
<p>Chemical manipulations of the implant surface produce a bactericidal feature to prevent infections around dental implants. Despite the successful use of bismuth against mucosal and dermis infections, the antibacterial effect of bismuth in the oral cavity remains under investigation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activities of bismuth compounds against <italic>Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus mutans</italic>, and methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), and to investigate the antimicrobial effects of bismuth doped micro-arc oxidation (MAO) titanium via an agar diffusion test. Cell viability, alkaline phosphatase activity, and mineralization level of MG63 osteoblast-like cells seeded on the coatings were evaluated at 1, 7, and 14 days. The results demonstrate that bismuth nitrate possess superior antibacterial activity when compared with bismuth acetate, bismuth subgallate, and silver nitrate. The bismuth doped MAO coating (contained 6.2 atomic percentage bismuth) had good biological affinities to the MG63 cells and showed a higher antibacterial efficacy against <italic>Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans</italic> and MRSA, where the reduction rates of colony numbers is higher than that of the control group by 1.5 and 1.9 times, respectively. These in vitro evaluations demonstrate that titanium implants with bismuth on the surface may be useful for better infection control.</p>

<p>Modifications to biomaterial surfaces allow for the programming of cell-to-substratum events; this diminishes infection by enhancing tissue compatibility or integration or by directly inhibiting bacterial adhesion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211414942">1</xref></sup> Nevertheless, It has been reported that implant patients with a history of periodontitis are more susceptible to peri-implant infections, even if stable osseointegration appears to have taken place.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211414942">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211414942">3</xref></sup> Moreover, microbial cells can accumulate/breed in the complex geometrical sites, such as interfaces of implant/abutment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211414942">4</xref></sup> or ball-and-socket joints,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211414942">5</xref></sup> and penetrate into deep pockets when proper oral hygiene is not maintained. Thus chemical manipulation of the implant surface to obtain a self-sterile or bactericidal feature has become an interesting strategy to prevent infections around implants.</p>
<p>Titanium surface chemical modifications including various techniques, it is generally divided into two categories: dry methods, such as sputtering, ion implantation, thermal decomposition, and ion beam mixing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211414942">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211414942">10</xref></sup> and wet methods, such as anodize, sol–gel, electrophoresis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211414942">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211414942">18</xref></sup> Yoshinari et al<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211414942">7</xref></sup> used dry processes, to fabricate various surfaces on polished titanium. Their results indicate that pure titanium with implanted F- ions possesses better antibacterial activity against <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> and <italic>Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans</italic> (<italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic>) when compared to polished pure titanium. By magnetron co-sputtered hydroxyapatite (HA) and Ag coating, Chen et al<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211414942">8</xref></sup> indicated that there is a significantly reduced number of <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus</italic>) on the Ag–HA surface compared to titanium and HA surfaces. In addition, no significant difference in in vitro cytotoxicity was observed between HA and Ag–HA surfaces. However, some of these processes were cost- and technique-dependent, and their results were obtained from treatment on a relative smooth surface, some of these techniques may not suitable to be applied to a rougher surface for more stable integration consideration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211414942">19</xref></sup> By wet method, it is relatively easier to produce a layer on a rougher surface although a weaker interface between the coatings and substrate may associate with this wet process. Deng et al<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211414942">18</xref></sup> using a series of electrolytes containing chlorine ions to anodize titanium. Their results demonstrate that the peroxidation effects of HClO generated from the TiCl<sub>3</sub> formed on the titanium surface anodized in various chloride solutions efficiently killed adherent <italic>S. mutans</italic> on the surface. Alternatively, micro-arc oxidation (MAO) is an effective method for producing the porous anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> layer, which controls oxide thickness. By the MAO process, elements in the electrolyte can be doped into the oxide layer in different levels depending on the time, voltages, temperature, pH, and electrolyte composition/concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211414942">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211414942">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211414942">14</xref></sup> Recent study showed that titanium oxidized in the AgNO<sub>3</sub> containing electrolyte solutions obtained a significant antibacterial efficacy against S. aureus and Escherichia coli.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211414942">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bismuth salts have been widely used for treating gastrointestinal disorders, duodenal ulcers, general skin wound convergence and even lymph node cancer.<sup>20,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211414942">21</xref></sup> Despite the successful use of bismuth compounds against mucosal and dermis infections, the antibacterial effect of bismuth in the oral cavity remains under investigation. Bismuth is less toxic than its neighbor elements in the periodic table. In our previous study, we found that the in vitro culture of 3T3 fibroblast cells, which were conditioned by extraction of pure bismuth powder, did not induce cytotoxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211414942">22</xref></sup> In addition, bismuth oxide has also been used as a radiopacifier additive in some root canal filling materials (endodontic sealers) over a decade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211414942">23</xref></sup> Recently, a bismuth compound has been considered to be an antibacterial additive in calcium phosphate cement. The agar diffusion test results showed antimicrobial activities of bismuth-doped cements against <italic>S. aureus</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211414942">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this study was to understand the antibacterial activities of bismuth compounds and to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of bismuth doped MAO titanium. The effects on the cell proliferation and differentiation abilities are also evaluated by measuring the cell viability, alkaline phosphatase activity, and mineralization level of human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells cultured on a bismuth-doped, anodic titania layer for 1, 7, and 14 days. Hopefully we can produce a bismuth-doped titania layer on pure titanium implants, the implants would be biocompatible and antibacterial and thus able to prevent biofilm production.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0885328211414942"><title>Anodic oxidation sample preparation</title>
<p>Commercial pure titanium disks (ASTM grade 2, 12 mm in diameter and 1 mm in thickness) were mechanically polished to 0.5 µm under standard metallurgical methods. In order to obtain an uniform smooth surface, the titanium disks were chemically polished in a mix of nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>:HF = 3:1) for 15 s.</p>
<p>The electrolytes composed of 0.2 M calcium acetate (Katayama Chemical Co., Osaka, Japan) and 0.04 M β-glycerol phosphate disodium (CALBIOCHEM, Giessen, Germany) and superaddition of 0.001 M of either bismuth acetate, bismuth nitrate or silver nitrate were prepared for experiment groups (BA, BN or AN groups), respectively. The same electrolyte without superaddition was set as control group (AO group). Sandpaper (#600) grinded titanum discs (MT group) were prepared for the comparison of the in vitro cell proliferation, differentiation and mineralization tests.</p>
<p>The anodic oxidation was performed using a double-layer reaction cell; the outer layer was connected to a water cyclic cooling/heating system to control the constant temperature of 25°C. The polished titanum disk was then fixed in a custom Teflon sample holder to control a constant exposed area. A platinum cathode was placed in the reacting cell 1 cm away from the anode disk. The MAO process was performed at a galvanostatic mode under a constant current density of 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> to achieve a final voltage of 280 V by a DC power supply; this continued for 3 min at a pH value around 6 with moderate electrolyte agitation. Samples were ultrasonically cleaned and were dried in a 55°C oven overnight.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0885328211414942"><title>Antibacterial activities of bismuth compounds</title>
<p><italic>Zone of inhibition</italic>. The antimicrobial activity of bismuth compounds, including bismuth subgallate (98%, Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA, USA), bismuth acetate (98%, Alfa Aesar), bismuth nitrate (98%, Panreac, Barcelona, Spain), and silver nitrate (99%, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), was assessed by determining the zone of inhibition on an isolated 6 mm filter paper (containing 0.25 mg each). Gram-positive <italic>Staphylococcus mutans</italic> (<italic>S. mutans</italic>, ATCC 25175), MRSA (methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, ATCC 33591) and Gram-negative <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic> (ATCC 33384) were selected for the antibacterial activities test. The bacteria were pre-cultured and then dilution to a final concentration of 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL monitored by a spectrophotometer (Ultrospec 3000, Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington Heights, IL, USA). One hundred microliter aliquots of bacterial suspension were homogeneously spread onto the surface of the agar plates (1.5% agar, Difco) followed by each conditioned filter paper being put on the center of a 6-cm plate. After incubating the agar plates at 37°C for 24 h, the zones of inhibition were determined by measuring the mean diameter of the clear zone. Each assay was carried out in triplicate.</p>
<p><italic>Bacteriostatic effects.</italic> Test solutions containing bismuth acetate, bismuth nitrate, and silver nitrate (0.1% w/v) were stirred at room temperature away from light for 1 h, and 3 aliquots (10 mL) of each were transfered to 15 mL tubes. <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic> (10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL) was added to each test medium and then co-incubated for 0.2, 24, 48, 72 h under aerobic conditions (37°C). Bacterial suspension without selected chemicals was set as the control group. The optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) value of the supernatant of the suspension was measured and was normalized to the control group. The bacteriostatic effects of each compound was evaluated and compared.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0885328211414942"><title>Surface character</title>
<p>The surface chemical composition of the oxide layer was studied by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (PHI 5000 VersaProbe/Scanning ESCA Microprobe, ULVAC-PHI, Chigasaki, Japan) using a microfocused (100 µm, 25 W) Al X-ray beam with a photoelectron takeoff angle of 45°. The spectra were calibrated on C 1 s binding energy of 284.5 eV, the quantified chemical composition of the samples was evaluated by computing the weighted area of each element (peaks of C 1 s, O 1 s, Ti 2 p, P 2 p, Ca 2 p, Ag 3 d and Bi 4f) through the corresponding sensitivity factor.</p>
<p>The surface roughness was measured by a profilometer (Surfcorder SE 1200, Kosaka Laboratory Co, Chiyoba-Ku, Tokyo, Japan). Five disks were measured from each group to obtain an average roughness value Ra. Six individual measurements were made on each specimen. Wettability (hydrophilicity) of the MAO surface was determined using a contact angle analyzer (FTA-125, First Ten Angstroms, Portsmouth, VA, USA). After a 10 µL distilled water drop on the MAO titanium disc at room temperature, a continue record CCD was triggered and pictured. The contact angle of each water drop on the picture was measured automatically by a non-spherical fitting approach. Each reported contact angle is the mean of at least three independent measurements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0885328211414942"><title>In vitro cytocompatibility</title>
<p>MG63 human osteosarcoma cells were purchased from Bioresource Collection and Research Center (BCRC, Taiwan). The cells were grown in a minimum essential medium (α-MEM, Gibco, USA) containing nonessential amino acids and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 µg/mL of streptomycin, 100 U/mL of penicillin. Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C. The culture medium was renewed twice per week. The cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well onto the autoclaved titanium discs and incubated in a 24-well plate for 1, 7, or 14 days for either MTT proliferation assay, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) quantization or detection of mineralization. Cell differentiation and mineralization was induced by the previous culture medium with osteogenic supplements, 1 mM of β-glycerophosphate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 50 µg/mM of L-ascorbate (Sigma, USA). Prior to each test, the titanium discs with attached cells were changed to a new 24-well plate to eliminate the effects from cells outside the disk.</p>
<p><italic>Cell proliferation</italic>. Cell proliferation was evaluated using a tetrazolium dye (MTT) assay. The culture medium with unattached cells was carefully removed from the wells by a pipette. After incubation for 4.5 h at 37°C, the medium was replaced with thiazolyl blue to dissolve formazan. The optical density (OD) value of the dissolved solute was then measured by an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) reader (Synergy HT, BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) at a 570 nm wavelength. Measurements were performed in triplicate. Cell viability was calculated by the mean OD of three individual wells in the same group and expressed as percentage of control (MT group).</p>
<p><italic>Cell differentiation</italic>. Total protein level and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were detected after 1, 7, and 14 days using the cell contact test. The attached MG63 cells in the 24-well plates reacted with 400 µL of cell lysis solution (500 µL TRIS-HCl, 1 M stock solution, pH = 7.4, 49.45 mL of distilled water, 50 µL TX-100 and MgCl<sub>2</sub> powder 2.38 mg) at −80°C for over 20 h. Twenty-five microliter aliquots were transferred to a 96-well plate used to estimate alkaline phosphatase activity and total protein level. Total protein synthesis in the cell lysates was determined using a commercially available kit (BCA protein assay kit, Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Illinois, USA). Two hundred microliter of working reagent was added to each well for 30 min to incubate at 37°C. The absorbance was read using an ELISA reader at 562 nm and was correlated to a standard protein curve. The amount of enzyme ALP of the lysed cells in the 96-well plate was quantified using a colorimetric assay with 200 µL of p-nitrophenylphosphate (Sigma) as substrate. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, 25 µL of 3 M NaOH was added into the wells to stop color changing; the absorbance was determined at 405 nm. The values of ALP activity were calculated as the ratios of OD<sub>405</sub> values by ALP assay/OD<sub>562</sub> values by BCA assay, and the values were expressed as percentages of control (MT group). Triplicate samples from each group were analyzed.</p>
<p><italic>Detection of mineralization</italic>. Alizarin Red S cytochemistry was used to detect the mineralization of MG63 cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211414942">16</xref></sup> Cells in 24-well plates were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 10% (v/v) formaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. The cells were then washed three times with distilled water. Four hundred microliter of working solution containing 1% Alizarin Red S (Sigma, USA), pH = 4.2, was added to react at room temperature for 5 min. After being washed twice, the cells were incubated in 400 µL of CPC buffer (10% cetylpyridinium chloride in 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH = 7.0) (Alfa Aesar) for 1 h on the shaker in order to extract Alizarin Red S. The dye was then removed, and 100 µL aliquots were transferred to a 96-well plate prior to the reading at 550 nm. Mineralization levels were expressed as percentages (%), which were normalized to the OD<sub>550</sub> values of Alizarin Red S assay to the MT group.</p>

<p>It was reported that the antimicrobial effects of bismuth compounds (Bi<sup>3+</sup>) span a wide range of bacteria and affect the inhibition of bacterial growth at 2–10 mM levels, which is deemed therapeutically achievable in the digestive tract.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211414942">27</xref></sup> The total 0.1% w/v bismuth nitrate that makes up 4.8 mM seems to agree with the previous results mentioned above. The Bi+ groups in complex bismuth salts are known to ionically bind to anionic surfactants such as glycerolipids and glycoproteins, the predominant component of glycocalyx.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328211414942">28</xref></sup> This binding of Bi+ groups may displace divalent cations; the physiochemical properties of polycationic bismuth salts might explain the bismuth compounds’ antimicrobial activity against these selected oral bacteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328211414942">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885328211414942">31</xref></sup> However, bismuth subgallate, which has been used to treat <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211414942">20</xref></sup> and aid in wound therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328211414942">32</xref></sup>, reveals no antibacterial activity at this concentration (no zone of inhibition). This is probably due to the low solubility of bismuth subgallate in water.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328211414942">33</xref></sup> Another possibility is that bismuth subgallate inhibits the growth of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> under anaerobic conditions. The little differences in bacteriostatic effects between bismuth acetate and bismuth nitrate are reflective of the different dissolution concentrations.

However, in the present study, 0.1% is below the minimum inhibitory concentration against <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans.</italic></p>
<p>In our study, the XPS data show that the surface of MAO samples contained mainly O, Ti, and C the ratio of which were similar to previous analyses of dental implants by other authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885328211414942">35</xref></sup> The thickness of bismuth-doped measured by the Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) cross-section of the sample demonstrated that the thickness of the titania film is not affected by Bi-doping treated for 3 min (∼5 µm), however the thickness increases and become weak when prolonging the anodic oxidation time to 9 min (∼8 µm). In the BA and BN group, bismuth was doped into the titania layer by 2.3% and 6.2%, respectively. Other elements such as Ca and P were also found on the surface during the high-voltage plasma process and also confirmed by previous reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211414942">11</xref></sup> Interestingly, the P and Ca elements on the MAO surface were not crowd out by super addition of bismuth compounds in the electrolytes. These P and Ca ions may subsequently release and give a high concentration in the local area making the in vitro environment bioactive. This could promote the osseointegration process and result in possible biochemical bonding between bone and oxidized titanium implant in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885328211414942">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Biocompatibility and antibacterial effects are largely affected by the surface roughness and wettibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211414942">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885328211414942">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885328211414942">38</xref></sup> The present results show that the surface roughness and hydrophilicities are analogous among AO, BN, AN, and BN and are in line with previous studies. It is notable that oxidized titanium has a lower contact angle (higher surface energy) when compare to the machined titanium, this may be due to the micro-submicron porous titania layer on the oxidized titanium surface or contribute from the titania nano crystalline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211414942">18</xref></sup> The cell proliferation test results demonstrate that neither BA nor BN will cause cytotoxicity of the MG63 cell line; these results confirm our preliminary cell activity results of fibroblastic-like 3T3 cells cultured in pure bismuth powder extractions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211414942">22</xref></sup> The MG63 cells cultured on the bismuth-doped MAO surface revealed analogous proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity when compared to the control AO group. The alkaline phosphatase activity of the BN group on the 7<sup>th</sup> day was even higher than that of the AN group (marked by an asterisk in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328211414942">Figure 5</xref>). It was found that the induction of heme oxygenase-1 modulates bismuth oxide (or bismuth salts)-induced cytotoxicity in human dental pulp cells (or the human intestinal epithelial cell line DLD-1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0885328211414942">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885328211414942">40</xref></sup> In the present study, there might be the same self-protective mechanism, the cytotoxic effect of bismuth may be reduced by the production of heme oxygenase-1. There was a relatively low mineralization level of the osteoblast-like cells on the BN group on the first test day when compared to that of the AN and AO group. However, the mineralization levels of all the groups were similar after day 7, and the mineralization level of the BN group on the 14<sup>th</sup> day was even higher than that of the AN group. Although it has been reported that the proliferation of the MG63 cells were inhibited on MAO coatings contains 0.21–0.45% of Ag (by EDS detection)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211414942">15</xref></sup>, in this study the MG63 cells cultured on the AN group revealed similar abilities to proliferate when compared to the control AO group. The alkaline phosphatase activity of the AN group on the 7<sup>th</sup> day was lower than that of the BN group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). It was therefore suggested that MAO doped with bismuth possesses less effect on the cell differentiation and mineralization when compared to MAO doped with silver. It has been reported that there may have occurred the risk of neurotoxicity, and acute renal failure when the bismuth concentration in blood over 0.1 ppm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885328211414942">41</xref></sup> In the present bismuth/or silver ion doped MAO titanium, the released bismuth and silver is absent in extractions of the samples up to 4 weeks, detected by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) (the detection limit is 0.1 ppm, data not shown). Perhaps the doped bismuth would have a persisting and local effect on the attached microbial as well as to the cells.</p>
<p>The BN group containing 6.2at% Bi doped in the titania surface appears to have more antibacterial efficacy than that of the BA group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0885328211414942">Table 4</xref>). Although bismuth acetate comparably inhibits <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic> and MRSA, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328211414942">Table 1</xref>, less bismuth on the surface of the BA group does not seem to inhibit the growth of the attached bacteria. It is notable that our results are tested in aerobic conditions, and the results may not be applicable in anaerobic conditions. Further research is needed to clarify the antibacterial effects of these bismuth-doped MAO coatings in anaerobic conditions.</p>
<p>For AN group, there is only little antibacterial activity against MRSA and no antibacterial activity against <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic>. The results indicate that the doped silver in the MAO coating may not be enough to inhibit the bacterial growth. It has been reported that titanium oxidized in AgNO<sub>3</sub>-containing electrolyte solutions under 400 V obtain a significant antibacterial efficacy (&gt;99.8%) against <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211414942">15</xref></sup> It is reasonable that under higher voltage MAO process can fuse more silver into the titania layer and produced a local high silver concentration on the surface to have higher antibacterial efficacy. Although the in vitro data show that the MG63 cell viability and their differential ability (alkaline phosphatase activity) were the same, the mineralization level of the AN group was lower than that of the BN group as well as that of the control AO group. These in vitro evaluations provide evidence that titanium implants with bismuth elements on the surface can improve infection control; however, more studies are needed to determine the effects of clinical use.</p>
<p>Infection around oral implant caused by pathologic bacteria during plaque/biofilm acumination is a major complication leading to potential implant failure. Alternative to the approaches to incorporate antibacterial agents as a bactericide onto the MAO surface, using UV illumination to sterilizing the contaminated surface (to trigger photocatalytic reactions on samples covered with relatively thick titanium dioxide) of titanium has been recently suggested by several researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211414942">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885328211414942">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0885328211414942">43</xref></sup> Developing an implant surface combining these two strategies would be a good direct to provide a more promised successful rate of dental implant in the future.</p>
