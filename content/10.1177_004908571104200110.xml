<p>My earliest memory of Dr Ram Dayal Munda goes back to the early 1980s when a classmate of mine, Anil Mahajan, was conducting his doctoral fieldwork with the Ho of Bihar and had several occasions to meet and discuss his data with Dr Munda. On his return, among other things, he shared with me his experiences of learning from Dr Munda. Mahajan’s words are etched in my mind:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In spite of having studied in America and immersed in the modern intellectual world, Dr. Munda has his roots firmly entrenched in his community. He is one of those few scholars who know their people with as much of objectivity as they know about the West. He is an accomplished synthesizer of tradition and modernity.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At that time when ‘tribal intellectuals’ in universities and research organisations were rather rare, Dr Munda was carving out his niche as a leading spokesperson of tribes and the other depressed sections of rural India. I had a closer look at his writings, not only because these were on folklore and linguistic anthropology, the areas that generally did not attract the undivided attention of Indian anthropologists, but also because these provided a different perspective, what we call today ‘auto-anthropological’, to the understanding of tribal people than was the case in the writings of the non-tribal authors on tribes. Dr Munda’s books and articles were replete with the tribal voice and that is why they were different from the other conventional writings.</p>
<p>Born to Shri Gandharb Singh and Smt. Lokma in the tribal village of Diudi (also written as Diuri or Deori) of Ranchi (Jharkhand), Dr Munda received his primary education at Luther Mission School (at Amlesa) and for secondary schooling, he went to the town of Khuntia. Incidentally, Khuntia was the heartland of the Birsa Munda movement for political autonomy during colonial times. Because of this connection, researchers from India and abroad visited Khuntia and Dr Munda often assisted them in their work. In addition, in Khuntia, he had a chance to meet and compare the members of other tribal and non-tribal communities with his own people. Perhaps, these were the reasons that drove him to do a post-graduation in anthropology (in 1963) from the University of Ranchi.</p>
<p>Around that time, Norman H. Zide (1928–), Professor Emeritus at the Chicago Department of South Asian Languages and Civilization, had a research project on the dialects and languages of the Indic group (Santhali, Mundari and others), which Dr Munda joined, giving him an opportunity to study at the University of Chicago for higher degrees. In 1968, Dr Munda completed his M.A. thesis on the ‘Proto-Kherwarian Phonemic System’ and his Ph.D. work of 1975 was titled ‘Structural Features of the Vaisnava Songs of the Pacpargana (District of Bengal): A Study in the Language of Poetry’. From 1966 onwards, Dr Munda published extensively on tribal folklore and social organisation, languages and the impact of the external cultural and linguistic systems on tribal societies. He also translated several Hindi and tribal poets into English, for which he received international accolade. Many of his publications were with his teacher, Norman Zide, for whom he also did a felicitation volume. One of his oft-consulted works is of 1988 on Mundari grammar. After his doctorate, Dr Munda held teaching positions at Chicago and Minnesota, where he also carried out collaborative research projects with foreign scholars, the findings of which have been published. He also lectured at the universities of Tokyo, Syracuse and Australia. He delivered a number of distinguished lectures, including the Durgabai Deshmukh Memorial Lecture (2005).</p>
<p>The credit of bringing Dr Munda to Ranchi University goes to its then Vice Chancellor, Dr K. Suresh Singh. Joining the university in 1981, Dr Munda was advised to found a department of tribal and regional languages. He played a central role in introducing tribal languages (such as Santhali, Kurukh, Mundari) in the university syllabi. Later, he served Ranchi University first as its Pro-Vice Chancellor (1985–86) and then Vice Chancellor (1986–88).</p>
<p>The department Dr Munda founded became the rallying point of tribal activists, who came together to work constructively for ameliorating the condition of tribal communities. An outcome of this was the formation of the All Jharkhand Students’ Unit, which rendered an intellectual base to the Jharkhand Movement. Dr Munda played a pivotal role in the dialogue between the state and the people, as a result of which the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi formed the Committee on Jharkhand Matters. In fact, it was on the basis of the report of this committee that the prospect of creating a new state—now called Jharkhand—brightened.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Dr Munda had been engaged with the cultural mobilisation of tribespersons. He regarded them as constituting India’s ‘cultural epicenter’. Their survival depended upon the flourishing of their ways of life and their unassailable control over their land, water and forests. He was deeply concerned about the predicament of tribes in the wake of the outsiders taking illegal possession of their resources and converting them into serfs. Using a local expression, he used to say that the non-tribal entered the system ‘like a needle’ and ‘got out like ploughshare’. Against this backdrop, he thought that the diverse tribal communities of India should unite for a long and hard struggle to achieve their objective of living with dignity. He believed that the cases of violent manifestation in tribal areas could be checked if all the constitutional provisions, laws and government schemes for tribespersons were sincerely and devotedly implemented. In this endeavour, he said, the Tribal Affairs Ministry could play a pivotal role; it should not remain a ‘post office’, as it was. As a senior official of the 1987-founded Indian Confederation of Indigenous and Tribal Peoples (ICITP), Dr Munda participated at the UN Working Group on Indigenous People at Geneva and the UN Forum of Indigenous Issues at New York. For a brief period, he was the President of the Jharkhand People’s Party. And, he also contested on a Congress ticket the assembly polls from Tamad (Jharkhand), which he lost.</p>
<p>As a child, Dr Munda learnt the traditional music from his grandfather, Shri Chamu Singh. Soon he was able to sing, compose songs and also play flute and various kinds of drum. With the passage of time, he built up a troupe of dancers and musicians, who performed regularly in festivals. Dr Munda also performed on radio in the 1950s. Whilst as a researcher at Chicago and Minnesota, he put together a group of South Asian folk performers. His troupe led the Indian contingent in the Festival of India, USSR, in 1987. He participated in many international music and dance workshops and festivals, the prominent of which were in Bali (1988), Manila (1989) and Taipei (1990). His troupe of almost 150 persons participated in the World Social Forum in Mumbai and Delhi.</p>
<p>It was not only the aesthetic aspect of dance and songs that appealed him. He looked at all these traditional performances anthropologically, that is from the point of view of their contribution to national integration. In dance and music, he saw harmony, the ability to touch the hearts of people. For him, the local festival known as Sarhul symbolised the unity of the universe, and so he enthusiastically promoted it. His passion for dance and music was exemplary. In March 2011, before he was detected with prostrate cancer to which he eventually succumbed, he participated in the meet of the All-India Adivasi Mahasabha. At one time, when the people were dancing, Dr Munda, as an accomplished raconteur, stepped down the stage to join them, singing and dancing, and also playing the drum. The leader was one with the fellow tribal folk! He always had in mind the unity of this kind.</p>
<p>Dr Munda summed up the idea that tribes would live only when their respective cultures survived by using a phrase from Nagpuri, a regional language of Jharkhand, which was: <italic>nāci se bāci</italic> (‘one who dances, survives’; ‘by dance, survive’; ‘one who knows to dance will always live’). In 1993, he created a tradition around this phrase, implying that the term dance symbolised the ‘culture of people’ and if people ‘danced’, meaning thereby that if they had their cultural designs intact, they would be able to withstand all vicissitudes of life and survive well. It would remind one of the famous statement from the work of W. H. R. Rivers, the British anthropologist, ‘the tribe that dances never dies’. Because of his contribution to regional arts and aesthetic activities, Dr Munda received in 2007 the Sangeet Natak Academy Award, and in 2010, Padma Shri. He also became a member of Rajya Sabha in March 2010.</p>
<p>With this vision, he revived in the villages of Jharkhand the open-air theatres (<italic>akhārā</italic>), where people could practice dance and music. One of the projects he had in mind was to build a big <italic>akhārā</italic> on Tagore Hills in Ranchi. He also wished a modernisation of these places by offering facilities like library, discussion rooms and computer laboratories, so that research could be conducted on traditional performances, and the culture of people could grow salubriously. He had also kept aside a sum of ₹95 lakhs from his M.P. Area Development Fund for building and modernising <italic>akhārā</italic>s. We have now learnt that the Chief Minister of Jharkhand has decided to transform Tagore Hall into an open-air theatre as was envisaged by Dr Munda.</p>
<p>Dr Munda’s memory will last forever through the institutions he enlivened and the efforts he unswervingly made to keep the tribal culture intact, a work that his disciples and admirers would carry forward.</p>
