<abstract>
<p>I argue in this comment that Hunt’s analysis of the intelligence of nations is smarter than it is wise. It is based on too narrow a conception of intelligence. It also conflates correlation and causation with regard to the relation between IQ and socially defined success, both individual and familial. I suggest that a better approach might be to compare nations as well for their creativity and wisdom.</p>

<p>Since earliest times, nations, cultural groups, and other human collectivities have been trying to show that they are better than other comparable groups. Historically, the main way of doing this has been through wars. One nation would show its superiority to another by conquering that other nation. But in modern times, there is less violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1745691612443829">Pinker, 2011</xref>), perhaps because there are diverse and less violent ways of proving our people are better than your people. Groups now can attempt to show economic, technological, cultural, athletic, religious, or other kinds of superiority. Moreover, they can gain the fruits of these various kinds of superiorities, as, say, China is now doing in the realm of the economy.</p>
<p>Academics typically seek intellectual rather than physical battlegrounds, and psychological scientists, in particular, may choose to show the superiority of one nation or culture over another in psychological terms. This proclivity has a long history, having been directed over the years for or (usually) against a variety of social and immigrant groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1745691612443829">Gould, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1745691612443829">Lemann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1745691612443829">Sarason &amp; Doris, 1979</xref>). Today, its latest manifestation is in the form of books and articles such as that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1745691612443829">Hunt (2012)</xref> and other psychologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1745691612443829">Lynn &amp; Vanhanen, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1745691612443829">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1745691612443829">Rindermann, 2008</xref>) regarding comparative national intelligence.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1745691612443829">Hunt (2012)</xref> places cognitive abilities, or IQ, at the top of the heap of human characteristics (literally and figuratively—see Figure 1 of his article). IQ is indeed important and is correlated with many criteria of success in our society and many others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1745691612443829">Gottfredson, 1997</xref>). The correlation of IQ or its proxies with diverse criteria is one of the most well-established findings in psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1745691612443829">Gottfredson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1745691612443829">Schmidt &amp; Hunter, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1745691612443829">Sternberg, 2012d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1745691612443829">Sternberg &amp; Kaufman, 2011</xref>). There is, however, a rub or two. Let’s look at some history.</p>
<p>In the United States of the early to mid-20th century, socioeconomic class was the main basis for sorting individuals in terms of what college or university they were allowed to attend, especially in the case of prestigious institutions, and hence, what jobs were available to them upon graduation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1745691612443829">Karabel, 2006</xref>). The intention of standardized testing was to replace accident of birth with merit. What testers did not realize at the time was that the tests were a close proxy for socioeconomic status, so station of birth could be replaced with a measure that gave the appearance that society had become a meritocracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1745691612443829">Sternberg, 2010a</xref>) when, in fact, not so much had changed.</p>
<p>Amount of schooling is highly correlated with, and substantially causal of, IQ level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1745691612443829">Ceci, 1996</xref>). Students who have opportunities for more and especially better schooling—both in terms of socialization at home and in terms of formal education in schools—are at an advantage on cognitive tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1745691612443829">Sternberg, 2003</xref>). However, different forms of home and community socialization and of formal schooling may promote the development of different patterns of cognitive abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1745691612443829">Gardner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1745691612443829">Sternberg, Jarvin, &amp; Grigorenko, 2011</xref>), and even traditional psychometric models of intelligence allow for diverse cognitive abilities at different levels of a proposed hierarchy of mental abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1745691612443829">Carroll, 1993</xref>), not merely the single one discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1745691612443829">Hunt (2012)</xref>.</p>
<p>Thus, although narrow cognitive ability, or IQ, is correlated with many forms of success, it is not necessarily fully causal of them. Family background, schooling, enculturation, and other factors will differentially promote the development of the particular set of skills that appear on an intelligence test. But not all adaptive skills for all people are represented on intelligence tests, and some of the skills on the tests may be less relevant in far-flung cultures. In societies other than our own, children may develop cognitive skills relevant to adaptation in their societies at levels higher than the development of those skills in our own mainstream society (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1745691612443829">Sternberg, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1745691612443829">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1745691612443829">2012c</xref>). By their standards, their children look more intelligent than ours, but <italic>their</italic> skills are not measured by <italic>our</italic> cognitive tests.</p>
<p>Hunt believes that IQ is largely causal of varying degrees of success, individually as well as nationally. But people decide what they want to believe, and then do their best to muster supportive arguments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1745691612443829">Mercier &amp; Sperber, 2011</xref>). Hunt’s article is a good example of this process. There are many factors in our country and others that manufacture a correlation between IQ and societal success. For example, without high test scores, it is difficult to get the school-track placements and college and graduate and professional admissions, that will provide one entry into higher level jobs. Even if people with lower test scores might succeed, they are rarely given a chance. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1745691612443829">Flynn (2009)</xref> has shown, once factors in the environment pick up on early differences representing an interaction between genes and environment, then the environment tends to magnify those effects (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1745691612443829">Bronfenbrenner &amp; Ceci, 1994</xref>). By creating better opportunities for those with higher IQs, societies help create correlations between IQ and success.</p>
<p>It is easy to dismiss such results by arguing that globalization is moving toward a single cultural norm and that our society just happens to look pretty damn good cognitively according to that norm. (Of course, all societies can find reasons why their society looks better than others, and then wonder at the inferior criteria other societies use in an obviously dubious way to make the same claim.) But from the standpoint of what may be more important sets of skills than IQ, perhaps our society and some other high-IQ societies do not look so good. Those sets of skills are the ones that constitute creativity and wisdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1745691612443829">Sternberg, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there are different definitions of creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1745691612443829">Kaufman &amp; Sternberg, 2010</xref>), a common thread in these definitions is that people who are creative defy the crowd and find their own path in producing ideas that are both novel and compelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1745691612443829">Sternberg, 2012a</xref>). Creativity can be measured with reasonable reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1745691612443829">Amabile, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1745691612443829">Runco, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1745691612443829">Sternberg, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1745691612443829">2012b</xref>). Some of the societies highest in average IQ are among the most repressive and discouraging of creativity outside of very limited bounds. In the United States, individuals who are creative may sometimes be discouraged in school or at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1745691612443829">Sternberg, 2010c</xref>). In some other high-IQ societies today, it is much worse: They may be fined, imprisoned, or executed. Yet it is creativity, much more than IQ, that has distinguished the leading countries today from those that excel in producing the products designed elsewhere or in producing illegal knockoffs. Creativity may correlate at some level with IQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1745691612443829">Lubinski, Benbow, Webb, &amp; Bleske-Rechek, 2006</xref>), but anyone who has ever worked with graduate students knows it is not the same as IQ (nor are their proxy, GRE scores; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1745691612443829">Sternberg, 2003</xref>). Moreover, creativity, like intelligence, can be used for bad ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1745691612443829">Sternberg, 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>It is perhaps no coincidence that some of the investigators most associated with broad views of intelligence have, later in their careers, moved toward the study of wisdom and allied constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1745691612443829">Baltes &amp; Staudinger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1745691612443829">Gardner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1745691612443829">Renzulli, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1745691612443829">Sternberg, 2011</xref>), as have many other investigators (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1745691612443829">Sternberg &amp; Jordan, 2005</xref>). They have recognized how often people, even distinguished ones, can be smart but foolish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1745691612443829">Sternberg, 2004b</xref>), sometimes ending up at the top of the world before they fail or even go to prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1745691612443829">McLean &amp; Elkind, 2004</xref>). Wisdom is essentially the direction of one’s intelligence as well as knowledge toward a common good, over the long-term as well as the short-term, through the infusion of positive ethical values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1745691612443829">Sternberg, 2003</xref>). At the same time that narrowly construed intelligence, as measured by IQ, has increased roughly three points per decade since roughly the beginning of the 20th century (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1745691612443829">Flynn, 2009</xref>), wisdom seems not to have shown a similar trend. Are people today two standard deviations higher in wisdom than they were in 1900? (Do they even seem two standard deviations smarter?) The Flynn effect occurred around the world, including in countries that perpetrated genocides and mass executions during the 20th and even the 21st century, such as Cambodia, Sudan, Bosnia, Armenia, Russia, and Germany, among many others.</p>
<p>As noted above, some of the countries today that are congratulated by Hunt as high in IQ are repressive dictatorships (disguised as self-labeled “democracies”). In my own country, the United States, I write as there is a primary campaign in anticipation of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1745691612443829">2012</xref> presidential election. Two candidates have advanced degrees from Harvard, one is a medical doctor, and one is a former college professor. So we have in the United States lots of “smart” leaders, but it is easier to think of smart leaders than to think of wise ones. The narrow intelligence of which Hunt is so proud has provided us with the means to obliterate our own species, hardly a compliment to the wisdom of the species and perhaps not to its intelligence either. Even today, many very smart people turn a blind eye to the wars, poverty, government atrocities, starvation, and disease that affects others around them. Indeed, some very smart political candidates suggest we pay less attention to them than we now do. And the European countries, which fare relatively well by IQ measures, are currently caught in an economic mess of historic proportions.</p>
<p>Hunt admires the Spaniards, who conquered the Incas and Aztecs with their superior “cognitive artifacts” (p. 302). The day may come when the upgraded versions of these cognitive artifacts that Hunt so admires —superior weapons, manufactured microbes, climate-changing technologies, and so forth—will cause modern-day peoples to destroy themselves. In that case, the next species to live on this planet may have a less positive view of the intelligence of developed nations than does Hunt. We humans might do better in the long run to put more emphasis on developing creativity and wisdom in our children in addition to their narrowly construed intelligence.</p>
