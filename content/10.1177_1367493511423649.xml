<abstract>
<p>In interviews with parents for the evaluation of a cardiac ward programme in a children’s hospital, a number of parents mentioned the role of the Heart Beads Program in including siblings in the hospitalisation of the child with congenital heart condition (CHD). Inclusion of siblings in the events surrounding the child with the cardiac condition was of two kinds: (a) touching and explaining about the beads and the child’s condition and (b) involvement in collecting and threading the beads. Discussion of the needs of siblings suggests that inclusion of siblings in activities related to the care and understanding of the CHD child as well as the creation and shaping of the family narrative is important. These cases illustrate the different ways in which siblings are involved and acknowledged and how involvement can be facilitated by a programme like Heart Beads.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Children’s Hospital at Westmead in Sydney launched a programme for children with congenital heart disease (CHD) known as the Heart Beads Program in July 2008. The aim of the programme was to document the children’s experiences in a unique and child-friendly form, adding a positive dimension to their treatment process and ultimately reducing the stress involved in their hospital admission. The aim was to assist children to feel a sense of achievement for their courage and be able to trace their continuing journey.</p>
<p>The beads are small porcelain shapes of varying colours and patterns that can be threaded onto a string. At pre-admission, the child (or parent if the child is too young) is given a set of beads with the child’s name spelt out and some of the beads for initial planned procedures. Families are also given an information flyer outlining the purpose of the programme and specifying what each of the distinct beads are for, and how the beads will be accessed during their hospital stay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1367493511423649">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>An evaluation of the programme carried out with 11 families of the 50 children enrolled in the programme found an overwhelmingly positive response to the programme. Families were particularly excited and impressed with their ability to tell the child’s story as the beads help to document details of the child’s hospitalisation. A number of parents mentioned in interviews that the Heart Beads made it possible to include siblings in the experience of caring for the child with a congenital heart condition. This paper reports on an analysis of the statements made in the 19 interviews from the Heart Beads evaluation relating to siblings of CHD children.</p>

<sec id="section2-1367493511423649">
<title>Background</title>
<p>There has been some research on the impact on siblings of having a chronically ill child in the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493511423649">Gallo et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493511423649">1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493511423649">Williams (1997)</xref> reviewed studies published between 1970 and 1995 finding that about 60% of the studies reported an increase in sibling risk, while 30% reported no risk and 10% had positive and negative outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493511423649">Van Riper (2003)</xref> identified multiple factors that affect how siblings respond to childhood chronic illness and disability. In research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493511423649">Flietas (2000)</xref>, children wrote of responsibility and loneliness, fear, jealousy, resentment, guilt and admitted feelings of sadness and embarrassment, and ‘sometimes overwhelming confusion’. They also expressed pride in their sense of responsibility and patience, felt good about themselves and have been shown to display greater maturity and independence than their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493511423649">Flietas, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Many studies have shown that siblings can be ‘lost in the shuffle’ according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511423649">Ray (2002)</xref>. In a study of 34 families, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511423649">Ray (2002)</xref> found parents made special efforts to make separate time for siblings and that they tried not to give too much responsibility to siblings, though there were examples where siblings took on responsibility for their ill siblings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493511423649">Williams et al. (2002)</xref> found interrelationships between the well sibling’s knowledge about the illness of the brother or sister, attitude toward the illness, mood, self-esteem and feelings of social support and suggested interventions to address the knowledge levels of the well sibling.</p>
<p>It is apparent that there is a need to include siblings in consideration of families with a child diagnosed with a chronic condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493511423649">Stawski et al., 1997</xref>). Information needs of families and children in particular have become more apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493511423649">Coyne, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493511423649">Griffin, 2002</xref>). The impact on siblings is related to other familial factors such as perception of the impact of the condition by parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493511423649">Guite et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367493511423649">Lawoko, 2007</xref>) and family history and experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493511423649">Rolland and Walsh, 2006</xref>). The role that the Heart Beads Program can play in including siblings in the experiences of hospitalisation with the CHD child will be explored.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1367493511423649">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The Heart Beads Program used an action research approach involving a partnership between clinicians who worked in the cardiac unit and researchers from the nursing research unit. A team with ward nurses and researchers was formed to support the development, implementation and evaluation of the programme and met regularly throughout the phases of the project. Feedback from families and nurses on the ward and in other units allowed the modification of the programme as it developed and was incorporated into the cardiac service at the hospital.</p>
<p>To date the programme has been very well received by children, young people and their families, and a paper outlining the development process and implementation has been submitted for publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493511423649">Dengler et al., 2011</xref>). Ethics approval for the research was gained from the hospital Ethics Committee. Participation in the programme is optional with the only inclusion criteria being that the child’s primary reason for admission to hospital is a cardiac condition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1367493511423649">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Interviews with families were undertaken by members of the research team who had no prior contact with the family. Families were approached by the ward nurses and asked if they wished to participate in an interview. When a parent consented a time was arranged at their convenience. Most interviews were conducted in an interview room on the ward and were audio-taped. Three interviews were conducted by phone, and notes were taken during the interview and written up immediately after. The length of the interview was determined by the participants resulting in brief discussions (around 10 minutes) to more in-depth explorations (around 30 minutes). Interviews were conversational in nature beginning with a general question about the Heart Beads Program, such as How have you found the Heart Beads Program? What do you/the child/parents like about your beads? and What happens to the beads when you go home? The participant shaped the flow and direction of the conversation with the interviewer prompting with further questions as appropriate. In total, 19 family interviews were held with 17 mothers, three children/young people (4-year-old boy, 12-year-old girl and 15-year-old boy) and one father who was interviewed on two separate occasions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367493511423649">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Rigour was assured by having two members of the research team work independently using a cognitive mapping process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493511423649">Eden et al., 1983</xref>) to manage and analyse data from the interviews. A thematic analysis process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367493511423649">Boyatzis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493511423649">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>) enabled themes and sub-themes to emerge from the data, which reflected the experiences of families participating in the Heart Beads Program. Following this first level of analysis, robust critical discussion between the two researchers enabled the themes to be condensed. The themes were mapped onto a whiteboard, and their connections discussed until final themes were agreed upon.</p>
<p>The overall theme from the interviews was storytelling. Families stated that they found the Heart Beads very helpful in keeping track of what was happening during hospitalisation and putting together the story of the child’s treatment. The value of the beads was predominantly in facilitating putting together a story of the child’s ‘journey’. Overwhelmingly, the Heart Beads provided an opportunity to review and understand the processes and procedures involved in the child’s condition and recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493511423649">Redshaw et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This paper is reporting on a secondary analysis of the interviews in which the involvement of siblings in the experience of hospitalisation related to a child with CHD through the Heart Beads Program was investigated. Interview transcripts were reanalysed for mention of siblings, and quotes were extracted and examined. There were 19 interviews in total, and in 10 interviews, siblings were mentioned. Discussion focuses on those interviews where involvement of siblings in relation to Heart Beads was signalled.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1367493511423649">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Interviews with parents showed that the Heart Beads Program, in addition to providing a means of telling the child’s story, could also involve siblings. For siblings, the parent focus on the CHD child can be difficult to understand and accept especially when the children are very young. Two types of involvement were apparent in the interviews with parents. These were as follows: (a) ‘touching and explaining’ in which the siblings are able to handle the beads and the beads are used as a way of providing explanation to siblings and (b) ‘collecting the beads’ in which the sibling is included in the process of collecting and threading the beads. The dominant theme was that the Heart Beads provided a means of explaining to siblings.</p>
<sec id="section7-1367493511423649">
<title>Touching and explaining</title>
<p>For a number of families, the beads provided a means by which the experiences of the family were acknowledged and the beads could assist in providing explanations to siblings. In one interview, the mother stated that the beads were an aspect of the experience that the siblings were able to share in:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>They are something I want to be hands on, his older sister and brother are allowed to handle them</italic>. [Family Member 3 (FM3)]</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For another mother being able to take out the beads and ask questions is important for the sibling:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>C (sister) loves them and gets them out and plays with them and she says ‘hey Mum what’s this one for’?</italic> (FM7)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The beads were often considered a means of providing explanation to the siblings. In handling the beads and asking questions, siblings are able to seek explanation and able to be engaged in the process. One mother noted that the sibling was too young to handle the beads, but she did imagine that they will be something she can use to explain to the child as she gets older what has happened with the younger brother:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>I haven’t showed them to her (older child)—she’s two and a half and I’m a bit worried she’ll break them. But it will be good for her when she’s older, she’ll know exactly what he went through as well. She’d just got used to him when we were at home before and she’s just beginning to understand—Mummy’s at the hospital</italic>. (FM4)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In this case, the child’s need to understand and the impact on him or her is acknowledged though it is considered that it will be dealt with in the future. Offering an explanation so that the child knows what the baby went through is seen as a way of compensating for the mother’s absence.</p>
<p>Explanation is clearly recognised by these mothers as important for their other children. Another mother emphasised the whole family in giving an account of what has occurred allowing them to be included in knowing about the procedures and events involved:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>It helps with the family because I can explain everything in order…rather than trying to remember everything</italic>. [Parent 3 (P3)]</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>By using the beads as a way of explaining, siblings can become involved in the family’s process of making meaning about the experience, and an opportunity is then offered for the siblings’ experiences to be discussed or considered.</p>
<p>For one family, the Heart Beads became the source of, or perhaps allowed, the expression of jealousy on the part of the siblings. With explanation from the mother the siblings’ feelings were somewhat allayed:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>His brothers feel quite jealous. The seven year old…was quite jealous because he thought they were quite cool. I explained it to him and after that he could see well R’s getting them and it’s because…initially it was like well why can’t I have some?…he was quite satisfied with that</italic>. (FM8)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The sibling saw the beads as being about the experiences of the child with CHD and expressed the desire to have the beads also, perhaps wanting his own experiences and feelings acknowledged. This is important for children where the parent’s focus is with the child with CHD. While the sibling in this case could accept that the beads were for his CHD brother, it is also important that the siblings’ own experiences can be acknowledged as they go through the ordeal and see the impact on their parents.</p>
<p>The beads can represent a shared experience that includes the siblings and the parents:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>My other child, he’s 21 months, he’ll love them and want to touch and feel and I can explain to him…It’s something really positive that both the children and the parents can experience and it’s something for the whole family. It’s that reference point to go back to</italic>. (FM9)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As a reference point, the beads can represent something different as well as something shared for each family member allowing them to reflect on their own experiences. The beads can have different meanings for each and also represent the experience of the whole family. Being able to handle the beads and have the meanings explained to them gives the other children a part in the experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1367493511423649">
<title>Collecting the beads to include a sibling</title>
<p>For two mothers, the beads had a major role in including and involving the older sibling. In both cases, the child with CHD was an infant and the older child 5 years in one case and 7 years in the other. Both mothers explained how they had used the beads in a deliberate effort to include the sibling:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>It was nice for my son who is seven—putting them together and getting excited about getting the new beads. He asks what does this mean…he was able to be involved. I always waited for him to come on the weekends and he would go and get the beads from the nurses and then we could thread them</italic>. (P8)</p>
<p>
<italic>I used these to break the news to my son and we sat together and put the beads together and just explaining it to him and so it was an easier process for him to absorb that information. He loves putting them together</italic>. (P7)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In both these cases, the mothers involved the older child in threading the beads and saw that as a means of including them in the experience in a way that was light and fun and manageable for them. The mothers want to spend as much time as they can with their other child and include them in the experience with the baby so that the other child can see where they are and why they are spending so much time away from them.</p>
<p>These mothers realise that they need a way to include the other child in the experience and recognise that there is an impact on them and a need for them to share in being with the parents. Hands-on collection of beads allowed conversation between parent and child about the experiences the family is undergoing. The mothers see the Heart Beads as a means of addressing the need for explanation they recognise in their other child.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section9-1367493511423649">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The parents in this sample provide examples of how the Heart Beads are used to include and involve siblings in a family experience. Integrating the experience of child chronic illness into the fabric of family life involves all members of the family. Recognition that a disruption or crisis such as diagnosis of a child’s chronic condition impacts the whole family is vital in order for families to go on strengthened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493511423649">Rolland and Walsh, 2006</xref>). Involvement of siblings can take many forms, and providing information and explaining events is one of the most important (Williams et al., 2002). Being mindful of the additional focus on the ill child and the unintended exclusion of siblings can lead to finding ways of including siblings where possible, thus providing reassurance.</p>
<p>It was noted earlier in the paper that families valued the Heart Beads Program as a means of putting together a story of the child’s ‘journey’, representing the emotions and the processes involved. The theme encompasses the building of a story that cultivates an understanding and carries it into the future of the child representing an important part of their life. The opportunity to review and understand the processes and procedures involved in the child’s condition and recovery could also include siblings who are part of the new meanings being created for the family. Given that the impact on their lives is significant, their input into the building of the story is important. Siblings can be an explicit and integral part of the story-building process. Allowing for their perspectives as part of the meaning for the whole family would be a significant form of involvement.</p>
<p>Diagnosis of a chronic illness results in a crisis of meaning and loss of pre-illness family identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493511423649">Rolland and Walsh, 2006</xref>). Creating meaning around the illness that preserves a sense of mastery is an important step in dealing with the initial crisis. Comments from families suggest that the Heart Beads help them to construct meanings around the child’s CHD. Making this process of meaning construction inclusive of the whole family where possible would be optimal in assisting the family to ‘regroup’. This is likely to be an ongoing process as the implications of the child’s condition become more apparent.</p>
<p>Children do require information and discussion and have a need and willingness to understand and so need opportunities for asking questions, being provided with explanations as well as expressing feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493511423649">Williams, 2002</xref>). Considering adaptation to the illness as a shared challenge that involves implications for all family members requires open communication, acknowledgement and validation of feelings and concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493511423649">Rolland and Walsh, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1367493511423649">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The study was based on a small number of interviews, and the analysis illustrates potentially positive ways in which siblings can be included. While it is limited to discussion by families in interviews about the Heart Beads Program, using the beads to include siblings was important to a number of families. Future research could focus on explicitly including siblings and understanding their relation to the CHD sibling.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1367493511423649">
<title>Implications for practise</title>
<p>Health professionals can be mindful of the needs of siblings and the family’s need to create new meanings when they are presented with a crisis such as diagnosis of CHD in a child or infant. Programmes such as Heart Beads can be used to assist families in telling their story and including siblings in the creation of the family narrative and in coming to terms with the condition and what is involved in managing it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1367493511423649">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There is a need to keep siblings in the loop by providing information and involvement where possible to minimise the impact of a child with chronic illness. Including siblings in fun activities such as the Heart Beads Program provides involvement as well as an activity that is inclusive. It is possible to involve siblings in supporting the bead collection and its presentation in helping them to understand the CHD condition and its implications, in helping to vent their own feelings and in being part of the journey. Building the family story together by including the impact on siblings is important for the well-being of the whole family.</p>
