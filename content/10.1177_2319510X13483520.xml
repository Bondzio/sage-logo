<p>I was quite flummoxed when I read the name of the book under review <italic>A Grain of Sand in the Hourglass of Time—an autobiography</italic>. The Webster’s Third New International Dictionary says that ‘autobiography’ is the biography of oneself narrated by oneself and ‘biography’ is the written history of a person’s life. Therefore when I read the name of two authors Arjun Singh and Ashok Chopra on the cover page my befuddlement knew no bounds. However on reading page 15 of the book I realised that the autobiography under review is to be regarded as work-in-progress since Arjun Singh left for his permanent abode on the 4 March 2011, when he was about to complete his literary masterpiece. Owing to his proximity to the deceased author, Ashok Chopra filled the gaps in the text in order to maintain continuity.</p>
<p>The supreme audit institution of India that is, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India has unearthed several scams and brought to the fore several financial irregularities related to several politicians. Recently the newspapers have carried news pertaining to a few politicians who have been mired in political chicaneries. It may not be wrong to say that perhaps the class that rules the nation now forms a special category which people love to hate and hate to love. The tome under review will help the readers in understanding that the life of the political class is not that easy, a number of external parameters come into play (although that is not a plea offered for exculpation and definitely excuses serve no uses), and how by the time a person is able to comprehend the labyrinths of power and politics the uncontrollable events and the vicissitudes of daily life entwine themselves and suddenly take an unpredictable turn.</p>
<p>The book has been effectively divided into forty-three chapters and an appendix which contains the statement made by the author in the Rajya Sabha on the11 August 2011. Each chapter describes at least one event which may leave the reader spellbound or speechless for a few moments. For instance the first chapter describes a tragic event because of which Mr. Arjun Singh decided to redeem his family’s honour by making himself well-versed in the art and science of administration of the government. The second chapter ends with an incidence which made Arjun Singh give up his law practice. The fifth chapter explains the distress which Mr. Arjun Singh experienced because of the event due to which his father was awarded an imprisonment sentence. The tenth chapter explains how Mr. Arjun Singh’s visit to the United States helped transform the agricultural and educational landscape in Madhya Pradesh. Through the lives of a few powerful statesmen the eleventh chapter lays bare the fact that everyone gets what he/she deserves. The nineteenth chapter throws light on the surrender of dacoits who were quite active in the Chambal ravines. The twentieth chapter has a fleeting reference to Operation Bluestar and its aftermath. The twenty-first chapter is devoted to the Bhopal Gas Tragedy which occurred on the fateful night of 02–03 December 1984 and also explains how and why Warren Anderson, the then chairman and CEO of Union Carbide, was released. The thirty-second chapter is devoted to the demolition of a holy place of worship in 1992, which tore apart the secular fabric of the country. A relevant part of the Parliamentary proceedings which followed the imbroglio have been reproduced in the succeeding chapter.</p>
<p>The book is a treasure-trove of information. For instance, the sixth chapter minutely dissects the structure and economies of the trade that makes <italic>bidis</italic>. The initial part of the seventh chapter dwells on the incursions which China made into India in 1962. The early part of the thirteenth chapter dwells on the creation of Bangladesh. The fourteenth chapter sheds light on a top-secret operation carried out in 1974 which had been code-named ‘the Smiling Buddha’ and explores the dimensions of the Emergency which had been imposed in 1975 under the leadership of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The twenty-third chapter contains the historic agreement known as the Punjab Accord which was signed by Mr. Rajiv Gandhi and Sant Longowal. The tome carefully traces the change and marvellous transformation which a few states in India have undergone in the past six decades or so under the leadership of political, cultural, administrative and literary icons.</p>
<p>Letters written by Pandit Nehru, a few other prime ministers, governors and other important dignitaries have been reproduced in the book which along with some monumental photographs make the book come alive. The book also contains references to several committees which have been set up by the Government of India to conduct enquiries into several lapses/scams/killings/incidences due to which the resilient nation has suffered to a great extent. Some incidences/experiences mentioned in the book help in understanding the role of serendipity in a person’s life.</p>
<p>The book describes incidences which expose the hideous realities of feudal India, incidences which describe subversion of justice, incidences related to bloodshed, public apathy, harrowing ordeals some innocent people had to pass through, the disparities in income which result because of the apathy of the governing class, the injustice meted out to the tribals and the people who are financially weak. The book will be helpful to management practitioners as it dwells on real-life situations.</p>
<p>The timeline covered in the book is quite vast and the number of characters which appear in the book is quite large due to which certain sections might require re-reading. It is desirable that a book like the one under review should have a dramatis personae at the beginning as it would help in better understanding of the subject matter.</p>
