<abstract>
<p>Biomechanical models of the fingers are used to gain a greater understanding of internal loading. This can help guide the treatment of injuries and pathologies. However, to be valid these models require accurate measurement of body kinematics, external reaction forces and soft tissue architecture. This study aimed to quantify the sensitivity of one such model, to errors in these inputs. Experimental data was collected from a single subject carrying out a simple gripping activity and the experimental data altered to introduce artificial errors. We found that the correlations between errors in measurement of body kinematics and the model outputs could be used to express errors in motion capture data in terms of internal loading. However, these correlations were specific to grip type, therefore, if the grip changed significantly a new analysis would be required. Sensitivity analysis of the muscle and tendon locations indicated which parameters were most important to measure accurately; outputs were most sensitive to changes in the most highly loaded muscle–tendon units, these results were applicable across different hand orientations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ability to understand the internal loading on the human body can be of great assistance to clinicians, engineers and anyone else involved in the prevention and treatment of musculo-skeletal disorders. In the absence of direct force measurements, biomechanical modelling is used to predict internal loading. These models simplify the anatomy to a linked chain of segments that can articulate relative to each other.</p>
<p>Owing to the nature of the activities carried out by the hand, a three-dimensional (3D) modelling approach is normally required. The muscles, tendons and ligaments are represented by their lines of action and moment arms relative to the joints they act across. For example, the model proposed by An et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912445730">1</xref></sup> was the first to use 3D moment arms for each muscle–tendon unit. Previously, the only established hand models were those proposed by Landsmeer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912445730">2</xref></sup> who considered the hand in the simplified two-dimensional (2D) case. An et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912445730">1</xref></sup> defined a set of measurements taken from cadaveric hands, which has provided the basis for many of the models proposed subsequently. Some of these studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912445730">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912445730"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912445730">5</xref></sup> were in the development of simulation models that either simulated a kinematic, or a force, input to the finger. These models were used to study pathology, such as repetitive strain injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912445730">5</xref></sup> and tetraplegia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912445730">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other studies required a subject to carry out a set of tasks or exercises, then by taking external measurements and using the principle of inverse dynamics, the joint forces and moments were calculated. Vigouroux et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912445730">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912445730">7</xref></sup> studied the high loading cases and associated acute injuries to both the tendons and pulley mechanism of the fingers encountered in rock climbing (the hand was measured pseudo-statically using photographs). Sancho-Bru et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912445730">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912445730">9</xref></sup> also used photographic measurements to represent a dynamic situation, both for a free flexion and high loading case. For dynamic measurement, Fowler and Nicol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912445730">10</xref></sup> used photogrammetric techniques similar to those used in gait analysis, using clusters of retro-reflective markers to track hand movement. The external loading was then measured by a load cell mounted into objects simulating simple tasks. This model differed significantly from most others owing to the inclusion of three-degrees-of-freedom (DoF) at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint (instead of just one DoF about only the flexion/extension axis).</p>
<p>Validation of biomechanical models is difficult as the direct measurement of internal loading is rarely practicable. Issues of indeterminacy make it impossible to use cadavers for validation. Consequently all models must include an optimisation using a cost function that represents muscle coordination and neurological control. Although it has been possible to use direct invasive techniques during surgery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912445730">11</xref></sup> there has to be some compromise on the possible hand positions and movements owing to the anaesthesia. Electromyography (EMG) measurements have been used to validate models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912445730">12</xref></sup> and can also be used as an input to constrain them,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912445730">6</xref></sup> but accurate measurement requires the insertion of fine-wire probes into one or more of the extrinsic muscles. This is painful for the subject, and the calculation of muscle activation from EMG response is subject to error. The combination of these factors means that most models have been validated through comparison with other studies in which the subject carried out a similar set of activities.</p>
<p>In general all models rely on three fundamental inputs: body kinematics, soft tissue architecture, and the magnitude and centre of pressure (CoP) of the external reaction forces. Inaccurate measurement of these inputs can result in poor results despite a model having previously been shown to be valid.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to quantify the sensitivity to variations in the input parameters, not to establish the validity of any given model. This will give an indication of what are the most important parameters to measure accurately.</p>

<title>Model</title>
<p>The model selected for study was that proposed by Vigouroux et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912445730">7</xref></sup> based on the normative model developed by An et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912445730">1</xref></sup> This was chosen because it was derived from the model used by a number of researchers in the field.</p>
<p>This model represented the three phalanges of a finger and its associated metacarpal as a linked chain of four rigid segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912445730">Figure 1</xref>). The positions and orientations of each segmental ACS were in accordance with the International Society of Biomechanics recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912445730">13</xref></sup> For each segment the <italic>y</italic>-axis was directed proximally defining the long axis. The <italic>x</italic>-axis was directed palmarly and, with the <italic>y</italic>-axis, defined the sagittal plane of the segment. The <italic>z</italic>-axis was perpendicular to this plane and directed radially (it was coincident with the flexion axis of rotation at the interphalangeal joints). The origin of each phalanx segment was coincident with the joint centre located proximally to the segment. The origin of the metacarpal segment was coincident with the joint centre located distally to the segment.</p>

For each phalanx (<italic>d</italic> = distal, <italic>m</italic> = middle, <italic>p</italic> = proximal) the origin of each ACS was coincident with the joint centre (distal interphalangeal, PIP and metacarpo-phalangeal) located proximally to the segment. The origin of the metacarpal segment (mc) was coincident with the joint centre located distally to the segment.

</fig>
<p>The DIP, PIP and MCP joints lie between the segments. The DIP and PIP joints were defined as a one DoF hinge about the flexion/extension (<italic>z</italic>) axis. The MCP joint modelled as a two DoF universal joint, able to rotate about the flexion/extension (<italic>z</italic>) and abduction/adduction (<italic>x</italic>) axes.</p>
<p>Acting across these joints were actuators representing ten muscle–tendon functional units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912445730">Figure 2</xref>). These were described as functional units because they can not all be regarded as independent muscles and tendons. This is of particular relevance for the extensor hood across the PIP joint, where the extensor tendon is considered as a set of functional units bound by inter-dependent physical constraints. Acting across the DIP joint are the FDP and the TET, which flex and extend the joint, respectively. The FDP also acts across the PIP joint in addition to the other flexor unit, the FDS. At this joint the extensor is split into three functional units forming the extensor hood. These are the CET, the RLB and the ULB. The FDP and FDS both act across the MCP joint in addition to another four functional units. Three of these are attached to the extensor hood; the EDC, PIU and LUR. The fourth is the DIR, attached to the radial side of the proximal phalanx. A summary of these functional units is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912445730">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Sensitivity analysis</title>
<p>Small changes in the magnitude of external reaction force will have no effect on results because all forces were normalised. Additionally, error in the location of the CoP relative to the finger can be considered equivalent to an error in the measurement of body kinematics. For this reason sensitivity analysis was carried out only with regard to body kinematics and to soft tissue architecture.</p>
<p>For the body kinematics sensitivity analysis the assumed location of each joint centre (DIP, PIP and MCP) was displaced to simulate errors in their measurement. These displacements were applied in the palmar/dorsal, proximal/distal and radial/ulnar directions at the three joints. Each displacement was made independently of the others, therefore, interaction effects were not calculated. This was not deemed necessary at this stage as only the primary effects were of interest within the scope of this study. To provide results that could be generalised and compared with other subjects in the future, the displacements were defined in terms of percentage of middle phalanx length, chosen as a scaling factor because it has been used for this purpose in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912445730">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411912445730">16</xref></sup> The middle phalanx length was the length of the middle phalanx of the index finger, defined as the distance between the functionally defined DIP and PIP joints.</p>
<p>The maximum displacement for each joint in each direction was 20% of the middle phalanx length and the displacement step size was 1% of the middle phalanx length. The step size was the amount that each joint centre was displaced between each trial in the sensitivity analysis. These percentages were chosen to achieve approximately 5 mm maximum displacement. This ensured that even the most extreme errors in the ACS position were taken into account. The subject used in this experiment had a middle phalanx length of 25.4 mm, equating to a maximum shift of 5.08 mm and a step size of 0.254 mm.</p>
<p>For the soft tissue architecture sensitivity analysis, the moment arms of a total of 13 functional units acting across the three joints were adjusted. Adjustments were made to each functional unit at each joint independently, therefore giving the additional three functional units. As with the body kinematics analysis, the components of the moment arms were adjusted in the palmar/dorsal, proximal/distal and radial/ulnar directions at the three joints. Again, all adjustments were made independently, and expressed as a percentage of middle phalanx length. A maximum percentage of 20% was chosen to ensure the likely maximum errors in the functional unit with the largest moment arm were covered. This percentage was applied to every functional unit in every direction.</p>
<p>In addition to the forces in each functional unit, the joint reaction force (JRF) was also calculated using</p>

<title>Experimental procedure</title>
<p>The sensitivity analysis needed only an example of realistic experimental input, therefore, just a single subject was used. This subject was a healthy right-handed male aged 26 years, with no history of injury.</p>
<p>A six-axis force transducer (AMT Inc, USA) was mounted in a rig to measure the external reaction force at the tip of a single finger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912445730">Figure 3</xref>). The finger was pressed against a 15 × 20 mm pad rigidly attached to the transducer that was fixed to a base plate. A rigid rest allowed the other fingers of the hand to rest next to the measured finger without applying any load to the transducer. This meant the subject did not have to hold their other fingers unnaturally flexed or extended to keep them away from the transducer. The rest was wide enough that any finger could be measured with the others laying on the rest. Attached to the base plate were three 10 mm retro-reflective spheres that defined a CTF, fixed in space relative to the transducer origin and orientation. This meant the whole rig could be moved in the photogrammetric frame with its position and orientation fully defined.</p>

The pad was attached to the load surface of the transducer while the rest was attached to the base plate. An open hand grip position is shown. Typical joint angles at the DIP joint = 30° to 50°, at the PIP joint = 30° to 40° and at the MCP joint = −10° to 10°.</p>

</fig>
<p>The base plate could be adjusted vertically relative to an elbow rest fixed to the base of the rig. This allowed the subject to rest his arm, hence minimising the effect of posture on the results. This set-up allowed basic grip types to be tested.</p>
<p>Finger kinematics were measured using a stereo-photogrammetric system (Vicon UK Ltd). A set of 12 × 4 mm hemispherical markers were attached to the index finger of the right hand. This was in accordance with the phalanx transformation technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912445730">17</xref></sup> used to define the ACSs of each phalanx. For this, an open hand grip type was tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912445730">Figure 3</xref>) with the subject required to apply a range of finger-tip forces with a total of 20 repetitions. The subject was required to apply a force vertically downward on the pad with his index finger. The forearm was vertical and the elbow flexed at 90°, supported by the elbow rest. The subject was asked to apply a force that was comfortable for him to maintain for up to 5 s.</p>

<p>The force predictions from the model were normalised to the component of the external reaction force normal to the surface of the transducer (i.e. the largest force) and averaged across the 20 trials recorded. The magnitude of these forces is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912445730">Figure 4</xref> and is referred to as the baseline output.

<p>The mean JRF was predominantly sensitive to changes in the proximal/distal direction at the DIP joint. It had a negative correlation in the distal (<italic>−y</italic>) direction and a less pronounced positive correlation in the proximal (<italic>+y</italic>) direction. At the PIP joint the correlations with changes in the palmar/dorsal and proximal/distal directions were much clearer. There was a negative correlation with the palmar (+<italic>x</italic>) direction and a positive correlation in the proximal (+<italic>y</italic>) direction. At the MCP joint the mean JRF was sensitive to the changes in all three directions, although sensitivity in the proximal/distal direction was less than in the other two. A mean JRF had a positive correlation with changes in the palmar (+<italic>x</italic>) direction and a negative correlation with changes in the proximal (+<italic>y</italic>) and radial (+<italic>z</italic>) directions.</p>
<p>The results of the sensitivity analysis to the soft tissue architecture are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912445730">Figure 6</xref>. The figure is split into three plots, showing the sensitivity to adjustments of the moment arms at the three joints. The horizontal axes of each plot are split into divisions representing each functional unit. These are split into three further subdivisions representing the adjustment in the three directions (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912445730">Figure 5</xref>). To provide detail and maintain consistency between plots the vertical axes have been limited to ± 5 units of normalised force or ± 100% change. This leads to cropping of the data for large changes in the FDP moment arm. In this case the increase shown in the plot continues to rise exponentially. It is evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912445730">Figure 5</xref> that changes in the moment arm of the FDP had the greatest impact on the mean JRF compared with other muscle–tendon units. Although changes in the moment arm of the FDS, DIR and EDC had an effect on the mean JRF, this was less pronounced than with changes to the FDP. Adjustments in all other functional units had little effect on the outputs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>For the joint position sensitivity analysis it was found that, at the DIP joint, the mean JRF was sensitive to changes in the proximal/distal direction and less sensitive to those in the palmar/dorsal direction of the distal phalanx ACS. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912445730">Figure 7</xref> shows that the orientation of the distal phalanx ACS relative to the external reaction force was such that this force acted almost entirely in the dorsal (−<italic>x</italic>) direction. This meant that any change in the location of the joint centre in the palmar/dorsal direction had very little effect on the joint moment, and subsequently muscle force. Because the model included only a DoF about the flexion/extension (<italic>z</italic>) axis for this joint, any change in the radial/ulnar direction would not have affected the model outputs despite altering the moments about the abduction/adduction (<italic>x</italic>) and pronation/supination (<italic>y</italic>) axes. This left only displacement in the proximal/distal direction having any effect.</p>

</fig>
<p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912445730">Figure 7</xref> it is evident that changing the distance between the distal phalanx ACS origin and the external reaction force in the proximal/distal direction would directly correlate with an increase and decrease in the moment at this joint. As the only flexor crossing this joint is the FDP, the force in it changed to ensure the moment equilibrium across the DIP joint was maintained. The moments across the PIP and MCP joints were unaffected by changes in the location of the DIP joint, therefore, any change in the FDP force had to be counterbalanced by changes in all the other functional units to maintain equilibrium. Because the FDP provides stability to the MCP joint, a decrease in DIP moment requires an increase in overall extensor force to provide this stability. As a result there was an increase in mean JRF despite the moment at the DIP joint decreasing.</p>
<p>At the PIP joint the orientation of the middle phalanx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912445730">Figure 7</xref>) meant there was sensitivity to displacement in both the palmar/dorsal and proximal/distal directions of the middle phalanx ACS. Like the DIP joint there was no change with displacement in the radial/ulnar direction owing to there only being a DoF about the flexion/extension axis. Displacement of the joint centre in a dorsal (−<italic>x</italic>) direction or in a proximal (+<italic>y</italic>) direction resulted in an increased moment at the joint. Because more functional units cross this joint than the DIP, the change in required muscle forces, and ultimately the mean JRF, more closely reflected the change in PIP moment.</p>
<p>At the MCP joint there was sensitivity to displacements in the direction of all three axes of the proximal ACS. The orientation of the proximal phalanx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912445730">Figure 7</xref>) meant that, like the PIP joint, a displacement of the joint centre in a dorsal (−<italic>x</italic>) direction resulted in an increase in joint moment. This in turn meant less extensor force was needed to balance the moments at the joint, resulting in a negative correlation between displacement in this direction and mean JRF. As the external reaction force was almost aligned with the proximal/distal axis of the proximal phalanx ACS, displacement in the direction of this axis had little effect on moments and subsequently mean JRF. In this orientation of the hand, the moment about the abduction/adduction axis at the MCP joint decreased with increased displacement in the radial (+<italic>z</italic>) direction, i.e. the required abduction moment decreased. This led to a decrease in the DIR force. The DIR has a much larger abduction than flexion moment arm, therefore, changes in the force had little effect on the other functional units, resulting in the mean JRF following a negative correlation with displacement in the radial (+<italic>z</italic>) direction.</p>
<p>It was possible to get an estimate of the level of error acceptable in the calculation of joint position using these relationships between joint displacement and error in the internal loading. The standard deviation in the mean JRF was 0.5 (10%), therefore an acceptable level of accuracy would be if errors are kept within this boundary. Because the greatest sensitivity to errors was at the PIP joint, this joint was used to define acceptable limits of accuracy. Errors in mean JRF could be kept within the 10% boundary if the error in position of the PIP was less 13% of the middle phalanx length, equivalent to 3.3 mm for the subject in this study. The method of motion analysis of the hand used in this study estimated the error at this joint as ≈ 1 mm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912445730">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The sensitivity of mean JRF to changes in the anatomy showed that changing the moment arm of the FDP had the most significant effect. In general for this functional unit, decreases in the moment arm in the palmar (+<italic>x</italic>) direction and increases in the proximal (+<italic>y</italic>) direction decreased the unit moment, which meant a larger muscle force was required and the mean JRF increased. It was observed that the four most highly loaded functional units (FDP, FDS, DIR and EDC) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912445730">Figure 4</xref> had the highest sensitivity to the moment arm displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912445730">Figure 6</xref>). These results are more widely applicable beyond the specific grip type tested, as changes in the anatomy do not change the moment across the joint itself.</p>
<p>As with the kinematic sensitivity analysis, limits can be placed on the accuracy required from the anatomical measurement, keeping the error in normalised JRF to within the 10% boundary. The error in the FDP moment arms was used to define acceptable measurement accuracy limits. This meant the FDP moment arm should be measured to within 10% of the middle phalanx length, equating to 2.5 mm in this case.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>There were strong correlations between predicted force in each functional unit and errors in the measured position of the three joints of the index finger. Where the error in the location of the joint centres can be quantified, these correlations can be used to define acceptable magnitudes of this error. Also, the largest sensitivity of the model to errors in soft tissue architecture was in the most highly loaded functional units.</p>
<p>Sensitivity boundaries on the required accuracy in the measurement of relevant anatomy have been found. These can provide a guide in future applications where the accuracy of these measurements is known. This will enhance clinical relevance and the weighting to be given to predictions from biomechanical models. There is still much work to be done however, not only in improving the accuracy of the anatomical measurements, but simply being able to put acceptable errors bounds around them.</p>
