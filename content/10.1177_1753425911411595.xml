<p><italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, the causative agent of plague, is a Gram-negative bacillus classified as a Category A pathogen by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), reflecting its high potential as a weapon of bioterrorism. There is significant concern that <italic>Y. pestis</italic> may be used as a bioweapon in warfare or a terrorist attack as it is widely available, can be mass produced, can be aerosolized for widespread dissemination, may spread rapidly beyond the initial site of the attack, and is both highly contagious and lethal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425911411595">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425911411595">5</xref></sup> The World Health Organization has predicted that 50 kg of aerosolized <italic>Y. pestis</italic> released over a city of five million people would cause pneumonic plague in as many as 150,000 persons, of whom 36,000 would die.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425911411595">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425911411595">3</xref></sup> If persons exposed to the attack then fled, the outbreak could spread far beyond the initial site of dissemination. Pointedly, a government training exercise to assess reactions to an aerosolized <italic>Y. pestis</italic> attack found that disease would spread rapidly, with hospitals quickly overwhelmed and unable to care for sick patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425911411595">4</xref></sup> A bioterrorist attack with aerosolized <italic>Y. pestis</italic> may occur when there is a limited supply of first-line antibiotics in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), as well as logistical concerns for providing these antibiotics in a timely manner to the vicinity of a <italic>Y. pestis</italic> attack. Owing to the virulence of <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, if treatment is delayed for more than 24 h after the onset of symptoms, the mortality rate of pneumonic plague approaches 100%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425911411595">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425911411595">5</xref></sup> Equally important, strains of <italic>Y. pestis</italic> have been isolated in the natural environment that are resistant to multiple antibiotics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425911411595">6</xref></sup> Taken together, with the concern that multi-drug resistant strains of <italic>Y. pestis</italic> can be developed under laboratory conditions and that vaccines are not effective as post-exposure medical countermeasures (MCMs),<sup>.</sup>a critical need exists for novel therapeutic strategies to expand the window of opportunity for treating patients in the event of mass casualties following an aerosolized attack with <italic>Y. pestis</italic>.</p>
<p>An important virulence factor for <italic>Y. pestis</italic> is LPS (endotoxin), a glycolipid moiety and primary component of its bacterial outer wall that contributes to <italic>Y.pestis</italic>-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and septicemia in animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425911411595">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425911411595">8</xref></sup> In the lungs, LPS causes structural changes that result in disrupted alveolar septa, interstitial and alveolar edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, microvascular congestion and frank alveolar hemorrhage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425911411595">9</xref></sup> The pathology of ALI caused by an intravascular or intratracheal challenge with LPS resembles that with <italic>Y. pestis</italic> infection in animals and humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425911411595">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425911411595">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was previously reported that LPS binds to and activates A<sub>1</sub> adenosine receptors on human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) to induce the release of thromboxane and IL-6, immunomodulatory substances that are cytotoxic to endothelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425911411595">13</xref></sup> In animals, antagonists of the A<sub>1</sub> adenosine receptor (A<sub><bold>1</bold></sub>AR) block LPS-induced ALI and increase survival following cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced intraabdominal polymicrobial sepsis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425911411595">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425911411595">14</xref></sup> Given the unmet medical need for safe and effective post-exposure MCMs for <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, it was our objective to investigate the efficacy of a promising clinical drug candidate, the A<sub>1</sub>AR antagonist, L-97-1, in a rat model of pneumonic plague.</p>

<p>The <italic>Y. pestis</italic> strain CO99 pCD1<sup><bold>+</bold></sup>/Δpgm (hereafter CO99) used in these studies was a gift from Dr Susan C. Straley (University of Kentucky School of Medicine, Lexington, KY, USA) and was derived from the clinical isolate CO92, an <italic>occidentalis</italic> biotype that caused fatal pneumonic plague by feline-human aspirate transmission in 1992.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425911411595">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753425911411595">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425911411595">16</xref></sup> This CO99 strain retains all of the chromosomal and plasmid-derived virulence factors of wild-type CO92, including a type III secretion system composed of <italic>Yersinia</italic> outer proteins, while lacking only the <italic>pgm</italic> (pigmentation) locus encoding an iron-transport siderophore.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425911411595">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425911411595">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425911411595">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425911411595">11</xref></sup> The A<sub>1</sub>AR antagonist L-97-1 was synthesized by Scynexis Inc. (Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) under contract with Endacea Inc. and stored in the dark as anhydrous powder at 26 °C until reconstituted daily in United States Pharmacopeia (USP)-grade water for use as described below. This sterile USP-grade water, as well as USP-grade normal saline (NS), isoflurane and sterile Na-heparin stock solution (1000 U/ml) were from Baxter Healthcare (Deerfield, IL, USA). Intermedic® polyethylene (PE-50) tubing for catheterizations, heart infusion broth (HIB), agar for bacterial culture plates and serum separation tubes were obtained from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA). USP-grade ciprofloxacin (cipro) was obtained as a 10 mg/ml <sc>IV</sc> solution (Hospira Inc., Lake Forest, IL, USA).

<sec id="sec4-1753425911411595"><title>Bacterial growth and quantitation</title>
<p>For each experiment, CO99 from 80% glycerol frozen stocks was inoculated onto trypticase soy agar plates (TSA: 1% HIB, 1.5% agar, 0.2% D-galactose) and was grown for 72 h at 25 °C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753425911411595">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753425911411595">19</xref></sup> Log-phase cultures were started by inoculating 8 ml of HIB with 5–10 white colonies of plated CO99 followed by shaking for 8 h at 25 °C. Then, 1.0 ml of the log-phase culture (OD<sub>600</sub> 0.2–0.4) was sub-cultured in 100 ml fresh HIB with overnight shaking at 25 °C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425911411595">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753425911411595">19</xref></sup> The CO99 inocula for infection were made by centrifuging these overnight stationary-phase cultures (OD<sub>600</sub> &gt; 1.0) for 10 min at 8000 <italic>g</italic> and then twice washing the bacterial pellet with 1 × PBS at 25 °C and centrifuging for 10 min at 8000 <italic>g</italic>.</p>
<p>Preliminary studies were performed in catheterized rats, as described below, to determine the LD<sub>50</sub> for CO99. Based upon 6-d survival rates for three exposure levels of CO99 (1×10<sup>7</sup>, 1×10<sup>8</sup>, and 1×10<sup>9</sup> CFU/rat), a dose of 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/rat in 0.1 ml PBS was chosen for studies described here (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753425911411595">Table 1</xref>). Thereafter, working inocula of 1×10<sup>9</sup> CFU/ml PBS as calibrated by OD<sub>600</sub> of ∼1.35 were held at 25 °C until used within 20 min. Endotoxin levels in three representative inocula were determined using the PyroGene® detection system (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) and the manufacturer’s instructions. In each case, whole live bacterial cultures equivalent to the standard infectious inoculum were sonicated in the presence of a nonionic detergent (Triton X), centrifuged at 10,000 <italic>g</italic> (4 °C), and the resulting supernatants assayed. Results ranged between 3000 and 6000 EU per 10<sup>8</sup> CFU, <italic>i.e.</italic> per animal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425911411595">18</xref></sup> All inocula, arterial blood samples and lung homogenates (see below) were streak-plated in duplicate on TSA and grown for 72 h at 25 °C before final enumeration.

<sec id="sec5-1753425911411595"><title>Rat model of pneumonic plague</title>
<p>All procedures for surgery, infection, monitoring and euthanizing animals were performed according to relevant Health and Human Services (HHS) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines and only after prior approval by the Saint Louis Univer-sity Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan SPF, 250–350 g, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were housed in pairs upon arrival in positive-pressure isolation carrels within the animal care facility. After each of the two surgical preparations and intratracheal infection (i.t.) as described below, each rat had <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food and water and was individually housed in a micro-isolator cage within a certified biosafety laboratory (BSL)-2+ laminar flow hood to prevent any cross-contamination among animals or contact between any animal and the laboratory environment.</p>
<p>Vascular catheterizations of the left carotid artery and right jugular vein were performed aseptically via a single 2 cm mid-ventral neck incision under 2% isoflurane/98% O<sub>2</sub> anesthesia as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425911411595">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425911411595">22</xref></sup> Sterile PE-50 catheters filled with 10 U/ml heparinized NS were tunneled subdermally to exit at a single site on the dorsal neck to permit arterial blood draws and hemodynamics, as well as <sc>IV</sc> infusions. Catheters were shielded by stainless steel sleeves and swivels (Instech Solomon, Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA) to allow rats free movement and access to food and water. In accordance with IACUC policy, each rat received one dose of buprenorphine (10 µg/kg, s.c.) for analgesia but no post-surgical antibiotics, and recovered overnight at room atmosphere and temperature in its cage as described above.</p>
<p>The following morning, and 18–24 h after vascular catheterization, each rat was re-anesthetized as des-cribed above (2% isoflurane/98% O<sub>2</sub>) and positioned supine in a sterile surgical field. A 1.0 ml baseline carotid blood sample was obtained for the determination of arterial blood gases and quantitative culture, hematocrit and serum harvest. Each arterial sample was replaced with 3 ml of NS given by slow intra-arterial infusion. Only rats subsequently found to have normal blood gases and sterile baseline blood cultures before i.t. were included in the final data sets. Then, a parallel mid-ventral neck incision was made aseptically to expose the trachea. Each rat was infected by i.t. instillation of 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFU CO99 in 0.1 ml NS over 15–20 s during 5–6 normal inspirations, using a sterile 18 mm, 27-g needle directed caudally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425911411595">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753425911411595">20</xref></sup> To promote uniform dissemination of the inocula, one-third of each 0.1 ml inoculum was sequentially delivered with the rat in the supine, left decubitus, and right decubitus positions, while its body was inclined 20–30° cranially. Obser-vations for the next 1–2 min after needle withdrawal confirmed that inocula did not insufflate surrounding neck tissues. Uniform distribution of bacterial suspensions by this technique also was confirmed by instilling the trachea of other rats in preliminary studies with inocula containing Evans Blue dye (15 mg/ml) and inspecting their lungs 1 h later. The time of infection was designated as <italic>t</italic> = 0 and then the neck incision was closed, anesthesia was withdrawn and the animal roused within its cage as described above.</p>

Continuous or intermittent chart recordings of AP (mmHg) and HR (beats/min) were obtained with an MKIIIS Physiograph (International Biomedical, Houston, TX, USA) and small-displacement pressure transducers with independent analyses by two investigators. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated at key time points cited above as the sum of diastolic pressure plus one-third of the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425911411595">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425911411595">22</xref></sup></p>

Measured values for pHa, PaCO<sub>2</sub> (mm-Hg), and PaO<sub>2</sub> (mmHg) were used to calculate arterial HCO<sub>3</sub><sup><bold>-</bold></sup> (mM) and the alveolar-arterial (A – a) PO<sub>2</sub> gradient (mmHg).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425911411595">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753425911411595">20</xref></sup> As <italic>t</italic> = 1 h represented the first arterial blood gas sample with the animals breathing room air, subsequent serial changes in each rat’s PaO<sub>2</sub> were calculated using its own <italic>t</italic> = 1 h value as baseline control. An additional 50-µl aliquot of each arterial sample was streak-plated for quantitative culture as described above, and the remaining portion of each arterial sample then clotted for sterile serum harvest and storage at – 70 °C.</p>
<p>Infected rats were randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups: no interventions (infection controls); cipro (10 mg/kg, <italic>b.i.d.</italic> × 3 d, IV) plus a continuous infusion of pharmacy grade sterile water (H<sub>2</sub>O) (0.5 ml/h × 8 h/d × 3 d); a continuous infusion of sterile H<sub>2</sub>O only (0.5 ml/h × 8h/d × 3 d); or cipro (10 mg/kg, <italic>b.i.d.</italic> × 3 d, IV) plus L-97-1 in sterile H<sub>2</sub>O (1, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/h) as a continuous <sc>IV</sc> infusion (0.5 ml/h × 8 h/d × 3 d). Treatments with cirpro plus H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>2</sub>O alone, or cipro plus L-97-1 started at <italic>t</italic> = 0 (immediately), 6, 24, 48, or 72 h after i.t. <italic>Y. pestis</italic> infection. All treatments were infused via venous catheters by calibrated infusion pumps (Harvard Apparatus, Cambridge, MA, USA). One additional group of CO99-infected rats received <sc>IV</sc> cipro as above plus L-97-1, but with the drug delivered by oral gavage (20 mg/kg, <italic>b.i.d.</italic>) starting at <italic>t</italic> = 72 h post-infection; oral dosing was done without sedation, using gentle hand cradling and an 8-cm stainless steel 15-gauge gavage needle fitted to a 1.0 ml syringe.

<p>In the 6 d survival studies, animals that survived 6 d (144 h) were necropsied; rats that died overnight were recorded as having survived until the previous observation period but were not necropsied. Also, in a 72 h time-killed study, infected rats that received no interventions were necropsied at 72 h. Rats were euthanized by isoflurane overdose (5%) and then underwent aseptic laparotomy and puncture of the diaphragm below the xiphoid process to allow an observed pneumothorax, followed immediately thereafter by dorsal aortic exsanguination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425911411595">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425911411595">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Right lung lobes were then aseptically excised, rinsed with sterile NS, and blotted dry on sterile gauze.

Paraffin-embedded serial sagittal sections (6 µm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H &amp; E) for routine evaluation of histopathology. Using double-blind scoring methods, each H &amp; E-stained section was evaluated at 40X, 100X and 400X using a scale of 0 (normal), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe) to grade parenchymal injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425911411595">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753425911411595">21</xref></sup> Acute lung injuries scored were: (a) interstitial and/or alveolar edema; (b) interstitial and/or alveolar hemorrhage; and, (c) interstitial and alveolar leukocytic infiltration indices (LII). For the first two injury types, the entire sagittal section was scanned at these multiple magnifications to assign a global severity index to each lung. In practice, at least ten random high-powered fields (HPFs) were assessed per sagittal section, starting at very low magnification (40X) and then magnifying these fields up to 400X, as needed, to denote a specific injury type, such as interstitial or alveolar edema or hemorrhage. For LII, a total of eleven HPFs for each lung section at 400X were independently selected by microscope stage coordinates and the median LII score of these eleven HPFs was reported. Total aggregate lung injury scores expressed as the sum of the individual lung injury scores (combined interstitial and alveolar scores) for edema, hemorrhage and LII were determined. Regions showing artifactual damage, such as pleural crushing, under-inflation, or compression atelectasis were excluded from analysis. Infected rats given no treatment were necropsied at 72 h (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and their lungs scored as described above.

<p>Delaying the start of treatments until <italic>t</italic> = 72 h after infection, cipro plus H<sub>2</sub>O resulted in a 6-d survival rate of 28% (5 out of 18), not different from either the 20% (2 out of 10) survival rate for L-97-1 alone (10 mg/kg/h × 8 h/d) or the ‘No Intervention’ group cited above (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753425911411595">Table 2</xref>).

Among these 72-h delayed treatment groups, median survival times for cipro plus L-97-1 at 1, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/h all increased to &gt; 144 h vs the median survival time of 84 h for cipro plus H<sub>2</sub>O, and 96 h after no intervention.</p>
<p>Given these striking results for 6-d survival among infected animals treated with cipro plus L-97-1 beginning at <italic>t</italic> = 72h, additional infected animals received either cipro plus H<sub>2</sub>O or cipro plus 10 mg/kg/h L-97-1 starting at <italic>t</italic> = 72 h for 3 d as above, before their catheters were sealed on day 6 and the animals monitored for an additional 22 d. Among these additional groups, we found the 28-d survival rates for cipro plus L-97-1 to be 78% (7 out of 9) vs 38% (3 out of 8) for cipro plus H<sub>2</sub>O (<italic>P</italic> = 0.12, logrank test). In addition to these <sc>IV</sc> treatment groups, we determined the effect of orally administered L-97-1 (20 mg/kg, <italic>p.o.</italic>, <italic>b.i.d.</italic>) plus the same <sc>IV</sc> cipro regimen (10 mg/kg, <italic>b.i.d.</italic>) starting at <italic>t</italic> = 72 h post-infection on 6-d survival.

<p>In this rat model of pneumonic plague induced by i.t. administration of <italic>Y. pestis</italic> CO99 (pCD1<sup><bold>+</bold></sup>/Δpgm), the combined treatment of cipro plus an infusion of L-97-1 significantly increased 6-d survival and reduced ALI versus cipro plus an infusion of H<sub>2</sub>O, the vehicle for L-97-1, when administered 72 h post-<italic>Y. pestis</italic> i.t. infection for 3 d. Cipro plus an infusion of H<sub>2</sub>O produced 100% survival if administered as late as 24 h following i.t. infection with <italic>Y. pestis</italic>. However, the 6-d survival benefit for cipro plus H<sub>2</sub>O dropped off significantly when administered 48 h and 72 h post-i.t. infection to 64% and 28%, respectively. The addition of L-97-1 to cipro at 48 h did not significantly improve 6 d survival versus cipro plus H<sub>2</sub>O; however, the addition of L-97-1 to cipro started at 72 h post-i.t. infection significantly improved 6 d survival and indices of ALI while preventing a significant decline in MAP versus cipro plus H<sub>2</sub>O. These data suggest that L-97-1 has considerable promise as an effective, post-exposure MCM adjunctive therapy to antibiotics for treating individuals exposed to airborne <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, as could occur during a bioterrorist attack. The present results are particularly significant in the absence of any Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved post-exposure MCMs for <italic>Y. pestis.</italic></p>

<p>It is possible that in the rat model of pneumonic plague described in these studies, and as is suggested by previous reports, LPS released from bacterial foci following blood-borne dissemination to multiple organs, contributes to the histopathologic changes of ALI evident at 72 h following inhalation of <italic>Y. pestis</italic>. In the current study, treatment with only cipro plus H<sub>2</sub>O that began at 24 h and 48 h following infection was effective and improved 6-d survival. However, at 72 h post-exposure to i.t. <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, cipro plus H<sub>2</sub>O was not effective and increased the mortality rate versus the untreated infected controls. When administered concurrently with cipro at 48 h post-exposure, L-97-1 did not improve survival versus cipro plus H<sub>2</sub>O. However, when administered with cipro starting 72 h post-exposure to <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, L-97-1 significantly increased 6-d survival. These findings suggest that the proliferation of intrapulmonary and disseminated bacteria within 72 h had reached sufficient mass to produce circulating levels of LPS that cause systemic effects. This is supported by the findings in a murine pneumonic plague model, where bacterial transcription profiles changed within the lung from day 2 to day 3 after infection with <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, confirming that expression of virulence factors, including LPS, increased with the duration of infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1753425911411595">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1753425911411595">32</xref></sup></p>

<p>When considered together, several reports suggest that the activation of A<sub>1</sub>ARs in the lung may contribute to LPS-induced ALI.

<p>Support that the A<sub>1</sub>AR is an important molecular target for LPS comes from both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies.

<p>Additional information suggesting that the A<sub>1</sub>AR may be an important molecular target for LPS comes from <italic>in vitro</italic> pharmacology assays for the A<sub>1</sub>AR, including radioligand competition binding and functional assays. In <italic>in vitro</italic> competition binding studies, LPS from US Pharmacopeia (Rockville, MD, USA) had an affinity (Ki) of 2.4 µg/ml for rat A<sub>1</sub>ARs stably expressed in Sf9 cells and labeled with [<sup>3</sup>H]-DPCPX (unpublished data, Constance N. Wilson). Previously, it was reported that in competition binding studies using membranes prepared from human PAECs, LPS from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Salmonella</italic> typhimurium, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> displaced the binding of another high affinity A<sub>1</sub>AR antagonist radioligand, [<sup>125</sup>I] BWA844U (IC<sub>50</sub> = 195 ng/ml, 290 ng/ml, 602 ng/ml, and 693 ng/ml respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425911411595">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In an <italic>in vitro</italic> pharmacological functional assay, <italic>e.g.</italic> a [<sup>35</sup>S] GTPγS GTP binding assay to measure A<sub>1</sub>AR agonist-mediated activation of G proteins, using membranes prepared from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing the rat A<sub>1</sub>AR, both LPS and <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), a selective A<sub>1</sub>AR agonist, activated G proteins. This activation by both LPS and CPA was significantly blocked by the A<sub>1</sub>AR antagonist, DPCPX, as well as by pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Gi/o protein (unpublished data, Constance N. Wilson). These results suggest that LPS functions as an A<sub>1</sub>AR agonist to activate A<sub>1</sub>ARs coupled to a Gi/o protein. These results considered with a previous report that LPS activation of A<sub>1</sub>ARs on human PAECs induces the release of cytotoxic substances, thromboxane and IL-6, suggest that LPS induces ALI by activation of A<sub>1</sub>ARs. Collectively, the results from the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies taken with those from the <italic>in vivo</italic> studies that A<sub>1</sub>AR antagonists block LPS-induced and <italic>Y. pestis</italic>-induced ALI and increase survival in two different animal models of sepsis, CLP-induced polymicrobial sepsis and <italic>Y. pestis</italic>-induced Gram-negative sepsis as reported in the current study and in previous reports, suggest that the A<sub>1</sub>AR is an important molecular target for LPS.</p>
<p>In the current study, plasma levels of L-97-1 for a single 8-h infusion of L-97-1 (10 mg/kg/h, IV) in normal, uninfected animals peaked at a concentration of 3.66 ± 1.06 µg/ml at the 4-h midpoint of the infusion. During the 3-d 8 h infusion, trough plasma levels of L-97-1 never declined below 0.38 µg/ml. These plasma levels correlate with L-97-1 concentrations of 6 μ<sc>M</sc> and 0.6 μ<sc>M</sc> respectively. In <italic>in vitro</italic> pharmacologic competition binding studies, L-97-1 binds to the rat A<sub>1</sub>AR stably expressed in Sf9 cells with an affinity of 550 n<sc>M</sc> (corresponding to 326 ng/ml) and to the rat A<sub>1</sub>AR stably expressed in CHO cells with an affinity of 2.8 µ<sc>M</sc> (corresponding to 1358 ng/ml; unpublished data, Constance N. Wilson). Although the affinity of <italic>Y. pestis</italic> LPS for the rat A<sub>1</sub>AR has not been determined and LPS plasma levels were not measured in the current study, based on the affinity of LPS and L-97-1 for the rat A<sub>1</sub>AR, the plasma concentrations of L-97-1 in the present study should have been sufficient to effectively compete with LPS for binding to A<sub>1</sub>ARs. Although it is not known if plasma concentrations of the agonist, LPS, or the antagonist, L-97-1 in the current study, were sufficient to saturate A<sub>1</sub>ARs, it would appear from the leveling off of the survival rate at 70% for the highest doses of L-97-1 that A<sub>1</sub>ARs were saturated with L-97-1.</p>
<p>In addition to the improved survival and reduced ALI achieved by using L-97-1 as an adjunctive therapy to antibiotics in a rat CLP sepsis model and in this study of pneumonic plague, L-97-1 has shown efficacy in an animal model of asthma, where it blocked allergic airway responses, hyper-reactivity and inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1753425911411595">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1753425911411595">45</xref></sup> Others have reported that A<sub>1</sub>AR antagonists block ischemia-reperfusion injury of the heart, lung, liver, and pancreas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1753425911411595">33</xref></sup> It is worth noting, however, that as opposed to a pro-inflammatory effect of A<sub>1</sub>AR activation, other reports have suggested an anti-inflammatory, protective effect for the A<sub>1</sub>AR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1753425911411595">33</xref></sup> Based on the findings in one of these reports, the use of A<sub>1</sub>AR antagonists in sepsis is not supported. In that report, the survival rate of A<sub>1</sub>AR knockout (KO) mice with CLP-induced sepsis was lower than that for the wild-type mice with CLP. In the same report, wild-type mice with CLP-induced sepsis treated with the A<sub>1</sub>AR antagonist, DPCPX, had a lower survival rate than the CLP controls.</p>
<p>There are a number of possible explanations to clarify the differences between these studies in mice with CLP sepsis versus the current studies in rats. Firstly, genetically manipulated animals may have compensatory expression of other proteins that alter the phenotypes of cells and organs. These altered phenotypes may play a significant role in the organ injuries seen in these KO models. Secondly, although at low concentrations DPCPX has high affinity for the A<sub>1</sub>AR and serves as an A<sub>1</sub>AR antagonist, at higher concentrations, DPCPX may function as an inverse agonist for the A<sub>1</sub>AR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1753425911411595">46</xref></sup> In addition, at higher concentrations, DPCPX is not selective for the A<sub>1</sub>AR and may block the anti-inflammatory effects of the Gs coupled A2bAR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1753425911411595">33</xref></sup> A detailed discussion of the pro-inflammatory versus the anti-inflammatory effects of A<sub>1</sub>AR activation is provided in a recent publication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1753425911411595">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, the findings in the current study support efficacy for L-97-1 as a post-exposure MCM to cipro for the treatment of <italic>Y. pestis</italic>-induced sepsis. The mechanism of action for the beneficial effects of L-97-1 as an adjunctive therapy to cipro on survival, ALI and shock in the rat model of pneumonic plague in the current study is not known at this time. Based on reports that LPS is an important virulence factor for <italic>Y. pestis,</italic> that LPS binds to and activates A<sub>1</sub>ARs, and that A<sub>1</sub>AR antagonists block LPS-induced ALI and improve survival following CLP, it is possible that L-97-1 is blocking activation of A<sub>1</sub>ARs by LPS to produce ALI and septic shock in this animal model of <italic>Y. pestis</italic>-induced sepsis. The role of LPS in <italic>Y. pestis</italic>-induced ALI and septic shock in this rat model of pneumonic plague, as well as other possible mechanisms of action to explain the efficacy of L-97-1 as an adjunctive therapy to cipro in this animal model of sepsis, are areas for future investigations. Furthermore, it is important to note that the host response to a more virulent strain of <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, such as the parent wildtype CO92 strain from which the CO99 pCD1<sup><bold>+</bold></sup>/Δpgm <italic>Y. pestis</italic> strain used for the current studies was derived, may differ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1753425911411595">47</xref></sup> Efficacy for L-97-1 as a post-exposure MCM for <italic>Y. pestis</italic> CO92-induced pneumonic plague and sepsis is yet to be determined, an area for future investigation, and a requirement to advance this promising anti-sepsis therapeutic as a MCM for plague sepsis in humans.</p>
