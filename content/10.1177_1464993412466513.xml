<p>In <italic>Brand Aid: Shopping Well to Save the World</italic>, Lisa Ann Richey and Stefano Ponte use the example of the Product (RED) campaign to interrogate one manifestation of recent efforts to ‘rebrand’ aid: namely, the connection of Western/Northern consumption with the generation of funds for development and aid in the Global South. Richey and Ponte effectively argue that this relatively recent phenomenon, while pulling together various threads in the history of aid, is something new that requires greater critical attention. Brand aid, as they call it, is a moment in which one can interrogate the impact of celebrity on policy-making, examine the emergent legitimacy of consumption as a source of aid, understand a shift in corporate social responsibility away from concerns for the relations of production associated with particular goods and toward a masking of those very relations under the notion of ‘helping’, and understand the (re)production of Africans as aid recipients. This book is at the same time approachable and tremendously ambitious, engaging a broad set of literatures and issues in aid and development in a relatively short, very well constructed and written book.</p>
<p>The central point of <italic>Brand Aid</italic> is clear: Product (RED) is an emergent form of aid that simultaneously produces brands that provide aid to poor and needy people and provide aid to brands, thus rebranding both aid (as something produced through the ‘standard’ workings of markets and consumerism, as help to the needy that does not require sacrifice on the part of the donor) and the companies engaged in such activities (granting them social legitimacy without engaging the relations of production that mark the companies’ own operations). The authors build their case through a tight argument that carries the reader from a history of representations of Africa through a discussion of the character of celebrity, the place of AIDS in the modern African context and the nature of consumerism. Despite the sweep of literatures and issues engaged by the text, the book is quite coherent.</p>
<p>After a concise introduction that lays out the broad arguments and structure of the book, Chapter 1 begins the argument with a discussion of the ‘Aid Celebrity’, which the authors construct around three major points: the meaning of celebrity and how such meanings play into contemporary aid and development, the history of celebrity involvement with international charity and ‘helping’ and a careful examination of what Richey and Ponte term the ‘aid celebrity trinity’ of Bono, Jeffrey Sachs and Paul Farmer, which has enabled Product (RED). The chapter lays out a clear definition of an ‘aid celebrity’, both in historical and contemporary context. That said, the authors’ definition seems a bit narrow, as their discussion is largely confined to post-1960 celebrity activism. This ignores the clear parallels between the modern aid celebrity and historical figures from early exploration and colonialism, such as Livingston or even Olaudah Equiano, and perhaps narrows the scope of their argument unnecessarily – indeed, it seems that a deeper consideration of the history of ‘aid celebrities’ only strengthens their argument that this is an important undercurrent in the history of aid and development, both mobilized by and transformed by Product (RED). I also found the inclusion of Farmer in the aid celebrity trinity uncomfortable, as the authors clearly recognize that Farmer’s involvement with aid, and indeed his status as a celebrity, has something of a different character than that of Bono or Sachs. Farmer is not directly engaged with Product (RED), and he is quite aware that his story has become a totem that represents much more than the sum of his professional achievements. This cannot be said of either Bono or Sachs. And, thus, while Richey and Ponte may be justified in arguing that Farmer’s celebrity status in the aid world has enabled some of the claims of Product (RED), to link Farmer to the efforts of Bono and Sachs was, to me, an unnecessary step too far in making their points about celebrity and aid.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 places Product (RED) into its historical context among efforts to ‘save Africa’. It begins with a brief discussion of efforts to represent Africa as disease-ridden, linking these previous discussions (which, among other things, were used to promote the sale of particular brands of soap) to contemporary framings of the African HIV/AIDS crisis. Richey and Ponte argue that Product (RED) mobilizes imagery of Africa and Africans that, while useful for promoting sales of Product (RED) products, draws upon the consumer expectations for Africa and thus consumer expectations of how their consumerism might help to deliver Africans from the plight of HIV/AIDS. Thus, the rebranding of aid under Product (RED) is ironic, as this rebranding is anything but libratory or transformative with regard to Western consumers’ understandings of Africa and the challenges faced by Africans in their everyday lives.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 provides a useful introduction to contemporary debates over aid effectiveness. Richey and Ponte note that these debates emerge from a current crisis of legitimacy in aid and development, though one might argue that the current crisis is just the latest manifestation of a debate that has raged for at least 25 years. Rather than question the entire framing of aid and development as ‘in crisis’, the authors focus on the debate taking place within this assumption – essentially, one camp (personified by Jeffrey Sachs) that argues that existing aid flows are too small to matter and therefore must be enlarged to be effective, and another (personified by William Easterly) that argues that aid is ineffective because it does not respond to actual needs on the ground. They argue that Product (RED) cuts across these arguments, supporting a technocratic solution for development challenges that can be achieved with more funding (à la Sachs), while at the same time more closely linking aid to business, which is presumed to be more responsive to on-the-ground desires and needs. While I find this construction of Product (RED) compelling, I feel that Richey and Ponte have overly narrowed the arguments of Easterly and others to a focus on making aid more like a business in their effort to demonstrate that Product (RED) cuts across contemporary development discourse. In fact, the bulk of Easterly’s critique is not about making aid like a business but better understanding why aid is not as effective as we expect – and his argument is about local governance and capacity, not business. Thus, it is not clear that Product (RED) would be any more appropriate in the eyes of Easterly than other aid efforts. The chapter then turns to a discussion of aid and AIDS in Africa, examining how organizations like the Global Fund (to which Product (RED) donations flow) construct the AIDS crisis and its solutions in a manner that attempts to balance on-the-ground needs with consumer and donor expectations of those needs, often to problematic ends.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 turns explicitly to how Product (RED) is a form of aid to brands, how it legitimizes business practices that link products to philanthropy in a manner that obscures the relations of production behind the products themselves. The chapter effectively demonstrates that Product (RED) is a particular form of corporate social responsibility (CSR) within an interesting typology of such efforts. The common view of CSR is what Richey and Ponte term ‘proximate and engaged’, examining such things as workplace conditions at headquarters, or ‘distant and engaged’, focused on workplace conditions and codes of conduct for suppliers who are spatially and socially distant from the company and its consumers. Such efforts address the relations of production of particular consumer products such that the perceived value of consumption of these products rises, generating a ‘win-win’ of improved worker conditions and improved profits. Product (RED), on the other hand, is a form of ‘distant and disengaged’ CSR, where efforts to address issues of social good associated with the products of a particular company hinge not on the relations of production of that product, but instead on the ways in which the consumption of the product serves to benefit a distant constituency that the consumer understands to be needy. Thus, the idea of need or emergency, such as presented by the crisis narratives associated with AIDS in Africa, can sweep aside efforts to engage challenges to the relations of production within companies and their supply chains for a focus on the ways in which a company and its products are ‘good’ for others in need, effectively obscuring potential inequalities and other issues tied to the production of the goods in question.</p>
<p>In Chapter 5, the authors pull the threads of the previous four chapters together into a discussion of what they call ‘causumerism’, shopping that seeks to make the world a better place. Legitimized by the voices of celebrities and justified by the emergency narratives that surround aid, product lines associated with Product (RED) enable consumers to address their desire to ‘do good’ without interrogating their patterns of consumption or the relations of production that underlie the products they consume. The authors effectively illustrate the complex contradictions of causumerism through a discussion of ethical trade and the specific case of Starbucks’ efforts to market sustainable, fair-trade coffees. The tension between Ethiopia’s desire to trademark its own indigenous varieties of coffee and Starbucks’ legal challenge to such efforts nicely illustrates how the brand aid that emerges through Product (RED) at some level always pits the desire to do good for impoverished others against the need to provide aid to brands in the form of imagery and associations that improve corporate image and therefore sales.</p>
<p>The final chapter is a conclusion that sums the key points of the book, concluding with the powerful argument that ‘Brand Aid creates a world where it is possible to have as much as you want without depriving anyone else’ (p. 188). If I have a complaint about this summary, it is that it ends on this point, leaving implicit the well-established fact that this world is a fantasy, from the standpoint of environmental sustainability and the distribution of wealth under late capitalism. The less-informed reader might not take this point from the conclusion, though it is clear that the authors fully understand the point they are making.</p>
<p>This book should be read by anyone interested in aid, development or the various emergent forms of capitalism taking shape in the Global South. It is written in an accessible style and the argument is very clearly structured and easy to follow. Despite the wide range of literatures engaged in this relatively short text, the book provides a broad (but manageable) range of citations for the reader. Here, I would argue that in their efforts to bridge academic and popular audiences, Richey and Ponte try too hard to bring social theory into the text. The few references to such theory, such as in their discussions of consumerism, are far too shallow and fleeting to add a great deal to the text. They could be dispensed with without having any negative effect on the overall argument, while making the book perhaps appear more approachable for the general reader. This, however, is a minor critique of an excellent book that has enough range of material to serve as a core text for a university course on aid and development, especially with a focus on ‘rebranding aid’, and which otherwise would provide an outstanding complement to courses on development, aid, economics, international business and philanthropy. <italic>Brand Aid: Shopping Well to Save the World</italic> should attract a following among the professional aid community as well, as this latest crisis of aid runs its course and responses like Product (RED) emerge, for better or for worse.</p>
