      <p>It has been over 11 years since the publication of the South Dakota (SD) Board of Nursing theory-based regulatory decisioning model in <italic>Nursing Science Quarterly</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447552">Benedict et al., 2000</xref>). This innovative model based on nursing science continues to guide the SD Board of Nursing in their unique role of public protection as it relates to the practice of nursing. This column revisits the decisioning model in 2012 with an emphasis on the cocreation of a strategic plan to guide the work of the SD Board through 2014, influenced by the latest refinements of the humanbecoming theory postulates and the humanbecoming concepts of community change. To this day, a three dimensional artistic interpretation of the model is on display in the Board of Nursing conference room and is referred to on many occasions as regulatory decisions are made.</p>
      <sec id="section1-0894318412447552">
         <title>The Journey</title>
         <p>The South Dakota Board of Nursing embarked on the journey to create a nursing theory-based decisioning model in 1995. The initial step of the journey involved a retreat held in the Black Hills of South Dakota. This retreat offered the Board the opportunity to engage in a generative discussion regarding decisions made by nursing regulatory boards and to engage in a process of values clarification.</p>
         <p>Three experts addressed the Board at this retreat; a public policy expert, a nursing practice expert, and an expert in nursing education. These experts engaged in scholarly dialogue with the Board on the state of the art and science of their respective areas of expertise. Each expert offered information that related directly to the public protection responsibilities of the Board of Nursing. As a result of this dialogue, it became evident to the Board that nursing science was not an integral part of decisions made by regulatory boards. Two questions emerged as major influencers in the decision to create a nursing theory-based decisioning model. The questions were:</p>
         <list id="list1-0894318412447552" list-type="order">
            <list-item>
               <p>Why is it necessary for professional nurses to hold positions on Boards of Nursing as members and staff if nursing knowledge is not a critical element of the decisions that are made and become public policy?</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
               <p>Should not nursing knowledge be the key component of decision making for nursing? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318412447552">Damgaard &amp; Bunkers, 1998</xref>, p. 142)</p>
            </list-item>
         </list>
         <p>The creation of a regulatory decisioning model, grounded in nursing science, the tenets of public policy development, and the values of the Board of Nursing became a shared vision of the SD Board of Nursing. The next steps of the journey included the selection of Rosemarie Rizzo Parse’s humanbecoming school of thought as the basis for this work. The Board embraced this human science perspective focusing on quality of life from the person’s perspective as a core value related to their regulatory decision-making.</p>
         <p>A systematic study of the humanbecoming theory ensued over the course of several years. The study included sessions with staff members and a standing agenda item at each Board meeting for conversations about humanbecoming led by Dr. Sandra Bunkers, a Parse scholar. Additionally, the Board supported staff to attend the Institute of Humanbecoming to increase knowledge and understanding of the theory. During this time, two nursing theory conferences were held in Sioux Falls, SD, that featured Dr. Rosemarie Rizzo Parse. Board of Nursing members and staff had the opportunity to meet and dialogue with her on the Board’s emerging decisioning model. This unique opportunity to work directly with the nurse theorist made the decisioning model come to life. Public protection is the SD Board of Nursing’s mission and is enacted in codified law and administrative rules. “The decisioning model demonstrates a fundamental belief that quality of life is defined from the person’s/community’s perspective” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447552">Benedict et al., 2000</xref>, p. 168). The SD Board of Nursing’s theory-based regulatory decisioning model fulfills the Board of Nursing’s social mandate “to protect the public’s health, safety, and welfare as it relates to the profession of nursing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447552">Benedict et al., 2000</xref>, p. 167). The public protection mandate centers on three major quality standards that are depicted in the decisioning model as pillars. These pillars of quality include: quality of education, quality of care, and quality of the practitioner.</p>
         <p>
            <italic>Quality of education</italic> relates directly to the approval of nursing education programs and is a major responsibility of the Board of Nursing in protection of the public. This includes consumers of education as well as consumers of nursing care. The Board sets guidelines for the teaching of nursing science and ensures that quality standards are in place for nursing graduates to enter the profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447552">Benedict et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
         <p>
            <italic>Quality of care</italic> is directly linked to the quality of education and the quality of the practitioner and focuses on the nurse-person process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447552">Benedict et al., 2000</xref>) The nurse person process involves “recognizing each person as a human presence, being open to new discoveries in nursing science, respecting differing views, being nonjudgmental, and understanding that people are free to choose within situations their own paradoxical patterns for living health” (Parse, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447552">Benedict et al., 2000</xref>, p. 169).</p>
         <p>
            <italic>Quality of the practitioner</italic> focuses on the competence of the nurse and the quality of care that is delivered in healthcare settings. “The Board recognizes that competence of the practitioner is based on the accepted standards of nursing practice, the ethics of the discipline, skill in critical thinking, a value system that focuses on the betterment of humankind, an understanding of nursing science, and a commitment to life-long learning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447552">Benedict, 2000</xref>, pp. 169-170).</p>

         <title>Postulates of Humanbecoming Manifested in the Board of Nursing’s Values</title>
         <p>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447552">Parse’s (2007)</xref> humanbecoming postulates undergird the three principles of humanbecoming. These postulates are: illimitability, paradox, freedom, and mystery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447552">Parse, 2007</xref>). These four postulates provide a unifying foundation for the principles that the Board of Nursing theory-based regulatory decisioning model is based upon and the values that the Board of Nursing profess: vision, integrity, commitment, courage, flexibility, and collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447552">Benedict et al., 2000</xref>). Following will be examples of how the humanbecoming postulates surface with the Board of Nursing’s living of their identified values.</p>
         <p>The first postulate, “illimitability is the indivisible, unbounded knowing extended to infinity, the all-at-once remembering and prospecting with the moment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447552">Parse, 2007</xref>, p. 308). The Board of Nursing’s value of <italic>flexibility</italic> which is “a responsive openness to changing patterns of living while honoring diversity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447552">Benedict et al., 2000</xref>, p. 171) suggests exploring unbounded possibilities for choosing new and unlimited ways of moving with what is emerging. The choosing-not choosing that occurs with <italic>flexibility</italic> indicates valuing, the second core concept in the first principle of humanbecoming, “structuring meaning is the imaging and valuing of languaging” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447552">Parse, 2007</xref>, p. 309). In relation to illimitability, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447552">Parse (2007)</xref> posited that, “humans in structuring meaning, have illimitable options from which to choose in the context of what is known explicitly-tacitly and confirmed-not confirmed with speaking-being silent and moving-being still” (p. 309). <italic>Flexibility</italic> confirms an honoring of new and original choices.</p>
         <p>The second postulate, paradox, “is an intricate rhythm expressed as a pattern preference. Paradoxes are not opposites to be reconciled or dilemmas to be overcome but, rather, are lived rhythms” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447552">Parse, 2007</xref>, p. 309). The Board of Nursing’s value of <italic>collaboration</italic> is described as “engaging with others while cocreating the not-yet. Collaboration involves living with paradoxical forces in relationship and serves as a vehicle for sharing public information and forming public policy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447552">Benedict et al., 2000</xref>, p. 170). With <italic>collaboration</italic>, individuals and groups move together and apart in framing ideas and actions. These paradoxical rhythms of attending and distancing, embracing certain ideas and discarding others, are part of connecting-separating which is the third concept in the second principle of humanbecoming, “configuring rhythmical patterns of relating is the revealing-concealing and enabling-limiting of connecting-separating” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447552">Parse, 2007</xref>, p. 309). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447552">Parse (2007)</xref> suggested that, “humans, in configuring patterns of relating, live humanuniverse rhythms” (p. 309). <italic>Collaboration</italic> involves the configuring of paradoxical rhythms of disclosing-not disclosing and looking at what is possible and what is not possible in working together as a Board of Nursing.</p>
         <p>The third postulate, freedom, “is contextually construed liberation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447552">Parse, 2007</xref>, p. 309). Freedom to choose in situation is explicit in the Board of Nursing’s values of <italic>integrity and commitment. Integrity</italic> “is a consistent way of being with chosen beliefs. It involves acting on certain beliefs and choosing not to act on others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447552">Benedict et al., 2000</xref>, p. 170). C<italic>ommitment</italic> is “a passionate presence to something of value” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447552">Parse, 1997</xref>, p. 109). It is “a focused determination to deliberately engage with others to move an idea or program to fruition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447552">Parse, 1997</xref>, p. 109). Both <italic>integrity and commitment</italic> are ways of living what is important and are freely chosen by individuals on the Board of Nursing, and involve the humanbecoming concepts of valuing and powering. Valuing, as described earlier, is the second core concept of the first principle of humanbecoming. Valuing involves the paradoxical processes of confirming-not confirming what is important. Powering is the first core concept of the third principle of humanbecoming, “cotranscending with possibles is the powering and originating of transforming” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447552">Parse, 2007</xref>, p. 309). The consistent ways of acting with <italic>integrity</italic> and the focused determination to move an idea or program forward with <italic>commitment</italic> demonstrate the pushing-resisting rhythm of powering onward. “Powering is a continuous rhythmical process incarnating intentions and actions in moving with possibilities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447552">Parse, 1998</xref>, p. 47). The freedom with which the Board of Nursing chooses to push onward and to choose possibilities is lived with <italic>integrity and commitment.</italic>
         </p>
         <p>Mystery, the fourth postulate of humanbecoming, “is the unexplainable, that which cannot be completely known unequivocally. It is a puzzlement, an impenetrable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447552">Parse, 2007</xref>, p. 309). Puzzlement and not knowing emerge with the Board of Nursing’s valuing of <italic>courage</italic>. “<italic>Courage</italic> is the willingness to risk when knowing and not knowing what will be. Courage involves perseverance in the face of opposing forces” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447552">Benedict et al., 2000</xref>, p. 170). Courage embraces having a <italic>vision</italic> of what could be, while not knowing what will be and involves originating transforming, the second and third concepts of the third principle of humanbecoming. Originating is “inventing new ways of conforming-not conforming in the certainty-uncertainty of living. It is creating ways of distinguishing personal uniqueness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447552">Parse, 1998</xref>, p. 49). It requires <italic>courage</italic> and vision for the SD Board of Nursing to move forward a humanbecoming regulatory decisioning model, not knowing how the regional or national regulatory boards will respond to a unique and different method of public policy-making. Transforming is “shifting the view of the familiar-unfamiliar, the changing of change in coconstituting anew in a deliberate way” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447552">Parse, 1998</xref>, p. 51). <italic>Courage</italic> is lived by the SD Board of Nursing members as they face the familiar-unfamiliar and work with the vision of transforming anew their public policy practices.</p>
         <p>The SD Board of Nursing’s public policy practices are based on the belief that “public policy making, as it relates to the profession of nursing, must be grounded in nursing science” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447552">Benedict et al., 2000</xref>, p. 170). Linking the theory of humanbecoming, the values of the Board of Nursing, and tenets of public policy creates a nursing theory-guided process of establishing transparent decision-making in nursing regulation.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section3-0894318412447552">
         <title>Tenets of Public Policy-Making and Transparent Community Change</title>
         <p>The tenets of public policy-making identified by the Board of Nursing include “choice, diversity, history, economics, and law” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447552">Benedict et al., 2000</xref>, p. 170). These tenets helped to guide the members of the Board of Nursing as they cocreated a strategic plan for 2011-2014. “<italic>Choice</italic>, from a humanbecoming perspective is not a linear process but a pattern of acting on values at an explicit-tacit level” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447552">Benedict et al., 2000</xref>, p. 170). This pattern of acting on values when planning public policy involves the humanbecoming community change concepts of savoring-sacrificing. “Savoring is relishing ideas, objects, or events that are appealing to community, and these arise as threads of constancy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447552">Parse, 2003</xref>, p. 37). What is appealing to community, from the Board of Nursing perspective, is what is in the best interest of individuals and groups in regard to public protection as it relates to the nursing profession. “Sacrificing is giving up something originally delighted in and all-at-once taking on something else” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447552">Parse, 2003</xref>, p. 37). Viewing nursing regulation through the lens of nursing science has been a shapeshifting endeavor as old ways of decisioning were replaced with the new model.</p>
         <p>
            <italic>Diversity</italic>, “from a humanbecoming perspective is a unique pattern of relating. Complexity of individuals and systems is interconnected with diversity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447552">Benedict et al., 2000</xref>, p. 170). These unique, complex patterns of relating involve the humanbecoming concepts of moving-initiating community change, particularly laddering and ballooning. “<italic>Laddering</italic> is climbing multidirectionally in planning and executing strategies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447552">Parse, 2003</xref>, p. 24). The Board of Nursing considered all parties and all demands and interests when developing a strategic plan for the many directions to take in the protection of the public in relation to nursing practice, nursing regulation, and nursing education. “<italic>Ballooning</italic> is drifting vigilantly with the pattern of the whole in a buoyant surgence-release, while shifting winds cocreate the unexpected” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447552">Parse, 2003</xref>, p. 24). The Board of Nursing was vigilant in looking at the implications of new programming for nursing regulation as they developed their strategic plan. The Board of Nursing monitored the pattern of the whole of shifting attitudes and concerns of professionals and the public in regard to public protection and quality of healthcare—addressing all issues that surfaced with the unexpected.</p>
         <p>The public policy tenet of <italic>history</italic> links our “predecessors, contemporaries, and successors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447552">Parse, 1999</xref>, p. 120). Considering history in developing the Board of Nursing’s strategic plan focused “on understanding the patterns and meanings of lived experiences for persons and communities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447552">Benedict et al., 2000</xref>, p. 170). Honoring the community’s history involved the community change concept of revering-liberating.”<italic>Revering-liberating</italic> is honoring while all-at-once freeing in anchoring-shifting community change” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447552">Parse, 2003</xref>, p. 37). The Board of Nursing honored that which had been and was important to professional nurses and the public while at the same time feeling free to plan new programs and new ways for addressing regulatory issues.</p>

            <italic>Economics</italic>, from a humanbecoming perspective, “involves the interchange of resources. Resources may include persons, time, finances, or ideas” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447552">Benedict et al., 2000</xref>, p. 170). The Board of Nursing called upon a variety of persons, devoted full allotments of time, and explored ideas from all sources when cocreating their 2011-2014 strategic plan. This exploring of all resources involved the humanbecoming concept of considering-composing community change. “<italic>Considering-composing</italic> is deeply contemplating while all-at-once birthing anew in pondering-shaping community change” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447552">Parse, 2003</xref>, p. 39). Strategies for addressing public policy and public safety related to healthcare were created anew in the strategic planning process of the Board of Nursing.</p>
         <p>
            <italic>Law</italic> is the final public policy tenet addressed by the Board of Nursing strategic planning process. “<italic>Law</italic> from a human becoming perspective involves creating value patterns. These value patterns may involve rights of persons in society, the affirmation of a certain course of action, and the assurance of protection from harm”(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447552">Benedict et al., 2000</xref>, p. 170). The Board of Nursing was aware of “the paradox of law—it enables or authorizes nursing practice (freedom) while limiting nursing behaviors that are inconsistent with public safety (restriction)”(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447552">Vander Woude &amp; Hutcherson, 1999</xref>, p. 213). Cocreating the paradoxical value patterns of law entails the humanbecoming concept of pondering-shaping community change, specifically considering-composing. “Considering-composing is deeply contemplating while all-at-once birthing anew”(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447552">Parse, 2003</xref>, p. 39). The Board of Nursing realized that enacted law is not open to interpretation. Modification of law requires deep contemplation when composing alternatives to what currently exists.</p>
         <p>The Board of Nursing’s focus on humanbecoming nursing science, the values of the Board, and the tenets of public policy-making exist as a pattern of the whole as the SD Board moves forward with the implementation of the strategic plan which serves as a framework for operationalizing their work.</p>

         <title>The Board of Nursing Strategic Planning Process: For the Greater Good</title>
         <p>The greater good of society is the focus of the SD Board of Nursing’s strategic planning process with its foundational values based on the principles of the nursing theory of humanbecoming. From a humanbecoming perspective, living justice and transparency for the individuals on the Board of Nursing, can be viewed as a cocreated experience of honoring the dignity of others in participating with opportunities and limitations surfacing in community while moving with and away from others in assuring excellence in regulating the quality of nursing education, quality of the nursing practitioner, and quality of healthcare for all. The SD Board of Nursing identified four strategic initiatives to be operationalized in the years 2011 through 2014 to achieve this excellence.</p>
         <sec id="section5-0894318412447552">
            <title>Strategic Initiative #1</title>
            <p>The first strategic initiative is to assure the public that competent practitioners deliver nursing care services by upholding accepted standards of nursing practice, the ethics of the discipline, skill in critical thinking, a value system focused on the betterment of humankind, and understanding of nursing science, and commitment to lifelong learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447552">SD Board of Nursing, 2011</xref>).</p>
            <p>The operational focus for <italic>strategic initiative # 1</italic> includes creating a safe system of practice for the delegation of medication administration; participating in the development of a post-licensure competence model for nurses; developing reliable mechanisms to assure the safe return to practice for nurses identified as not meeting standards of quality of practice; and, establishing a just culture model within nursing regulation, while participating with healthcare systems in pursuing a statewide plan for patient safety. From a humanbecoming community change perspective, the Board of Nursing is involved in moving-initiating community change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447552">Parse, 2003</xref>). Moving-initiating community change involves “discarding and creating all at once incarnating the value priorities of community, whether the community is an individual or group” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447552">Parse, 2003</xref>, p. 23). The Board discarded outdated ideas concerning patient safety and cocreated new directions to address a just culture to promote patient safety.</p>
            <p>Examples of the projects based on <italic>strategic initiative #1</italic> focus on the model’s pillar of quality of the practitioner. Examples include the development of reliable mechanisms to assure the safe return to practice for nurses identified as not meeting standards of quality practice. The Board of Nursing has implemented a Health Professional Assistance Program for nurses living with substance use disorders. The Board is exploring expanding that program to include a mental health component. The Board of Nursing is also exploring the development of a practice remediation program. As the Board of Nursing 99999moves forward with these initiatives, the lens of humanbecoming guides the decisions made on programming.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section6-0894318412447552">
            <title>Strategic Initiative #2</title>
            <p>The second strategic initiative is to assure the public of quality nursing care through leadership that guides the evolution of nursing practice and recognizes each person as a human presence, is open to new discoveries in nursing science, respects differing views, and understands that people are free to choose their own patterns of living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447552">SD Board of Nursing, 2011</xref>).</p>
            <p>The operational focus for <italic>strategic initiative #2</italic> includes providing leadership for public policy initiatives influencing quality of nursing care; serving as a resource for guiding decisions regarding appropriate utilization of the knowledge and skills of practicing nurses; monitoring and participating in the development of emergent models of education, regulation, and practice for advanced practice registered nurses (APRN); and, participating in the development of the Center for Nursing Workforce strategic initiatives regarding the supply, demand, and need for nurses. From a humanbecoming community change perspective, the Board of Nursing is involved in pondering-shaping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447552">Parse, 2003</xref>) community change. Pondering-shaping is “contemplating while configuring. In living community, pondering what can be is present all-at-once with shaping what will be” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447552">Parse, 2003</xref>, p. 38).</p>
            <p>The projects involved in <italic>strategic initiative #2</italic> relate to the Board of Nursing’s model pillar of quality of care. Examples include a pilot research project entitled, “A Virtual Model of Nursing Care for Children with Diabetes in the School Setting.” It is an innovative model that utilizes current technology and the knowledge of the nurse to enhance the care of school-aged children. Another project involves implementing the National Consensus Model for APRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318412447552">APRN Consensus Work Group &amp; the National Council of State Boards of Nursing APRN Advisory Committee, 2008</xref>). There is also the formation of a practice advisory committee for the Board of Nursing to advise the Board on the state of the art and science of nursing care to assist the board in decision-making; and; building the leadership capacity of the nursing workforce through <italic>the art of hosting methodology.</italic>

         </sec>
         <sec id="section7-0894318412447552">
            <title>Strategic Initiative #3</title>
            <p>The third strategic initiative is to protect consumers of education, as well as consumers of nursing care, by establishing guidelines for teaching nursing science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447552">SD Board of Nursing, 2011</xref>).</p>
            <p>The operational focus for <italic>strategic initiative #3</italic> includes assuring that nursing regulations are current and relevant for nursing education and based on national standards while embracing innovative models. Projects with the <italic>strategic initiative #3</italic> are related to the model’s pillar of quality of education. They include creating an education advisory committee that will review and determine appropriate recommendations for revisions for the current education regulations. From a humanbecoming community change perspective the Board of Nursing is anchoring-shifting community change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447552">Parse, 2003</xref>). “The two major processes of anchoring-shifting community change are savoring-sacrificing and revering-liberating” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447552">Parse, 2003</xref>, p. 36). In promoting quality of education “savoring-sacrificing is delighting in and all-at-once foregoing something of value . . .and, “revering-liberating is honoring while all-at-once freeing in anchoring-shifting community change” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447552">Parse, 2003</xref>, p. 37). In advancing quality nursing education, all teaching-learning practices are reviewed with the freedom to hold on to what is excellent and let go of what is not working to create changes to further move nursing education forward.</p>

         <sec id="section8-0894318412447552">
            <title>Strategic Initiative #4</title>
            <p>The fourth strategic initiative is to position the Board of Nursing to effectively manage its resources and fulfill its mission of public protection and vision of regulatory excellence. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447552">SD Board of Nursing, 2011</xref>).</p>
            <p>The operational focus for <italic>strategic initiative #4</italic> includes implementing technology that improves accuracy, efficiency, and retrieval of data necessary for regulating and licensing qualified practitioners, and innovating new methods of professional role implementation within the structure of the Board of Nursing. From a humanbecoming perspective, the Board of Nursing is moving-initiating community change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447552">Parse, 2003</xref>). “Moving-initiating is a cocreated paradoxical rhythm of community change. It is discarding and creating all-at-once, incarnating the value priorities of the community, whether community is an individual or group” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447552">Parse, 2003</xref>, p. 23) The projects involved in <italic>strategic initiative #4</italic> include all model pillars since it is related to the infrastructure of the Board of Nursing that facilitates their fulfilling their social mandate of public protection and fulfilling their vision of regulatory excellence. These strategic initiatives address the value priorities of the SD Board of Nursing.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>The SD Board of Nursing theory-based decisioning model remains a pillar of strength in the decisions made by the Board over the past 11 years. The model continues to provide the framework for the strategic planning process that guides the operations of the Board. New conceptualizations of the theory will be studied by SD Board members and staff at the 2012 Institute of Humanbecoming and plans are in process to incorporate these conceptualizations into formal study at each of the Board meetings. The values of the Board of Nursing have been reaffirmed over the years and the tenets of public policy-making remain relevant to regulatory decisions. In the regulatory community, value is placed on the development of an infrastructure that withstands the test of time. The SD Board of Nursing theory-based regulatory decisioning model, grounded in nursing science, is an exemplar of such an infrastructure.</p>
