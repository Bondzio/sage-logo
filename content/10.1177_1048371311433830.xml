<p>Each semester I teach a music fundamentals course for elementary education majors—undergraduate students studying to be general classroom teachers, early childhood specialists, and/or special education teachers. I begin the term by inquiring about their previous music experience. My questions include: Do you currently play an instrument? Did you play an instrument while you were growing up? Are you playing/have you played in an ensemble? I typically receive a smattering of responses. Some have played an instrument at some point while they were growing up as well as participating in a large ensemble—usually band or choir.</p>
<p>I find that the students are usually reflecting on their most recent experience which is high school. So I dig a little deeper and ask about their elementary experiences. The following report on responses is not hard data, but rather a result of the traditional “show of hands.”</p>
<p>Q: How many of you had music in elementary school?</p>
<p>A: Usually everyone raises their hands—I find this encouraging.</p>
<p>Q: How many of you had a teacher that was solely in charge of music instruction?</p>
<p>A: Everyone—again, good news.</p>
<p>Q: How many of you went to a specific classroom for music?</p>
<p>A: Nearly all—I’m very pleased to see/hear this.</p>
<p>I continue to dig a bit more to inquire about the types of experiences they participated in during music class—how they were engaged in music.</p>
<p>Q: How many of you remember SINGING during your music class?</p>
<p>A: All hands go up.</p>
<p>Q: How many remember LISTENING to music during your music class?</p>
<p>A: Again, all hands are raised although it does take some a few moments for them to contemplate the meaning of “listening.”</p>
<p>Q: How many of you recall PLAYING instruments during music class?</p>
<p>A: Everyone.</p>
<p>Q: How many recall MOVING to music during class? (This question usually requires a bit of explanation.)</p>
<p>A: Not a consensus—usually ½ to ¾ of the class.</p>
<p>Q: How many remember CREATING during music class? (This question always requires an explanation and description of what “creating” might look like in a music class.)</p>
<p>A: Just a few hands are raised in response. While not surprised, I find this discouraging.</p>
<p>What is it about the act, or art, of creating that is inhibiting? Perhaps it is the years of training that music educators experienced as they learned their instrument/s and the focus to play the music that was written. Or, maybe it is the fear of the unknown—not sure that the result will sound “okay” or “acceptable.” Some may find reading/performing existing music easier than creating—whether through improvisation or composition. And, of course, the mind-set of “improvisation is for jazz musicians and I wasn’t trained as a jazz musician” is fairly common among many “classically trained” music educators.</p>
<p>Yes, planning a lesson with a creative component takes many of us out of our comfort zone. Yes, music educators need to be willing release the control of the resulting product to the student/s doing the creating. And yes, sometimes it takes more time, energy, and structure on the part of the teacher to plan and implement an experience with a creative element. But, ultimately, it is worth the time, energy, and discomfort. When our students are engaged creatively, we have a true picture of their content knowledge and skill level.</p>
<p>I encourage everyone, myself included, to make a concerted effort to plan experiences for students, allowing them to create as well as recreate music. And I am looking forward to the day when I ask my class of 19-year-olds, “How many of you recall CREATING in music class?” and all hands are raised in response.</p>
<p>This is my final column as Chair of the Council for General Music Education. It has been an honor to serve in this capacity for general music educators. Best wishes for much success in your future endeavors.</p>
