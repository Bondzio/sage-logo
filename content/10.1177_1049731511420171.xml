<body>
<p>With the editor of this journal, Professor Bruce Thyer, the suggestion was made that he and I prepare editorials outlining our views on the merits of the research approach that is largely seen as contrasting with the one we professionally use most often and is reflected in the journals we, respectively, edit. He has prepared his essay on the merits of qualitative research, and it will appear in the journal I coedit, <italic>Qualitative Social Work,</italic> and mine appears within the pages of <italic>Research on Social Work Practice</italic> (RSWP).</p>
<p>Like the qualitative health researchers, Miller and Crabtree, I am prepared to “hold quantitative objectivisms in one hand and qualitative revelations in the other” (2005, p. 613)—“‘hold” not as something I possess but as better enabling a close examination and understanding. Critical understanding of the merits of this or that research methodology requires being insider and outsider, member and stranger, white coat thinker and purple coat doer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1049731511420171">1</xref></sup> It demands the cultivation of “anthropological strangeness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731511420171">Lofland, Snow, Andersen, &amp; Lofland, 2006</xref>), and the avoidance of sentimentality, which we are guilty of<disp-quote>
<p>when we refuse, for whatever reason, to investigate some matter that should properly be regarded as problematic. We are sentimental, especially, when our reason is that we would prefer not to know what is going on, if to know would be to violate some sympathy whose existence we may not even be aware of. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731511420171">Becker, 1970</xref>, pp. 132–133)</p>
</disp-quote>Yet, the ways in which such debates have been conducted are in large part unhelpful. Not that there is nothing to debate, or that I stand as a neutral bystander (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049731511420171">Shaw, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049731511420171">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049731511420171">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049731511420171">Shaw &amp; Norton, 2008</xref>). But social workers have tended to adopt entrenched positions that make it difficult to get fully inside or outside the arguments. Hence positivism, for example, becomes “a swearword by which no-one is swearing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049731511420171">Williams, 1976</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1049731511420171">2</xref></sup> or we are sometimes left with the impression that if only we were courageous enough to “deconstruct” a problem or take a “postmodern” position, we would be more than half way to its solution. For both positivists and committed advocates of humanist alternatives, Augustine’s comment is apposite—“total abstinence is easier than perfect moderation.”</p>
<p>To get to the point, writing as a convinced qualitative methodologist—roughly speaking, epistemologically constructivist and ontologically realist—I hope to get over the major ways in which I have been influenced, shaped, and even excited by quantitative methods in particular and methodology in general. While I have engaged in a number of quantitative studies—surveys (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049731511420171">Shaw, 1985</xref>), mark-recapture methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049731511420171">Shaw, Bloor, Cormack, &amp; Williamson, 1996</xref>), and program evaluation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049731511420171">Shaw et al., 2009</xref>)—my main focus in this short article is on quantitative solutions to the problem of comparison, in particular through experimental and quasi-experimental intervention research. I write in rather personal way, and this means some of the U.K. references are left unexplained. The article is written as a planned tandem piece with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049731511420171">Thyer (in press)</xref>, offering something to a conversation, rather than simply inviting it.</p>

<title>The Thrill of the Chase</title>
<p>I had found methodology exciting from my undergraduate days as a sociology student at Sheffield University, pursuing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731511420171">Peter Mann’s (1985)</xref> methodology course.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1049731511420171">3</xref></sup> It was many years later that I gratefully picked John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731511420171">Madge’s (1963)</xref>
<italic>The Origins of Scientific Sociology</italic> off the shelf of a second hand bookshop in Hay on Wye.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1049731511420171">4</xref></sup> I was probably the only student of my year who read the now long-forgotten heavyweight Madge cover to cover.</p>
<p>In 1960s and 1970s in the U.K. experiments and quasi experiments (the distinction was not too often made until the classic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731511420171">Cook and Campbell’s 1979</xref> book), and the responses that bounced off them, provided the real excitement as well as the reference point for social work research. Some of the most stimulating writing was by those who engaged with this work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731511420171">Briar &amp; Miller, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731511420171">Fischer, 1976</xref>). I spent many hours writing detailed abstracts of these studies for my students (<italic>Girls at Vocational High</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731511420171">Meyer, Borgatta, &amp; Jones, 1965</xref>; <italic>Helping the Aged</italic> by Matilda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731511420171">Goldberg, 1970</xref>; Kingswood study in Bristol (Clarke &amp; Cornish, 1972), the IMPACT studies in the UK’s Probation Service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731511420171">Folkard et al, 1976</xref>); <italic>Brief and Extended Casework</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049731511420171">Reid &amp; Shyne, 1969</xref>, etc.). The edginess of this field can still be encountered in reading Mary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049731511420171">MacDonald’s (1966)</xref> response to the <italic>Girls at Vocational High</italic> study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049731511420171">MacDonald, 1966</xref>), and even around the experimenters’ camp fires, there were sharp elbows (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731511420171">Fischer, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>I am not sure whether scientific controversies take place in social work in the same sense they occur in the more established sciences, but this was perhaps as near as it gets. This is perhaps one reason why all this quickened the pulse. It appeared to offer a tough-mindedness combined with an empirical rigor marked by a mind-set that was ready to listen to the evidence. For example, the original task-centered casework experiment <italic>Brief and Extended Casework</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049731511420171">Reid &amp; Shyne, 1969</xref>) was carried out with the assumption that open-ended casework would prove more effective than brief interventions, given ideal circumstances. When the contrary was supported by the evidence, it led to a prolonged program of research led by Bill Reid to develop and test the effectiveness of the model. It was this resistance to ideological interests that gave me something to challenge the psychodynamic hegemony of social work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1049731511420171">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the 1960s and shortly after, Britain witnessed substantial social work research that was based on quantitative expertise or a combination of quantitative and qualitative excellence. The early work of people such as Sinclair, Davies, Clarke, and Cornish and others linked to the Home Office Research Unit, the influence of epidemiological models on the work of Matilda Goldberg and others, the cross-fertilizing work of Tizard, Sinclair, and colleagues on small institutions, the solitary cluster of British research on task-centered models of intervention, and the research on child care issues that led to the establishment of the Dartington Social Research Unit in 1963,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1049731511420171">6</xref></sup> were often marked by a methodological enthusiasm and innovativeness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1049731511420171">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>Gifts and Borrowings</title>
<p>Enthusiasm, innovativeness, and tough-minded rigor would be good enough to be going on with, but there are other quantitative gifts and qualitative borrowings that I find enriching. By “gifts” I have in mind those occasions—by no means universal—when quantitative scholars take positions on the nature and priority of different sources of evidence that permit reciprocity in exchanges between quantitative and qualitative scholars. By “borrowings” I have in mind ways in which design solutions and fieldwork methods in qualitative research may gain from adopting aspects of the logic of quantitative comparison studies.</p>
<sec id="section3-1049731511420171">
<title>Gifts</title>
<p>I will glance at two kinds of position taking. First, those that are sometimes associated with researchers working in the experimental design tradition, and second, caveats and cautions expressed by quantitative scholars regarding the nature of the scientific enterprise.</p>
<p>There was an ambiguity about the value of experimental designs even in the rather overdrawn halcyon days of the 1960s and 1970s. Perhaps, the most enduring of these was the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731511420171">Cook and Campbell (1979)</xref>, for example, in their discussion of “obstacles to conducting randomized experiments in field settings” in Chapter 8 of the first edition. One of the aforementioned U.K. Home Office studies was a controlled trial of the effectiveness of a therapeutic community approach at the Kingswood Training School in Bristol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731511420171">Clarke &amp; Cornish, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049731511420171">Cornish &amp; Clark, 1975</xref>). They concluded:<disp-quote>
<p>The research design used in the Kingswood study was signally unsatisfactory on a number of counts. Not only did ethical difficulties inherent in the design contribute to the premature closure of the project, but even if it had been completed as planned, the results would have been of doubtful scientific value since they would have provided a poor basis for any generalisations about effective treatment methods. In addition the research disrupted many aspects of the administration and life in the school and, because it took such a long time (and would have taken even longer if it had gone according to plan), it is doubtful that decisions about treatment policy could have been suspended until its completion. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731511420171">Clarke &amp; Cornish, 1972</xref>, p. 19)</p>
</disp-quote>Anticipating that someone might respond that even negative evidence is of some value, they say that because of the interpretive ambiguity of such evidence, this would not “seem to be an adequate pay-off for such a time-consuming and expensive project” (p. 19). “Accordingly, the controlled trial would seem to have a more limited function in penal research than has sometimes been ascribed to it in the past and certainly much more limited than it has in medicine” (p. 22).</p>
<p>The problems were tellingly expressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731511420171">Reid (1988)</xref>. While he was convinced the helping professions can demonstrate that they are effective, he warned that the practical significance of identified effects is often slight and their durability ambiguous. He sometimes appeared doubtful about the methodological criteria of such studies. In his chastening and memorable metaphor, “It is like trying to decide which horse won a race viewed at a bad angle from the grandstand during a cloudburst” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731511420171">Reid, 1988</xref>, p. 48).</p>
<p>Reid’s work also illustrated the wider reservations by some quantitative scholars about the hegemony of particular assumptions about the nature of scientific knowledge. He was keen to remind me and a coauthor in a prepublication review of our then pending book that in our discussion of common sense, we “might consider some reference to the long-held notion that science is, indeed, as Dewey once put it, ‘common sense, writ large’” (unpublished review). Despite his misgivings about positivist bashing and epistemological grandstanding, he was ready to acknowledge that theoretical assumptions <italic>are</italic> implicit in scientific practice (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049731511420171">Reid, 2002</xref>). He developed this in one of his invaluable reviews of the empirical practice movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731511420171">Reid &amp; Zettergren, 1999</xref>) and returned to it in his and Kirk’s argument that “it may make sense to construe scientific practice as a ‘perspective’ on intervention,” and his willingness “to accredit client ideas about measurement, data collection and the like that might not fit conventional research notions.” They went as far as to say that this understanding of a scientific practice perspective “could be used with advocacy research, even though the practitioner researcher might need to forgo his or her ‘neutrality’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731511420171">Kirk &amp; Reid, 2002</xref>, p. 89).</p>
<p>Reid was making two kinds of concession that may seem surprising from a superficial reading of his extensive body of work. First, he is nodding acknowledgment to advocacy researchers, and second, he is readily conceding that conventional scientific logic may not be the only player in the game. He may have agreed with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731511420171">Byrne (2011)</xref> when he writes that “measurement is a process of interpretation, no less than the processes of interpretation which underpin qualitative research practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731511420171">Byrne, 2011</xref>, p. 32). Acknowledging the place of interpretive and perspectival stances in quantitative research opens the way for greater hesitancy in evidence claims.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731511420171">Cronbach et al. (1980)</xref> at Cornell laid out more general hesitations in their profound assessment of program evaluation that repays repeated reading and every time poses new insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731511420171">Cronbach et al., 1980</xref>). They suggested that summative evaluations have a deeply conservative tendency through powerful biases to showing no effects. They cite a writer to the effect that the great power of these is “when the main purpose is to knock down some new proposal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731511420171">Cronbach et al., 1980</xref>, p. 158). The question, “Does it work?” is a skeptical question and “functions as an exclusionary gatekeeper” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731511420171">Bogdan &amp; Taylor, 1994</xref>, p. 296). Even assuming the design problems had been solved the question still would not be helpful to practitioners. “Conscientious practitioners do not approach their work as sceptics; they believe in what they do” (p. 297). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731511420171">Bogdan and Taylor (1994)</xref> have worked to develop what they call “optimistic research.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1049731511420171">8</xref></sup> “We have evolved an approach to research that has helped us bridge the gap between the activists, on the one hand, and empirically grounded sceptical researchers, on the other” (p. 295).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731511420171">Cronbach et al. (1980)</xref> also offered a critique of the injunctions to evaluate against clear and measurable goals, with assignment, and reliable and objective measures that sustain internal validity. While not going as far as what they call the humanist school of evaluation, they say “We do not consider it reasonable to separate the effects of the program from the rest of the client’s experience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731511420171">Cronbach et al., 1980</xref>, p. 217). Using school evaluation as illustration, they say that a “program that appears superior to a rival program in isolation may be inferior when each program is embedded in the regular sequence of school experience.” In addition, “After the experimenter with his artificial constraint leaves the scene, the operating program is sure to be adapted to local conditions” (p. 217). They comment to similar effect with, as they say, a “stroke or two of caricature” (p. 58) on the notion of evaluation as a summative single stand-alone study in which “the program is to ‘play statue’ while the evaluator’s slow film records its picture” (p. 56).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731511420171">Cronbach (1986)</xref> argued in a later article that to reduce inferential risk we should collect data about the local situation. Independent variables are in fact a local “combination of treatment, units, setting, and so on,” and arguments about causes are oversimplified. He pleads for the importance of the “search” in research, and for not discouraging quantitative researchers “from wide-eyed unstructured observation” (p. 101). He complains of evaluation research being geared to justification rather than discovery. “Investigators … should sniff around the phenomenon and probe unsystematically for a long while before they mount a wrap-up study intended to ‘establish’ what they have perceived” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731511420171">Cronbach, 1986</xref>, p. 102). He also casts doubt on the value of the notion of replication. “A program evaluation is so dependent on its context that replication of it is only a figure of speech” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731511420171">Cronbach et al., 1980</xref>, p. 222).</p>
<p>This “tough-minded master of conceptual distinctions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049731511420171">Scriven, 1986</xref>, p. 15) detects consequences for how we draw inferences. In his important critique of Campbell’s position on internal validity, he argues that “External validity”—validity of inferences that go beyond the data—is the crux of social action, not ‘internal validity’” (1980, p. 231). The statistical inference only allows us to say that something associated with this made a difference. “This is a report on a local historical event, not a conclusion about a recurrent relation” (pp. 314–315). Thus, it is external and construct validity that matter. To this end, evaluation can provide the credible, plausible, and probable—but not the necessary—evidence.</p>
<p>By way of advice he insists “progress requires that we respect poorly formed and even ‘untestable’ ideas.”. In a nice phrase he says, “We should be stern only where it would cost us much to be wrong” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731511420171">Cronbach, 1986</xref>, p. 86). He espouses epistemological modesty in a challenging sense when he says<disp-quote>
<p>In my opinion, social science is cumulative, not in possessing ever-more-refined answers about fixed questions, but in possessing an ever-richer repertoire of questions. (p. 91)</p>
</disp-quote>I have extended this argument because Cronbach’s general work is largely unknown in social work research. Yet I find it, with Shadish and others,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>A brilliant <italic>tour de force</italic>, unusually rewarding if closely read, trenchant in analysis of the status quo, and creating truly unique alternatives sensitive to the scholarly needs for general knowledge and the practitioner need for local application. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049731511420171">Shadish, Cook, &amp; Leviton, 1990</xref>, p. 375)</p>

<title>Borrowings</title>
<p>The quantitative scholar, Ian Sinclair, goes as far as to say that qualitative methods are in many ways “more adapted to the complexity of the practitioner’s world than the blockbuster randomized control trial (RCT).”<disp-quote>
<p>Qualitative research draws attention to features of a situation that others may have missed but which once seen have major implications for practice. It counteracts a tendency to treat the powerless as creatures with something less than normal human feelings. It contributes to an ethically defensible selection of outcome measures. And, in combination with simple statistical description, it can lead to an informed and incisive evaluation of programs in social services. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049731511420171">Sinclair, 2000</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>He turns common assumptions on their head when he concludes that,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Quantitative social work research does face peculiarly acute difficulties arising from the intangible nature of its variables, the fluid, probabilistic way in which these variables are connected, and the degree to which outcome criteria are subject to dispute. (pp. 9–10)</p>
</disp-quote>But rather than compare the merits of one or the other for outcomes research, I want to refer to the ways that qualitative strategies may gain by borrowing. For example, simulations have the potential to provide “a unique and innovative tool that has not yet been widely applied” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049731511420171">Turner &amp; Zimmerman, 1994</xref>, p. 335). The application I have in mind is as a qualitative proxy for control within a natural setting. One particular example of simulation—the simulated client—represents an advance on the use of vignettes in policy research. Those who evaluate the process of professional practice come face-to-face with the invisibility of practice. How may we learn the ways in which lawyers, teachers, general medical practitioners, or social workers practice? How would different professionals deal with the same case? Wasoff and Dobash used a promising innovatory method in their study of how a specific piece of law reform was incorporated into the practice of solicitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049731511420171">Wasoff &amp; Dobash, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049731511420171">1996</xref>). The use of simulated clients in “natural” settings allowed them to identify practice variations that could be ascribed with some confidence to differences between lawyers rather than the artifacts of differences between cases.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049731511420171">Patton (2002)</xref> gives an example of such logic borrowing in showing how the creation of qualitative matrices is especially useful for exploring linkages between process and outcome. The analytic sequence entails the development of categorizations of types and levels of outcomes and of program processes. The categories are developed through orthodox qualitative analysis. The relationships between processes and outcomes may come either from participants or through subsequent analysis.<disp-quote>
<p>In either case, the process/outcomes matrix becomes a way of organizing, thinking about and presenting the qualitative connections between program implementation dimensions and program impacts. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049731511420171">Patton, 2002</xref>, p. 472)</p>
</disp-quote>The following extract gives an illustration of how this approach can operate.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Suppose we have been evaluating a juvenile justice program that places delinquent youth in foster homes …. A <italic>regularly recurring process theme</italic> concerns the importance of “letting kids learn to make their own decisions.” A <italic>regularly recurring outcome theme</italic> involves “keeping the kids straight” … By crossing the program process (“kids making their own decisions”) with the program outcome (“keeping the kids straight”), we create a data analysis question: What actual decisions do juveniles make that are supposed to lead to reduced recidivism? We then carefully review our field notes and interview quotations looking for data that help us understand how people in the program have answered this question based on their actual behaviors and practices. By describing what decisions juveniles actually make in the program, the decision makers to whom our findings are reported can make their own judgements about the strength or weakness of the linkage ….” (pp. 472–473)</p>
</disp-quote>Hence, while qualitative evaluation cannot resolve the problems of causal conclusions any more than quantitative evaluation, it can assess causality “as it actually plays out in a particular setting” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731511420171">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>, p. 10).</p>
<p>A more general influence of quantitative approaches in qualitative research can be seen in the development of structured methods within ethnography. Systematic self-observation is one such method. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731511420171">Rodriguez and Ryave (2002)</xref> explore its use as a research strategy. As a qualitative research tool, they see systematic self-observation as training informants “to observe and record a selected feature of their everyday experience,” so that participants “go about their lives while alertly observing” the matter of interest (p. 2). The focus is on understanding the ordinary, in particular the covert, the elusive and the personal. In an effort to overcome the “numbness to the details of everyday life” (p. 4), respondents are asked to observe “a single, focused phenomenon that is natural to the culture, is readily noticeable, is intermittent … is bounded … and is of short duration” (p. 5) and also to focus on the subjective.</p>
<p>The recording involves writing a narrative about the situation, the participants, what occurred, the words spoken and thoughts/feelings experienced at the time (i.e., not retrospectively), and doing it as soon as possible after the event. In observing, they are instructed in no way to act differently than usual, to never produce instances nor to judge the propriety of the action—“do not judge it, do not slow down, do not speed up, do not change it, do not question it—just observe it” (p. 17). They refer to a key skill as gaining a “new mindfulness” about everyday life. In their own studies, they have used the method to research telling lies, telling secrets in everyday life, withholding compliments and the role of envy in making social comparisons in everyday life—mundane everyday matters that are not far from the concerns of social workers.</p>
<p>Compared with single system designs for evaluating intervention, systematic self-observation may well be a preferred research method in two respects:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>It will allow a more contextualized and richer understanding of the nature of a problem in a service user’s life, as part of an assessment and planning process.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Single system approaches often are committed to behavioral approaches that typically proceed by counting and measuring incidence and prevalence of problems. Systematic self-observation is, as we have noted “more appropriate for the study of hidden or elusive domains, like the motives, memories, thought processes, withheld actions, thoughts and/or emotions that accompany overt behaviours” (p. 11).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>I have revisited social work research half a century ago to recapture the excitement and radical intellectual and logical challenge of quantitative research addressing comparative outcomes. I have referred to the work of several quantitative scholars, whose sensitivity to the limits (and limitations) of science makes for greater rather than lesser impacts on research thinking and practice. I have concluded with illustrations of qualitative borrowings from more structured research approaches. Nothing said in this article supports naïve consensual synthesizing of quantitative and qualitative methods, sometimes apparent in the current fad for mixed methods. But it may enrich both qualitative and quantitative inquiry.</p>

<p>The decline and partial loss of this creative stream of research in the United Kingdom can be understood in the light of the withering and eventual demise of the Probation Service link to social work, the crisis of confidence in the face of “nothing works” arguments, and the decline of quantitative skills associated with the flowering of qualitative methodology from the early 1970s. At the time of writing, there is a determined revival of quantitative skills in the United Kingdom through Forrester, Shemmings, Macdonald, Carpenter, and others.</p>
