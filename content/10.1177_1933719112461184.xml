<abstract>
<p>The pituitary gonadotropin follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) interacts with its membrane-bound receptor to produce biologic effects. Traditional functions of FSH include follicular development and estradiol production in females, and the regulation of Sertoli cell action and spermatogenesis in males. Knockout mice for both the ligand (<italic>Fshb</italic>) and the receptor (<italic>Fshr</italic>) serve as models for FSH deficiency, while <italic>Fshb</italic> and <italic>Fshr</italic> transgenic mice manifest FSH excess. In addition, inactivating mutations of both human orthologs (<italic>FSHB</italic> and <italic>FSHR</italic>) have been characterized in a small number of patients, with phenotypic effects of the ligand disruption being more profound than those of its receptor. Activating human <italic>FSHR</italic> mutants have also been described in both sexes, leading to a phenotype of normal testis function (male) or spontaneous ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (females). As determined from human and mouse models, FSH is essential for normal puberty and fertility in females, particularly for ovarian follicular development beyond the antral stage. In males, FSH is necessary for normal spermatogenesis, but there are differences in human and mouse models. The <italic>FSHB</italic> mutations in humans result in azoospermia; while <italic>FSHR</italic> mutations in humans and knockouts of both the ligand and the receptor in mice affect testicular function but do not result in absolute infertility. Available evidence also indicates that FSH may also be necessary for normal androgen synthesis in males and females.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The coordination of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis is regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) action. Intriguingly, GnRH neurons originate outside the brain and migrate alongside olfactory nerves to reach the hypothalamus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112461184">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112461184">2</xref>
</sup> The GnRH neurons from the arcuate nucleus within the hypothalamus secrete GnRH in a pulsatile manner into the hypophyseal portal system, where it acts on its cell surface receptor in the anterior pituitary.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112461184">3</xref>
</sup> In turn, pituitary gonadotropes respond by increasing the production of the common α-subunit and specific β-subunits of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). These assembled α-β dimers of FSH and LH exert their principal function in the gonads, where gametogenesis, folliculogenesis, and steroidogenesis occur. The steroid hormones, estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) in females, and testosterone in males, feedback to both the hypothalamus and pituitary to modulate the production of GnRH and the gonadotropins. The recently characterized gonadotropin inhibitory hormone (GnIH), also known as RFRP-3, inhibits gonadotropin expression and serum levels and is likely to have an important regulatory function.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112461184">4</xref>
</sup> The HPG axis is central to normal pubertal development and reproductive capacity, as the onset of puberty is accomplished through an activation of the GnRH pulse generator with FSH playing a vital role in reproductive maturation and function.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112461184">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The FSH ligand is produced principally from the anterior pituitary and targets its receptor found on the cell surface of granulosa cells of the ovary and Sertoli cells of the testes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112461184">5</xref>
</sup> The ovarian response to FSH induces aromatase, converting androgens to estrogens and inducing follicular maturation. In addition, the hormone inhibin B is produced by the granulosa cells and exerts negative feedback upon FSH. In the testes, FSH upregulates Sertoli cells and along with testosterone plays a key role in spermatogenesis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112461184">5</xref>
</sup> Mutations of both the <italic>FSHβ</italic> gene (<italic>FSHB</italic>) and its receptor (<italic>FSHR</italic>) have been reported in humans; and the corresponding knockouts (KOs) have been generated in mice. These recent discoveries have furthered the understanding of FSH signaling and metabolism, important for its effect upon sexual maturation and reproduction. The purpose of this review is to evaluate all of the existing literature on these very valuable “KOs of nature” in humans with mutations of <italic>FSHB</italic> and <italic>FSHR</italic>, as well as the corresponding KO and transgenic mice. Since activating <italic>FSHR</italic> mutations have also been described in humans, the phenotypic findings from excess FSH can be examined and compared with transgenic mouse overexpression models. Findings from these studies will then be incorporated into the understanding of FSH action in mammals as much has changed since we last summarized the literature more than a decade ago.<sup>

<title>The Human FSH Ligand</title>
<p>A dimeric pituitary glycoprotein hormone, FSH is composed of an α-subunit and a β-subunit, which are both expressed in the gonadotropes of the pituitary gland.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112461184">6</xref>
</sup> The α-subunit is encoded by a single gene (<italic>CGA</italic>), which is common to FSH, LH, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112461184">7</xref>
</sup> The α-subunit protein is noncovalently joined to the β-subunit to form a biologically active hormone, but it is the β-subunit that confers hormone specificity. The β-subunit is structurally similar to the members of the cysteine knot GF family.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112461184">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The 9.6 kb human <italic>CGA</italic> gene is localized to chromosome 6q14.3 and has 2 splice variants. Variant NM_001252383 represents the longer transcript and encodes the longer isoform, containing 5 exons, yielding a 147 amino acid protein that is N-linked glycosylated at positions 107 and 133 (Asn52 and Asn78 of the mature protein).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112461184">6</xref>
</sup> The signal peptide is 24 amino acids and the mature protein 123 amino acids. The shorter variant NM_000735 encodes 116 amino acids and lacks an alternate in-frame exon 3 that the longer variant possesses. This protein has the same 24 amino acid signal peptide and a 92 amino acid mature protein. Tertiary structure of the α-subunit is provided by 5 disulfide bonds formed via 10 Cys residues, which are completely conserved across species.</p>
<p>The 4.26 kb human <italic>FSHB</italic> gene on chromosome 11p14.1 is composed of 3 exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719112461184">Figure 1</xref>), which encode a 129 amino acid FSH β-subunit (an 18 amino acid signal peptide and a 111 amino acid mature protein).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112461184">8</xref>
</sup> The single <italic>FSHB</italic> gene possesses several unique characteristics compared to the other gonadotropin β-subunit genes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112461184">8</xref>
</sup> Alternative splicing of the first exon, which encodes the 5' untranslated regions, renders this small exon either 33 or 63 nucleotides in length.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112461184">8</xref>
</sup> Exon 2 encodes the 18 amino acid signal peptide followed by the first 35 residues of the mature β-subunit, while the third exon encodes amino acids 54 to 129 and the 3′ untranslated region. Therefore, 2 different-sized transcripts (<italic>FSHB</italic>-NM_000510 and NM_001018080) are produced from alternative splicing of exon 1 and the presence of 2 different potential sites of polyadenylation; however, each results in the translation of the same FSHβ protein. The FSHβ-subunit possesses 2 N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn25 and Asn42 of the total protein (Asn7 and Asn24 of the mature protein) as well as 12 highly conserved Cys residues that form 6 disulfide bonds including Cys21-Cys69, Cys35-Cys84, Cys38-Cys122, Cys46-Cys100, Cys50-Cys102, and Cys105-Cys112 of the full-length protein.<sup>

<title>The Human FSHR</title>
<p>The human FSH receptor (FSHR) is a glycosylated, heptohelical G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with an exceptionally long extracellular domain (ECD) constituting more than half of the full-length protein (residues 1-357), a 7 transmembrane domain (TMD1: 358-390, TMD2: 395-429, TMD3: 440-472, TMD4: 482-506, TMD5: 525-557, TMD6: 565-597, and TMD7: 605-642), 3 short intracellular loops (ICL1: 391-394, ICL2: 473-481, and ICL3: 558-564), and 3 extracellular loops (ECL1: 430-439, ECL2: 507-524, and ECL3: 598-604), and an intracellular tail (643-695; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719112461184">Figure 2</xref>).<sup>

<p>Two transcript variants have been described in humans, a longer one (NM_000145) and a shorter one (NM_181446), which lacks an alternate in-frame exon 6 of the longer variant. The longer protein NP_000136 contains 695 amino acids in length and is encoded by a 192-kb gene on chromosome 2p16.3, which contains 10 exons. The first 9 exons range in size from 69 to 251 bp and encode the extracellular domain, while the last exon containing an open reading frame of 1234 bp encodes the entire transmembrane domain loops and intracellular domains of the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719112461184">Figure 2</xref>). The large ECD is made up of leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and a horseshoe-shaped structure of α-helices and β-strands, conferring specificity and high-affinity binding.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112461184">14</xref>
</sup> The rhodopsin-like domain comprising 7 hydrophobic transmembrane helices functions to activate the receptor which then use G proteins for signal transduction. The FSHR is principally expressed in granulosa cells in females and in Sertoli cells in males but has also recently been found in the endothelium of a wide variety of tumor blood vessels.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112461184">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In addition to the 2 human FSHR isoforms, FSHR isoforms have been described in other species. Yarney et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719112461184">15</xref>
</sup> identified an alternatively spliced ovine FSHR isoform, which is identical to the full-length FSHR for most of its protein, but diverges in sequence beginning at residue 625 and results in a shorter protein by 25 amino acids. As further shown by these investigators,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719112461184">16</xref>
</sup> this FSHR isoform was shown to possess dominant negative qualities since co-transfection of the isoform in stably transfected HEK293 cells abrogated hormone response. Kraaij et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112461184">17</xref>
</sup> identified 2 FSHR splice variants in rat, but both messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encode truncated proteins, and when co-transfected with the WT FSHR, signal transduction was not affected. Therefore, no clear gonadal function could be attributed to these 2 isoforms. Similarly, Tena-Sempere et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719112461184">18</xref>
</sup> identified 4 different mouse FSHR splice variants, but none were able to bind recombinant human FSH or elicit cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) or progesterone responses in vitro. More recently, Sairam et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112461184">19</xref>
</sup> characterized 4 ovine FSHR isoforms (R1-R4). R1 is the full-length FSHR comprised of 10 exons, while R2 has the 10 exons but has a different C-terminus (the dominant negative isoform mentioned above). R3 has exons 1-8, but is truncated, and appears to function as a cytokine/growth factor type receptor. R4 has only exons 1-4 and is a truncated receptor with uncertain function.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112461184">19</xref>
</sup> Therefore, the complexity of the FSHR suggests diverse functions that will continue to be elucidated.</p>

<title>Follicle-Stimulating Hormone Signaling and Action</title>
<p>Dimeric FSH binds to the ectodomain of the FSHR in a handclasp fashion as β-strand residues of the receptor interact with the α- and β-subunits of the ligand.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112461184">6</xref>
</sup> During this ligand binding, the FSHR dimerizes, which prompts changes as the 7-transmembrane domain then acts on a heterotrimeric G<sub>s</sub> protein causing guanine nucleotide exchange and activation of adenylyl cyclase, which results in the production of protein kinase A.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112461184">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112461184">14</xref>
</sup> The resulting cAMP then initiates a signaling cascade culminating in steroid synthesis. In addition, there is evidence that FSH also activates other separate signaling cascades such as RAS,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719112461184">20</xref>
</sup> PI3K (likely via an SRC tyrosine kinase),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719112461184">20</xref>
</sup> and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112461184">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Recently, the crystal structure of FSH binding to the entire ectodomain of the receptor has been reported by Jiang et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112461184">22</xref>
</sup> The ectodomain of the FSHR is comprised of 12 LRR with a hairpin loop between the 11th and 12th LRRs. This hairpin loop contains an important amino acid residue, a sulfated tyrosine at codon 335 (sTyr), that forms the hinge region (the hinge region was previously thought to be a separate structural unit).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112461184">22</xref>
</sup> The convex surface formed by the LRR and the hinge region resembles the fingers and thumb, respectively, of a right hand; and the binding of FSH with its receptor is similar to a right hand clasping an American football. Unexpectedly, FSH binding to the entire ectodomain forms a trimeric arrangement, which suggested an additional binding site on the FSHR outside the primary region (termed an exosite).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112461184">22</xref>
</sup> These findings suggest a 2-step process of FSH binding to its receptor. First, the quiescent state FSHR exposes LRR 1-8 to recruit FSH to the hormone-binding region. In the second step, FSH accepts the hinge region of the FSHR with sTyr, which now prepares the FSHR to enter the active state with G<sub>s</sub> or β-arrestin.<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719112461184">24</xref>
</sup> Serum LH levels in the <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− mice were consistently elevated above baseline for all ages of development. Grossly, the uteri and ovaries of the <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− mice were markedly small, consistent with hypoestrogenism. Somewhat surprisingly, however, serum estradiol levels were normal in these <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− females, although it is notoriously difficult to discriminate low from low-normal estradiol by immunoassay.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719112461184">25</xref>
</sup> Microscopically, the ovaries contained mostly primordial and primary follicles, with only occasional small, degenerating, antral follicles. No preovulatory mature follicles or corpora lutea were identified in female <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− mice.<sup>

</p>
<p>These findings in <italic>Fshb </italic>−/− mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719112461184">Table 1</xref>) suggested that FSH is essential for estrous cyclicity and fertility in female mice. In addition, follicular development up to the primary and early antral stages in the ovary occurred in the absence of pituitary FSH.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719112461184">24</xref>
</sup> The observed phenotypic manifestations in female <italic>Fshb </italic>−/− mice were all reversible by the administration of exogenous gonadotropins.<sup>

Ovarian <italic>Fshr</italic> expression doubled, but <italic>Lhr</italic> was 5-fold less that of WT and heterozygotes. Serum/glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (Sgk), which is implicated in transitioning granulosa cells from a proliferative to a terminally differentiated luteal state, was reduced more than 5-fold. Steroid enzyme machinery was also affected as expected. Without FSH, both P450 side chain cleavage (<italic>Cyp11a</italic>) and aromatase (<italic>Cyp19</italic>) were decreased by about 6-fold, while 17-hydroxylase (<italic>Cyp17</italic>) expression was doubled (and found to be localized to the theca).<sup>

Follistatin (<italic>Fst</italic>) expression did not change. Cell cycle genes were also altered: cyclin D2 (<italic>Ccnd2</italic>), which is important for granulosa cell proliferation, was decreased by 30%; whereas <italic>Cdk2</italic> and <italic>Cdk6</italic> (associated with granulosa cell cycle withdrawal, differentiation, and luteinization) were increased by 50% and 20%, respectively.

<title>Human <italic>FSHB</italic> mutations</title>
<p>Only 5 different <italic>FSHB</italic> mutations have been found in humans (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1933719112461184">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719112461184">Figure 1</xref>)— 6 females (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1933719112461184">Table 3</xref>) and 3 males (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1933719112461184">Table 4</xref>). The first patient with an <italic>FSHB</italic> mutation was described by Matthews et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112461184">36</xref>
</sup> in 1993. She was a 27-year-old female who presented with primary amenorrhea, low serum FSH, and high LH. At the age of 13, she had no breast development but was subsequently treated with estrogen. She later conceived with exogenous gonadotropin therapy. Upon DNA sequencing, the proband was found to possess a homozygous 2 base pair deletion at codon 61 (Val61X) of the mature protein. These investigators did not perform functional studies in vitro, but this frameshift mutation was predicted to alter amino acids 61 to 86, and then produce a stop codon, resulting in a truncated FSHβ protein lacking amino acids 87 to 111.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112461184">36</xref>
</sup> It should be noted that for most of the described human <italic>FSHB</italic> mutations, the nomenclature only took into account the mature protein. However, in the now accepted mutation nomenclature, the 18 amino acid signal peptide should really be numbered as codon 1 as it represents the first in-frame ATG.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1933719112461184">41</xref>
</sup> In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1933719112461184">Table 2</xref>, the reported nomenclature of described <italic>FSHB</italic> mutations is shown, along with their corrected nomenclature. Therefore, this mutation is more correctly indicated as Val79fs or Val79fsX105, as it alters amino acids 79 to 104 and produces a stop codon truncating amino acids 105 to 129.</p>

</sup> reported the first patient with an <italic>FSHB</italic> mutation that was confirmed by in vitro analysis. The proband was a 15 11/12 year-old female who presented with absent breast development, primary amenorrhea, low FSH, undetectable estradiol, elevated LH levels, and no pituitary tumor by MRI.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719112461184">32</xref>
</sup> She demonstrated compound heterozygosity for 2 different <italic>FSHB</italic> gene mutations, 1 being the previously described Val61X (Val79fs or Val79fsX105) inherited from her mother, while the other was a Cys51Gly (Cys69Gly, new nomenclature) missense mutation inherited from her father. When mutants versus controls were separately transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells, both the Val79fs and the Cys69Gly proteins resulted in unmeasurable immunoreactive and bioactive FSH levels in the cellular media compared with controls.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719112461184">32</xref>
</sup> These in vitro data confirmed the phenotypic findings of the patient and indicated that FSH is necessary for pubertal development and fertility in females. There were 5 heterozygotes within the family who were fertile, therefore suggesting that only biallelic <italic>FSHB</italic> mutations impair reproductive function.</p>
<p>Since these 2 patients were described, there have only been 4 more females with <italic>FSHB</italic> mutations reported (cases 3-6 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1933719112461184">Table 3</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719112461184">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1933719112461184">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1933719112461184">38</xref>
</sup> Rather than completely lacking breast development as was present in the first 2 patients, these females all had partial breast development. Nevertheless, all 6 described females share certain phenotypic findings—primary amenorrhea, low serum FSH, low serum estradiol, and elevated LH (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1933719112461184">Table 3</xref>). When GnRH stimulation was performed in 5 of these patients, no FSH rise from baseline was observed, whereas there was a marked rise in serum LH in all 5 patients who were studied. These findings could be predicted since the absence of estradiol negative feedback should elicit an increase in GnRH secretion and a subsequent but appropriate rise in LH. However, no corresponding rise in FSH occurs because of the <italic>FSHB</italic> mutation, which likely interferes with dimer formation and subsequent secretion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719112461184">32</xref>

Two are frameshift; 1 is a stop mutation; and 1 is a missense involving the highly conserved Cys residue. All 4 reported <italic>FSHB</italic> mutations in females resulted in unmeasurable immuno and bioactive FSH in vitro, regardless of the clinical severity of the mutations (ie, the presence or absence of breast development).<sup>

<p>Several interesting features of the patient with the compound heterozygous Val61X/Cys51Gly (Val79fx/Cys69Gly, new nomenclature) mutations deserve further mention.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719112461184">32</xref>

</sup> These findings were unexpected, considering that women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) demonstrate elevated LH levels and elevated androgens.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1933719112461184">44</xref>
</sup> This suggested that perhaps FSH was necessary for the LH-induced theca cells to make androgens. In order to test this hypothesis, serial gonadotropin levels were obtained for 11 hours at 10-minute intervals. Consistent with the baseline levels, serum FSH was unmeasurable, while the mean LH level was elevated (49 mIU/mL) with 9 LH pulses and an elevated amplitude (46 mIU/mL), as is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719112461184">Figure 3.</xref>

</sup> By ultrasound, she had multiple small antral follicles, similar to a PCO appearing ovary except there was no dense stroma.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1933719112461184">42</xref>
</sup> She was given dexamethasone to suppress the adrenal contribution of androgens for 4 days and then 5000 IU hCG was administered (endocrine studies were done at baseline and 24 hours later). Following a washout period of 1 month, baseline studies were obtained, and then she received 300 IU recombinant FSH (rFSH), and then hCG again 24 hours later.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1933719112461184">43</xref>
</sup> Androgens increased somewhat in response to hCG alone, but there was a more dramatic rise in testosterone (which more than tripled) after rFSH followed by hCG. These data add further support to the hypothesis that LH-induced androgen production in the theca requires the presence of FSH for a normal physiologic response, perhaps by inducing inhibin, LH receptors, or growth factors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1933719112461184">43</xref>
</sup> In primates, there is a positive correlation between expression of the FSHR and the androgen receptor in healthy, growing follicles.<sup>

</sup> By overnight sampling, she had 8 LH pulses/8 hours similar to the other patient. However, she had no response to hCG, rFSH, or hCG + rFSH, which could be an age-related effect since she was 41 at the time of the studies.<sup>

<title>The <italic>Fshb</italic> knockout mouse</title>
<p>FSH-deficient <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− male mice had normal sexual development (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719112461184">Table 1</xref>); and serum levels of LH and testosterone were similar to control <italic>Fshb </italic>+/+ males. It is likely that testosterone’s negative feedback in these <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− mice accounts for the quantitative difference in serum LH values between male and female <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− mice. In contrast to female <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− mice that are infertile, the male <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− mice are fertile despite a decrease in testicular size and a 75% reduction in sperm. Microscopic examination of the testes reveals a relative diminution in all testicular elements, but progression through spermatogenesis as well as Leydig cell numbers appears to be normal. Unfortunately, however, the litter sizes were not provided. It seems possible that reduced litters or prolonged intervals between pregnancies would be observed because of the oligospermia, but this has not been reported. The combination of small testes and fertility in <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− male mice suggests that FSH is necessary for testicular volume but may not be absolutely essential for spermatogenesis and normal fertility in mice.</p>
<p>Further support that these observed effects of <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− mice are specifically caused by FSH deficiency comes from rescue of the <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− mice of both sexes by the introduction of the human <italic>FSHB</italic> transgene,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719112461184">30</xref>
</sup> which is selectively expressed in the pituitary. In both females and males, all of the phenotypic effects are corrected, indicating that they are caused by isolated FSH deficiency.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719112461184">30</xref>

</p>
<p>Since the original description of the <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− mice, Wreford et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1933719112461184">46</xref>
</sup> examined testicular function in more detail. Testicular weights were decreased about 60%, and Sertoli cell number and germ cell numbers were decreased 30% to 39%. The germ cell attrition was more pronounced for later stages of spermatogenesis, as manifested by a 46% reduction in spermatogonia and 60% decrease in round spermatids. The investigators suggested that the testicular function in <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− male mice is due to the lack of FSH’s action on Sertoli cell proliferation and the ability of Sertoli cells to nurture germ cells.<sup>

<p>Baker et al<sup>

Diminished testicular volume was apparent as early as 20 days of life and was about one-third the normal size in adults. Reflecting normal serum LH levels in <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− male mice, Leydig cell number increased appropriately at days 1, 5, 20, and adult compared with control. Corresponding intratesticular testosterone was normal at 60 and 180 days. Leydig cell morphology was normal, but the reserve of the testis was impaired since hCG administration elicited an intratesticular response that approximated two-thirds of the WT animals.<sup>

<title>Human <italic>FSHB</italic> Mutations</title>
<p>Only 3 males with <italic>FSHB </italic>mutations have been described in humans (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1933719112461184">Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719112461184">Figure 1</xref>). Based upon the findings in <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− mouse, the expected phenotype would be that of normal puberty (since LH-induced testosterone production should occur), but there could be varying degrees of spermatogenic failure. The first male described by Lindstedt et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1933719112461184">39</xref>
</sup> with an <italic>FSHB</italic> mutation had exactly this presentation, with normal virilization and pubertal development although the testes were small (3 and 6 cc volume with normal being ∼15-25 cc). His testosterone level was in the lower range of normal; LH was mildly elevated, but FSH was undetectable (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1933719112461184">Table 4</xref>). He demonstrated homozygosity for a Cys82Arg (p.Cys100Arg in new nomenclature) missense mutation, which was predicted to interfere with dimer formation but was not studied in vitro. Subsequently, Clark et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1933719112461184">34</xref>
</sup> demonstrated that this mutation resulted in absent immunoactive and bioactive FSH (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1933719112461184">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Phillip et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1933719112461184">40</xref>

He had no evidence of pubertal development with very small testes (1 and 2 cc), a low testosterone (130 ng/dL; normal: 270-1070), elevated LH, and low FSH. He demonstrated homozygosity for the Val61X (p.Val79fs, new nomenclature),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1933719112461184">40</xref>
</sup> previously shown to be completely devoid of immuno- and bioactivity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719112461184">32</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719112461184">33</xref>
</sup> had a presentation similar to the first reported male. He had normal puberty, infertility, and azoospermia. His testicular biopsy demonstrated Leydig cell hyperplasia and sparse, small seminiferous tubules with germinal cell aplasia, peritubular fibrosis, and scant Sertoli cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719112461184">33</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>All 3 men with <italic>FSHB</italic> mutations had in common the finding of azoospermia despite testicular size ranging from completely prepubertal to nearly normal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1933719112461184">Table 4</xref>). Interestingly, none had gynecomastia or cryptorchidism. Also, in all 3 males, FSH was low and did not respond to exogenous GnRH administration. Similar to females with <italic>FSHB</italic> mutations, and unlike male <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− mice, baseline LH levels were elevated and displayed an exaggerated LH response to GnRH. Inhibin B was low in the first 2 males, reflecting Sertoli cell dysfunction<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1933719112461184">48</xref>
</sup> (unfortunately, inhibin B was not studied in the third male).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719112461184">33</xref>
</sup> Although only 2 had testicular biopsies, Leydig cells were present in 1 patient and numerous in the other, yet variable seminiferous tubule dysfunction was noted—germinal aplasia to spermatogenic arrest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1933719112461184">Table 4</xref>).</p>
<p>It is intriguing that at least one of the males had low serum testosterone. Leydig cells do not express the FSHR, so direct evidence of FSH upon Leydig cells has not been demonstrated. However, several studies identified by Phillip et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1933719112461184">40</xref>
</sup> indicated that FSH may have an indirect role upon Leydig cell testosterone production. In fact, supernatants of Sertoli cells incubated with FSH have been reported to stimulate testosterone secretion by Leydig cells and testicular explants from rats,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1933719112461184">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1933719112461184">50</xref>

</sup> and humans.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719112461184">29</xref>
</sup> Therefore, human <italic>FSHB</italic> mutations in males clearly affect fertility by causing azoospermia and possibly could play a role in pubertal development. These mutations appear to be rare in eugonadal males with infertility, since none of 65 males studied, including 13 with nonobstructive azoospermia and 52 with oligozoospermia, had <italic>FSHB</italic> mutations (Clark AD and Layman LC, unpublished).</p>

<title>Human inactivating <italic>FSHR</italic> mutations</title>

Using linkage analysis of multiplex families, strong linkage at chromosome 2p21 was observed and the <italic>FSHR</italic> gene was found to be in linkage disequilibrium with this phenotype. DNA sequencing revealed a homozygous p.Ala189Val missense mutation in about one-third of all the Finnish ovarian failure patients studied. This mutation was shown to markedly reduce the binding capacity of the receptor in MSC-1 Sertoli cells, as well as to dramatically impair cAMP production in response to recombinant FSH (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1933719112461184">Table 5</xref>).<sup>

<sup>a</sup> Kuechler et al found that the deletion was due to a 46, XX, t(2;8)(p16.3or21;p23.1), which was apparently balanced prior to chromosomal microarray analysis. The precise deletion breakpoints have not been determined. However, the minimal deletion would be 163 kb (chr2: 48 895 903-49 058 614) and the maximal deletion would be 178 kb (chr2: 48 887 046-49 065 417) based on the HG18 version. With the maximal deletion, the proximal breakpoint is within intron 6 of <italic>FSHR</italic> and so exons 7-10 would be deleted, encoding a truncated protein with the first 174 amino acids of full-length FSHR. In this case, almost of half of the ECD, all 7 TMD1-7, ICL1-3, and ECL1-3, and the intracellular domain would be gone. With the minimal deletion, the proximal breakpoint would be within intron 8 of <italic>FSHR</italic> and therefore exons 9 and 10 would be deleted, encoding a truncated protein with the first 222 amino acids of full-length FSHR. In this case, part of the ECD, all 7 TMD1-7, ICL1-3, and ECL1-3, and the intracellular domain (ICD) would be removed. The full mutation for case 10 is annotated as Chr2: g.(48 887 046-48 895 903)_(49 058 614-49 065 417)del (NCBI 36/hg18).</p>

</sup> Ultrasound of the ovaries demonstrated follicles of varying sizes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1933719112461184">Table 6</xref>). On histologic evaluation, only primordial follicles were seen in some patients, but in others, preantral or antral follicles were identified. In 1 patient, even a mature follicle was identified. Corpora lutea were not mentioned in the 9 women with <italic>FSHR</italic> gene mutations, suggesting that they did not ovulate, at least in the recent past. Stature of women with the <italic>FSHR</italic> gene mutations was less (160.5 cm) compared with ovarian failure patients without the mutation (165.8 cm). Although only a small sample size was studied, women with <italic>FSHR</italic> gene mutations (6 of 12) were more likely to have follicles on ultrasound than for those without mutations (1 of 11).<sup>

</p>
<p>Similar to patients with <italic>FSHB</italic> mutations, the inheritance of inactivating <italic>FSHR</italic> gene mutations was autosomal recessive. Although the carrier frequency of this mutation was common in Finland, the allele was not found in 35 unrelated US women with 46, XX ovarian failure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1933719112461184">64</xref>
</sup> In a much larger international study, Jiang et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1933719112461184">65</xref>

<p>The second <italic>FSHR</italic> mutation was identified in an Armenian woman with secondary amenorrhea and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism.<sup>

The Ile160Thr mutation in the ECD resulted in dramatic functional effects: severely impaired binding of iodinated FSH in COS-7 cells and a 90% reduction of cAMP production in response to exogenous FSH (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1933719112461184">Table 5</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1933719112461184">56</xref>

The affected proband had normal breast development, but menstruated only 3 times in a year-and-a-half, and then became amenorrheic. Serum gonadotropins were elevated and estradiols were low/low normal (20-40 pg/mL), and she had a 46, XX karyotype (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1933719112461184">Table 6</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1933719112461184">56</xref>

The authors suggested that the compound heterozygous <italic>FSHR</italic> gene mutations in this patient produced a partially deficient state.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1933719112461184">56</xref>
</sup> However, it is also true that women with the Finnish missense mutation displayed evidence of hypofunction rather than null since half of these women manifested breast development; and follicular maturation (antral and mature follicles) was observed in some patients.<sup>

It is also likely that the other patient also did as well; however, she had been treated with oral contraceptives at age 17 and then had a normal exam about 10 years later. When examining these 10 inactivating <italic>FSHR</italic> mutations, it can be seen that 9 were missense (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1933719112461184">Table 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719112461184">Figure 2</xref>). The ECD was the most common site involved (4 of 10), but mutations were also found in the TMDs (n = 3) and ECLs (n = 2)—none were located in the ICLs. One mutation (case #10 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1933719112461184">Table 5</xref>) involved a deletion that was not completely mapped at the genomic level but would be annotated as chr2: g.(48 887 046-48 895 903)-(49 058 614-49 065 417)del (NCBI 36/hg18) at the genomic level. The minimal deletion would be 163 kb, involving exons 9 and 10, while the maximal deletion would consist of a 178 kb deletion, affecting exons 7 to 10. In both cases, all 7 TMD1-7, ICL1-3, and ECL1-3, and the intracellular domain (ICD) would be removed.

</sup> found elevations of both LH and FSH in the serum of <italic>Fshr</italic> −/− mice, but the pituitary content of either gonadotropin was not different from wild-type animals. These investigators also found that intratesticular inhibins A and B were not different in <italic>Fshr</italic> −/− mice compared to wild type or heterozygotes (although inhibin A was lower than inhibin B in all groups).<sup>

<italic>Fshr</italic> −/− mice had small testes and seminiferous tubules and were initially reported by Dierich et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719112461184">27</xref>

</sup> In a subsequent, in-depth analysis by Krishnamurthy et al,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1933719112461184">66</xref>
</sup> there was no disruption or alteration of any of the steps of spermatogenesis, but 2 stages of spermatogenesis (VII and XI) were quantified. At 3 months of age, flow cytometric analysis indicated a 28% increase in spermatogonia and testicular somatic cells (2C fraction) and a 25% reduction in elongated spermatids in <italic>Fshr</italic> −/− mice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1933719112461184">66</xref>
</sup> There was no difference in BrdU incorporation of S-phase cells indicating no increase in actively dividing spermatogonia. The expression of c-kit ligand (<italic>Kit</italic>), which stimulates DNA synthesis in type A spermatogonial cells, was doubled compared with WT. However, the expression of the FSH-responsive gene cAMP responsive element modulator (<italic>Crem</italic>), which is necessary for spermiogenesis, was unaltered.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719112461184">27</xref>
</sup> Elongated spermatids had reduced nuclear compaction, and there was evidence for inadequate condensation of sperm chromatin and poor sperm quality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1933719112461184">66</xref>
</sup> Despite these abnormalities in sperm, litter size of <italic>Fshr</italic> −/− males was not different from wild-type or heterozygous mice as reported by Abel et al,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719112461184">26</xref>
</sup> although Dierich et al<sup>

</sup> found that matings between heterozygous males and females resulted in a 35% to 50% litter size. Overall, the fertility of <italic>Fshr</italic> −/− male mice was more impaired than that of <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− mice and was thought to be due to the reduced testosterone levels in <italic>Fshr</italic> −/− mice.<sup>

<p>Interestingly, <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− and <italic>Fshr</italic> −/− males both have small testes, but <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− males have normal serum testosterone and LH levels, while <italic>Fshr</italic> −/− males have reduced testosterone and elevated LH levels. Baker et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1933719112461184">47</xref>
</sup> compared Leydig cell function in these 2 KOs. Although <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− males had normal intratesticular testosterone and Leydig cells over time, <italic>Fshr</italic> −/− males had a reduction in intratesticular testosterone at 60 and 180 days (about one-third of the controls) and a reduction in Leydig cells at 20 (30% of controls) and 60 days (60% of controls). Similar to <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− males, <italic>Fshr</italic> −/− males demonstrated an impaired intratesticular testosterone response to hCG. There was a reduction of P450scc (<italic>Cyp11a1</italic>), 3βHSD6 (<italic>Hsd3b6</italic>), and StAR (<italic>Star</italic>) expression, but no change in P450c17 (<italic>Cyp17a1</italic>) or 17βHSD3 (<italic>Hsd17b3</italic>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1933719112461184">47</xref>
</sup> They hypothesized that constitutively active FSHR in <italic>Fshb </italic>−/− male mice could regulate Leydig cell function and explain the different phenotypes. When the WT <italic>Fshr</italic> was transfected into a Leydig cell line, cAMP and progesterone were both upregulated 4-fold. These authors suggested that FSH signaling is not needed for the fetal population of Leydig cells (starting ∼day 5-10), as evidenced by normal Leydig cell number for both <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− and <italic>Fshr</italic> −/− at days 1 and 5.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1933719112461184">47</xref>
</sup> However, the adult population of Leydig cells was diminished by day 20 and 60 in <italic>Fshr</italic> −/− males (and not <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− males), but the constitutive action of the WT FSHR in <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− mice permitted sufficient signaling to effect normal function. Since only Sertoli cells (and not Leydig cells) express the FSHR, this is likely a permissive action of FSH upon Leydig cell function.<sup>

<title>Overexpression of FSH Using Transgenic Mice</title>
<p>In order to study how a gain of FSH function affects reproduction, transgenic mice were generated that ectopically produce FSH.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719112461184">28</xref>
</sup> In these experiments, metallothionein 1 promoter-driven expression of <italic>Cga</italic> in some mice and <italic>Fshb</italic> in other mice was accomplished. These overexpressing mice were then crossed to produce mice that could form dimeric FSH. Some strains of mice—the weak FSH expressers—had no phenotypic effects but had mildly elevated FSH levels (FSH = 48 mIU/mL in males; and 116 mIU/mL in females). In contrast, the high copy FSH expressers did manifest recognizable reproductive abnormalities. Male transgenic mice were infertile, despite having normal sized testes and increased sperm production (by ∼75%). In these mice, FSH levels were markedly elevated (150 000 mIU/mL), as were serum testosterone levels (18-fold increase compared to wild type). No obvious testicular defects were noted on histologic evaluation, but the seminal vesicle size was more than doubled. The infertility in these transgenic mice was thought to be due to either high testosterone levels or altered reproductive behavior. There is precedence for this as it is well known that the administration of exogenous testosterone to human males may act as a contraceptive agent by suppressing LH to decrease sperm concentration.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1933719112461184">68</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In contrast, female high copy FSH expressers had markedly elevated FSH levels (360 000 mIU/mL), elevated estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone levels and demonstrated hemorrhagic, cystic ovaries similar to human ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Of interest, these female transgenic mice were infertile but usually died because of extreme bladder and kidney enlargement with obstruction.<sup>

The patient had undetectable serum FSH and LH, though his testicular volume was normal and semen analysis parameters were essentially normal. In vitro analysis of the mutant <italic>FSHR</italic> revealed cAMP production that was increased by approximately 1.5-fold without ligand.<sup>

</sup> These investigators<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1933719112461184">70</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1933719112461184">71</xref>
</sup> They created the p.Asp567Gly transgene and directed its expression using the rat androgen binding protein (<italic>Abp</italic>) gene promoter into the Sertoli cells of hpg mice. The insertion of the transgene resulted in a 2-fold-increased testicular weight, which contained mature Sertoli cells and premeiotic germ cells (absent in controls). Isolated Sertoli cells had a 2-fold increase in basal cAMP production and 1.5-fold increase in FSH-stimulated cAMP levels. Intriguingly, this transgene also resulted in increased testicular production of testosterone, suggesting a Sertoli-cell-mediated paracrine effect upon Leydig cells of the hpg mouse.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1933719112461184">70</xref>

<p>Similar to the phenotype of the overexpressing FSH mouse, human females with <italic>FSHR</italic> mutations manifest spontaneous ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (sOHSS), previously only thought to be an iatrogenically induced condition in infertile females receiving exogenous gonadotropins for infertility treatment (Table 8). A hyperresponsiveness to gonadotropins in these patients results in excess follicular maturation, supranormal estradiol levels, with resultant ovarian enlargement, ascites, and hydrothorax if severe, as well as an increased risk for congestive heart failure, oliguria, and thrombotic events.<sup>

<p>When this mutant <italic>FSHR</italic> was transfected into COS-7 cells, cell surface expression was normal and there was no constitutive activation basally (without ligand), and there was no difference in cAMP production after FSH administration compared to WT. However, the Thr449Ile mutant demonstrated an increased cAMP response to hCG. The wild-type FSHR had little or no activation of cAMP to increasing doses of hCG, but there was a profound increase (&gt;20-fold) in maximal cAMP production of the mutant receptor compared to wild type. This occurred despite the observation that I<sup>125</sup>-labeled hCG did not bind to the mutant receptor; and there was no displacement of I<sup>125</sup>-labeled FSH by hCG. Additionally, TSH had no effect upon this receptor (Table 8). Therefore, this mutant receptor was not constitutively active, but exhibited a loss of binding specificity as it bound hCG in addition to FSH.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1933719112461184">72</xref>
</sup> It is interesting that although the ECD is responsible for ligand binding, activation of this mutant receptor by hCG without binding suggests an interplay between the 2 regions of the receptor resulting in decreased binding specificity.<sup>

<p>The other activating <italic>FSHR</italic> mutation was reported by Smits et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1933719112461184">73</xref>
</sup> who found a heterozygous p.Asp567Asn in a 40-year-old woman with sOHSS in each of her 4 prior pregnancies (Table 8). This affected residue was located within the sixth transmembrane domain (TMD6) and interestingly was the same wild-type amino acid affected as in the hypophysectomized man (although it was a different mutation). Functional studies revealed that despite a 31% decrease in cell surface expression, the mutant exhibited a 3-fold basal increase in cAMP production relative to the wild type. Binding affinities were similar to the WT with increasing doses of exogenous FSH, as were the maximal responses for the mutant and wild-type receptors. However, there was an enhanced response of the mutant receptor, but not WT, to hCG. This response to hCG was only about 1 of 1000 as sensitive as the cAMP response of the LHR to hCG. Unlike p.Thr449Ile, the p.Asp567Asn mutant displayed constitutive activity, and an increased sensitivity to TSH (Table 8).<sup>

</sup> The p.Thr449Ala in TMD3 described by Montanelli et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1933719112461184">75</xref>
</sup> was constitutively active and displayed increased sensitivity to hCG and TSH (Table 8). Montanelli et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1933719112461184">83</xref>
</sup> further studied each the reported activating <italic>FSHR</italic> mutations (p.Thr449Ile, p.Asp567Asn, and p.Thr449Ala) and showed that these 3 mutations affect the interhelical bonds between transmembrane helices which are known to keep the receptor in an inactive state.</p>
<p>In a patient with first trimester sOHSS and normal hCG levels, in 2006 De Leener et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1933719112461184">76</xref>
</sup> characterized a p.Ile545Thr in TMD5 with a modest (30%) increase in basal cAMP activity, which was further increased by hCG or TSH (case 5 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1933719112461184">Table 8</xref>). The sOHSS patients with reported <italic>FSHR</italic> mutations to this point all had normal hCG levels during pregnancy. These investigators<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1933719112461184">76</xref>
</sup> studied 7 additional sOHSS patients with elevated hCG (n = 4) or TSH (n = 3) levels in pregnancy but did not find <italic>FSHR</italic> mutations, suggesting a natural stimulation of the WT receptor to high concentrations of the hormones. These studies indicate that not all patients with sOHSS have activating <italic>FSHR</italic> mutations or that they were not identified using current methodology. Whether these patients might possess mutations in regulatory regions of the receptor or have intragenic deletions or rearrangements not detectable by PCR-based DNA sequencing remains to be determined.</p>
<p>All reported activating <italic>FSHR</italic> mutations were localized to the transmembrane regions of the FSHR until 2008 when De Leener et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1933719112461184">77</xref>
</sup> discovered the first mutation in the ligand binding domain—a heterozygous p.Ser128Tyr missense mutation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1933719112461184">Tables 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1933719112461184">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719112461184">Figure 2</xref>). Functional analysis of the p.Ser128Tyr mutation resulted in a 64% reduction in cell surface expression, and there was no constitutive activation. However, the mutant receptor had increased affinity and sensitivity to hCG but not to TSH (Table 8).</p>
<p>When the identified heterozygous, activating <italic>FSHR</italic> mutations in 5 females with sOHSS are examined, it can be seen that 4 are in the serpentine region of the receptor and only 1 is in the ECD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719112461184">Figure 2</xref>, cases 2-6 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1933719112461184">Table 8</xref>). In fact 4 of the 6 activating <italic>FSHR</italic> mutations (when the 1 male is also included) occur in either the p.Asp567 (changing it to either a Gly or Asn) or a Thr449 (changing it to either an Ile or Ala). In both cases mutation of p.Asp567 resulted in a constitutively active protein, while Thr449Ala was constitutively active but Thr449Ile was not (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1933719112461184">Table 8</xref>). Overall, 2 of the 5 activating mutations in females (1 in TMD3 and 1 in the ECD) were not constitutively active. However, the common feature is that all 5 activating <italic>FSHR</italic> mutations, causing OHSS have reduced specificity such that they respond to the increasing hCG levels that occur during normal pregnancy. Perhaps this would be expected in the ascertainment of a phenotype exacerbated in pregnancy. A total of 3 also had an increased response to TSH further, demonstrating the decreased specificity of the mutant receptor.</p>
<p>When the phenotypes of the affected sOHSS women are examined, 2 of the 5 patients had other affected members, indicating autosomal dominant inheritance, while 3 were sporadic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1933719112461184">Table 9</xref>). Mutations seem to affect different ethnicities. Interestingly, 2 of the patients described had 4 of 5 and 4 of 4 pregnancies affected with sOHSS, but 2 of 5 had some pregnancies that were not affected with OHSS. Therefore, the presence of an activating <italic>FSHR</italic> mutation did not preclude the possibility of an unaffected pregnancy. Overall, in these 5 patients, sOHSS occurred in 12 of 14 pregnancies with varying pregnancy outcomes. All 5 patients had at least 1 healthy live-born child during the cycle of hyperstimulation. Of the 12 pregnancies complicated by sOHSS, 1 resulted in a spontaneous abortion, 2 were electively aborted, 1 resulted in a death in utero at 41½ weeks, and 8 resulted in healthy live-born children—3 males and 5 females (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1933719112461184">Table 9</xref>).</p>

<title>Inactivating Mutations</title>
<sec id="section26-1933719112461184">
<title>Females</title>
<p>A small number of inactivating mutations in both the <italic>FSHB</italic> and the <italic>FSHR</italic> genes in humans have been described. The effect of mutations of the <italic>FSHB</italic> gene in human females is very similar to that described in <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− KO mice. These women had irreversibly delayed puberty and infertility with low serum FSH levels and elevated LH levels. <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− mice also were sterile with low FSH and elevated LH. Estradiol levels were low in the human patients; and although reportedly normal, they were likely low in the <italic>Fshb </italic>−/− mice, particularly given the appearance of the reproductive organs. Histologically, these mice had predominantly primordial follicles, although some degenerating antral follicles were present. Human females with <italic>FSHB</italic> mutations demonstrated primordial and small antral follicles. However, both mice and humans responded to exogenous FSH, indicating that even with endogenous depletion of the FSH ligand, the ovaries have the capacity to activate FSH signaling (except in the 1 patient who was older).</p>
<p>The phenotypes of women with inactivating <italic>FSHR</italic> mutations and the <italic>Fshr</italic> −/− KO mice were quite similar. The mice were sterile, while the women all had primary amenorrhea (with or without breast development). Both humans and mice had elevated serum gonadotropin levels. Most women with <italic>FSHR</italic> mutations had low or undetectable estradiol levels. The female <italic>Fshr</italic> −/− KO mice had low estradiol and progesterone, but elevated testosterone (not present in the humans with <italic>FSHR</italic> mutations); and these mice had no vaginal openings (indicating no puberty). The mice demonstrated primordial, primary, and secondary follicles, but antral follicles were not observed. Rarely, humans with <italic>FSHR</italic> mutations also had further follicular development with at least 1 of the Finnish patients having mature preovulatory follicles.</p>
<p>Women with inactivating <italic>FSHB</italic> or <italic>FSHR</italic> gene mutations possess mostly primordial follicles but may also have antral follicles. Therefore, FSH does not appear to be necessary for follicular development up to the small antral follicle stage but seems to be required for further follicular development. Since women with <italic>FSHB</italic> gene mutations have elevated LH levels but do not have hyperandrogenism, FSH may have some requisite function for ovarian thecal androgen production possibly by stimulating production of CYP17, LHR, inhibin, or other growth factors. These findings suggest that FSH is important for normal pubertal development and fertility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-1933719112461184">
<title>Males</title>
<p>The phenotypic effects of males (human and mice) deficient in FSH are somewhat disparate, particularly for the ligand. Male <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− KO mice demonstrated smaller testes with a 75% reduction in sperm concentration and 40% reduction in motility, but they were fertile. Serum FSH was low, but LH was normal as was testosterone. All 3 human males with <italic>FSHB</italic> mutations had low FSH, elevated LH, and azoospermia. Interestingly, 2 males had small testes, but one of them also had low testosterone, suggesting that FSH deficiency could play some role in androgen production in the male.</p>
<p>Mutations in the receptor, whether in the human or mouse, had no demonstrable effect upon fertility in males. <italic>Fshr</italic> −/− KO male mice had a somewhat decreased testes size and a modest reduction in sperm concentration, motility, and morphology. As expected, serum FSH was elevated, but perhaps unexpectedly, serum testosterone was reduced by 65%. There have only been 5 human males with <italic>FSHR</italic> mutations—all ascertained in Finnish families with the p.Ala189Val mutation found in women with ovarian failure. They all had elevated serum FSH, normal to elevated LH, and normal testosterone levels. Their ages and sperm parameters were quite variable, but 2 of the 3 attempting fertility had children.</p>
<p>These findings in males suggest that perhaps there are species-specific differences between mice and men. In humans, mutations in the ligand gene are more severe than those of the receptor, while the opposite is true for the mouse. The endocrine function of human <italic>FSHB</italic> mutants may be more adversely affected than the human <italic>FSHR</italic> or either of the mouse genes since 1 of the 3 males with an <italic>FSHB</italic> mutation had low testosterone and delayed puberty. In the mouse, the <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− mouse may have a less severe phenotype because of the constitutively active FSHR, which may result in some FSH function without the presence of the ligand. However, both the <italic>Fshb</italic> −/− and <italic>Fshr</italic> −/− mice have decreased germ cell and Sertoli cell numbers (30%-40%). These studies also suggest that FSH is necessary in both males and females to augment LH-induced synthesis of androgens.</p>
<p>Inactivating <italic>FSHR</italic> and <italic>FSHB</italic> gene mutations in humans are both inherited as autosomal recessive traits, and they produce a somewhat similar phenotype in that they result in hypogonadism. However, both gonadotropins are elevated in patients with <italic>FSHR</italic> mutations (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism), while patients with <italic>FSHB</italic> mutations manifest reduced FSH levels (isolated FSH deficiency) and elevated (or normal) LH levels. Women with <italic>FSHR</italic> or <italic>FSHB</italic> mutations may have completely absent pubertal development or partial development. The difference lies in the reproductive potential of these patients with treatment as women with <italic>FSHB</italic> mutations have normal ovarian function and an excellent chance to conceive with exogenous gonadotropins; while women with <italic>FSHR</italic> mutations have impaired ovarian function and a poorer prognosis, as do other women with ovarian failure from any cause.</p>

<title>Activating FSHR Mutations</title>
<p>The creation of transgenic mice overexpressing human <italic>Fshb</italic> produced variable phenotypes depending upon the level of expression and the sex of the animal. With low Fshb expression, elevated FSH protein levels were observed similar to humans with gonadal failure, but the phenotype was normal in both male and female mice. However, with high <italic>Fshb</italic> expression, females demonstrated infertility and had enormously elevated levels of FSH with hemorrhagic ovarian cysts similar to iatrogenic human OHSS. Subsequently, human females with activating FSHR mutations were shown to have the same phenotype as the mouse. Although they are usually constitutively active, activating human FSHR mutations causing sOHSS have uniformly altered the receptor such that it responds to hCG, which is why ovarian enlargement is restricted to pregnancy. This sOHSS is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Therefore, hypofunction of both the ligand and the receptor are inherited as autosomal recessive disorders, while hyperfunction of the receptor is autosomal dominant, similar to the genetics of human <italic>LHR</italic> mutations. Lastly, when the single activating <italic>FSHR</italic> mutation in a human male was inserted into Sertoli cells of the hpg mouse, testosterone production increased. These data, in addition to that discussed above, provide further support that FSH action is necessary for LH-dependent androgen production in males as well as females.</p>
