<sec id="section1-0890334413478835">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Community attitudes toward breastfeeding in public influence how comfortable women feel about continuing breastfeeding. Knowledge of the social context helps target breastfeeding-promoting interventions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0890334413478835">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>To examine trends in Western Australian adult attitudes toward breastfeeding in public places.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0890334413478835">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>As part of 5 cross-sectional surveys from the Western Australian Nutrition Monitor Survey Series conducted between 1995 and 2009, 5496 adults aged 18 to 64 years were asked whether it was acceptable for mothers to breastfeed their babies in public places, including shopping centers, workplaces, and restaurants, and on public transport. Descriptive statistics and multinomial regressions were used to describe factors associated with attitudes toward publicly breastfeeding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0890334413478835">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>There was no change in the acceptance of breastfeeding in shopping centers, restaurants, and workplaces and on public transport over time, but in 2009, significantly fewer people said that it was unacceptable to breastfeed in public compared with 1995. Women, people older than 44 years, those born outside Australia, and the less educated were those most likely to say that breastfeeding in public was unacceptable. In the years that the question was asked, more than 97% of respondents said that breastfeeding was acceptable if a separate room was provided.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0890334413478835">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Making breastfeeding acceptable and pleasant for mothers in public spaces is a key policy recommendation. Women, people older than 44 years, and those born outside Australia were most likely to respond that breastfeeding in public was unacceptable unless a room was provided. Given that, on average, 70% of the population said that breastfeeding in public was acceptable, investigation into why some women do not think so is warranted.</p>

<title>Well Established</title>
<p><italic>There are many health benefits to breastfeeding. Supportive environments help women to continue breastfeeding.

<title>Newly Expressed</title>
<p><italic>Acceptability of breastfeeding in public has been improving since 1995, with fewer people saying that it is not acceptable. Of concern is that 20% of the population in 2009 said that it was unacceptable or acceptable only if infants were breastfed discreetly</italic>.</p>

<sec id="section8-0890334413478835">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Breastfeeding is the most appropriate method for feeding infants, with immediate and long-term health benefits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334413478835">1</xref></sup> Exclusive breastfeeding to 6 months and continued breastfeeding for up to and beyond 2 years has been recommended by the World Health Organization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334413478835">2</xref></sup> The Australian Government’s National Health and Medical Research Council endorsed guidelines for infant feeding that encourage exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months and continuing breastfeeding as solids are introduced for up to at least 12 months and beyond.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334413478835">3</xref></sup> Previous studies have found that higher levels of knowledge about breastfeeding and positive attitudes toward breastfeeding by parents are associated with higher breastfeeding initiation rates and longer duration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334413478835">4</xref></sup> Mothers with positive attitudes toward breastfeeding are also more likely to breastfeed their babies to the end of the sixth month.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334413478835">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Breastfeeding in public can evoke negative reactions as well as engender a feeling of embarrassment in the mother.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334413478835">6</xref></sup> Previous research has found that mothers may still feel vulnerable when breastfeeding in public places, such as shopping centers and restaurants, even if breastfeeding at that time does not evoke negative responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334413478835">7</xref></sup> Boyer reported that discomfort with breastfeeding in public is a major factor in shaping infant feeding choice and posited that a solution to this may be to increase advocacy for breastfeeding in the public arena.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334413478835">8</xref></sup> Research in the United States has shown wide variation across geographic regions in community support for women breastfeeding in public and for workplace breastfeeding policies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334413478835">9</xref></sup> To develop effective public breastfeeding policy, it would be useful to also measure population perceptions of acceptability of breastfeeding in specific public venues.</p>
<p>Making breastfeeding acceptable and pleasant for mothers in public places is a high-priority public health policy recommendation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334413478835">10</xref></sup> The recommendation is based on the assertion that the availability of, and access to, dedicated breastfeeding areas in public spaces and work settings is a key physical environmental determinant of breastfeeding, with the provision of facilities suggested as potential actions (eg, a dedicated breastfeeding room in workplaces).</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to assess the attitudes toward breastfeeding in specific public places (shopping centers, restaurants, workplaces) and on public transport among Western Australia adults from 1995 to 2009 and any changes over time. The uniqueness of this study is that it reflects perceptions and attitudes relating to the acceptance of breastfeeding in public places, including specific venues, across a representative sample of the Western Australian population, including men and adults from 18 to 64 years.</p>

<sec id="section10-0890334413478835">
<title>Surveys</title>
<p>The data used in this study were collected as a component of the Western Australian Nutrition Monitor Survey Series. Computer-assisted telephone interviews of Western Australian adults aged 18 to 64 years were conducted July to August in 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004, and 2009. The 1995 sample was stratified by geographic area, and the 1998, 2001, and 2004 samples were quota sampled by sex and geographic area. The telephone numbers were selected randomly by a computer-generated random digit–dialing program. In 2009, the sample was randomly drawn from the 2008 electronic white pages for Western Australia and stratified according to area of residence. All sample households with an address were sent a primary approach letter, explaining the purpose the survey, how the sample was selected, who would be asked to complete the survey, and the amount of time it would take. Every household in the initial sample was called and asked if someone aged 18 to 64 years was resident and, if so, which one had the most recent birthday. No substitutes were accepted.</p>

<sec id="section11-0890334413478835">
<title>Measurements</title>
<p>The Nutrition Monitoring Survey Series commenced in 1995. A prepilot of the survey at that time enabled some of the open-ended questions to be categorized into common responses. In the 1995-2004 survey years, participants were asked 2 questions in terms of whether it is acceptable for women to breastfeed their babies in public places:</p>
<list id="list1-0890334413478835" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Question 1</italic>: Do you think it is acceptable for women to breastfeed their babies in public places such as . . . (a) shopping centers, (b) workplaces, (c) restaurants and (d) on public transport (such as buses and trains)?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Each public place was read out, but the response categories were not. The response categories for each place were <italic>yes, no</italic>, or <italic>depends on how obvious feeding is</italic>. If respondents answered <italic>no</italic> or <italic>depends</italic>, they were then asked,</p>
<list id="list2-0890334413478835" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Question 2</italic>: Would it be acceptable if a room or space was provided for women to breastfeed their babies in any of those public places? (Yes or No).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In the 2009, all respondents were asked the first question, followed by “Would it be acceptable if a room/space was provided for women to breastfeed their babies in any of these public places?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0890334413478835">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The data were collected to be representative of the Western Australian population. Data for all the years were pooled and weighted to account for sample design and adjusted for age, sex, and geographic area to a single population to allow for comparisons over time. The standard population used was the 2006 estimated resident population of Western Australia, as it was the most recent census year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334413478835">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Descriptive analyses explored changes associated with survey year. Multinomial regression analyses designed for use with survey data were conducted to explore the relationships over time, sociodemographic indicators, and acceptability of breastfeeding in public places. Pearson chi-square tests were used to determine statistically significant differences for nominal data. A <italic>P</italic> value &lt; .05 was regarded as statistically significant.</p>
<p>Results from the 4 multinominal regressions are expressed as relative risk ratios for the groups who said <italic>no</italic> and <italic>it depends</italic>, compared with those who answered <italic>yes</italic> (relative risk ratio = 1). The covariates in the models include all the comparable sociodemographic information from the 5 surveys: survey year as a measure of time (1995, 1998, 2001, 2004, 2009), sex, age (grouped into 18-44 and 45-64 years), education level (from less than high school to university), household income (grouped into &lt; AUD$60 000 and ≥ AUD$60 000), employment status (grouped into not employed and employed), country of birth (grouped into born in Australia and born outside Australia), and area of residence (grouped into metropolitan and nonmetropolitan). With the exception of survey year (used as the time variable), only variables having a <italic>P</italic> value &lt; .05 were retained and reported.</p>
<p>All analyses were undertaken using STATA 12.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas, USA). The surveys were conducted with approval from the Department of Health’s Human Research Ethics Committee.</p>

<p>An average of 70% of the population thought that it was acceptable to breastfeed in shopping centers, restaurants, and workplaces and on public transport, showing a stable trend over the 14 years of the survey period with few significant differences between years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0890334413478835">Table 2</xref>). Shopping centers and public transport were consistently considered more acceptable places to breastfeed than restaurants and workplaces. The changes that did occur over time were the decreases in the proportion of the population who thought that breastfeeding in public places was unacceptable, which were statistically significant for all places except public transport. Over 95% of the respondents thought that breastfeeding in a room provided for this purpose would be acceptable in each public place asked about (1995-2004) and in any place if a room was provided (2009).</p>

<p>Results are relative risk ratios for the groups who said that it was “not acceptable” and “it depends on how obvious it is” compared with those who answered “yes” (rrr = 1). Results are from 4 multinomial logistic regressions using the STATA survey module. Full models include the following variables: survey year as a measure of time (1995, 1998, 2001, 2004, 2009), sex, age (grouped into 18-44 and 45-64 years), education level (from less than high school to university), household income (grouped into less than AUD$60 000 and AUD$60 000 or more), employment status (grouped into not employed and employed), country of birth (grouped into born in and outside of Australia), and area of residence (grouped into metropolitan and nonmetropolitan). With the exception of the year of the survey (used as the time variable), only variables having a <italic>P</italic> value &lt; .05 were reported in the table.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>The multinominal regression models showed that sociodemographic characteristics were more important than time per se. With the exception of breastfeeding in shopping centers, the changes related to the year of the survey were not statistically significant. In every case, women were more likely than men to say that it was not acceptable to breastfeed in public, with 60% more likely to say that it was unacceptable to breastfeed in shopping centers and 58% more likely to say that it was unacceptable in the workplace, compared with men. People born outside Australia were also significantly more likely to say that breastfeeding in public was unacceptable anywhere, as were people aged older than 44 years. Increasing education level was significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of saying that breastfeeding was unacceptable in public places.</p>
<p>The group who said that the acceptability of breastfeeding in public <italic>depends on how obvious it is</italic> showed a similar pattern for women and by age group but not for changes over time, education level, or place of birth where there were no statistically significant differences. Women were more than twice as likely as men to say that breastfeeding acceptability <italic>depends on how obvious it is</italic>. There were variations relating to the specific venue being asked about, as well as significant age-related differences in opinion, with 40% to 70% of people older than 44 years saying <italic>it depends</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Since 1995, there has been an improvement in the perception of breastfeeding in public places, with significantly fewer people saying that it is unacceptable in 2009. The shift appears to be from attitudes that breastfeeding is unacceptable to breastfeeding is acceptable depending on “how obvious it is.” Even in 2009 there was still an average 14% who thought that it was unacceptable and 16% who thought that it would be acceptable if infants were breastfed in a way that was not obvious. Interestingly, it was women who were most likely to respond this way. Although women may feel that others disapprove of their breastfeeding, even when that is not the case,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334413478835">7</xref></sup> or that breastfeeding in public is embarrassing, it is somewhat surprising that in this set of surveys, this view is apparently not shared by the majority of the community. The findings suggest that women are responding from a different and more personal perspective than from what appears to be a widely held community-based norm.</p>
<p>It seems that Western Australia has a higher acceptability of breastfeeding in public, with an average of 70% of the population between 1995 and 2009 saying that it is acceptable, compared to the United States, where between 1999 to 2001 only 37% to 59% of adults believed that women should have the right to breastfeed in public.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334413478835">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The other groups who were more likely to find public breastfeeding unacceptable were people older than 44 years, people with less than a high school education or some trade or training school qualification, and people born outside Australia. The association between higher education levels and health-related behaviors has been shown,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334413478835">12</xref></sup> but it is less clear why being an immigrant to Australia is associated with less acceptance of breastfeeding in public. It is possible that there are cultural norms influencing this response.</p>
<p>There appears to be a potential conflict between the overall community belief that breastfeeding is acceptable in public places and the notion that “it depends” or is acceptable only when a room is provided in public places. The availability of, and access to, dedicated breastfeeding areas in public spaces and work settings is a key physical environmental determinant of breastfeeding. The option for possible policy action is to make breastfeeding accepted and pleasant for mothers in public spaces. Provision of facilities have been suggested (eg, a dedicated breastfeeding room in workplaces).</p>
<p>This cross-sectional survey provides useful insights into how community attitudes toward breastfeeding in public places change over time and within particular sociodemographic groups; but, as with all cross-sectional studies, no causality can be attributed to results. The main limitation of this study is that the way in which the data were collected changed over time (prior to 2009, random-digit dialing, with and without matching to known operational numbers; in 2009, electronic white pages). This affected the response rates, which were lower in years when random-digit dialing was done without any matching to known operational numbers. The quota sampling in years prior to 2009 also contributed to difficulties in making the population groups comparable. However, weighting, as described in the Methods section, was used to adjust for these sampling differences. Mobile phones were not included in the sample frames prior to 2009; however, in 2004 (the time of the previous survey), Australia still relied predominantly on landlines—so, bias, if any exists, should be minimal.</p>
<p>The findings of this study quantify and confirm, at a population level, findings from Australian focus group research conducted in 1997, just prior to the first survey, which found general agreement that breastfeeding in public is socially acceptable provided that the woman does so discreetly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334413478835">13</xref></sup> At the time, it was recommended that appropriate facilities should be provided in places where mothers and young families frequent. Our findings suggest that if a separate area or facility for breastfeeding were provided, breastfeeding in public would be acceptable to almost everyone in the community, consistent with previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0890334413478835">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334413478835">15</xref></sup> Providing managers of public places with information about breastfeeding and having breastfeeding policies in place are 2 strategies that may improve acceptability of breastfeeding when designated areas are not available in the public places.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334413478835">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Australian National Breastfeeding Strategy aims to increase the proportion of mothers who exclusively breastfeed their infants to 6 months and continue any feeding to 12 months and beyond.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334413478835">17</xref></sup> In 2010, less than half of Australian women continued any breastfeeding after 6 months, which falls short of recommendation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0890334413478835">18</xref></sup> Government policies now acknowledge and highlight the importance of improving the acceptability of breastfeeding in public places to improving breastfeeding initiation and duration rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334413478835">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334413478835">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Local information about the social cultural context is needed to support the successful implementation of these policies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334413478835">15</xref></sup> Different public places may call for different types of facilities—for example, what is suitable for a restaurant may differ from a shopping center or workplace. Also, our current research suggests that there is greater resistance to breastfeeding at work or on public transport than there is at restaurants and in shopping centers. Focus group research in Northern Ireland, exploring women’s perceptions of societal attitudes toward breastfeeding, identified restaurants, public transport, and workplaces as lacking facilities for breastfeeding mothers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0890334413478835">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>We recommend regular monitoring of breastfeeding acceptance in public, including whether the acceptability is dependent on the discreetness or provision of a private area for breastfeeding. The practical implications of policy implementation should be explored in terms of providing facilities for breastfeeding in public at specific venues. Questions for further research include “Does a private room for breastfeeding, away from the general public, really contribute to greater acceptability of breastfeeding in public?” and “What, if any, are the reasons why women would prefer this option?” Our study demonstrates no change in the proportion of the population who say, “Yes, it is acceptable for mothers to breastfeed in public places.” It would be useful to understand why this group has not improved over time.</p>
<p>Reviews of the literature about the factors associated with breastfeeding found that duration increases with any support for breastfeeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0890334413478835">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0890334413478835">23</xref></sup> The uniqueness of the current study is the focus of community-based perceptions of breastfeeding issues, an approach that is different from those of previous studies, which usually focus on parents, women, or health professionals. The important finding from this study is that even with widespread community acceptance for breastfeeding in public, it is women themselves who are most likely to find it unacceptable. These results provide information to assist education providers to better target breastfeeding promotion campaigns and supporting activities.</p>

<sec id="section15-0890334413478835" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The findings indicate that women may be more likely to breastfeed in public if a place to breastfeed discreetly were provided. Being able to breastfeed discreetly in public may make it easier for women to continue to breastfeed longer. Support for breastfeeding mothers—in community perceptions and in provision of breastfeeding facilities—is required if improvements in duration are to be achieved.</p>
