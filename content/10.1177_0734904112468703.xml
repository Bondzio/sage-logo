<p>According to regulation CPSC 16 CFR 1633, every new residential mattress sold in the United States since July 2007 must resist ignition by open flame. An environmentally benign “green,” inexpensive way to meet this regulation is to use a low-cost flame-retardant barrier fabric. In this study, a nonwoven fabric of grey unbleached cotton was treated with a low-cost phosphate-based formulation. The energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis showed uniform nitrogen and phosphorus distribution. With 17% add-on, the flame-retardant unbleached cotton barrier showed a limiting oxygen index of 33% oxygen and 83 mm of char length with no after-flame and no afterglow in the vertical flame test. Under air and nitrogen at 500°C, 24% and 35% char remained after thermogravimetric analyses, respectively. This flame resistance is comparable to that of current commercial barrier fabrics made from bleached cotton and Flovan cyanoguanidine or from T-bond grey cotton fiber highlofts (Jones Fiber). Mattresses constructed with a flame-retardant cotton nonwoven barrier fabric are predicted to meet the requirements of 16CFR1633. As a follow-up to this study, a full-scale mattress burn test is recommended.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The recent CPSC 16 CFR 1633 standard (effective since July 2007)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734904112468703">1</xref></sup> for residential mattresses and mattress-foundation sets is designed to reduce the risk of flashover.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734904112468703">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734904112468703">3</xref></sup> By limiting the amount of heat energy released, this requirement provides additional time for the occupants to escape and provides at least 30 min for the occupants to escape to safety in a fire. The standard requires that a full-scale burn test be done using a pair of T-shaped gas burners.</p>
<p>In North America, the great majority of the residential mattresses are constructed with polyurethane foam (PUF), such as layers of foam, and innersprings with flame-retardant (FR) natural or synthetic fiber barrier fabrics (discussion with Dr Said Nurbakhsh, California Department of Consumer Affairs, 1 June 2012). The open-flame standard has led to the use of barrier fabric for protecting PUF from fire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734904112468703">4</xref></sup> The barrier fabric is placed between the exterior cover fabric (ticking) and the first layer of the cushioning material during the manufacture of mattresses to protect mattresses from the open-flame dual burner test.</p>
<p>The barrier material can be composed of either inherently heat-resistant fiber (such as Kevlar, Nomex, and modacrylic), or charring fibers (such as cotton, rayon, and wool). The expensive FR barrier fibers such as aramid, modacrylic or specialized FR barrier nonwoven (NW)/knit/woven materials can be afforded for expensive mattresses. Our focus has been on the use of charring fibers that must be treated with FR chemicals to be competitive in performance with flame-resistant fibers. Such a treatment on less-expensive grey, that is, unbleached cotton NW fabric will ensure competitive FR test performance at a lower price.</p>
<p>The FR-unbleached cotton barrier fabric deserves special mention because it is natural, biodegradable, and soft to the touch.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734904112468703">5</xref></sup> It also costs less than bleached cotton. It is also environmentally beneficial to avoid bleaching, which requires subsequent disposal of the chemicals. The unbleached cotton NW fabric contains 12.5% of polypropylene (scrim) needed to give necessary sturdiness to the fabric.</p>
<p>In the interest of worker and environmental safety, regulatory guidelines suggest that new FR reagents must be effective and nontoxic, and should become innocuous upon reaction with cotton or other substrates. Additionally, volatile byproducts generated during the degradation of treated cotton products should be no more toxic than the volatile products from untreated cotton.</p>
<p>To date, much work has gone into development of an FR system for the FR NW cotton barrier fabric or highloft for mattresses employing either boric acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734904112468703">6</xref></sup> or phosphates. As a result, cotton continues to be a very cost-effective solution for mattress manufacturers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734904112468703">7</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The US mattress business is large. For the year 2009, the annual retail value was US$11 billion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734904112468703">8</xref></sup> Approximately 4 lbs of FR fibers are used to make a NW FR barrier for a queen mattress, a queen size mattress being 60 in wide × 80 in long (Ogle S, INDA, 1100 Crescent Green. Suite 115; Cary, NC 27514, <italic><email>sogle@inda.org</email></italic>, communication on 7 December 2009.). If 25 million mattress sets are sold to the US residential market each year, the FR barrier fiber market is about 100 million pounds. As of April 2009, there were 33 suppliers marketing a variety of barrier fabrics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734904112468703">9</xref></sup> Major barrier fibers used in the United States are FR cotton (20 million pounds), FR rayon (65 million pounds), and the balance includes post-treated rayon, wool, Basofil<sup>®</sup> (melamine fiber), and different blends of inherently FR fibers (15 million pounds). Cotton’s share of the FR barrier market is likely to increase not only in the United States but also globally due to “green” initiatives. This study shows why the increased use of FR grey unbleached cotton barriers would have economic and environmental benefits by replacing expensive and/or nonbiodegradable materials.</p>
<p>For an FR barrier to be effective, it must reduce the actual, recognized hazard (smoldering or flaming combustion or both) and improve fire resistance. To be salable, the final product (mattress) must meet the aesthetic criteria (comfort, appearance) without introducing any health-/safety-related issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734904112468703">10</xref></sup> FR barriers must be sturdy and durable enough to last the life of the mattress.</p>
<p>Diammonium phosphate, having a long history of use in flame retardancy, has been used as an FR chemical in this work. The USP 5,397,509 relates to a fire retardant composed of certain percentages of dibasic ammonium phosphate, dibasic ammonium sulfate, and ammonium biborate dissolved in water. That solution is applied to the absorbent material/fabric/paper, allowed to soak in, and then dried to create the fire-retardant characteristics in the material/fabric/paper. The composition and the process can be used to make an FR terrycloth blanket that can be used as a safety device to smother fires.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734904112468703">11</xref></sup> However, that application and the formulation are different from the current application to a barrier fabric. This is because grey unbleached cotton is much less absorbent than bleached terrycloth. Using a borax–boric acid treatment, Wakelyn et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734904112468703">12</xref></sup> developed grey unbleached cotton barrier fabrics.</p>
<p>At the Southern Regional Research Center (SRRC), FR barriers have been developed with phosphate-based nondurable (to washing) formulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734904112468703">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734904112468703"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734904112468703">15</xref></sup> for grey unbleached cotton fabrics. For comparison, a commercially available, nitrogen-containing phosphonic acid salt–based FR chemical, Flovan<sup>®</sup> cyanoguanidine (CGN; “F”) was acquired from Huntsman Corporation (Huntsman Corporation, High Point, NC, USA, acquired it from CIBA, Europe). It is a CGN (or guanylurea) salt of methylphosphonic acid developed for nondurable FR treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734904112468703">16</xref></sup> This product has been utilized for producing FR barrier fabrics (for use in mattresses to meet CFR 1633). Flovan CGN FR finish is suitable for cellulose, polyester, wool, polypropylene, and their blends, and has been successfully tested and utilized on ticking and barrier fabrics to meet CFR 1633 regulations (Ms Betty Tilley, Technical Resource Manager, Huntsman International Textile Effects Division (PH: 704-587-5271), Charlotte, NC: Verbal Communication 8 June 2012.).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734904112468703">17</xref></sup> It combines skin compatibility with high protection and has achieved the third-party certification of Oeko-Tex Standard 100.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734904112468703">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734904112468703">19</xref></sup> The formulation based on Flovan CGN was used to produce FR grey unbleached cotton barrier fabrics. The test results of these NW FR cotton barrier fabrics are presented and discussed.</p>

<p>The formulation based on Flovan CGN was applied to grey unbleached cotton NW fabric with a Mathis laboratory padder with varying amounts of wet pickup to obtain a range of dry add-on (6.7%–26.2%) for the fabric. The finishing technique involved thoroughly wetting and saturating the grey NWs with the formulation and passing through a padder (one immersion and one nip, two immersions and two nips, or three immersions and three nips). The samples were dried thoroughly in a Mathis forced-air lab dryer on a pin frame for 3 min at 120°C–130°C, depending upon the wet pickup. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734904112468703">Table 3</xref> shows the add-ons with two immersions and two nips. The SRRC-1 formulation was applied with a Mathis padder to unbleached cotton NW fabric with two immersions and two nips (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734904112468703">Table 4</xref>). The thoroughly wetted and saturated fabrics were passed through the first padding at a nip pressure of 90 lbf/in<sup>2</sup> and with a speed of 2 m/min to obtain a low wet pickup of about 60%. Fabrics were again saturated in the formulation, and passed through a nip pressure of 10 lbf/in<sup>2</sup> at 2 m/min to obtain a wet pickup of about 95%–100%. The samples were placed on a pin frame and dried thoroughly in the forced-air dryer at 135°°C for 2 min 45 s, giving an average add-on of 14.2%.</p>

<title>Fabric testing</title>
<p>The test evaluations were carried out under standard atmospheric conditions, 65% relative humidity and 70°F. The untreated needle-punched NW fabric (control) as well as the FR-treated samples were evaluated as follows: vertical flame resistance by test method ASTM D 6413/D6413M-11ae1 standard test method for flame resistance of textiles; limiting oxygen index (LOI) by ASTM D 2863-12 standard test method for measuring the minimum oxygen concentration to support candle-like combustion of plastics; percent nitrogen by Dumas combustion; percent phosphorus by AOAC 986.15 with inductively coupled plasma; and breaking strength by “grab test” ASTM D5034-09 standard test method for breaking strength and elongation of textile fabrics. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were run on a model Q500 from TA Instruments (New Castle, DE) with the heating rate of 10°C/min from room temperature to 500°C in air and nitrogen.</p>
<p>Elemental analysis and mapping of NW cotton fabric samples were performed on an FEI XL30 Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDAX; Ametek Corp, Mahwah, NJ) Carbon planchets were adhered to standard ½ in Cambridge aluminum stubs using double-sided Avery photo labels (no. 06001). Samples were carbon coated to a thickness of 10 nm. Specimens were observed at 1500× magnification with accelerating voltages of 15–20 kV and a working distance of ∼10 mm.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>Before we discuss our present results, we summarize the salient features of our previous FR research using CA TB603, and the microscale combustion calorimeter (MCC) that are pertinent to the present investigation of FR grey unbleached cotton NW fabrics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734904112468703">20</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In 2003, grey unbleached cotton NW fabrics treated with the SRRC-1 formulation were certified as acceptable by the CA Bureau of Home Furnishing and Thermal Insulation based on passing the CA TB 603 test (that is admittedly less stringent than the currently required 16CFR1633).</p>
<p>That previous project used a MCC to evaluate the effectiveness of five FR-treated fabrics as flame-blockers for mattresses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734904112468703">Table 2</xref>, reproduced from Ref. 20). The MCC was used to evaluate various factors: heat release rate, peak heat release rate (PHRR), temperature at peak heat release rate, heat release capacity, total heat release (THR), and char yield for those three grey cotton NW barrier fabrics, and two Jones Fiber (Humboldt, TN) highloft FR grey cotton barrier fabrics. Jones Fiber has used 18–20 million pounds of grey cotton annually for the past 10 years to produce T-bond FR highlofts that have been successfully used as a fire-blocker in the production of mattresses that meet 16CFR1633. The T-bond highloft fabrics use a synthetic bonding fiber along with cotton to make the thermally bonded, low-density NW fabric. The comparability of the MCC data for the various treatments in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734904112468703">Table 2</xref> suggested that the mattresses constructed with FR grey cotton NW fabric (treated with SRRC-1) would have successfully met the requirements of 16CFR1633. We also found that untreated grey unbleached cotton (the control) consistently showed better flame resistance than untreated bleached cotton (PHRR: 101 vs 235; T<sub>PHRR</sub> (°C): 354 vs 380; THR: 9.5 vs 10.9; and char yield %: 16.8 vs 6.5).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734904112468703">20</xref></sup> As a result, the FR products of grey unbleached cotton exhibit lower heat release rate and PHRR than those of the bleached cotton. An added advantage of not bleaching, besides avoiding the expenses of scouring and bleaching, is that the FR grey unbleached cotton fiber is also softer than the FR-bleached cotton. When cotton’s natural wax is removed (by scouring and bleaching cotton fiber), the fiber-to-fiber friction is increased and the fiber becomes less soft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734904112468703">21</xref></sup>

<p>This study focuses exclusively on the SRRC-1 and Flovan CGN-treated grey cotton needle-punched NW fabrics, evaluated with the vertical flammability test, nitrogen and phosphorus analyses, breaking strength tests, TGA, and scanning electron microscopy with EDAX. The SRRC-1 formulation contains Hylite LF dimethyloldihydroxyethyleneurea resin (DMDHEU) ultra-low free formaldehyde) as supplied (a 40% aqueous solution; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734904112468703">Table 1</xref>). Stowell and Yang have used DMDHEU in their FR treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734904112468703">22</xref></sup> Formaldehyde is an International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Group I carcinogen and is definitely carcinogenic to humans. DMDHEU is the chemical used in durable press shirts and slacks that are frequently in contact with the skin, so is suitable for use in the manufacture of FR barrier fabrics. Given that the FR barrier fabrics are used under the mattress ticking, there would be even fewer toxicological issues. A mixed catalyst system of magnesium chloride hexahydrate and citric acid (1:1) was used to carry out the low temperature cure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734904112468703">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734904112468703">24</xref></sup> Triton X-100 was used to ensure efficient wetting of the unbleached grey cotton. Diammonium phosphate and urea were used as FRs in the SRRC-1 formulation and have a history of use in other semidurable cotton fabric applications.

<title>Flammability tests</title>
<p>Vertical flammability test results of the Flovan CGN formulation and the SRRC-1 formulation are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0734904112468703">Table 5</xref> along with nitrogen and phosphorus analyses. The standard procedure was performed with a flame contact time of 12 s. The untreated cotton control (150 g/m<sup>2</sup>) was, of course, highly combustible. It ignited when exposed to flame, the flame propagated, and after-flame continued upon removal of the flame source. Flameless smoldering called afterglow continued until the entire fabric was consumed. The specimen burned forming char with the evolution of combustion gases. The char has a certain degree of integrity, probably due to the scrim, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734904112468703">Figure 1(a)</xref>, whereas the char produced from an untreated grey unbleached cotton needle-punched fabric that was without scrim (100 g/m<sup>2</sup>) had much less integrity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734904112468703">Figure 1(b)</xref>. As may be seen, a light char is formed that does not adhere to the sample holder. The FR-treated grey unbleached cotton NW fabrics are self-extinguishing without any after-flame or afterglow (upon removal of the flame source) for the fabrics treated with either formulation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0734904112468703">Table 5</xref>); an add-on as low as 7.8% produces self-extinguishing fabric. There is no simple relationship between percent add-on of the Flovan CGN formulation and char length measured. This is more true for NW cotton fabric, as illustrated by the result for the Flovan CGN formulation with 22.7% add-on giving 13 mm char, and 13.2% giving 14 mm char. Based on three replicates, char lengths of the Flovan CGN formulation-treated cotton were 7–35 mm, and those of SRRC-1 formulation were 75–108 mm.</p>

<p>To determine how the FR grey unbleached cotton barrier fabrics perform when exposed to heat, the TGA is a useful technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734904112468703">25</xref></sup>

The results of the different add-ons essentially overlap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734904112468703">Figure 2</xref>, showing decomposition to about 35% char at 500°C, compared to untreated fabric showing 10% char. The FR chemicals reduce the decomposition temperature of cotton by ∼80°C as compared to that of unfinished cotton. These FR chemicals decompose at lower temperatures, releasing water, which helps in achieving flame retardancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734904112468703">26</xref></sup> Also, the percentage of char formed in FR-treated cotton is significantly higher than that of untreated cotton. Char is essentially carbon, and the oxidation of char causes afterglow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734904112468703">27</xref></sup> Phosphorus compounds are particularly effective in inhibiting afterglow, which is the case with the SRRC-1 and the Flovan CGN FR formulations. The preferred fiber types for use as FR barriers are cotton and regenerated cellulosic fibers because they do not melt like synthetic fibers such as polyester but rather decompose to a charred structure. The char serves a number of functions: it insulates the substrate from the intense heat of the fire and also acts as a barrier, hindering flammable volatile breakdown products from reaching the flame front.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734904112468703">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734904112468703">29</xref></sup>

<p>TGAs of FR grey unbleached cotton NW fabrics with various add-ons of Flovan CGN are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734904112468703">Figure 2</xref>. The needle-punched FR fabrics with add-ons in the range of 6.7%–26.2% were studied. Regardless of the add-ons, all the curves (except the control) overlapped closely with each other and a char of nearly 35% was formed at 500°C. The first noticeable result of the effect of heat was the loss of water. Compared to an untreated control, the FR-treated sample had higher char yield and showed higher initial loss in weight at lower temperatures. This is consistent with other observations; the FR additives have a higher release of water that enhances flame resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734904112468703">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734904112468703">31</xref></sup> Weight loss behavior was similar for all percentage add-on values (7%–22%). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734904112468703">Figure 3</xref> shows the thermal behavior of the Flovan CGN FR NW fabric and SRRC-1 FR NW fabric in both air and nitrogen. Thus, there are two curves each for the Flovan CGN, SRRC-1, and control fabrics. At 500°C, the char in air for the control was 1% versus 15% in nitrogen; for the Flovan CGN FR formulation, char in air was 24% versus 35% in nitrogen; and for SRRC-1 FR, char in air was 25% versus 35% in nitrogen. In air, the rate of burning was faster at a lower temperature, leaving a lower percentage of char. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734904112468703">Figure 3</xref> also shows that the thermal decomposition behaviors of SRRC-1 FR and the Flovan CGN FR grey unbleached cotton NW were comparable.</p>

<title>LOI, breaking strength, and elongation</title>
<p>The test results of LOI, breaking strength, and elongation at break of FR NWs with the SRRC-1 formulation and with the Flovan CGN FR formulation are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0734904112468703">Table 6</xref>. The LOI (32%) of the FR fabrics is high, at least 50% greater than that of the control fabric (LOI: 20%), confirming improvement in FR quality. With low to high add-on, the breaking strength improved over that of the control. Apparently, the chemical acted as a bonding agent, thereby increasing the breaking strength. With the Flovan CGN finished fabric, as the breaking strength increased, as expected, there was a slight reduction in elongation at break (93.2%, 88.7%, and 95.7%) for the three different add-ons with an exception where the elongation at break improved to 113% for 14.7% add-on. For SRRC-1 formulation-treated fabrics, there was a slight reduction in elongation at break (95.8% and 99.4%) with the exception where the elongation at break improved to 101.7% and 101.2% for add-ons of 17.5% and 16.1%, respectively. The data on breaking strength and elongation at break in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0734904112468703">Table 5</xref> convey that the FR finishes do not unduly alter the strength properties as compared to the untreated control. The treating grey unbleached cotton with either the Flovan CGN or SRRC-1 formulation FR does not cause adverse effects on strength, elongation, or softness. The percent nitrogen and percent phosphorus on the FR grey unbleached fabric of SRRC-1 and the Flovan CGN formulations are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0734904112468703">Table 5</xref>. Their values increased with increased percent add-on. The synergism of nitrogen and phosphorus on the fabric produced a high-quality FR fabric.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734904112468703">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734904112468703">33</xref></sup> The SRRC-1 formulation gives as good an FR finish as does the commercial treatment with Flovan CGN.

<title>EDAX analyses</title>
<p>The EDAX spectra of FR grey unbleached cotton treated with the SRRC-1 formulation compare well with those of FR cotton treated with the Flovan CGN formulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734904112468703">Figure 4(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734904112468703">(b)</xref>) regarding percentages for nitrogen and phosphorus. Their presence on the fiber is evidence of FR add-on. The dot map images of elements nitrogen and phosphorus show good distribution throughout the fiber for both the treatments, a typical example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734904112468703">Figure 5</xref>. Having a uniform distribution of the FR chemicals throughout the web is important for achieving an efficient FR treatment; the SRRC-1 treatment has successfully accomplished this. Although only one figure is shown, several images were collected and confirmed uniform nitrogen and phosphorus distribution. The EDAX spectra of the untreated grey control cotton (not shown) showed no elemental peaks for nitrogen and phosphorus.</p>

<title>Application to full-scale mattress tests</title>
<p>The flammability performance of the SRRC-1 formulation-treated grey unbleached cotton NW fabric was comparable to that of the Flovan-treated fabric as well as that of the commercially successful T-bond grey unbleached cotton highloft fabric (Jones Fiber). This is a positive indication that the mattresses constructed with unbleached, NW cotton FR barrier fabrics would pass 16CFR1633. The inexpensive unbleached fabric approach to an FR barrier is already used in the commercially successful T-bond grey unbleached cotton highloft fabric to comply with Federal open-flame standard.</p>
<p>As a follow-up to this study, we recommend constructing mattresses with a grey unbleached cotton NW fabric treated with the phosphate-based SRRC-1 formulation, and performing the full-scale burn test of whole mattresses.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>The FR characteristics of grey unbleached NW cotton fabric treated with either Flovan CGN formulation or the SRRC-1 formulation were studied. Both formulations produced comparable FR cotton fabrics. The grey unbleached cotton enabled the FR cotton NW to be especially economical. The unbleached cotton is less expensive and softer to the touch than the bleached cotton, thus increasing the marketability for low-to-medium value mattresses. Scouring/bleaching increases the price significantly by a factor of more than 2, and uses chemicals that must be disposed of in an environmentally benign way. The gray color of the unbleached cotton of our FR fabric should not pose a problem when used as a hidden barrier fabric. The mattresses constructed with FR cotton unbleached NW barrier fabric are predicted to meet the requirements of 16CFR1633.</p>
