<p>Currently, large, thick, and complex tissue vascularization is one of the research focuses of tissue engineering. Numerous studies have proven that microvascular systems can be developed by cultivating endothelial cells in a hydrogel/scaffold structure. As the sources of adult endothelial cells are very limited and very easily degraded, it is better to induce stem cells into endothelial cells. In this article, a grid poly(<sc>d</sc>,<sc>l</sc>-lactic-<italic>co</italic>-glycolic acid) structure with defined internal channels was fabricated using a low-temperature deposition manufacturing technique under computer direction. In a fibrinogen mixture, an aqueous adipose-derived stem cell fibrinogen mixture was incorporated into the internal walls of the poly(<sc>d</sc>,<sc>l</sc>-lactic-<italic>co</italic>-glycolic acid) scaffold and stabilized with thrombin solution. After several days of in vitro culture, the adipose-derived stem cells immobilized in the fibrin hydrogel were induced into endothelial-like cells with endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the major issues in tissue engineering is how to vascularize relatively large size constructs. Studies have shown that cells can only survive within the range of 150–200 µm of blood vessels where they are able to obtain oxygen and nutrients by the dispersion effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883911513481892">1</xref></sup> If the engineered tissue volume is larger than several square millimeters, with no blood vessel inside, the cells in the construct will die due to ischemia and hypoxia. This is the reason why the number of tissue engineering products is limited and only confined to thin tissues, such as the skin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883911513481892">2</xref></sup> cartilage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883911513481892">3</xref></sup> and bladder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883911513481892">4</xref></sup> To solve this problem, a vascular network needs to be established inside the construct to maintain cell viability and induce structural organization.</p>
<p>Currently, there are two main approaches for tissue vascularization: One is to coculture endothelial cells or stem cells with parenchymal cells based on some cell biotechnologies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883911513481892">5</xref></sup> and the other approach is to directly fabricate a vascular network with vascular cells using an advance three-dimensional (3D) forming technology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883911513481892">6</xref></sup> For example, Black et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883911513481892">7</xref></sup> seeded umbilical vein endothelial cells and fibroblast in a collagen–glycosaminoglycan scaffold and synthesized tissue-engineered skin containing capillary-like structures. Sahota et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883911513481892">2</xref></sup> seeded human endothelial cells into a biodegradable scaffold and implanted it into nude mice. They proved that endothelial cells have the ability to migrate and proliferate in a scaffold to form microvascular structures that can be connected to the host’s vascular system and execute some basic functions. However, the microvascular could not form in vitro by seeding pure endothelial cells in a stiff scaffold, because the endothelial cells need mitogen and extracellular matrix to proliferate and migrate. To engineer large tissues or organs, the source of self-renewable endothelial cells is not enough as they are terminally differentiated cells.</p>
<p>Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are a kind of multipotent adult stem cells that exist in adipose tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883911513481892">8</xref></sup> Recently, scientists have demonstrated that ADSCs are easily cultured and can differentiate into many cell types, such as adipocytes, endothelial cells, neurons, and osteoblasts in certain conditions. The main benefit of ADSCs is that they can be easily harvested from patients by a simple, minimally invasive method. Li et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883911513481892">9</xref></sup> extracted ADSCs from human adipose tissue and induced them to adipose cells for 2 weeks. After being implanted in nude mice with exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibrin, vascularized adipose tissue formed inside the composite structure.</p>
<p>In previous studies, we developed several rapid prototyping (RP) techniques that enable the direct deposition of scaffold biomaterials, cells/natural hydrogels, and hybrid synthetic and natural polymer compounds automatically to form special 3D complex architectures in a predesigned pattern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883911513481892">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883911513481892"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883911513481892">21</xref></sup> Self-renewable ADSCs have been incorporated into the 3D grid constructs with the ability to differentiate into different terminal cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883911513481892">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883911513481892">23</xref></sup> The designed architecture facilitates cell growth, organization, and differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883911513481892">24</xref></sup> However, there is a critical limitation of the cell/hydrogel construct in creating a vascular system. The mechanical properties of the natural cell/hydrogel constructs are notoriously too weak to withstand vascular implantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883911513481892">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0883911513481892"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883911513481892">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Low-temperature deposition manufacturing (LDM) is an important RP technique for loacting both synthetic and natural polymer solutions into a predefined space to form 3D complex architectures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0883911513481892">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0883911513481892"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0883911513481892">34</xref></sup> In this study, a synthetic poly(<sc>d</sc>,<sc>l</sc>-lactic-<italic>co</italic>-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffold was fabricated with a LDM system. ADSCs were encapsulated in a fibrinogen solution before the cell/hydrogel was incorporated into the synthetic PLGA scaffold. The stiffer PLGA scaffold provided mechanical support for the soft cell/hydrogel construct that prevented them from yielding quickly in the culture medium. After several days of in vitro culture and induction, the proliferation and differentiation states of the ADSCs in the construct were determined. This incorporation technique, based on the LDM-formed PLGA scaffold, holds the potential in creating vascularized large tissues with mechanical strong enough support materials.</p>

<title>Fabrication of the grid PLGA scaffolds</title>
<p>Synthetic PLGA (LA/GA=70/30 Mw 100,000 Da) was bought from Institute of Medical Devices of Shandong Province, Jinan, China. PLGA (Beijing Modern Eastern Fine Chemical Products Co., Ltd, Beijing, China was dissolved in 1,4-dioxane) to form a 16% (w/v) solution before assembling. A lattice PLGA scaffold with defined interconnected channels and cross strands in both horizontal and vertical directions was designed with a computer. A software package (Microsoft AT6400) was used to design the grid 3D structures with different channel sizes. PLGA scaffolds with different sizes of macrochannels were built layer-by-layer using a digital model under low temperature of −28°C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883911513481892">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883911513481892"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883911513481892">21</xref></sup> A stainless nozzle was used to extrude the PLGA fibers. The outlet diameter of the nozzle was 0.3 mm, and the minimum resolution of the low-temperature deposition process was 10 µm. After the low-temperature deposition, the PLGA scaffolds were freeze-dried for 48 h to remove the organic solvent 1,4-dioxane.</p>

<title>Preparation of the ADSC/fibrinogen mixture</title>
<p>ADSCs were isolated from rat subcutaneous adipose tissue. The epididymal adipose tissues from Sprague Dawley rats (100–150 g, Beijing University Medical Center of Laboratory Animals, Beijing, China) were excised, washed sequentially in serial dilutions of betadine, and minced finely in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The adipose tissues were digested with 0.075% Type II collagenase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37°C for 30 min. Neutralized cells were centrifuged to separate mature adipocytes and the stromal vascular fraction. Floating adipocytes were removed, and pelleted stromal cells were filtered through a 100 mm cell strainer before plating. The ADSCs were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (in DMEM; Gibco, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The cells were grown to subconfluence and passaged by standard trypsinization methods. The ADSCs were trypsinized, washed, and quantified before use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0883911513481892">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fibrinogen and thrombin were purchased from Sigma. A 5% w/v fibrinogen solution was prepared by dissolving bulk fibrinogen in DMEM without the addition of FBS. Bovine thrombin (Gibco) was dissolved in PBS to give a final concentration of 100 IU/mL. The trypsinized ADSCs were mixed with the fibrinogen solution at a density of 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL.</p>

<title>Building process of the ADSC/fibrin–PLGA construct</title>
<p>The PLGA scaffolds were infiltrated with 1 mL of the thrombin solution before the ADSC/fibrinogen mixture was added into the got-through porous structures of PLGA scaffolds. A syringe containing the ADSC/fibrinogen mixture was used to squeeze the mixture into the go-through pores of the PLGA scaffolds. After the ADSC/fibrinogen mixture was inserted into the channels, 1 mL of the thrombin solution was used to polymerize the fibrinogen for 5 min to obtain a stable structure. After a layer of ADSC/fibrin hydrogel had attached to the walls of the PLGA scaffolds, the ADSCs were immobilized into the fibrin hydrogel. The 3D ADSC/fibrin–PLGA constructs were cultured in a 24-well plate with high-sugar DMEM (Gibco).</p>

<title>Principles for building the ADSC/fibrin–PLGA construct</title>
<p>The LDM system is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883911513481892">Figure 1</xref>. The modeling and fabrication processes of the hybrid ADSC/fibrin–PLGA construct based on a RP technique are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883911513481892">Figure 2</xref>. A two-step fabrication method was used to develop the ADSC/fibrin–PLGA construct. At the first stage, a basic 10-layered grid pattern was created with lines 10 mm long and a distance between lines of 1.0 mm. The average diameter of the extruded filaments was 0.25 mm. By varying the assembly route and deposition parameters, the patterns of the PLGA scaffolds changed correspondingly, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911513481892">Figure 3</xref>. Three regular cube PLGA scaffolds with a bulk volume of (7–10) × 10 × 5 mm<sup>3</sup> and open-square channels (staggered lattice, grid) were created by changing the grid (lattice) spacing (channel size) from 1.35 to 1.45 mm and to 1.55 mm (Figure 3(a) to (c)). A special structure with four larger holes (1.5 mm diameter) was created with the computer-aided design model based on the same regular grid structure of 1.55 mm grid spacing (Figure 3(d)). The deviation of the line widths in the structures was approximately 10% with some channels blocked with the extra PLGA solution. According to the later incorporation and stabilization processes, the 1.35 mm grid spacing (channels) was too small that the cell/hydrogel could hardly be injected uniformly into the intervals. After 1 week of in vitro culture, cells inside the 3D constructs were barely detectable. In contrast, the spaced grids (1.45 and 1.55 mm) were much easier to be processed. However, when the grid spacing was &gt;1.55 mm, the cell/hydrogel was deposited on the bottom rather than being attached to the side walls of the constructs. Similar results were found with the special constructs with the four larger holes (1.5 mm diameter) in the original 1.55-mm grid spacing structures. The samples with grid spacing of 1.45 mm were chosen for the following experiments. The 16% PLGA/1,4-dioxane solution with viscoelastic fluid characteristics was suitable for continuous extrusion under the low temperature (−28°C). The organic solvent 1,4-dioxane was sublimated from the PLGA scaffolds during the freeze-drying stage.</p>

<title>Cell states in the ADSC/fibrin–PLGA construct</title>
<p>The ADSCs were embedded in the fibrin hydrogel which adhered on the PLGA walls tightly. After 3 days of culture, the living cells on the surface of the cell/hydrogel appeared bright blue with extended pseudopodia under trypan blue staining that means that the cells were viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0883911513481892">Figure 4</xref>). A few ADSCs appeared as a deadly dark color with no pseudopodium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0883911513481892">Figure 4</xref>). The total cell viability was 96% ± 1.2%.

These results indicate that the ADSCs proliferated well in the fibrin network. During the long-term in vitro cultures, a lot of cells had moved to the bottom of petri dish instead of on the PLGA walls. However, after the group with the grid spacing of 1.35 mm was sliced, hardly any cells or fibrinogen were found inside the construct. Apparently, this channel size was too small to let the cell/fibrin hydrogel flow into the interior section of the construct. Thus, the group with grid spacing of 1.45 mm was found to be the most suitable one for the cell/fibrin hydrogel attachment and later cell survival.</p>

The nutrients in the medium could go into the go-through porous construct and be absorbed by cells. It was noted that after several days of in vitro culture, the ADSCs were not evenly distributed in the fibrin hydrogel. Most of the cells tended to seat on the internal channels of the PLGA scaffolds. This indicated that the ADSCs grew easier on the channel walls than inside the fibrin hydrogel.</p>

<title>Confocal laser scanning result of the induced differentiated cells</title>
<p>The ADSCs stained positive with CD31 (mature endothelial cell indicator) and appeared in red fluorescence under the microscope, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0883911513481892">Figure 9</xref>, which is a distinct biomark for mature endothelial cells. After 4 days of culture with endothelial growth factor (EGF), CD31 staining revealed that over 90% of the ADSCs on the channel walls had differentiated into mature endothelial cells (CD31t) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0883911513481892">Figure 9(a)</xref>). On the fifth day, a few more ADSCs near the surface of the walls had differentiated into endothelial cells and connected with each other on the surface of the fibrin hydrogel to form fiber-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0883911513481892">Figure 9(b)</xref>). However, the cells located deep inside the fibrin hydrogel were not apparent. On the seventh day, there were a few more ADSCs had differentiated into endothelial-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0883911513481892">Figure 9(c)</xref>). From the 7th day to 10th day, the endothelial cell number increase was not obvious (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0883911513481892">Figure 9(d)</xref>) and some of the cells had aggregated into clusters. This indicated that the ADSCs on the surfaces of the fibrin hydrogel were more easily induced into endothelial-like cells, and that the cell position in the 3D construct plays a key role in the cell differentiation states. This may be due to the growth factors that were able to reach the cells on the channel walls but difficult to reach the cells encapsulated in the fibrin hydrogel. After the cells were induced into endothelial cells, cell proliferation ability was reduced sharply.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>One of the major challenges in large tissue engineering is to vascularize the structure to transport nutrients and gases to the incorporated cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0883911513481892">38</xref></sup> The spatial variation of cell–substrate interfaces is likely to influence the sustainability of cell vitality, metabolism, and phenotype expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0883911513481892">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0883911513481892">40</xref></sup> The flexibility and versatility of creating lattice (or cellular) structures by LDM RP techniques provide the opportunity to study the influence of different channel sizes on cell/hydrogel incorporation as well as the induced ADSC differentiation capabilities.</p>
<p>In this study, the channel sizes of the PLGA scaffolds can be changed by varying the assembly route and deposition parameters. The basic predefined interconnected channels inside the PLGA scaffolds were obtained with grid spacing changes from 1.35 to 1.45 mm and to 1.55 mm. These channels were useful to transfer nutrients and oxygen to the cells throughout the construct. From the morphology structures of the deposited PLGA scaffolds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911513481892">Figure 3</xref>), it is clear that within a (7–10) ×10 × 5 mm<sup>3</sup> 3D construct, the filaments appeared to have a consistent width as well as an even distribution of interconnected channels throughout the entire construct. As an alternative for improving cell survival rate, four larger holes with 1.5 mm diameters were drilled on the PLGA scaffolds, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883911513481892">Figure 3(d)</xref>. With the thrombin solution, the synthetic PLGA and natural cell/hydrogel systems were integrated tightly and formed an organic entirety. No delamination was found between the two systems during the following 2–3 weeks of in vitro culture. The stiff PLGA scaffolds provided an efficient mechanical template to support the soft cell/fibrin hydrogel structures, and the interconnected channels as mass exchange conduits.</p>
<p>Fibrinogen is a natural polymer that can be polymerized with thrombin to form fibrin. Fibrin has been used as an effective scaffolding material to grow a variety of tissue constructs with numerous advantages as it is normally used by the body as temporary scaffolding for tissue regeneration and healing and can be sourced autologously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0883911513481892">41</xref></sup> In this study, the fibrin hydrogel was used as the extracellular matrix to house the ADSCs and to sustain cell viability. The weak mechanical properties of natural cell/hydrogel composite were overcome with the predefined PLGA scaffold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883911513481892">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883911513481892"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883911513481892">23</xref></sup> The synthetic polymer PLGA with good mechanical properties could provide a supportive backbone for the cell/hydrogel accommodation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883911513481892">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883911513481892"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0883911513481892"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883911513481892">29</xref></sup> ADSCs proliferated progressively during the 2–3 weeks of in vitro culture. The 3D fibrin hydrogel remained its stable polymerization state with no degradation during the 2–3 weeks of in vitro culture. With the bound fibrin hydrogel networks, the ADSCs proliferated quickly and formed large aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0883911513481892">Figure 7(b)</xref>). Meanwhile, those ADSCs on the bottom of the constructs tended to extend outwardly on the petri dishes. The reason for some cells to move to the bottom of petri dish instead of to the PLGA walls may be that the cell/fibrin hydrogel was much easier to fall on the bottom than to attach to the internal channels due to gravity. Several different test results were consistent with the conclusion that the integration of synthetic polymer PLGA and natural polymer fibrin make it possible to provide cells with a stable and suitable 3D environment for survival. The hybrid cell/hydrogel–scaffold construct is an improvement over the currently available techniques for pure synthetic polymer scaffold or natural cell/hydrogel manufacturing.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this study, a new approach was developed to provide cells with oxygen and nutrients as well as to remove waste products inside an engineered cell/hydrogel–scaffold construct. A digital predefined grid PLGA scaffold provided the mechanically weak cell/hydrogel with a suitable 3D environment, and the ADSC/fibrin complex was successfully integrated into the internal channels of the PLGA scaffold. Over 96% of the ADSCs were found alive in the fibrin hydrogel and maintained their proliferation capability during the 2–3 weeks of in vitro culture. Progressively, the embedded ADSCs were able to be induced into endothelial-like cells with VEGF and b-FGF in the culture medium. This unique two-step fabrication method provides a favorable alternative to the existing large tissue vascularization strategies. With this technique, it is possible to directly manipulate scaffold and cells with biomimetic extracellular matrices and arrange them in proper spatial sites according to predefined digital models. This combination technique could potentially be widely used in the future vascular system engineering and complex organ manufacturing areas.</p>
