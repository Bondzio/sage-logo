<p>The last couple of years have seen something of a renaissance for feminism. Books such as Kat Banyard’s <italic>Equality Illusion</italic>, Natasha Walter’s <italic>Living Dolls</italic> and Caitlin Moran’s <italic>How to Be a Woman</italic>, have all popularized feminist ideas, bringing them to a new (and younger) audience. At the same time, there has been an increase in grassroots feminist movements which have built on the success of ‘Reclaim the Night;’ groups like UK Feminista and Feminist Fight Back conducting campaigns against the sex industry and unequal working practices.</p>
<p>For a forty-something feminist, politicized in the 1980s, there is much to feel optimistic about in these new and energetic responses to old social problems. After the popularity of post-feminism, there seems to be a willingness amongst the next generation of women to engage with what feminism might have to say to their experiences. The naïve optimism that equal rights have been achieved is being challenged, women thinking more critically about the things that act as a bar to our flourishing in contemporary society.</p>
<p>But even if there is more openness among younger women to the key ideas of feminism that is not to say that the culture more generally reflects and supports feminist sentiments.</p>
<p>Recently I was reminded that sexism remains as resilient and pernicious as ever. I am something of a late convert to the new forms of social media. Initially, this involved opening a Facebook account which enabled me to connect with old friends from various stages in my life. Since then, I’ve moved on to Twitter. Twitter is a social media tool where communication takes place through statements of no more than 140 characters. Having so few letters with which to play instills a certain discipline in your communication. It is an exacting art that forces you to be pithy in the way you express your ideas. This format gives rise to statements that can be funny, witty, serious or angry. Most of the time it is a rather polite medium of communication but every so often it reveals frightening things about the attitudes of the prevailing culture.</p>
<p>I was shocked when for a couple of days one of the trending (or most popular) debates on Twitter was ‘reasons to beat your girlfriend.’ Whether this started as a joke it is difficult to say. (A previous trending topic was ‘the Muslims are to blame’ which began as a wry comment on the tendency of the Western media to blame Islam for all ills and quickly became a forum for racist comments and prejudices.) Even if this topic was supposed to be serious, you have to ask yourself about the kind of society where violence against women is an appropriate topic for a joke.</p>
<p>This is an age-old problem. Violence against women has frequently formed the basis for entertainment. Think of the rape and mutilation of Lavinia in <italic>Titus Andronicus</italic>; her sufferings depicted in graphic terms in a long speech by her uncle Marcus. Or we might think about the writings of the Marquis de Sade where the torture of women and children form the basis for his tales of sex and death. Think about the traditional Punch and Judy shows that I remember from beach holidays that involved domestic violence. We might come closer to our own time and think of the popularity of slasher movies where the victims are often young, often female.</p>
<p>Cataloguing the history of sexism is useful if painful as it reminds us of the need to consider critically the sometimes less obvious sexism of our own time. Elaine Graham’s discussion of the critically acclaimed TV series <italic>Mad Men</italic> in this edition of the journal offers some words of advice and caution about how feminist theologians engage with that past. Set in the early 1960s, <italic>Mad Men</italic> presents an image that both glamorizes and critiques the sexual politics of the time. But what it also does is make the viewer think more critically about the values and norms of our own age.</p>
<p>How religious institutions respond to sexism remains an issue of crucial significance for feminist theologians, as is seen in several of the pieces in this edition. Timothy Lincoln considers the differences between men and women’s experience of seminary life through a detailed empirical investigation of the problems the sexes face as they train for the ministry. Gina Messina-Dysart addresses directly the experience of sexual violence, using the Korean idea of ‘han’ to consider the spiritual damage that rape brings in its wake, a theme that is further developed by Beth Crisp who seeks to consider this spiritual damage as something that is not limited to those who are explicitly religious.</p>
<p>Crisp’s piece gets us to think more broadly about what the spiritual involves, and this is further developed by Rhiannon Grant. In order to cope with the things that happen to us, what religious sources might we turn to? Grant urges us to be sensitive in the use that we might make of rituals and stories from religious traditions other than our own. Too easy an appropriation of ideas and beliefs can lead to a kind of violence against those from whom these sources come. We think that their beliefs are ours to use as we wish, and we fail to treat them with the respect they deserve.</p>
<p>Often the best feminist theology comes out of the use of ordinary, day-to-day experiences and activities. Anna Fisk suggests something of the beauty and creativity that women have traditionally found in some of the crafts that have stemmed from their experiences of domesticity. In her article, knitting becomes a kind of therapy that leads to healing, forming the basis for theological reflection.</p>
<p>Fisk’s piece, perhaps surprisingly, is most useful for my attempt to understand the disturbing side of the new social media. It may be an old art, Twitter may be a new one, but the Bitch and Stitch circles reveal something of the way women can come together to find support from each other. While that Twitter topic may have revealed the continuing reality of misogyny, it also became the opportunity for women to connect with each other in order to reject it. I am now in touch with several feminist groups who responded quickly to that topic and used it as an opportunity to discuss attitudes towards women. Challenging sexism and all that emanates from it enables women to come together, envisioning and creating new worlds out of the experiences of the old.</p>
