<p><italic>Sunburnt Cities: The Great Recession, Depopulation and Urban Planning in the American Sunbelt</italic> is particularly timely as it challenges widely held assumptions about effective responses to population and employment loss that are pertinent in the current economic crisis. In particular, the author challenges the assumption common in planning and economic development that economic development policies should attempt to reverse population decline through new growth in jobs and people. Hollander argues that such growth-based policies are often ineffective and that cities should instead consider proactively adjusting to population decline as part of a more flexible management of change. In analogy to the smart growth movement, he promotes smart decline: The idea is that city shrinkage and prosperity do not have to be incompatible and that there are more effective alternative responses to population decline than the current bias toward growth-based economic development policies. Examples of such alternatives include reductions in housing density through demolitions and blotting (acquisition of a home’s neighboring green spaces); conversion of residential to alternative land uses such as parks, playgrounds, cemeteries or community gardens; or return to agricultural land uses such as the Buffalo Commons proposal.</p>
<p>Hollander’s argument has been formulated and analyzed in a larger body of research by the author and others for the past decade. <italic>Sunburnt Cities</italic> synthesizes some of the author’s previous research on the topic and provides the shrinking cities movement with a succinct summary of some of the key arguments. The international movement to rethink planning responses to shrinking cities includes active recent research in European countries like Germany where cities in the East of the country experienced large population losses to the West after the fall of the Wall in 1989. Institutions and research networks include, for instance, the international <italic>Shrinking Cities Project</italic> in Berlin, the European <italic>Cities Growing Smaller</italic> project, the <italic>Shrinking Cities International Research Network</italic> launched by the University of California, Berkeley, in 2004, and Kent State University’s <italic>Shrinking Cities Institute</italic> in Ohio.</p>
<p>Although the author does not make this link, the critique of growth policies among shrinking cities advocates and researchers could be framed more broadly by connecting with recent research that challenges the seemingly inevitable connection between prosperity and growth at a macroeconomic level. For instance, the recent book <italic>Prosperity without Growth: Economics for a Finite Planet</italic> challenges the dominant assumption that economic growth is the prerequisite for prosperity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739456X12456520">Jackson et al. 2009</xref>). Instead, the authors argue that prosperity is possible without economic growth, that prosperity and welfare should be defined and measured beyond gross domestic product, and that economic growth is directly related to environmental and economic crises as well as unequal development. Other authors within the planning community have recently argued that smaller cities might be more sustainable in the future than larger ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739456X12456520">Kunstler 2011</xref>). Also, Duany’s new book <italic>Garden Cities</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12456520">2011</xref>) seems to fit well with Hollander’s proposed approach. It is one of the strengths of Hollander’s book that his challenge of economic growth tools as the only panacea worth considering is one that inspires connections to other current research and debates on sustainable development.</p>
<p>In a well-written analysis that makes technical material accessible and entertaining to read, Hollander starts with general data from the Rust Belt (chapter 3) and a case study of Flint, Michigan (chapter 4). He then focuses on cities in the Sunbelt that have been growing rapidly in the past decades but have started to recently experience population loss, particularly in some neighborhoods (chapters 6 to 9). He argues that planners in these cities, including his three case study sites of Fresno, California; Phoenix, Arizona; and Orlando, Florida, can learn from the experience of Rustbelt cities such as Flint. The case studies are framed by conceptual chapters (1, 2, 5, and 10) that provide theoretical models for understanding population decline and concluding recommendations for planners. The qualitative data are supplemented by a descriptive analysis of 2000 U.S. Census data and 2006 and 2009 postal service data and some multivariate regression modeling that is explained in an accessible fashion for nontechnical audiences.</p>
<p>One of the traditional problems with population decline is the resulting oversupply of housing, which can then lead to housing abandonment and crime problems. Hence a key component of Hollander’s approach is dedensification, that is, a reduction of housing unit density to right-size or retrofit neighborhoods to match their smaller populations. He focuses on adjusting established growth management tools to accommodate periods of lack of growth. For instance, smart decline tools discussed in more detail include the so-called Reverse Transect, Relaxed Zoning, and the Reverse Land Use Allocation Model. The Reverse Transect builds on Duany and Talen’s New Urbanist Transect but explicitly accounts for the reversal from urban center (T5) to rural reserve (T2). Relaxed zoning enables adaptive reuse or demolition of housing once a threshold of population loss is reached—in contrast to typical current zoning rules that often prohibit reductions in density and alternative land uses. The Reverse Land Use Allocation Model predicts neighborhoods with the fastest likelihood of decline rather than the fastest growth. Smart growth and smart decline can be compatible strategies for different neighborhoods within the same city as some areas gain while others lose population. Hollander’s key argument is that planners and planning tools should become more flexible in adjusting to both growth and decline as necessary as opposed to only applying growth-based tools even in the case of population decline.</p>
<p>There are multiple contributions of this book to planning scholarship. Most immediately, Hollander offers a cohesive argument why economic development policies should be rethought in shrinking cities. This is a topic of national interest that involves core concerns such as employment and population growth and planning responses to a lack of both. The book raises important larger questions, for instance, related to the need for more flexible planning strategies that allow for the management of change with a larger toolbox of responses than is currently the norm. Finally, the book is a good example of planning scholarship that applies mixed methods, is accessible to researchers and practitioners alike, and moves easily from case study details to a discussion of larger conceptual questions.</p>
<p>The weakest discussion in the book, in this reviewer’s opinion, pertains to the relationship between historic preservation and dedensification. Hollander describes how historic preservation policies can make the demolition of surplus units especially difficult and that it will be easier to demolish units in cities such as Phoenix without strong historic preservation rules. However, the idea of cities that constantly renew their housing stock based on population growth and decline without any markers of previous times seems to point too much to a future of cities without a past. Preurban structures such as historically significant buildings can provide cohesiveness to dedensification as well as redensification plans. In terms of recommendations for future planning approaches, a more attractive alternative would then be to think about more flexible historic preservation rules—for instance, in analogy to Hollander’s proposed flexible zoning where structures of particular historic significance are preserved while simultaneously allowing for dedensification within historic preservation districts.</p>
