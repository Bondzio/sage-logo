<p>The first universal exhibition of the post-Second World War era and a major battleground in the ‘cultural Cold War’, the 1958 Brussels Exposition served as an appropriate venue for the display of Sputniks I and II. As the centerpiece of the enormous Soviet pavilion, the Sputnik replicas enabled the USSR to bask in the reflective glow of its scientific and technological achievement before an international audience of 40 million. Based on archival sources (from Brussels and Moscow) as well as contemporary published material, this article employs a modified version of Stuart Hall's reception theory to analyze Soviet authorities' production (or ‘encoding/writing’) of the exhibit and its appropriation (‘decoding/reading’) by radically different publics – non-Soviet visitors and Soviet readers back home. It argues that the producers exercised only tenuous control over the meaning of Sputnik.</p>

<p>In April 2008 the ITAR-TASS online journal <italic>Ekho Planety</italic> carried an article on the Brussels World's Fair, also known as Expo '58. Focusing on the Soviet pavilion that an international jury judged as the Fair's most outstanding, the article cited the two replicas of the first artificial satellites – the Sputniks – as ‘its highlight, the trump card’. Expo '58 served as the first venue for the display of the Sputniks, the first time that the general public had an opportunity to view them up close. It also was the first universal exhibition of the post-Second World War era and as such became a major battleground in the ‘cultural Cold War.’ The exhibition enabled the USSR to bask in the glow of its technological achievement before an international audience in excess of 40 million while the United States was still scrambling to catch up. Indeed, the period from the launching of Sputnik-1 on October 4 1957 to the close of Expo '58 almost exactly a year later arguably coincided with the peak of the Soviet Union's international prestige. No wonder an article published half a century later could look back nostalgically to a time ‘When We Were First.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022009411422372">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The anthropologist Penelope Harvey has described world's fairs as the ‘most flamboyant of modernist institutions of cultural display’. ‘Temporary yet monumental,’ she writes, they typically offered ‘extremely flexible … sites of innovation providing opportunities for demonstration of new technologies and their effects’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022009411422372">2</xref></sup> A consideration of how Soviet authorities used Sputnik, the messages they inscribed in its display and the appropriation of the exhibit by different publics can help us gain new clarity about the effectiveness and limitations of demonstrating new technologies for both foreign and domestic audiences and more particularly Sputnik's role in the Cold War. This article begins by contextualizing Soviet participation in the Brussels World's Fair with reference to both previous international expositions and the geo-political and cultural standoffs between East and West during the mid- to late 1950s. It proceeds to analyze the display of the Sputnik replicas in the entrance hall of the Soviet pavilion in terms of its production (or ‘encoding/writing’), reproduction and consumption (or ‘decoding/reading’). This approach, derived from one of Stuart Hall's canonical essays on the media and slightly modified by social anthropologist Sharon Macdonald's framework to analyse museum displays, is pursued using different sources for each component.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022009411422372">3</xref></sup> Thus, the section on production relies mainly on discussions behind closed doors – statements at meetings of the Soviet pavilion's organizing committee and internal memos among its members, advice from its board of consultants, correspondence with party officials and exchanges with Expo officials in Brussels. Reproduction – essentially the repackaging of Sputnik and the impression it made at the exhibition for those who could not attend – is examined via published materials. Finally, to get at consumption, I rely on comments in visitors' books deposited in the Soviet archives as well as commentary published in contemporary foreign newspapers and journals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022009411422372">4</xref></sup> Though presented in succession, these different kinds of material were clearly linked and in a sense produced each other.</p>
<p>‘The Soviet Union was no stranger to the arena of international expositions,’ writes Anthony Swift in an article devoted to the USSR's pavilion at the New York World's Fair of 1939. Aside from New York, Swift mentions the 1925 Paris Exposition des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes where Konstantin Melnikov's prize-winning constructivist pavilion housed a model of Vladimir Tatlin's monument to the Third International, and the 1937 Exposition Internationale where the Soviet and Nazi pavilions famously confronted one another across the esplanade.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022009411422372">5</xref></sup> Actually, according to a Soviet Chamber of Commerce publication, the USSR represented itself at over 80 international exhibitions and fairs in 16 countries during the inter-war years, and in the first ten years after the Second World War (1946-56), appeared at a total of 68 exhibitions in 22 countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022009411422372">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>This cumulative experience is one of the strands in the contextual web surrounding Soviet participation in Brussels. It meant that in performing the myriad tasks necessary to erect the pavilion and fill it with objects that showed off the capabilities of the Soviet people and system, the organizing committee under Dmitri Ryzhkov proceeded in familiar, practiced ways. However, Expo '58 and the Soviet presence at the event were also shaped in the most profound ways by the Cold War. The Fair's organizers were not above exploiting the superpower rivalry and mutual fears associated with it. Brigitte Schroeder-Gudehus and David Cloutier cite internal State Department memos to the effect that ‘the Belgian organizers kept the American government abreast of Soviet plans as one of several stratagems intended to lure the United States to attend the exposition’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022009411422372">7</xref></sup> It turns out the organizers played the same game in reverse. During his visit to Moscow in June 1956, the Fair's General Commissar, Baron Moens de Fernig, ‘underscored the tremendous interest in the project throughout the world <italic>and especially in the United States’</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022009411422372">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whether the Soviets needed such prodding is doubtful. Sputnik would become not only the centerpiece of the Soviet pavilion but the best known Soviet scientific-technological achievement from this era. But when in August 1955 Deputy Foreign Minister Valery Zorin formally accepted de Fernig's invitation to participate, Sputnik was hardly a twinkle in the eye of its chief designer, Sergei Korolev.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022009411422372">9</xref></sup> In the context of Cold War rivalry, Sputnik fed off a whole series of Soviet advances and propaganda victories that continued beyond the successful launching of the satellites themselves and indeed the display of their replicas in Brussels. Washington was probably most concerned about Soviet progress in developing its nuclear arsenal and delivery systems. Moscow's announcement on August 26 1957 that it had successfully tested the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) upset the Pentagon more than the Sputnik launch would, for the test demonstrated the capability of sending nuclear weapons to targets within a radius of 4000 miles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022009411422372">10</xref></sup> This and other international gains plus the initial success of his Virgin Lands program account for why at least one of Khrushchev's biographers considers the years 1957 to 1960 the Soviet leader's ‘best yet’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022009411422372">11</xref></sup> Others have noted that the ‘cult of science’ that had emerged during the last years of Stalin ‘grew unchallenged in the 1950s on the foundation of successes in space, nuclear power, and high-energy physics’, and that achievements in space technology ‘were the capstone of scientists' increasing power and prestige under Khrushchev’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022009411422372">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>During these same years, Soviet cultural politics correspondingly shifted away from the autarchy that characterized the late Stalin era to ‘the aspiration to world cultural leadership in line with the Soviet Union's new geopolitical role’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022009411422372">13</xref></sup> The pursuit of this goal was inextricably connected with what Frederick Barghoorn called the Soviet Union's ‘cultural offensive’ in the Cold War,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022009411422372">14</xref></sup> an offensive that also helps to contextualize the Soviet pavilion at the Brussels World's Fair and the impression that the Sputnik replicas made.</p>
<p>As the commissioner general of its pavilion, the US State Department chose a Broadway producer and director of the Metropolitan Opera, Howard Cullman. Cullman's Soviet counterpart, Dmitri Ryzhkov, had worked his way up to First Deputy Minister of the Machine Tool Industry and Deputy Chairman of the Moscow Regional Economic Council before assuming the position of general commissar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022009411422372">15</xref></sup> The contrast is instructive. The US pavilion, designed as a vast ‘pleasure dome’ by Edward Durrell Stone, emphasized, in Robert Haddow's words, ‘men's gadgets, women's fashions, and the American way of life’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022009411422372">16</xref></sup> The Soviet pavilion, an aluminum and glass parallelepiped designed by a team of relatively young Moscow-based architects, contained displays that were, as British design expert Catherine Cooke recalled many years later, ‘straightforwardly factual, showing concrete technical and scientific achievements … with photographs of Soviet people doing their work and enjoying the new amenities of their socialist environment’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022009411422372">17</xref></sup> But what was the thinking that went into the selection and design of the displays? How, to reiterate Sharon Macdonald's central question about museums, was the pavilion ‘produced’ such that Sputnik would become its ‘trump card’?</p>
<p>The production of the Soviet pavilion began in June 1956 with the appointment by the State Committee on Economic Affairs of Ryzhkov as general commissar and M.V. Nesterov of the USSR Chamber of Commerce as his assistant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022009411422372">18</xref></sup> Aside from selecting the winning design from among submissions for the pavilion, the most noteworthy activity during the initial phase consisted of the two meetings of general commissars from the Soviet bloc countries, one in Prague (16–17 July 1956) and the other in Moscow (20–22 August 1956).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022009411422372">19</xref></sup> Who initiated these meetings is not clear, but according to a letter of instructions (<italic>direktivnoe pis'mo</italic>) from the Soviet Minister of Foreign Trade I. G. Kabanov to Ryzhkov, their purpose was to coordinate political aims, architectural styles and participation in conferences, theatrical productions and international scientific and artistic displays.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022009411422372">20</xref></sup> The prevailing assumption seems to have been strength in unity, for it certainly was not in numbers. Comparatively few to begin with, the socialist ‘camp’ soon dwindled to three (the USSR, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, with Yugoslavia being socialist but not in the camp) when expenses proved prohibitive or just not worth bearing for the expected payoff. Recent analyses of the Czechoslovak and Hungarian pavilions cast doubt on the persistence of coordination with Moscow, and nothing I saw in Soviet archives suggests otherwise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022009411422372">21</xref></sup>
<fig id="fig1-0022009411422372" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Entrance to the Soviet pavilion, Brussels Exposition 1958. (See colour version in the plate section.).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022009411422372-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>But the salient point is that from the very beginning, Soviet organizers saw the World's Fair in terms of the Cold War rivalry between two systems, and demanded equal treatment for theirs. They only accepted a reduction in the space allotted to their pavilion from 30,000 to 25,000 square meters when Belgian authorities assured them that they would restrict the US pavilion to the same size.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022009411422372">22</xref></sup> But matching the West and particularly the US in other ways would be difficult. ‘This exhibition,’ wrote Ryzhkov in a letter to Soviet Minister of Finance Zverev in July 1956, ‘will be more complicated than an industrial fair because: a) of the complexity of issues concerning politics, technology, industry, science, economics, culture, art, the struggle for peace, etc., and b) we must show how in the USSR material and moral benefits are guaranteed and how successes in these areas compare to capitalist countries’. Nesterov, addressing a meeting of ministerial and departmental representatives on 1 September, reiterated Ryzhkov's point ‘that this exhibition is special because here two economic systems – socialist and capitalist – will compete and the foreign press will be discussing this with complete candor’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022009411422372">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>How to meet the challenge? Iakov Lomko, head of the Soviet Information Bureau, drew upon both personal experience and recent events in addressing a meeting in May 1957 hosted by Ryzhkov. ‘We must acknowledge’, he told the meeting,
<disp-quote>
<p>that simply advertising our achievements will not have the intended effect on foreigners … especially after the Twentieth Party Congress when the shortcomings that we revealed in order to move forward more successfully became the center of gravity of imperialist propaganda against the USSR.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Lomko advised that the main emphases should be Soviet democratism, the country's rising standard of living, and its struggle for peace, but warned that ‘we must not ‘varnish' [reality]. We must admit to our problems’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022009411422372">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Such advice, though, was hard to follow for those whose who had made their careers by ‘varnishing’ and who instinctively rebelled against washing dirty linen in public. The thematic plan that the organizers wrote for the exhibit contained virtually no admission of problems. Consisting of four themes – the USSR as a socialist, multi-national, peace-loving state; the achievements of industry, agriculture and transportation; the development of a socialist culture; and the growth of material well-being – it celebrated achievements predictably and monochromatically.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0022009411422372">25</xref></sup> Between October 3 and November 15, 1957 – coincidentally, the period encompassing the launching of Sputnik I and II – the plan was scrutinized by a consultative council consisting of some 30 prominent architects, artists, writers, scientists, representatives of public organizations and ministerial bureaucrats. Their criticisms and suggestions for revision as well as the responses by Ryzhkov and his staff comprise a laboratory for the Soviet pavilion's production.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0022009411422372">26</xref></sup> The proposals that appear to have had the most far-reaching consequences came from Vasilii Dmitrievich Zakharchenko, chief editor since 1949 of the popular science magazine <italic>Tekhnika – molodezhi</italic> (Technology for Youth) and a cosmic enthusiast <italic>par excellence</italic>. Submitted on October 5, 1957, the day after Sputnik's historic flight, they insisted upon a fundamental reorientation of the Soviet Union's self-presentation by emphasizing above all that cosmic event. They therefore deserve special attention.
<fig id="fig2-0022009411422372" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Vasilii Dmitrievich Zakharchenko (1915–1999) Russkaia fantastika, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rusf.ru/fc/d0008.htm">http://www.rusf.ru/fc/d0008.htm</ext-link>. (See colour version in the plate section.).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022009411422372-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Zakharchenko leveled four major complaints against the thematic plan. First, instead of a hymn to the new Soviet man/person and his contribution to world culture, it stressed the ‘depersonalized fruits of labor – machines, mechanisms, and construction sites’. Such had been the bread and butter of Stalin-era propaganda but times had changed. He suggested presenting ‘realistic but lively’ biographies of people from varied walks of life – workers, students, artists, disabled veterans – and, echoing Lomko, urged the organizers not to be afraid to show difficulties, ‘even failures. Only then will we be believed!’ Second, the exhibits resembled each other too much in terms of color, materials, lighting and furnishings, causing attention to wane. Third, the explanations of exhibits suffered from mono-tonality. ‘We, the host, must not only ‘broadcast' but also smile, joke, engage in conversation, and not assume the role of a schoolteacher’, Zakharchenko admonished. Finally, and crucially, the experienced propagandist asked ‘What is the highest achievement of Soviet science and industry?’ and immediately answered his own question: ‘the sensational flight of Sputnik.’ Sputnik had to be recognized as ‘the top of the pyramid of all scientific, technological, and industrial development’ and everything – displays of computers, metallurgy, chemistry, radiotechnology, etc.  should follow from it (‘<italic>sleduet postroit vse</italic>’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0022009411422372">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The phrasing of Zakharchenko's criticisms and suggestions is reminiscent of the razzamatazz of Madison Avenue. But in terms of content, the idea of highlighting technological achievements was well within Communist ideological orthodoxy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0022009411422372">28</xref></sup> Zacharchenko was hardly the first to link such achievements to the fulfillment of the Soviet dream of a classless, and conflictless, modernity. Earlier antecedents included GOELRO, the plan from the early 1920s to electrify the new Soviet state according to Lenin's slogan ‘Communism is Soviet power plus electrification of the whole country’, and Stalin's forced-pace industrialization program of the 1930s. Even before the first Sputnik blasted off into space, organizers planned to festoon the pavilion with technological marvels that would include the ‘Lenin’ icebreaker (the first nuclear-powered surface vessel), the world's largest synchrophasotron (proton accelerator), and – before it turned out to be impossible to accommodate on the Expo's Heysel Park grounds – the giant TU-114 turboprop, largest aircraft in the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0022009411422372">29</xref></sup> What Zakharchenko's memo did was to make manifest the importance of Sputnik as a symbol around which everything else would orbit.</p>
<p>Zakharchenko came honestly by his cosmic enthusiasm. Not long after he assumed the editorship of <italic>Tekhnika – molodezhi</italic>, he serialized in it his own ‘Journey to Tomorrow’, a tale of space exploration. Traveling at speeds of up to 8 km per second, the author (disguised as ‘Engineer V. Dmitriev’) visits Tsiolkovskii Island, a space station in orbit around the Earth. The satellite, a gigantic carousel ‘about which we, Soviet people, have heard so much’, serves as a means for interplanetary communication. It also sustains a ‘cheerful collective’ that grows its own fruit and vegetables and keeps in touch with the latest news on Earth via radio and color tele-cinematic transmissions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0022009411422372">30</xref></sup> In subsequent years, readers of Zakharchenko's journal visited other places in the cosmos many of them illustrated with fantastical drawings that appeared on the cover.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0022009411422372">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Zakharchenko's insistence on making <italic>Sputnik</italic> the center of attention struck responsive chords within the organizing committee. In January 1958 its revised program garnered the approval of the Council of Ministers and the following month, the State Committee under Politburo member Anastas Mikoian issued its imprimatur. By this point Zakharchenko had authored a brochure, ‘Face to Face with the Cosmos’, for distribution at the Exhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0022009411422372">32</xref></sup> He also assumed the position of editor of the Soviet pavilion's newspaper, appropriately named <italic>Sputnik</italic>, which started its run of 20 issues with the opening of the Exhibition on April 17 1958. Printed in Liège in 800,000 copies, <italic>Sputnik</italic> introduced ‘Beep Beep’: ‘Any newborn tells the world of its existence with a cry,’ the inaugural issue explained. ‘I conformed to this tradition and hardly had I appeared, when I cried “beep-beep”. The entire planet heard my voice. What is the secret of my popularity? I serve humanity and progress … . Let's drop the formalities. You can call me Beep Beep.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0022009411422372">33</xref></sup> The gimmicky tone of the text and the playfulness of the accompanying graphics typified the enterprise, in effect, practicing what its editor had preached to the organizers. From low to high brow (Dmitri Shostakovich on David Oistrakh's performances of the composer's works, Sergei Eisenstein's ideas on film) with even a bit of cheesecake thrown in (some risqué drawings accompanying an article about the Soviet publication of the Flemish-language novel, <italic>Thyl Ulenspiegel</italic>), <italic>Sputnik</italic> was hardly an ordinary Soviet newspaper.</p>
<p>But then, offered in five languages (English, French, German and Flemish as well as Russian) <italic>Sputnik</italic>'s intended audience was hardly Soviet either. ‘The newspaper must become the focus of attention and interesting to broad layers of the Belgian intelligentsia and large numbers of cultural activists from other countries,’ Zakharchenko stated in a report written on the eve of the Exhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0022009411422372">34</xref></sup> Broad its coverage was, especially in the area of technology. ‘The Great Siberian Rivers Will Water the Deserts of the South,’ announced one article on the (never to be realized) river-diversion projects then being debated. Nuclear-powered airplanes, children expecting to be passengers on rockets to the moon, and Sputnik III – these and other features made for an attractively produced version of a dynamically modern Soviet Union, a country whose modernity was literally out of this world.</p>
<p>In his book that sounded the alarm about the Soviet ‘cultural offensive,’ Frederick Barghoorn noted that an article appearing in <italic>Pravda</italic> on February 6 1958 foreshadowed their ‘strategy for the fair.’ ‘Clearly,’ he wrote, ‘the Kremlin regarded the fair as an opportunity to display to 50–60 million visitors Soviet achievements which had already acquired unprecedented prestige as a result of the sputniks’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0022009411422372">35</xref></sup> What Barghoorn failed to mention was the loopback effect. While organizers of the pavilion did their best to produce awe-struck visitors at the Exhibition, the Soviet propaganda apparatus was busy reproducing an idealized version of visitors' reactions for an even larger audience back home.</p>
<p>‘So, what are the most interesting exhibits in the industrial section?’ the assistant director of the pavilion, Mikhail Chernikov, was asked on the eve of the Fair's opening by a reporter from the popular journal <italic>Nauka i Zhizn'</italic> (Science and Life) ‘It's hard to say,’ he replied. ‘There will be the model of Magnitogorsk; the Stalingrad hydroelectric station, the synchropoasotron and the nuclear icebreaker. Let me not forget to mention the Chaika and the three-axle ZIL-157 truck … . But of course all attention will be on the first Sputniks.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0022009411422372">36</xref></sup> Chernikov proved correct. ‘One could say without any exaggeration,’ wrote <italic>Pravda</italic>'s special correspondents on the opening day ‘that from the very first hours our artificial satellite is the highlight of the World's Fair. One feels enormous patriotic pride for our socialist Motherland,’ they continued, thanks to its ‘leading role in scientific and technological progress … . Everywhere one hears expressions of surprise, approval, and delight.’ A photograph a week later showed a crowd gazing intently and pointing at the second of the Sputnik replicas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0022009411422372">37</xref></sup> The pride proved infectious. It ‘overflows the heart,’ exclaimed <italic>Ogonek</italic>'s special correspondent, who added that not until foreigners heard the sound of ‘beep, beep’ from space ‘did they believe that we have intercontinental missiles’. ‘Here, it is the Sputniks that are stationary and the people who orbit around them,’ observed Boris Agapov.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0022009411422372">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>If the Sputniks were children of the socialist Motherland, what about their paternal lineage? V. Rodionov, the assistant artistic director of the pavilion, noted the old drawings and models of Tsiolkovskii that surrounded the Sputniks. He described them as the Sputniks' ‘grandfathers and great-grandfathers’. As for the father, one only had to lift one's gaze from the spherical metallic objects to encounter at the opposite end of the pavilion's ground floor a larger-than-life statue of Lenin. ‘Lenin and Sputnik form the main compositional element of the pavilion's central axis,’ Rodionov told a reporter. ‘Their mutual position carries the idea of the Soviet pavilion – the inseparability of technical and social progress.’ That is, ‘the technical achievements that Sputnik embodies are the result of the great social struggle that the genius of Lenin advanced and led’. Lastly, one should not forget the role of ‘the comradely labor of thousands of factories and dozens of combines’ that enabled the Sputniks to fly ‘at an unheard of speed to unseen heights’. And ‘when in the Hall of Science the visitor learns that the number of scientific workers in the USSR rose from 10,000 in 1914 to 260,000 in 1957 and the number of scientific institutions from 289 to 2756, he [sic] will know that only as a result of this could Sputnik be born’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0022009411422372">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>So the Soviet people were supposed to feel proud of their country, inspired by its revolutionary past, and grateful to the many who either through their labor or thanks to the application of what they learned in higher educational institutions contributed directly to the success of Sputnik. As for the future, it was possible to imagine people living on the moon and visiting Mars before the end of the century, wrote Zakharchenko, drawing on his fantasist experience. For the best ‘living predictor of this future remains the sphere with the mustachioed antennae’. But what did Sputnik mean in the here and now to Europeans, especially the fortunate ones who visited the Soviet pavilion? Zakharchenko contended that Sputnik had caused a ‘real revolution in Europeans' imaginations about us, the Soviet people’. That 83 kilogram aluminum ball with the long moustaches was like a ‘bomb that exploded in the consciousness of the man in the street (<italic>obyvatel'</italic>) causing him to think: “Wait a minute. If these Bolsheviks can do this, they must have a huge advantage, not in how they dress but in the general direction of their scientific and industrial development”’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0022009411422372">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Zakharchenko reported seeing an advertisement in a movie theater that showed a beer bottle traveling around the globe (‘Drink Sputnik beer – best in the world.’). In Antwerp he came across a carousel named ‘Sputnik.’ He also noticed or was told about women wearing hairpins in the shape of the aluminum ball with the antennae as clasps. Was he mocking the kitschness of it all – capitalists trying to appropriate Sputnik for their own grubby commercial purposes – or proud that a Soviet object had made its way into the everyday lives of Europeans? Probably both.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0022009411422372">41</xref></sup> In addition to his personal observations, Zakharchenko larded his account with selected quotations from the comment books placed at the entrance to each section of the pavilion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0022009411422372">42</xref></sup> Bourgeois newspapers proved to be another useful source. He and other reproducers cited the praise lavished on the pavilion as a whole by Brussels' <italic>Le Soir</italic> and <italic>Volks-Gazet</italic>. The Catholic daily <italic>La Cité</italic> provided good copy as well, referring to the Sputnik exhibit as the Expo’s ‘greatest show’ with a ‘crowd around it all the time, especially Americans’. These and other reviews were assiduously collected by the pavilion’s staff, arranged for translation into Russian, and made available for reproduction in Soviet publications.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0022009411422372">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>Actually, the staff did more than clip, translate and make available the articles. They also provided analysis for higher authorities. One such assessment of the Belgian press interpreted criticism of the Soviet pavilion as part of a campaign organized by Russian émigré and reactionary Hungarian circles to slander the country. Such anti-Communist groups did attempt to mount demonstrations, distribute leaflets and otherwise take advantage of the Soviet presence at the Exhibition, but the attribution to them of less than flattering comments in the newspapers suggests either ignorance or paranoia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0022009411422372">44</xref></sup> In truth, few reviews were entirely positive or negative though many reflected preconceived, stereotypical ideas of the Russian or Soviet character. Soviet staffers' laborious collection, translation, and periodic assessment of them demonstrate a need to document both bourgeois slander and bourgeois respect.</p>
<p>But why? What value did these statements – favorable and critical – have for Soviet propagandists? Notwithstanding their own assertions of technical dynamism and superiority, the exercise smacks of both a lingering sense of inferiority (as if the country's achievements were not being given their fair due in the bourgeois public sphere where it mattered most) and of insecurity (as if foreign praise were required to persuade a skeptical Soviet public). They also may reflect reproducers' difficulty in being able to predict or shape western reaction. Ever since the initial Soviet announcement of <italic>Sputnik</italic>'s maiden voyage, alarm at the military implications had been mixed with awareness of and fascination with the unprecedentedness of venturing into space.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0022009411422372">45</xref></sup> But these reactions did not necessarily line up with political orientation or affinity. Nor did they exhaust all possible responses. The ability of commercial enterprises to deploy the Soviet achievement for their own purposes threatened to domesticate it in ways that could blunt its propagandistic effect. The ‘cultural offensive’ clearly could be played by more than one side.</p>
<p>As for the comment books, these typically contained brief responses, sometimes only a few lines or words, numbering in the tens of thousands. Analyzed by staffers and culled by propagandists, they present to the historian a methodologically challenging source. Quantifying them would be a Herculean task and even then yield data of questionable utility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0022009411422372">46</xref></sup> One might divide them into thematic categories (political, technical, aesthetic, etc.) but that hardly could convey irony or forcefulness of expression, seriousness or levity and relevance to what was on display. Qualitative interpretation, while also hardly unassailable, at least can accommodate analysis of these kinds of responses and more generally appropriation by the viewer of what was on view.</p>
<p>In what follows I treat viewing and responding to the Sputnik replicas and other objects on display in the Soviet pavilion as a form of consumption, and therefore, following Daniel Miller and other anthropologists of material culture, as acts of ‘creative appropriation’ constitutive of cultural specificity and difference.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0022009411422372">47</xref></sup> But unlike the Coca Cola that Miller tells us thirsty Trinidadians consume and have adapted to their local universe of sweet drinks, Sputnik was hardly part of everyday life. Much like the Belgian beer company, the carousel operator and hairpin manufacturer, individual visitors adapted Sputnik by making the unfamiliar familiar, by giving it local meanings – only their meanings tended to be more personal. If Zakharchenko and other Soviet propagandists could employ Sputnik as a symbol of Soviet technological superiority, ‘humanity and progress,’ then visitors could ‘spin’ Sputnik in their own direction. However, not everyone who took up a pen to make a comment was equally creative. Arguing that ‘decodings do not follow inevitably from encodings,’ Stuart Hall posited three hypothetical positions among viewers: dominant-hegemonic, negotiated and oppositional.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0022009411422372">48</xref></sup> One finds evidence of all three among visitors' remarks.</p>
<p>‘An appeal: Fight for peace and inspire the peoples of the Middle East to destroy Israel,’ someone identifying him/herself from ‘Antwerpen-Beirut’ wrote in one of the guest books. The comment seemingly had nothing to do with anything in the pavilion; it might have been prompted by nothing more than the availability of a pen and paper and a great deal of anger at Israel. Then again, the author may have appealed to the USSR not only because of its professed commitment to peace, but also as a result of its seemingly miraculous ability to best the West (and especially the United States, then emerging as Israel's strongest ally) at what historically had been its own game. If this were so, it could be interpreted as evidence of the Soviet Union's hegemonic power; if not, then it should be understood as a negotiated position, <italic>viz.</italic> ‘a mixture of adaptive and oppositional elements’ that ‘acknowledges the legitimacy of the hegemonic definitions … while, at a more restricted, situational level, … makes its own ground rules.’ Other comments appearing in the same book had a very different political bent and seem unambiguously oppositional: ‘Budapest – oh, my country!’; ‘Where are the concentration camps in Siberia?’; and from someone from ‘USA, God's country,’ ‘Beautiful lies: Where is the churches? (sic).’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0022009411422372">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many visitors, however, were moved to congratulate the USSR on the success of its space program, expressing ‘admiration’ and offering ‘best wishes’ and ‘peace.’ Two congratulated Laika, the canine occupant of Sputnik II, perhaps as a tongue-in-cheek gesture or because they were unaware that the dog had not survived. Displays of Soviet art and automobiles provoked expressions of ‘ridicule’ and puzzlement as to the point, given American pre-eminence, but this was not the case with the Sputniks. Invoking friendship and peace in relation to an object launched with an ICBM reproduced the very associations intended by Soviet propagandists thereby reflecting the USSR's hegemonic-dominant position in the emerging space race. Not all comments inspired by Sputnik would have pleased Soviet authorities, though. For example, one visitor observed none too subtly that if ‘your people’ were given ‘a higher standard of living with the speed of Sputnik, there would be no more Communists’. More thoughtful was the following comment by a resident of Liège:
<disp-quote>
<p>I am surprised by what I have seen. I doubt that everything is as great in the USSR as you want to show. Without a doubt your scientific achievements are impressive, but I am sure that the standard of living is not as high as you claim, proof of which is the fact that very few have the right to travel to western countries. I hope, however, that improvement will come … .<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0022009411422372">50</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Soviet authorities probably interpreted these responses as evidence of incorrigible bourgeois prejudice, but like that of the Lebanese visitor already cited, they may represent a ‘negotiated version of the dominant ideology … shot through with contradictions’ that Sputnik managed to make visible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0022009411422372">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>In September 1958, one month before the Brussels Exhibition closed, the Vienna Trade Fair opened its doors. It too had a Soviet pavilion containing two Sputnik models – whether the very same as exhibited in Brussels is not clear. According to the <italic>Arbeiter Zeitung</italic> hundreds of visitors streamed past the replicas every hour, some with expressions of doubt on their faces and others of delight and wonder. Of the 271 who penned comments in the pavilion's guest book some 36 (15 per cent) referred explicitly to the Sputniks. Some, as in Brussels, were impressed. A few – such as the person who wrote, ‘To live in the cosmos is impossible; we were created to live on earth.’ – were not. At least one visitor noted the contradiction between the USSR's ability to send a ball into space but not to feed its population adequately, while another – evidently a disgruntled wife or child – appropriated Sputnik to settle scores with ‘my old man’. ‘Sputnik I liked the best,’ s/he wrote, ‘and I want to put [him] in it and send him to the moon.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0022009411422372">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>The July 1959 Soviet exhibition in New York also included models of sputniks, but they evoked proportionately fewer comments and the majority of those mentioning the objects did so in perfunctory terms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0022009411422372">53</xref></sup> Could it be that less than two years after the launching of the first Sputnik its propagandistic value was beginning to fade? Was the Western public already becoming jaded? More to the point, how did the propagandists of Soviet space triumphs such as Zakharchenko perceive the Western (non-) reaction and how did they make their perceptions known? Is it possible, in short, that the launching of Yuri Gagarin into space in April 1961 was inspired as much by the desire to recapture the awe that had greeted Sputnik at Brussels as to advance cosmonautic research? More historical research would seem to be necessary to answer these questions.</p>
<p>In 1960 the Paris-based Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) awarded Moscow the right to host a World’s Fair in 1967 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. The Soviet government set aside 520 hectares in Teplyi Stan in the southwestern part of the capital, but after more than two years of intensive planning, informed the BIE that it had decided against hosting the event, at which point an earlier bid by Montreal was accepted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0022009411422372">54</xref></sup> Before it changed its mind, though, the government announced a competition to design a structure for the Fair's main entrance. Among the entries that survive in the archives, the most elaborate was submitted by Heinz Kolbe, a resident of the Saxon town of Grossenhain in the German Democratic Republic. A printer by trade, Kolbe also happened to be secretary of the local German-Soviet Friendship Society. His proposed structure, judging by the accompanying drawing, resembled the Eiffel Tower in its open iron grillework, although his tower had neon advertisements and a hotel rather than restaurants on the landings of the first and second levels. The crowning glory, though, consisted of another hotel perched on top of the moon which was cradled by the sloping roof of the tower. And what might the shape of that hotel be? Let us give Comrade Kolbe the last word:
<disp-quote>
<p>Dear comrades,</p>
<p>On 26 November 1960 I heard on the radio in the GDR about the World's Fair. Comrade Günter Leischner said to all listeners to send proposals for the main entrance to the Moscow city administration. In October 1959 I had the good fortune of visiting the Soviet Union and was delighted by the gigantic construction of Communism I saw in Moscow and Leningrad. After much thought, I have come to the conclusion that the most appropriate symbol for the Exhibition must be Sputnik with the Soviet star resting on steel supports.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0022009411422372">55</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>At least someone, it seems, could not get enough of Sputnik and the days of glory with which it was associated.</p>
<p>This essay has been about how the Soviet Union represented itself to both a foreign audience and its own citizens back in the USSR by highlighting its technological achievements and, above all, its successes in space. It has argued that no effort was spared to produce a persuasively attractive version of the country and its peoples and to reproduce for Soviet citizens the impression that version made on the some 30–35 million visitors who toured its pavilion. In the tradition of the Potemkin villages and perhaps of socialist realism too, the intent was not so much to distort reality as to display an idealized or ‘higher’ version of it in the hope that doing so would inspire people to work toward making the extraordinary become more ordinary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0022009411422372">56</xref></sup> Coinciding with the moment of supreme international prestige for the Soviet Union, Expo '58 provided the occasion for using technological success to make people believe this was possible. There is little to suggest that foreign visitors who were not already favorably disposed changed their attitudes towards the USSR based on what they saw or experienced, though considerable evidence suggests their creative appropriation of the display.</p>
<p>As for Soviet citizens, the materials at my disposal did not enable me to determine much at all about how they responded to or consumed this message. But we might take note of a reference to Sputnik in a letter of complaint filed by 100 residents of a Leningrad apartment building that had long since seen better days. Writing in 1958, 13 years after the end of the Great Patriotic War, they noted that ‘during this time in our native land there occurred an enormous improvement of life. Two artificial earth satellites were launched! … And our building remains without change, not improving, but rather worsening’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0022009411422372">57</xref></sup> If these Leningraders were any indication, ordinary Soviet citizens were also capable of spinning Sputnik in their own direction, in this case, using it instrumentally to shame housing authorities into making repairs. And since those repairs eventually did get done, albeit three years later in 1961, one might even say Sputnik benefited them, though not in the way the propagandists in Brussels seemed to assume it would.</p>
