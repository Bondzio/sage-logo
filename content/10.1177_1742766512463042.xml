<p>Jack Lule is Professor and Director of Global Studies and Professor and Chair of Journalism and Communication at Lehigh University. In this book he addresses the concepts that have defined the core of his field of study over the past two decades, realizing that they are neither easily understandable nor easily understood. Lule has ‘come to believe that few forces are more powerful in this world than globalization and media’ (p.x). Yet, he notes that his 18-year-old son, who has spent his entire life in the world of participatory media and alleged globalization, doesn’t even know what those words mean. The book is meant to popularize a better understanding of such terms – one instructed by scholarship.</p>
<p>The book begins with the profiles of four people, who, in different times and places, have been able to contribute to changing the world through media: Martin Luther, who led the Protestant Reformation in the 1500s thanks to the metal movable type printing press; Oprah Winfrey, who in the 1970s, thanks to her intellectual and speaking abilities, rose from poverty to become one of the most successful television hosts on the planet and build a media empire; Kevin Carter, a journalist whose photograph of a starving little girl made Western people aware of the famine that was plaguing Sudan in 1993; and Wael Ghonim, a computer engineer who, in 2011, used social media such as Facebook and YouTube to expose the atrocities committed by the regime of Hosni Mubarak, which sparked the outbreak of the Arab Spring in Egypt after it had started in Tunisia. These examples allow Lule to make the fundamental argument that globalization is a process carried out, through production and consumption of media products, by every person in the world.</p>
<p>Lule claims that globalization is not an achieved state, but is, indeed, an ongoing process that started when humankind began to live in more or less structured societies. Hence, using a number of examples, Lule defies some of the metaphors embedded in public discourse over globalization: globalization, he claims, is not typical of our era, it is not an ‘unstoppable force’, and, so far, has proved to be neither a ‘rising tide that lifts all boats’ nor a ‘benefactor’ (pp.25–27). The author also questions the idea that globalization creates a ‘clash of civilizations’ (p.125), ‘cultural convergence’ (p. 128) or ‘cultural hybridity’ (p.132). Everywhere in the world, Lule argues, there are examples of all of these phenomena.</p>
<p>As the book’s subtitle suggests, Lule’s analysis of the relationship between globalization and media pays tribute first to Marshall McLuhan’s insight that the electronic media – radio and, most of all, television – would make the world a smaller place, a global village. Throughout the book, Lule argues that McLuhan’s prediction has come true. However, he rejects the ‘imaginary of the technological sublime’ (p.59) and doesn’t share the enthusiasm that followed from McLuhan’s first ‘declinations’ of the global village. Actually, Lule also credits Lewis Mumford and his vision that the global village would become, not a place of harmony, but one where differences, divisions and conflicts would be strengthened because of a new struggle over capital and power fought through the use, and thanks to the availability, of the newest media. This is the pivotal argument of the entire book: that, even in light of the revolution brought about by the digital media, both McLuhan and Mumford were proved right. The world has become a global village, but is so fragmented that it is like the biblical Tower of Babel.</p>
<p>Another central argument Lule makes is that globalization and media are inseparable. Globalization would have never happened without the aid of media messages – be they oral, script, printed, transmitted electronically or encoded digitally. At the same time, Lule points out, media industries – first and foremost, media conglomerates – profit from economic globalization and provide other kinds of corporations with a wide set of tools to advertise their products effectively on a global scale, while ignoring the huge challenges still faced by at least one billion people on the planet.</p>
<p><italic>Globalization and Media</italic> does not advance any radically new interpretation of the relationship between globalization and media. The argument that globalization is a process started thousands of years ago, made possible and evolved thanks to media, is not particularly original. On the other hand, Lule does not claim to make a revolutionary contribution to the theoretical frameworks used to address globalization and its connection to media. The author does not pretend to coin a new theory, nor does he claim paternity of the idea of linking the current outcomes of globalization processes to the metaphor of the Tower of Babel. The book is definitely an interesting and coherent long essay on the topic – particularly effective, if we consider the huge undertaking of addressing such a broad subject and the fact that it is written in a style that makes it enjoyable even for an uninitiated readership.</p>
