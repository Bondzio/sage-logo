<sec id="sec1-1744987111424560" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>New cancer treatments and long-term care have increased the number of people living with advanced cancers. Most cancer coping research has focused on adjustment to diagnosis and treatment. However, the lack of research on the relationship among personal resources, social support and advanced cancer coping strategies prompted this study. Knowledge of patients’ perception of social support and coping with advanced cancer is helpful for health professionals to provide interventions that will promote patients’ wellbeing.</p>
<p>Advanced cancer in this paper is referred to as cancer that cannot be cured and has usually spread from where it started to other parts of the body. But not all advanced cancers are metastatic. For example, some cancers that start in the brain may be considered advanced because they are not curable and are life-threatening even though they have not spread to other parts of the body. In the same way, not all metastatic cancers are necessarily advanced cancers. Some cancers, such as testicular cancer, may spread to other parts of the body but may still be curable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111424560">American Cancer Society, 2010</xref>). This ‘advanced’ category of cancer has specific characteristics (progression of the disease, multifactorial and changing symptoms, high emotional impact as well as wellbeing as the main treatment objective) that distinguish it from other cancer phases, and includes patients first diagnosed as well as those in whom the disease has progressed because of failing primary treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744987111424560">Schröder and Comas, 2000</xref>). Advanced cancer can greatly affect patients’ physical, emotional and behavioural condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987111424560">Haylock, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987111424560">Kutner and Kilbourn, 2009</xref>). Therefore, nurses caring for these patients must be able to ease the impact of advanced cancer, helping individuals to cope with it.</p>
<sec id="sec2-1744987111424560"><title>Coping with advanced cancer</title>
<p>Advanced cancer patients have to cope with multiple challenges, threats, harms and even loss that require continuous efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987111424560">Fitch, 2005</xref>). The way patients cope might impact on patient adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744987111424560">Zabalegui, 1999</xref>). Patients with advanced cancer use a combination of coping strategies to deal with the stressors associated with the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987111424560">Franks and Roeschs, 2006</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987111424560">Dunkel-Schetter et al. (1992)</xref>, coping with cancer includes two types of strategies. The first focuses on the problem: when trying to change the stressor by dealing constructively with the problem that is causing the distress, such as seeking advice from a health professional or taking pain medication. The second focuses on the emotions: when trying to regulate the emotions by changing the meaning of the stressor, such as positive thinking, avoidance, distancing or self-controlling. In this way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987111424560">De Faye et al. (2006)</xref> found that advanced cancer patients used less problem-focused coping for existential issues and fewer emotion-focused strategies for physical stressors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1744987111424560"><title>Social support in advanced cancer</title>
<p>Since the early 1970s, social support has been studied and encouraged as a main social resource. Social support is perceived as an individual’s awareness of environmental and interpersonal relationships that offer the resources of attachment, social integration, opportunity for nurturance, reassurance of self-worth as a person and in role accomplishments, and assistance and guidance provided as informational, emotional and material help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1744987111424560">Weinert and Brandt, 1987</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111424560">Devine et al. (2003)</xref> concluded that patients particularly require social support to respond to the heightened need for verbal and physical expression of affection that occurs in advanced phases of cancer. Moreover, in a systematic review of social support and cancer progression, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987111424560">Nausheen et al. (2009)</xref> suggest that the evidence of the relationship between social support and cancer progression is sufficiently strong for breast cancer. Besides, emotional support is associated with better physical and psychological health, and usually buffers the damaging psychological impacts of major life events and chronic events such as cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111424560">Alferi et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, we can say that there is evidence to substantiate the positive effect of social support in coping with advanced cancer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1744987111424560"><title>Need for studying social support and coping in advanced cancer</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987111424560">Dunkel-Schetter et al. (1987)</xref> found that members of an individual’s social network may influence the way an individual copes. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987111424560">Hopkinson (2007)</xref> found that the pattern of self-action strategies adopted by each advanced cancer patient depends on the personal and contextual resources available. The relationship between social support and coping has been studied in patients with early-stage lung cancer and their family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987111424560">Downe-Wamboldt et al., 2006</xref>), in patients with irritable or inflammatory bowel syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987111424560">Jones et al., 2006</xref>), in high-risk pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987111424560">Giurgescu et al., 2006</xref>), in HIV-positive men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987111424560">Tate et al., 2006</xref>), in patients with myocardial infarction (Kristofferzon et al., 2005) and in old age psychosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111424560">Berry et al., 2006</xref>). However, there is a lack of knowledge about this relationship in advanced cancer, which shows there is a need to explore it further.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1744987111424560" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>A descriptive correlational design was used to analyse the research question: What are the relationships between demographic and medical variables, perceived social support, and coping strategies in patients with advanced cancer?</p>
<sec id="sec6-1744987111424560"><title>Theoretical framework</title>
<p>The transactional model of stress and coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744987111424560">Lazarus and Folkman, 1984</xref>) was used to guide this study, where coping is defined as ‘constantly changing cognitive and behavioural efforts to manage specific external and/or internal demands that are appraised as taxing or exceeding the person’s resources’ (p. 141). These authors identified two types of coping: emotion-focused and problem-focused. Emotion-focused coping regulates the emotional response to stress and is directed at changing the meaning of the stressful situation, while problem-focused coping involves strategies used for solving a problem.</p>
<p>Within this model, social support and demographic variables, antecedents of coping, are defined as resources that can influence coping strategies and adaptation to stressful life events such as advanced cancer. Therefore, advanced cancer patients’ personal resources (age, gender, educational level, income …) and their perception of social support may influence problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744987111424560">Figure 1</xref>).

</fig></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1744987111424560"><title>Sample and setting</title>
<p>Participants were recruited from two hospitals in the metropolitan area of New York, a city hospital (Bellevue Hospital) and a private hospital (New York University Medical Center). Medical oncologists identified a total of 191 individuals who met the eligibility criteria, and invited them to participate in the study. All participants were 18 years of age or older, able to read English, had a Karnofsky Performance Scale score higher than 50, had been diagnosed with advanced cancer, and were receiving chemotherapy as a palliative treatment. The final sample included 132 patients, representing 69% of the patients asked to participate. Those who did not finish the study informed the investigators that they could not complete the questionnaires because their physical condition had worsened between the first contact and the time the survey was completed.</p>
<p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of both hospitals. After providing written informed consent, participants completed measures of demographic and medical data, perceived social support and coping 2 weeks after their chemotherapy treatment. The three questionnaires were filled out by participants at their homes and returned by mail.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1744987111424560"><title>Instruments</title>
<p>Personal Resource Questionnaire-85 (PRQ85) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1744987111424560">Weinert and Brandt, 1987</xref>) is a self- administered measure of an individual’s perceived social support. Part 2, which was used in this study, is a 25-item, seven-point Likert scale that measures the respondent’s level of perceived social support. The total score is the sum of the items with a positive range from 25 to 175. Higher scores indicate increased levels of perceived social support. This scale has an adequate internal consistency (Cronbach alpha of 0.87) and validity.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987111424560">Dunkel-Schetter et al. (1992)</xref> revised the Ways of Coping Inventory (WOC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744987111424560">Lazarus and Folkman, 1984</xref>) and adapted it for cancer patients as the Ways of Coping Inventory – Cancer Version (WOC-CA). The WOC-CA is a 53-item scale that measures a broad range of behavioural and cognitive coping strategies that an individual might use to deal with problems associated with cancer. The instrument consists of five subscales: seeking and using social support, focusing on the positive, distancing, cognitive escape–avoidance and behavioural escape–avoidance. <italic>Seeking and using social support</italic> is an effort to establish interactions with people who could provide informational, tangible and emotional support and then actually using them. <italic>Behavioural escape–avoidance</italic> is a physical effort made to avoid dealing with the stressor or to escape through delayed or risky behaviour. <italic>Cognitive escape–avoidance</italic> is a mental effort to avoid dealing with the stressor or to escape through fantasising or dreamlike thinking; this concept includes wishful thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987111424560">Lazarus, 1993</xref>). <italic>Distancing</italic> is an effort to deal objectively with the stressor by minimising the significance of the event, and has also been referred to as detachment and disengagement by some authors. <italic>Focusing on the positive</italic> is an effort to perceive the stressor with a constructive attitude; other authors have referred to this construct as positive thinking or positive reappraisal.</p>
<p>Participants were asked to complete the WOC-CA by indicating how often they had tried a particular strategy in the previous 6 months. On a five-point Likert-scale format, responses ranged from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). A score was obtained for each of the five subscales. Scoring involved adding up the ratings for the scale items. Reliability (coefficient alpha) was 0.86 for seeking and using social support, 0.85 for focusing on the positive, 0.78 for cognitive escape–avoidance, 0.80 for distancing and 0.74 for behavioural escape–avoidance. The validity of the WOC-CA instrument was supported by a group of experts from several cancer centres.</p>
<p>The Demographic Information Sheet was used to obtain data about the participants. Items included age, gender, race, marital status, education, income, employment and religion. In addition, the investigators completed a medical data form, based on the participants’ medical records, to obtain information on the primary tumour site, cancer stage, time since diagnosis, type of chemotherapy currently being received, prior cancer treatments and location of metastasis. Data were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 12.0). Relationships between variables were considered significant at a level of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>

<p>This study was designed to investigate the relationship between demographic and medical variables, perceived social support and coping mechanisms in advanced cancer patients receiving chemotherapy treatment. A voluntary sample of 132 patients agreed to participate in the study and completed the Personal Resource Questionnaire, the Ways of Coping Inventory – Cancer Version and a Demographic Information Sheet. The sample consisted of 88 women and 44 men. Participants ranged in age from 33 to 83 (mean = 60.24, standard deviation = 11.78). Most of the participants were less than 65 years old (58%). The sample was relatively homogeneous with regard to ethnicity (Caucasian, 86%); married (63%) and living with their spouses (48%); retired (38%) or working full-time (32%); and of Roman Catholic (39%) or Jewish (35%) faith. Most of the sample had an educational level beyond high school (67%) and an annual income below US$50,000 (60%). The most frequent primary tumour sites were breast (27%), ovary (18%), lung (13%) and colorectal (11%). The average time since the initial cancer diagnosis was 13 months. All participants were undergoing palliative chemotherapy and had completed an average of 16 chemotherapy cycles. The most frequently reported chemotherapy side effects bothering the study participants were fatigue (77%), hair loss (59%), constipation (50%), shortness of breath (46%), tingling or numbness of extremities (46%), nausea (46%) and pain (43%).</p>
<p>Although the literature reports adequate reliability levels of the scales used, each of the instruments used in this study was tested for internal consistency. The alpha coefficients for most of the subscales demonstrated levels of internal consistency above the minimum of 0.70, as recommended; however, the scales of cognitive and behavioural escape–avoidance had alpha coefficients of 0.66 and 0.60, respectively.</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics were compiled for the study variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987111424560">Table 1</xref>). The results showed that most of the subjects in the study had good social support and used different coping strategies simultaneously to deal with the stressful aspects of advanced cancer. The coping strategy used most was distancing (on average, 24.8% of subjects’ total coping efforts), followed by cognitive escape–avoidance (22.2%), seeking and using social support (21.6%) and focusing on the positive (19%). Behavioural escape–avoidance was the coping strategy used the least (12.4%). Sixty-five percent of the cases had distancing scores higher than the 50th percentile, whereas only 4% had behavioural escape–avoidance scores higher than the 50th percentile.

<p>The number of chemotherapy treatments was only negatively related to perceived social support, indicating that individuals with more chemotherapy side effects perceived that they had less support. Besides, income level was positively related to perceived social support. These results indicate that, as income increased, perceived social support also increased. Moreover, perception of health was also positively related to perceived social support (<italic>r</italic> = 0.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), so, as the perception of good health status increased, perceived social support increased.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1744987111424560"><title>Demographic/medical variables and coping</title>
<p>As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744987111424560">Table 2</xref>, age was significantly related to behavioural and cognitive avoidance, focusing on the positive, seeking and using support, and chemotherapy side effects. These results indicate that, as age increased, participants sought and used less social support; used less avoidance and focused less on the positive; and had fewer chemotherapy side effects. The level of education was found to be significantly related to cognitive avoidance, and to seeking and using social support. Therefore, as educational level increased in the study sample, cognitive avoidance decreased and seeking social support increased. Income level was positively related to seeking and using social support. These results indicate that, as income increased, seeking and using social support also increased.</p>
<p>Interestingly, participants’ perception of their health status (with a higher score indicating good perception of health) was significantly associated with most variables. Perception of health was positively related to distancing (<italic>r</italic> = 0.36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), focusing on the positive (<italic>r</italic> = 0.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), education (<italic>r</italic> = 0.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and income (<italic>r</italic> = 0.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), and was negatively related to the time since diagnosis (<italic>r</italic> = −0.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), chemotherapy side effects (<italic>r</italic> = −0.18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and cognitive avoidance (<italic>r</italic> = −0.19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Therefore, as the perception of good health status increased, distancing, focusing on the positive, education and income increased, whereas time since diagnosis, cognitive avoidance and chemotherapy side effects decreased.</p>

<p>Finally, it is necessary to point out that, although the results indicate weak correlations in general, the measures were mainly Likert scales with robust psychometric properties, and low correlations could be indicative of greater effect than would be the case if the same correlations were derived from more precise instrumentation based on ratio variables.</p>

<p>The scores for perceived social support were distributed in the range of 27 to 135, while the possible range varied from 25 to 175. Although patients with low levels of social support were represented, most of the study participants perceived high levels of social support, because the distribution of perceived social support scores was negatively biased and 63% of the participants had perceived social support scores over 100 (50th percentile). The mean (101.52) and standard deviation (21.49) for the perceived social support scores in the study sample were similar to those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1744987111424560">Sollner et al. (1999)</xref> in melanoma patients in stages I and II. The perception of social support in this study was higher than expected for advanced cancer patients, because the literature supports the idea that, as cancer progresses, social support decreases due to the duration of treatments. Social support is essential to help patients deal with the shock of the diagnosis. Although social environment may be a source of stress, because in many cases patients have to answer the questions of family members, friends, co-workers or neighbours regarding test results or cancer progression, in our study none of the participants identified problems with family or friends as a source of stress related to advanced cancer. Social support also provides vital resources the individual can draw upon to survive or flourish until the end, whether this means cure or death. It is usually assumed that being embedded in a social network is essential for people to feel good about themselves and their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1744987111424560">Sollner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987111424560">Ohaeri et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111424560">Devine et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Income correlated positively with perceived social support, and with seeking and using social support. Patients with low income levels perceived that they had less social support, and sought and used less social support, than patients with high income levels. The low-income patients may have been immigrants who did not have social support in New York City, whereas high-income patients were non-immigrant and in many cases had relatives and friends who worked nearby. Moreover, as educational level increased in the study sample, cognitive avoidance decreased and seeking social support increased. These latest findings are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987111424560">Drageset and Lindstrom (2005)</xref>, who concluded that education level was the most important contributor to social support and a low level of education was related to greater use of cognitive hostile defence. Cancer patients with a low level of education could be in need of professional support to gain appropriate knowledge about the disease and its progression, especially if those patients are struggling to cope effectively.</p>
<p>Gender differences between men and women were identified. Men perceived that they had less social support than women, a finding consistent with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987111424560">Krohne and Slange, 2005</xref>). The cancer literature reports that women with cancer have more confidants and engage in more intimate, emotional and self-disclosing relationships than men with similar diagnoses; men engage instead in more task-oriented behaviours (problem-based) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111424560">Neff and Karney, 2005</xref>). The lower perception of social support among men may be associated with the threat cancer represents to the role of provider and worker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987111424560">Kristofferzon et al., 2003</xref>), thus making it difficult for men to receive support only within family relationships. This is consistent with the absence of gender differences in the use of the coping strategy seeking and using social support found in the study sample. Thus, although men perceive that they have less social support than women, this perception does not induce men to seek more social support. Consequently, men with advanced disease constitute a subset of cancer patients who are especially prone to perceiving low levels of social support. Therefore, when developing interventions to promote adjustment, it is necessary to help men use social support and ensure that their needs for communication, information and support from professionals are not overlooked.</p>
<p>Participants rated their perceived health status in a single question with responses ranging from 1 (very poor) to 5 (excellent); thus, higher scores were associated with a better perception of health. Health status was negatively related to cognitive escape–avoidance and was positively related to perceived social support, distancing and focusing on the positive. As theoretically expected, the perception of health as good was associated with a high perception of social support, distancing, focusing on the positive, income and education. A poorer health status may limit advanced cancer patients’ chances of developing and maintaining social networks. In addition, a reciprocal effect may occur; lack of social support may contribute to health deterioration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111424560">Devine et al. (2003)</xref> suggest that social support provides a buffer against the negative association between avoidance and psychological adjustment in advanced cancer.</p>
<p>Perceived social support was significantly related to focusing on the positive and seeking and using social support, indicating that individuals with high levels of perceived social support tend to focus more on the positive and seek more support. However, perceived social support was unrelated to emotion-based coping mechanisms (cognitive and behavioural escape–avoidance and distancing). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111424560">Devine et al. (2003)</xref> also reported, in patients at various cancer stages, perceived social support to be negatively related to avoidance coping, a relationship not found in this study. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987111424560">Giurgescu and her collaborators (2006)</xref> have found that participants who reported higher levels of social support also reported low levels of uncertainty and less use of avoidance.</p>
<p>As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987111424560">Lazarus (1993)</xref>, these findings may reflect aspects of the western lifestyle, with a strong tendency to regard problem-focused coping as more successful than emotion-focused coping. Studies have shown that patients who use more problem-focused coping show better adjustment and experience fewer psychological symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987111424560">Bennett and Cornell, 1999</xref>). Besides, this study evaluates the perception of social support, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111424560">De Leeuw and colleagues (2000)</xref> identified negative and positive influences of social support. These authors concluded that, while the availability of support seemed to be beneficial regardless of the situation, the effect of received support was equivocal, because it was found to be associated with more depressive symptomology in head and neck cancer patients.</p>
<p>There is evidence that avoidance coping has adverse effects, whereas looking for social support and optimism are considered positive coping mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987111424560">Carver et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987111424560">Kutner and Kilbourn, 2009</xref>). In advanced cancer patients, social support appears to be useful mostly as a source of emotional coping rather than information or tangible support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987111424560">Lichtenthal et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The patients in this research may have benefited from using distancing coping, and from perceiving high levels of social support, because of their reasonably good performance status. Despite the poor prognosis associated with the patients’ advanced stage, their clinical condition still allowed most of them to work. Thirty-two percent of the study subjects were working full-time, while 10% were working part-time and 38% were retired. Working facilitates the process of gaining distance from the emotional stress of the disease, provides evidence of one’s value to society and creates opportunities for social contact.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1744987111424560"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>When considering the implications of this study, the limitations imposed by convenience sampling should be taken into account. The study findings cannot be generalised beyond patients with characteristics similar to those included in the sample. The study findings are also limited by the wide range in the number of treatment cycles received and in the time since the diagnosis of cancer; nevertheless, this variable range is reduced considerably when the time since patients presented with advanced cancer is considered (2–10 months).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1744987111424560"><title>Conclusions and recommendations</title>
<p>In this sample of patients with advanced cancer receiving chemotherapy, there was a significant low positive relationship between perceived social support and seeking and using social support, and focusing on the positive. There was also a significant positive relationship between perceived social support, income and perception of health status. Also, women perceived that they had more social support than men.</p>
<p>This study has contributed to a better understanding of the theoretical connections between perceived social support and coping mechanisms in advanced cancer patients. Based on the findings of this study, future research should design and test nursing interventions to enhance social support and investigate how and why perceived social support differs between men and women.</p>
<p>Finally, when caring for patients with advanced cancer, health professionals need to consider the following: patients with low levels of perceived social support should be closely monitored, and, if possible, awareness of available social support resources should be enhanced. It is also important to assess specific coping strategies individuals use to cope with their disease.</p>
