<p>Dyslipidemia and hepatic overproduction of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) are hallmarks of the septic response, yet the underlying mechanisms are not fully defined. We evaluated the lipoprotein subclasses profile and hepatic VLDL assembly machinery over 24 h in fasted LPS-treated rats. The response of serum non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and glucose to endotoxin was biphasic, with increased levels of NEFA and hypoglycemia in the first 12 h-phase, and low NEFA and high glucose in the second 12 h-phase. Hypertriglyceridemia was more marked in the first 12 h (6.8-fold), when triglyceride abundance increased in all lipoprotein subclasses, and preferentially in large VLDL. The abundance of medium-sized VLDL and the increase in the number of VLDL particles was higher in the second phase (10-fold vs 5-fold in the first phase); however, apoB gene transcript abundance increased only in the second phase. Analysis of putative pre-translational mechanisms revealed that neither increased <italic>Apob</italic> transcription rate nor increased transcript binding to mRNA stabilizing HuR (Hu antigen R) protein paralleled the increase in apoB transcripts. In conclusion, endotoxin challenge induces increases in plasma NEFA and large, triglyceride-rich VLDL. After approximately 12 h, the triglyceride-rich VLDLs are replaced by medium-sized, triglyceride-poor VLDL particles. Hepatic apoB mRNA abundance also increases during the second period, suggesting a role for apoB protein expression in the acute reaction against sepsis.</p>

<p>Gram-negative sepsis is an increasingly clinical syndrome triggered by exposure to bacterial LPS or endotoxin. To fight the infection and restore homeostasis, the organism produces a systemic reaction controlled by pro-inflammatory cytokines and Kupffer cell products, the so-called acute-phase response (APR), that can ultimately lead to pathological condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425910390722">1</xref></sup> In addition to modifications in circulating acute-phase proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425910390722">2</xref></sup> and altered glucose homeostasis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425910390722">3</xref></sup> increased plasma lipid levels provide a well-known marker in septic patients, clinically defined as ‘lipemia of sepsis’ (reviewed by Khovidhunkit et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425910390722">4</xref></sup>). The rise in circulating lipids is mainly caused by a rapid accumulation of triglycerides (TG) within very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), although other lipids such as non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) coming from peripheral tissue lipolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425910390722">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425910390722">5</xref></sup> or cholesterol, in the case of rodents, can also be elevated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425910390722">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is increasingly believed that sepsis-induced hypertriglyceridemia represents an innate immune reaction against infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425910390722">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425910390722">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425910390722">8</xref></sup> Both <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425910390722">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425910390722">10</xref></sup> and <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425910390722">11</xref></sup> studies have demonstrated that all lipoprotein classes are able to bind LPS, through their phospholipid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425910390722">11</xref></sup> or apolipoprotein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425910390722">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425910390722">12</xref></sup> components, in such a way that lipoprotein-bound LPS is subsequently cleared from the circulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425910390722">8</xref></sup> Most of the LPS-binding ability corresponds to high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425910390722">10</xref></sup> however, when levels of VLDL are increased and HDL diminished, as may occur in endotoxemia, the binding appears to shift towards VLDL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425910390722">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425910390722">13</xref></sup> and partially depends on interacting with apolipoprotein B (apoB).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425910390722">12</xref></sup> Therefore, higher secretion levels of VLDL of any size may be regarded as a protective mechanism against infection.</p>
<p>The sepsis-associated increase in plasma VLDL–TG levels is ascribable both to inhibited peripheral clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425910390722">4</xref></sup> and increased hepatic secretion of VLDL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425910390722">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753425910390722">15</xref></sup> The assembly and secretion of VLDL in hepatocytes seems to occur in two steps (reviewed by Gibbons et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425910390722">16</xref></sup>). First, during translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, nascent apoB associates with lipids provided by the essential chaperone microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). Second, additional lipids, primarily TG, and other apoproteins are added to form the nascent fully lipidated VLDL particles. The <italic>Apob</italic> gene has been considered to be constitutively expressed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753425910390722">17</xref></sup> and VLDL assembly regulation as a post-transcriptional event. However, numerous studies have shown changes in hepatic apoB mRNA levels under a variety of inflammatory conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425910390722">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753425910390722">19</xref></sup> In rats, we found that apoB mRNA levels increased in periportal and perivenous hepatocytes in response to LPS injection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425910390722">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753425910390722">20</xref></sup> and that exposure of primary hepatocytes to LPS-stimulated Kupffer cell-conditioned medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753425910390722">15</xref></sup> or to individual or combined pro-inflammatory cytokines led to augmented apoB mRNA expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753425910390722">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753425910390722">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425910390722">22</xref></sup> We hypothesized that, during the APR, transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation affecting apoB mRNA levels might occur supplying more apoB competent for VLDL assembly, given that apoB secretion was enhanced in all cases. One aspect of this regulation could be the modulation of mRNA stability through <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements residing in the 5-′ and 3′-untranslated regions (UTR) and adequate RNA binding proteins. HuR is one of the most important proteins with a described role in stabilizing inflammatory AU-rich elements (ARE)-bearing RNAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753425910390722">23</xref></sup> Interestingly, and supporting our hypothesis, it was found that the human apoB mRNA contains ARE at 5′ and 3′ UTR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753425910390722">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although extensive studies have been carried out to clarify the involvement of sepsis-promoted changes in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in the APR, changes in lipoprotein-subclass lipid profiles and the impact of the metabolic background on the mechanisms underlying hepatic VLDL overproduction have not been fully established. We show that there are two metabolic phases during acute endotoxemia which are characterized by systemic fuel switching, specific lipid transport profiles and VLDL features. We also show for the first time that the elevation in the hepatic apoB transcript encompassing the late response is secondary neither to a higher transcription rate of apoB gene nor to a superior binding of apoB mRNA to the stabilizing HuR protein.</p>

<p>Lipopolysaccharide from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O11:B4 and BSA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). [α-<sup>32</sup>P]-dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-<sup>32</sup>P]-UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (UK). ApoB cDNA was provided by Dr M.P.

<p>Female Sprague–Dawley rats (180–200 g), obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Barcelona, Spain), were housed in temperature controlled rooms with a 12-h light–dark cycle and provided standard AO4 rodent chow (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain) and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. After 1 wk of acclimatization, at the end of the dark period of the light–dark schedule, rats were randomly divided into 16 groups and injected intraperitoneally with LPS (1 mg/kg body weight in 0.3 ml saline) or with saline alone. Food was withdrawn at the time of injection since LPS alters food intake in rodents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753425910390722">25</xref></sup> After 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 18 and 24 h of treatment, rats were anesthetized, blood samples were collected by superior vena cava puncture and centrifuged (1300 <italic>g</italic>, 15 min, at 4°C) to obtain serum. Livers were removed, rinsed in ice-cold PBS, weighed and either used immediately or stored at –80°C until analysis. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1753425910390722"><title>Serum biochemistry</title>
<p>Serum was used immediately to measure triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL-C, glucose and albumin (M. Lafita, Getxo, Spain). NEFA and ketone body concentrations were determined using commercially available kits (Wako Chemicals Inc., Richmond, VA, USA). Insulin concentration was measured at Reference Laboratory (Barcelona, Spain) by immunoradiometric assay.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1753425910390722"><title>Analysis of serum lipoprotein lipid profile</title>
<p>Serum lipoproteins were analysed by a computer-assisted online dual enzymatic method for the simultaneous quantification of total cholesterol and triglycerides in 20 HPLC-separated lipoprotein fractions at Skylight Biotech Inc. (Akita, Japan) according to the procedure described by Usui et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753425910390722">26</xref></sup> The HPLC system consisted of an AS-8020 autoinjector, CCPS and CCPM-II pumps, and two UV-8020 detectors (Tosoh, Japan). An SC-8020 system controller (Tosoh) was used for instrument regulation and data collection. Aliquots (10 µl) of serum, were injected into two tandem connected TSK gel LipopropakXL columns (300 × 7.8-mm; Tosoh). The column effluent was split equally into two lines by a Micro-Splitter P-460 (Upchurch Scientific Inc., Oak Harbor, WA, USA) in order to achieve simultaneous determination of lipids from a single injection. Concentrations of total cholesterol and triglyceride were calculated by comparison with total area under the chromatographic curves of a calibration standard of known concentration. The particle size of lipoproteins was estimated by the elution time of the column and appropriate size markers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753425910390722">26</xref></sup></p>

<p>We observed that serum albumin, a negative acute-phase protein, decreased by 10% from 16 h onwards and that the hepatic mRNA levels for the positive acute-phase protein α<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin was 215-fold times higher after 24 h of LPS injection than in control animals (data not shown), confirming that LPS had induced the septic reaction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425910390722">Figure 1</xref>A shows that LPS led to a rapid and sustained rise in serum TG levels. The TG concentration increased about 2-fold as early as 2 h after treatment, it peaked at 8 h with more than a 6-fold rise and maintained nearly 2-fold differences up to 24 h. Moderate (∼20%), though significant, decreases in HDL-C were registered at 18 h and 24 h of LPS challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425910390722">Figure 1</xref>B), although total cholesterol concentration was not altered at any of the test times (data not shown).

Both substrates returned to baseline at 12 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425910390722">Figure 1</xref>C,D), and from 16 h onwards and at least until 24 h, NEFA always remained below control levels although hyperglycemia was recorded. The level of ketone bodies was significantly decreased by LPS compared with their corresponding fasted control from 12 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425910390722">Figure 1</xref>E). The concentration of insulin was higher in LPS-treated animals from 8 h onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425910390722">Figure 1</xref>F).

Two different metabolic backgrounds are, therefore, associated with the initial septic response in fasting rats: switching from NEFA to glucose after 12 h of endotoxin contact, with low levels of ketone bodies and elevated insulin in the second phase.

<p>Although there are some studies characterizing the lipoprotein lipid profiles in sepsis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425910390722">11</xref></sup> further research is needed in this area.

Three subclasses were defined for VLDL (large, medium and small), four for LDL (large, medium, small and very small) and five for HDL (very large, large, medium, small and very small). The TG level increased in all lipoprotein classes, and, as expected, VLDL particles were the major contributors to hypertriglyceridemia with rises of 8.2-fold and 3.2-fold at 8 h and 18 h, respectively. However, there were differences in the peaking fraction. In the NEFA-phase (8 h), the greatest VLDL-TG increase was found in large VLDL (9.2-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425910390722">Figure 2</xref>B). After 18 h of LPS treatment, the peak shifted to medium and small VLDL particles (∼4.2-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425910390722">Figure 2</xref>B). Likewise, the increase in LDL–TG was associated with all LDL subclasses, at both times peaking in the largest lipoprotein subclass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425910390722">Figure 2</xref>B). Note that the so-called ‘large LDL’, together with ‘small VLDL’, corresponds, by density, to intermediate-density lipoproteins. Triglycerides also rose in all HDL lipoprotein subclasses. The largest increase, 7.3 times at 8 h corresponded, once more, to very large HDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425910390722">Figure 2</xref>B).

<p>Total cholesterol increased in large and medium VLDL both in the NEFA- and glucose-phases, with the largest rise (4.7-fold and 2.7-fold after 8 h and 18 h) being associated with large VLDL. As shown by serum biochemistry, HDL-C levels fell, concomitant to decreases in all HDL subclasses. Results obtained from analysing the lipoprotein lipid profile indicate that hypertriglyceridemia is associated with lipoprotein subclasses of different sizes during the course of the APR. The highest TG increase was found in the NEFA-phase associated mainly to 44–64 nm VLDL and small-dense LDL, while the rise observed in the glucose-phase, was less pronounced and peaked in smaller 31–37 nm VLDL particles.</p>

<p>Based on apoB quantities in isolated (d &lt; 1.006 g/ml) serum VLDL, the 8.2-fold rise in VLDL–TG was linked to a 5-fold elevation in the number of circulating VLDL particles at 8 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425910390722">Figure 3</xref>A). Increases were recorded both in apoB48 (4.5-fold) and, to a greater extent, in apoB100 (8-fold); whereby the apoB48:apoB100 ratio decreased from 3 in controls to 1.8 in LPS-injected rats. At 18 h, the number of VLDL particles increased 10-fold; the increase was also higher in VLDL containing apoB100 (14-fold) than in apoB48 (8-fold), the apoB48:apoB100 ratio dropped from 2.7 in controls to 1.5 in LPS-treated animals. Interestingly, the lipid mass carried by each endotoxic VLDL particle is phase-specific, as can be inferred from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425910390722">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425910390722">3</xref>.

<p>We next addressed whether the increases in serum VLDL apoB were accompanied by changes in hepatic levels of apoB mRNA by measuring transcript levels 8 h and 18 h after administering LPS. Although no change was observed in the NEFA-phase, the level of apoB mRNA was 60% above time-matched controls after 18 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425910390722">Figure 3</xref>B), which might be expected to provide a greater apoB supply for VLDL assembly.

<p>Sepsis leads to a wide spectrum of endocrine and metabolic alterations including drastic changes in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, which are considered to be part of the innate reaction against infection. Our aim was to asses the metabolic background and factors contributing the sepsis-promoted VLDL abundance and to analyse specific changes in lipoprotein subclass profiles and the hepatic VLDL assembly machinery. We show that there is a biphasic response to endotoxin in systemic fuels: a NEFA-abundant phase with 5-fold increases in circulating VLDL particles and 8-fold increases in VLDL-TG is followed by a glucose-abundant period with higher increases, 10-fold, in the number of VLDL particles in blood, each one carrying much less TG.</p>
<p>Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia have been reported to occur in response to endotoxin. As a dose- and time-dependent change, both carbohydrate utilization and glucose production are activated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425910390722">3</xref></sup> The marked hypoglycemia registered in our study between 2–8 h in rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425910390722">Figure 1</xref>D), which was also found in septic mice,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1753425910390722">32</xref></sup> may indicate that hepatic glycogenolysis/gluconeogenesis compensate insufficiently for enhanced glucose uptake and utilization by peripheral tissues in this extreme situation. In parallel to hypoglycemia, there was a sustained rise in the serum NEFA pool, most likely as a result of the well-known sepsis-associated adipose tissue lipolysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425910390722">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425910390722">5</xref></sup> Afterwards, blood glucose levels increased. It has been recognized that both stimulation of gluconeogenesis and reduced uptake of glucose by peripheral tissues are behind septic hyperglycemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425910390722">3</xref></sup> We detected increases in insulin levels during the second 12-h period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425910390722">Figure 1</xref>F) that, together with increased glucose levels, represent the well-documented sepsis promoted insulin resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1753425910390722">33</xref></sup> An increased use of fatty acids, together with poor lipolysis activation could lead to the low NEFA levels observed in the second 12-h period. The low level of ketone bodies present in the plasma of endotoxic rats in the second period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425910390722">Figure 1</xref>E) possibly points to diminished hepatic β-oxidation rates, in agreement with the reported suppressed acyl-CoA synthetase mRNA, mitochondrial activity and carnitine acyltransferase I expression by endotoxin treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1753425910390722">34</xref></sup> As a result, the available NEFA are directed away from mitochondrial oxidation and are used for TG synthesis for VLDL secretion.</p>
<p>Circulating NEFA and hypertriglyceridemia peaked after 8 h of endotoxin contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425910390722">Figure 1</xref>). As expected, this was associated with a rise in VLDL-TG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425910390722">Figure 2</xref>A). Circulating NEFA pool is the major contributor to hepatic VLDL–TG secretion in postprandial (61%) and fasting (81%) states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1753425910390722">35</xref></sup> During acute inflammation, adipose tissue lipolysis is activated by pro-inflammatory mediators providing NEFA for increased hepatic triglyceride synthesis and, therefore, promoting VLDL secretion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425910390722">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1753425910390722">36</xref></sup> Thus, in the first hours of our study using fasting animals, increased NEFA delivery to the liver is likely to be one of the main drivers behind hepatic VLDL overproduction and, hence, septic hypertriglyceridemia.</p>
<p>The 8-fold increase in circulating VLDL-TG in the NEFA-phase, was mainly associated to large, TG-rich VLDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425910390722">Figure 2</xref>B). Hussain et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1753425910390722">37</xref></sup> proposed that the N-terminus of apoB acquires neutral lipids in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane forming nucleation sites, whose number can be increased by augmented TG synthesis and MTP. Accordingly, whenever large amounts of TG are synthesized in the liver, as is likely to occur in septic hepatocytes during the NEFA-phase, more nucleation sites are expected to be generated in apoB. Moreover, lipid abundance is known to protect apoB from degradation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1753425910390722">38</xref></sup> This would result in an increased hepatic secretion of triglycerides in TG-rich VLDL particles, which would accumulate in the circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425910390722">Figure 2</xref>B), even in the absence of augmented levels of hepatic apoB mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425910390722">Figure 3</xref>) and MTP mRNA and activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425910390722">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Two findings mark differences in the second, glucose-abundant phase of endotoxemia: (i) that apoB gene transcript expression increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425910390722">Figure 3</xref>B), which would provide the additional apoB moiety necessary to enhance even more VLDL-apoB secretion; and (ii) that a low NEFA pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425910390722">Figure 1</xref>) would produce decreases in the TG synthesis rate and, therefore, in VLDL–TG secretion. The liver might then be expected to secrete TG-poor VLDL particles actively. In line with this consideration, we found a substantial decrease in TG content per circulating VLDL particle (as inferred from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425910390722">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425910390722">3</xref>), which suggests an accumulation of small, TG-poor VLDL. In previous studies, we stated that hepatocytes isolated from 18-h LPS-treated rats secreted TG-poor VLDL, and, although secretion was highly stimulated, global triglyceride secretion in VLDL remained unchanged.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425910390722">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753425910390722">20</xref></sup> We suggest that, in the second period of the APR, one major, but not the only, mechanism contributing to septic VLDL-associated hypertriglyceridemia was a reduction in the VLDL–TG clearance rate due to lipoprotein lipase inhibition. Several reports have shown suppressed mRNA levels, protein mass and activity of lipoprotein lipase in peripheral tissues at 24 h after induction of sepsis in rats;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1753425910390722">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1753425910390722">40</xref></sup> a situation comparable to our study at 18 h with respect to the metabolic background.</p>
<p>In none of the periods studied did LPS modify MTP mRNA levels or TG transfer activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425910390722">Figure 4</xref>). Despite the crucial role played by this apoB chaperone in VLDL assembly,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425910390722">16</xref></sup> MTP appears in this study as a non-target protein for Gram-negative sepsis. Therefore, in sepsis, hepatic oversecretion of VLDL particles does not seem to be dependent on the TG-transfer capacity of MTP but points more to the availability of triglycerides or apoB in the liver.</p>
<p>In order to ascertain whether the increase in the apoB transcript mass in the glucose-phase was due to a higher transcription rate, we measured the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of apoB mRNA. Indicative of critical up-regulation of acute phase positive proteins, endotoxic rats exhibited an almost 2-fold greater global transcription rate in the liver, but the transcription rate of the apoB gene after 16 h of LPS challenge was similar to that of untreated control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425910390722">Figure 3</xref>C). It cannot be ruled out, however, that transcriptional activation occurred transiently during other stages of the APR.</p>
<p>We then evaluated whether post-transcriptional events could be responsible for raising hepatic apoB transcript levels in the glucose-period of sepsis. One mechanism for modulating mRNA stability is the binding of some proteins to ARE sequences. It has been reported that the ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein HuR stabilizes several ARE-containing inflammatory transcripts, such as those of TNF-α and IL-8.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753425910390722">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1753425910390722">41</xref></sup> It has been stated that 3′-UTR of human apoB mRNA includes ARE sequences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753425910390722">24</xref></sup> By means of bioinformatic analysis, we found that rat apoB transcript (Refseq: NM_019287) also contains some AU-rich regions also present in pro-inflammatory mRNAs such as those of TNF-α and IL-8.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753425910390722">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1753425910390722">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1753425910390722">42</xref></sup> Here, we demonstrate for the first time that HuR binds specifically to rat apoB mRNA, although the specific binding was not enhanced by endotoxin treatment. Consequently, it seems unlikely that apoB mRNA half-life was extended by HuR binding. Regardless of this observation, it may be possible that apoB mRNA is stabilized by binding proteins other than HuR.</p>
<p>Considering that neither apoB transcription rate nor apoB mRNA stability increased in the second 12-h period, the rise in apoB mRNA levels could be attributed to changes in degradation; however, further analysis would be needed to confirm this hypothesis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-1753425910390722" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The data suggest that there may be a difference in the mechanisms and fuels that lead to the increase in serum TG and VLDL levels in different time-phases of the septic response, since we identified biphasic changes in lipoprotein metabolism coinciding with alterations in the metabolic background. Specifically, septic hypertriglyceridemia is accompanied by increased NEFA levels and a rise in large TG-rich VLDL in the early phases of the septic reaction, and by elevated apoB transcript levels and TG-poor VLDL accumulation in a second glucose-rich phase. We have also shown for the first time that endotoxin induced apoB mRNA elevation is not associated with a higher transcription rate or HuR binding in rats.</p>
