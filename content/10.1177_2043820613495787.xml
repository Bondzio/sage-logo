<body>
<p>Elizabeth Povinelli’s latest work, <italic>Economies of Abandonment</italic>, offers a fresh take on some of the more enduring questions regarding critical theory and social justice. While the book pulls on a variety of threads, I want to highlight her insights into the way tense, eventfulness, quasi-event, and sacrificial love provide the grammar with which most normative claims and counterpublics must contend in the context of what she refers to as ‘late liberalism’. By problematizing tense and eventfulness, Povinelli wants to draw the attention of critical theorists to the banal nature of suffering and survival to understand what it means for people to endure. She asks: “how do new forms of social life maintain the force of existing in specific spacings of life? How do they endure the effort it takes to strive to persevere?” (p. 9). But more importantly, she wants to invite discussion about how the capacity to endure might be interpreted as itself resistance and provide a critical rupture that might inspire alternative futures.</p>
<p>Writing a short contribution to a forum such as this on such a rich and thought-provoking book proves difficult. There are numerous applications to my own work with low income communities of color in the American South and urban Scotland with respect to land use, environmental justice, and politics that Povinelli’s analysis invites. Like Povinelli, I am frequently taken with the mere act of endurance that some groups must achieve and accomplish. In particular, I recognized the value of tense, eventfulness, and quasi-event in relation to understandings of racialized poverty before, during, and after Hurricane Katrina, particularly with respect to the ways in which the event of Katrina and the visibility of state abandonment in the Superdome overshadowed the persistence of racialized poverty before and after the storm. The day I sat down to write this contribution, the <italic>New York Times</italic> featured a story on a family who, 7 years after the storm, had yet to procure permits to rebuild their house in the lower ninth ward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820613495787">Robertson, 2013</xref>). When contrasted with the Super Bowl held in the Superdome just weeks earlier, tense, sacrifice, and endurance seem a particularly relevant set of problematics for understanding the urban politics of the post-Katrina landscape in the context of late liberalism. Likewise, as my research in post-Katrina Mississippi showed, the redevelopment process often cast historic low-income African American neighborhoods as sacrifices (without explicitly using that term) to the broader set of ‘opportunities’ that the storm presented. It is a credit to the book and the insights that it contains that so many other examples beyond those she laid out could be usefully (re)thought through tense, eventfulness, and sacrificial love. In addition to the example above, it has already proven a useful framework in my teaching about global governing institutions and structural adjustment, as it helps illuminate the tenets that comprise the teleological grammar of ‘development’.</p>
<p>She is, of course, not the first theorist to inquire into the political possibilities of survival and endurance. The current academic zeitgeist, at least in the discipline of geography, is coalescing around the political possibilities of ‘resilience’, a mantel being held by technocrats and progressive alike (‘sustainability’ redux). Danny MacKinnon and I have argued at length elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820613495787">MacKinnon and Derickson, 2013</xref>) that ‘resilience’ is an insufficient concept for advancing a progressive and transformative politics of survival, insofar as it fetishizes what my collaborator Gehan MacLeod has called ‘taking knock after knock’ and getting up again, without problematizing the broader systems in which some groups must endure while others thrive. Infused as it is with an insistence on the necessity and possibility of the ‘otherwise’ and grounded in a critique of settler colonialism, I find Povinelli’s engagement with the political possibilities of endurance more compelling and promising than praxis that coalesces around ‘resilience’.</p>
<p>Povinelli is an anthropologist by training who, by her own account, is interested in developing and deepening threads in critical theory. Part of what makes her work so interesting and fresh is the insight she draws from her own engagement over 20 years with Indigenous communities in Australia, much of which appears to take the form of friendship, collaboration, and shared knowledge production. This standpoint seems, upon my reading, to be fundamental—that is, inescapably necessary—to facilitating, inviting, and inciting the particular insights she offers in this book. She pulls anecdotally on her experiences with these communities to make points about the trembling of recognition in the face of cultural difference and the everyday nature of survival and endurance. Her own positionality in these narratives is what interests me; she recounts her experiences from the position of a friend and colleague helping out with a move or talking conversationally about the ethical treatment of animals. What she offers is more recognizable as reflection on deep relationships than it is ‘data’ from an anthropological study. By drawing attention to this I do not mean to offer a critique, but rather consider the implications of this epistemological approach for what we might call research praxis. I found myself wanting to have the conversations she was posing in a slightly different, or additional, register.</p>
<p>To that end, the book raised two questions for me. First, I am interested in the relationship between the mode of engagement or the praxis of research that appears to shape Povinelli’s approach to knowledge production and inform her theory building and the ethical and political substance of that theory and knowledge. Put another way, how does friendship and ‘capacitating’ (to use her word) render possible new and different standpoints, and what are the associated ethical and epistemological implications for critical theory more broadly? Second, and related, I am left wondering about the relationship between these approaches to research and the possibilities for bringing about, or at least contribute to the bringing about, of the kinds of ‘otherwise’ or alternative futures Povinelli is so curious about.</p>
<p>There are a host of threads relating to theory building and the ethical praxis of academic research that I’d like to pull on to further illuminate the implications of various responses to the questions I’ve raised. The first is the question of tense, and the way in which tense has been woven through various approaches to radical and critical theory building. While Povinelli makes clear the way in which particular notions of tense and sacrificial love work in relation to narratives of poverty and development as I mention above, I think these critiques might likewise be turned on some strands of radical and critical theory. For example, how might debates in geography and cognate disciplines around neoliberalism and its contestation be understood in relation to tense and eventfulness? How might the ethical practice of theory building be newly understood through the lens of Povinelli’s analysis?</p>
<p>One of the more enduring points of departure in the academic debates about neoliberalism concerns the appropriate scale at which neoliberal capitalism ought to be or is most effectively contested. On the one hand, political economists like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820613495787">Harvey (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820613495787">Brenner et al. (2010)</xref> insist that contestations of neoliberalism hold political economic policy and practice squarely in its sites and organize at the scales at which neoliberal capitalism operates, lest contestations become ‘mere irritants in the global machinery of capitalism’ (2010, 329). By contrast, post-structuralists, post-Marxists, and autonomous Marxists like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820613495787">Gibson-Graham (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820613495787">2006</xref>) and Holloway (2002, 2010) argue the nearly inverse proposition when they make an ethico-political argument regarding the promise of sidestepping structural political economy and remaking the world through everyday interactions. It occurs to me that in relation to these debates and Marxist political economy more broadly, the notions of tense, eventfulness, and sacrificial love might help us better understand the ethico-political implications of various theories of change. What constitutes an ‘event’ in the grammar of political economy, and how should ‘quasi-events’ be understood (or dismissed)? From whom is sacrificial love demanded in competing modes of praxis? What is the ethical substance of these theoretical traditions and their associated theories of change?</p>
<p>On a related note, the book also raised question for me about the act of conducting research and the ethics of ‘resourcing’ or capacitating counterpublics as they seek to transform their endurance into alternative futures. How can, or how should, critical theory and theories of change be accountable to these objectives? What does it mean to adopt a posture of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820613495787">Harvey (1996)</xref> has called ‘critical distance’ in relation to actually existing political organizing? What about critical distance in relation to acts of what Povinelli calls endurance of the general cruddiness of everyday life? These are not meant to be ‘academic’ questions, but rather serious questions regarding the ethical practice and praxis of critical theory building and radical scholarship. Though these are not questions that Povinelli tackles head on, the accounts of her relationships that inform and instantiate her broader theoretical points suggest to me that her work has something important to say about these questions.</p>
