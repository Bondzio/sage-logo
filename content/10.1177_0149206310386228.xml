<abstract>
<p>The resource-based view suggests that firms’ heterogeneous resource endowments are important for explaining interfirm performance differences. To date, however, the literature provides little insight on the factors that shape the identification of markets in which firm resources, as embodied in a product or service, can create value for end customers. Building on entrepreneurship research and Penrose’s early resource-based work, the authors examine how four main types of pre-entry human capital endowments (i.e., the characteristics that the founders bring to the founding process) shape the identification of market opportunities for emerging technology firms. They find that prior entrepreneurial and management experience endowments enhance, while marketing and technological experience endowments constrain, the number of market opportunities identified. In addition, the authors find that the number of market opportunities identified depends on the combinations of generalized and specialized endowments in the founding team.</p>

<p>An extensive theoretical and empirical literature has helped to shape our understanding of how firms’ heterogeneous resource endowments contribute to organizational value creation and interfirm performance differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206310386228">Afuah, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206310386228">Amit &amp; Schoemaker, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206310386228">Barney, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310386228">Penrose, 1959</xref>). Yet, although this literature has provided numerous substantial insights into the role of resources in achieving above-normal performance outcomes, it is surprising that we possess hardly any knowledge on a particularly important element of the resource–performance link, that is, the <italic>identification</italic> of markets in which firm resources can create value for end customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206310386228">Kor, Mahoney, &amp; Michael, 2007</xref>). In this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310386228">Penrose’s (1959)</xref> distinction between the firm’s resources and the services those resources can render for customers is important because the causal linkage between resources and the services that these resources can render for end customers is not given <italic>ex ante</italic>. Rather, it relies on the creative and subjective insights of the firm’s agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206310386228">Alvarez &amp; Busenitz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206310386228">Danneels, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206310386228">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206310386228">Kor &amp; Mahoney, 2004</xref>). Reinforcing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206310386228">Schumpeter’s (1934)</xref> depiction of entrepreneurs as the economic agents who imagine new combinations of economic value creation activities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310386228">Penrose (1959</xref>: 34) argued that “the decision to search for opportunities is an enterprising decision, requiring entrepreneurial intuition and imagination and must precede the ‘economic’ decision to go ahead with the examination of opportunities.” As this emphasis on the perhaps unique abilities of the entrepreneur already suggests, not all agents seem to possess equal abilities in the conceptualization of opportunity.</p>
<p>In this article, we build on early research in the resource-based literature that acknowledges entrepreneurial creativity as an intrinsic part of the resource-based framework. To develop our argument, we emphasize two core insights of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310386228">Penrose’s (1959)</xref> work: (1) that resources are upstream from the end product—that is, they can transcend a variety of final-product applications in different markets—and (2) that such resource fungibility allows agents to identify what Penrose calls the firm’s <italic>productive opportunity set</italic>, “which comprises all of the productive possibilities that its ‘entrepreneurs’ see and can take advantage of” (p. 31). As is typical for innovative activities, the identification of this opportunity set is highly contingent on the agent’s <italic>subjective</italic> perception of which services the firm’s resources can render for which types of markets. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310386228">Penrose (1959</xref>: 42) states,
<disp-quote>
<p>If we can discover what determines entrepreneurial ideas about what the firm can and cannot do, that is, what determines the nature and the extent of the “subjective” productive opportunity of the firm, we can at least know where to look if we want to explain or to predict the actions of particular firms. . . . We are on the trail of the theory of the growth of the firm.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This article addresses Penrose’s call for research into the construction of the firm’s subjective opportunity set by developing and testing an innovative theoretical framework that examines how the preexisting knowledge and experience endowments of firm founders affect the identification of market opportunities for their emerging firms’ technological resources. By providing an in-depth examination of two main types of <italic>educational endowments</italic> (education level, educational specialization) as well as four commonly encountered types of <italic>work experience endowments</italic> in venture teams (in technology, marketing, management, entrepreneurship), we significantly extend prior research that suggests that that novice and experienced firm founders systematically differ in their opportunity identification behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206310386228">Baron &amp; Ensley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206310386228">Gruber, MacMillan, &amp; Thompson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0149206310386228">Ucbasaran, Westhead, &amp; Wright, 2009</xref>). For instance, Baron and Ensley show that important <italic>qualitative</italic> differences exist in what novice and experienced founders consider an attractive business opportunity, whereas our companion study indicates significant differences in the <italic>quantitative</italic> number of opportunities identified. Experienced founders identify a larger number of opportunities prior to launching the firm than their novice counterparts do. Notably, our earlier results also show that those founders who identify a larger number of opportunities also create more successful ventures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206310386228">Gruber et al., 2008</xref>). Since the number of opportunities identified seems to have a key effect on the subsequent performance of new ventures, the present articles seeks to “peel back the layers” in order to better understand the chain of antecedents to technology venture performance, thereby adding a possible causal thread to extant research as well as adding an important theoretical component to the resource-based view. Hypotheses are tested with negative binomial analyses on a sample of 133 technology start-ups backed by venture capital (VC).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310386228">Penrose (1959</xref>: 25) observed that the
<disp-quote>
<p>services yielded by resources are a function of the way in which they are used—exactly the same resource when used for different purposes or in different ways and in combination with different types or amounts of other resources provides different service.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Subsequently, many scholars have noted that firm resources lie upstream from the end product and transcend any particular product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206310386228">Danneels, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206310386228">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206310386228">Prahalad &amp; Hamel, 1990</xref>). Because a firm’s resources are distinct from the products in which they are embodied, they may be utilized in a range of applications for different market domains and thereby form a firm’s opportunity set. As an illustration, consider the example of a young European technology firm that developed a new form of plastic that had the property of remaining water resistant while in use but could also be dissolved once a reagent was added to the water. In brainstorming sessions, the manufacturer identified multiple applications for its innovative plastic—ranging from diapers to humidity sensors to agricultural films—that correspond to different types of market opportunities that the founders could potentially exploit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206310386228">Jolly, 1997</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0149206310386228">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The choice of which of the identified market opportunities to pursue is likely one of the most fundamental decisions founders of technology ventures take during the gestation stage of their firm, as the market defines the competitive arena in which the venture seeks to become a viable organizational entity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206310386228">Abell, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206310386228">Michael, 2008</xref>). Because market opportunities vary along key dimensions such as life-cycle stage, market size, and industry structure (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206310386228">Lien &amp; Klein, 2009</xref>), firm founders who identify a larger market opportunity set prior to first entry are in a better position to select a market environment that offers more favorable conditions for establishing the emerging firm. This idea of market selection corresponds to the biological concept of <italic>habitat selection</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206310386228">Rosenzweig, 1981</xref>), a term that we borrow for the present article. The evidence obtained by biologists (e.g., in studies on avian species) shows that selection of the appropriate habitat over space and time enhances the probability of survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206310386228">Block &amp; Brennan, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206310386228">Klopfer &amp; Ganzhorn, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>The underlying notion that choice among alternative options is important for arriving at superior outcomes is also evident in the social sciences. As mentioned above, the companion study to this article shows that founders who identify multiple market opportunities prior to first market entry significantly outperform those who identify only a single opportunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206310386228">Gruber et al., 2008</xref>). Beyond this result drawn directly from entrepreneurship research, other social science literatures also suggest the importance of choice in decision making:</p>

<title>The Role of Founders’ Pre-Entry Knowledge and Experience in Market Opportunity Identification for Technological Resources</title>
<p>Although the ability to choose from more than a single market opportunity has been shown to have key performance implications in new firm creation, research indicates that founders seldom take alternatives into account. One of the most graphic examples has been offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206310386228">Shane’s (2000)</xref> study of the commercialization of a particular MIT technology. He found that the eight entrepreneurs who licensed this technological resource identified eight different market opportunities—with <italic>none</italic> of the entrepreneurs identifying any of the other markets. Intriguingly, the eight markets identified for the technology presented highly different prospects for new firm creation, with projected market sizes ranging between 10 million and several billion U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>If identification of multiple alternative market opportunities is important for performance, then agents need first to identify a market opportunity set before deciding on a commercialization path to follow with their technological resources. The construction of this opportunity set is highly contingent on the agent’s <italic>subjective</italic> perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206310386228">Kor et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310386228">Penrose (1959</xref>: 41) states,
<disp-quote>
<p>Although the “objective” productive opportunity of a firm is limited by what the firm is able to accomplish, the “subjective” productive opportunity is a question of what it thinks it can accomplish. “Expectations” and not “objective facts” are the immediate determinants of a firm’s behaviour, although there may be a relationship between expectations and “facts”—indeed there must be if action is to be successful, for the success of a firm’s plans depends only partly on the execution of them and partly on whether they are based on sound judgment about the possibilities for successful action. In the last analysis the “environment” rejects or confirms the soundness of the judgments about it, but the relevant environment is not an objective fact discoverable before the event.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Because subjective perceptions shape entrepreneurial ideas about what the firm can and cannot do with its technological resources, and hence the nature and the extent of the firm’s productive opportunity set, it is paramount to begin to understand the sources of founders’ subjective perceptions in order to better explain and predict the growth options they might or might not pursue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206310386228">Kor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310386228">Penrose, 1959</xref>). Yet, the extant literature recounts relatively little on how preexisting endowments of differing knowledge types influence the identification of market opportunities for technology start-ups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206310386228">Helfat &amp; Lieberman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206310386228">Kor et al., 2007</xref>). Specifically, beyond the insight that experienced and novice entrepreneurs differ in their opportunity identification behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206310386228">Baron &amp; Ensley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206310386228">Gruber et al., 2008</xref>), extant research does not tell us how different types of knowledge endowments in founding teams systematically affect opportunity identification outcomes, and which combinations of knowledge endowments in founding teams might enable the identification of multiple market opportunities for the firm’s resources (remember that each of the entrepreneurs studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206310386228">Shane, 2000</xref>, identified just a single market opportunity). In this vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206310386228">McGrath and Boisot (2005)</xref> draw on a genetic analogy to suggest that a wide range of adaptive behavior is possible if internal competences can be mobilized in such a way that they work in teams. They would argue that the variety of opportunities identified by founding teams stems from <italic>combinatorial</italic> permutations of individual endowments, which suggests that team endowments would be multiplicative rather than simply additive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206310386228">Bowman &amp; Hurry, 1993</xref>). Market opportunity identification could thus be driven not only by the knowledge endowments of <italic>individual</italic> members of the founding team but also by the ways in which these endowments <italic>combine</italic> in the founding team. The above discussion leads to the following research question:</p>

<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>To arrive at a thorough understanding of how pre-entry knowledge and experience endowments affect the identification of market opportunities in emerging firms, we begin with a general assessment of how the founding team’s <italic>educational diversity</italic> influences market opportunity identification. We then turn to a more detailed discussion of how four different types of pre-entry <italic>knowledge and experience</italic> endowments (in management, entrepreneurship, marketing, and technology) affect the identification of market opportunities. In a final step, we examine the effect of <italic>combinations</italic> among these different types of endowments in the founding team.</p>
<p>Although research examining the role of founding <italic>teams</italic> in entrepreneurial opportunity identification is recent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206310386228">Foss, Klein, Kor, &amp; Mahoney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206310386228">Short, Ketchen, Shook, &amp; Ireland, 2010</xref>), there is a fairly large body of literature investigating the relationship between founding team composition and the evolution and performance of start-up firms and, more generally, the relationship between team composition and a variety of outcomes in established firms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206310386228">Kor, 2003</xref>; for a recent overview see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206310386228">Finkelstein, Hambrick, &amp; Cannella, 2009</xref>). This literature indicates that teams with <italic>diverse backgrounds</italic> provide a heterogeneous set of knowledge, cognitive abilities, skills, and information, which when combined provide a broader knowledge base from which to solve organizational problems.</p>
<p>Team diversity can be assessed along different demographic dimensions such as education or organizational tenure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0149206310386228">Taylor &amp; Greve, 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0149206310386228">2</xref></sup> In the following, we examine two main dimensions of team diversity that can be expected to influence market opportunity identification, that is, diversity of <italic>educational specialization</italic> and diversity of <italic>educational level.</italic></p>
<sec id="section5-0149206310386228">
<title>Educational Diversity</title>
<p>Education shapes the knowledge, skills, and perspectives a person brings to a task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0149206310386228">Tsui, Egan, &amp; Xin, 1995</xref>). In terms of <italic>educational specialization</italic>, a person’s choice of curriculum reflects his or her cognitive style and personality, and the chosen curriculum shapes this person’s understanding of problems, the information and procedures used for problem solving, and outlook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0149206310386228">Wiersema &amp; Bantel, 1992</xref>). Prior studies have shown that group diversity with respect to educational specialization has a positive effect on cognitive task performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206310386228">Bantel &amp; Jackson, 1989</xref>). Working in a group with a diverse educational background exposes individuals to a broader set of knowledge, opinions, and perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206310386228">Harrison &amp; Klein, 2007</xref>). It brings individuals together in ways that allow them to build on each other’s insights, to challenge well-worn ideas stemming from the individual fields of education, to elicit relevant though often nonobvious knowledge from fellow team members, and to turn seemingly unrelated suggestions into potentially groundbreaking insights. These interactions can lead to a creative cross-fertilization of ideas and can stimulate novel combinations of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206310386228">Hargadon, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of <italic>educational level</italic>, extant work argues that the attained level of formal education is reflective of an individual’s cognitive ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0149206310386228">Pelled, 1996</xref>). Whereas individuals who are more educated tend to be more receptive to innovation, have a higher capacity for information processing, and are more likely to engage in boundary spanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206310386228">Hambrick &amp; Mason, 1984</xref>), individuals with lower levels of formal education yet on-the-job training may possess more applied knowledge and more practical intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0149206310386228">Sternberg, 2004</xref>) and may be more interested in solving practical problems. Identifying market opportunities for the start-up’s technological resources is a complex task requiring a mix of theoretical and applied knowledge, so teams with diverse educational levels should have an advantage in market opportunity searches.</p>

<title>Types of Experience Endowments</title>
<p>Beyond attained education, another endowment the founding team brings to the firm creation process is the <italic>work experience</italic> of its members. One can think of the prior experience of individuals as representative of routines they have learned, and this represents organizational routines they bring into the formative firm from their pasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206310386228">Baron, Burton, &amp; Hannan, 1999</xref>). While some people have developed deep experience and routines in solving particular organizational problems, others may not have been confronted with a problem of that particular nature in their work lives. People thus possess different problem-solving experience and perspectives and are also subject to different blind spots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206310386228">Finkelstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206310386228">Gagné &amp; Glaser, 1987</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206310386228">Eisenhardt, Kahwajy, and Bourgeois (1997</xref>: 48) point out that people “who have grown up in sales and marketing typically see opportunities and issues from vantage points that differ from those who have primarily engineering experience.” We examine four types of frequently recurring pre-entry experience endowments that are likely to influence the identification of market opportunities: <italic>management experience, entrepreneurial experience, marketing experience</italic>, and <italic>technological (engineering) experience</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Prior management experience</italic> provides individuals with well-understood and legitimated knowledge structures of how established firms function and how they should be managed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206310386228">Baron et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0149206310386228">Walsh, 1995</xref>). Individuals with this type of general experience can apply the managerial problem-solving procedures they have developed over time to the task of new firm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206310386228">Adelson, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206310386228">Knowlton, 1997</xref>). Although they are primarily used to make (optimizing) decisions in existing means–ends frameworks, individuals with managerial experience are likely to have developed a holistic (“big picture”) or systems-thinking perspective that tends to broaden rather than constrain their vision. In this vein, at least two arguments suggest that managerial experience will support the identification of market opportunities for technologies.</p>
<p>First, given their experience in managing across firm boundaries, individuals with managerial experience will be highly sensitized to the importance of market characteristics for firm performance. Case in point, in her qualitative study describing the thought worlds of different types of agents in the product innovation process, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206310386228">Dougherty (1992)</xref> suggests that people with managerial (planning) backgrounds see the development of the business case and thus the future financial performance of an innovation as the most critical issue to consider, whereas people with backgrounds in technology or marketing perceive criteria such as product performance or buyer needs as most critical. As a consequence of this greater sensitivity to business performance, we expect that people with managerial backgrounds would be motivated to continue their search for market opportunities until they have identified at least one that meets or exceeds their financial aspirations, whereas other types of organizational actors—in particular, those with functional backgrounds—will be more likely to terminate their search efforts early, perhaps even after the very first identified opportunity, as they tend to discount the importance of the market opportunity for business performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206310386228">Gaglio &amp; Katz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206310386228">Jolly, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0149206310386228">Simon, 1955</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, the market opportunity identification process will be less challenging and cognitively demanding for agents with managerial backgrounds. In particular, due to their prior business experience they should have developed skills at how to scan the environment for relevant information, how to make sense of new pieces of information, and how such information might pertain to customers and the broader industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206310386228">Cooper, Folta, &amp; Woo, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0149206310386228">Ward, 2004</xref>). As these mental capacities reduce cognitive effort, people with managerial experience should be more likely to engage in an extended search for market opportunities than agents who do not possess such experience.</p>
<p>Taken together, this reasoning suggests that founding teams with members who have strong management experience will identify more market opportunities for their technological resources than will teams with less management experience, all else being equal.</p>
<list id="list4-0149206310386228" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2a (management experience)</italic>: The greater the management experience endowment of the founding team, the greater the number of market opportunities it will identify.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The second key type of human capital endowment often encountered in founding teams is <italic>prior entrepreneurial experience</italic>. Founders with such experience not only should know what it means to start a new firm but can also be expected to possess a holistic understanding of the firm creation task (similar to people with managerial backgrounds) that broadens rather than constrains their vision. In this regard, both arguments just discussed—sensitivity to the importance of market opportunity characteristics and particular cognitive capacities to scan the environment for information cues—should also apply to people with entrepreneurial experience. Yet, while entrepreneurial experience may be looked at as a general type of experience endowment, extant research also suggests that there are key idiosyncratic characteristics of entrepreneurial experience that people with managerial experience do not possess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206310386228">Busenitz &amp; Barney, 1997</xref>)—and as such would influence opportunity identification beyond what could be expected of those with managerial experience alone. Specifically, an increasing number of theoretical and empirical studies indicate that persons with entrepreneurial experience can be viewed as having a set of common characteristics that together form an entrepreneurial mind-set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206310386228">McGrath &amp; MacMillan, 2000</xref>) and that makes them particularly apt in the identification of opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206310386228">Alvarez &amp; Busenitz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206310386228">Gruber, 2010</xref>). Consequently, researchers argue that experienced entrepreneurs have developed particular cognitive schemata that facilitate the identification of opportunity patterns, as they enhance their ability to “connect the dots” between seemingly unrelated information cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206310386228">Baron &amp; Ensley, 2006</xref>). Notably, as such schemata “automate” the identification of opportunities, their activation occurs without the person’s intentional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206310386228">Gaglio &amp; Katz, 2001</xref>). Being constantly on the lookout for opportunities, individuals with entrepreneurial experience may thus notice patterns that other people tend to overlook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206310386228">Gaglio, 2004</xref>)—which may explain why people with this experience endowment tend to not only identify opportunities earlier than other types of actors do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206310386228">Gaglio &amp; Katz, 2001</xref>) but also identify more opportunities than others do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206310386228">Gruber et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0149206310386228">Ucbasaran et al., 2009</xref>). In this regard, Gaglio argues that people with entrepreneurial experience like to engage in mental simulations and counterfactual reasoning when thinking about opportunities. The identification of one opportunity may thus lead to the identification of additional opportunities.</p>
<p>These arguments indicate that individuals with entrepreneurial experience are thought to possess distinctive cognitive frameworks that facilitate the identification of business opportunities. Their “chronic” alertness for new opportunities might be the most significant behavioral difference between them and other types of organizational actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206310386228">Gaglio &amp; Katz, 2001</xref>), which will make them particularly prone to identify a larger set of opportunities than, for instance, individuals with managerial experience or functional experience (see below) will identify. This line of reasoning is consistent with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310386228">Penrose (1959</xref>: 36), who suggested that “entrepreneurial versatility is a somewhat different quality from managerial or technical versatility. The latter two qualities are primarily questions of administrative and technical competence, the former is a question of imagination, which may or may not be ‘practical.’”</p>
<p>In sum, existing work (including our companion study) indicates a key difference between experienced and novice founders in opportunity identification in that the former tend to identify more opportunities than the latter do. However, extant work does not tell us whether additional benefits in opportunity identification accrue to those founding teams in which more than one member possesses entrepreneurial experience. This may be the case, since individuals with entrepreneurial experience not only may build on one another’s insights and thus identify additional opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206310386228">Gaglio, 2004</xref>) but should also possess an overall higher alertness for opportunities. Extending earlier research, we thus argue that the greater the entrepreneurial experience endowment of the founding team, the larger the identified opportunity set.</p>

</list>
<p><italic>Prior technological experience</italic> and <italic>prior marketing experience</italic> represent specialized, functional types of experience. While greater expertise in these functional areas is beneficial for performing the corresponding specialized activities, there is also evidence suggesting that strong expertise in a particular domain may reduce cognitive flexibility, as it provides a limited lens through which organizational problems are interpreted and acted upon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206310386228">Dearborn &amp; Simon, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206310386228">Finkelstein et al., 2009</xref>). In particular, cognitive psychologists point out that experts can become entrenched in deeply ingrained assumptions and routines associated with their specialties and thus may be less amenable to new ways of thinking and different kinds of tasks requiring alternative mind-sets and approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206310386228">Fiske &amp; Taylor, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0149206310386228">Ward, 2004</xref>). As individuals may become prisoners of their own expertise, attempts at creativity often exhibit unnecessarily limited thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0149206310386228">Teece, 2007</xref>). Moreover, prior research suggests that these cognitive constraints should be particularly strong during times in which job demands are high (as in the case of firm creation), as these work conditions will make it even more likely that people with functional expertise will scan and selectively perceive stimuli according to their learned expert frameworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206310386228">Hambrick, Finkelstein, &amp; Mooney, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Although both types of specialized, functional expertise discussed here may be subject to these pathologies, we need to take a closer look at the thought worlds of technologists and marketers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206310386228">Dougherty, 1992</xref>) to understand how their dissimilar information search activities and dissimilar inclinations to deal with market-related issues may influence market opportunity identification outcomes.</p>
<p>Two main arguments suggest that people with strong technological expertise will identify a smaller number of market opportunities for their technologies. First, cognition research provides many examples showing that the initial problem formulation already limits experts’ thinking. In particular, experts will “know the meaning” of the elements of the technological resource, and they will make narrower distinctions when conceptualizing it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0149206310386228">Mednick, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0149206310386228">Ward, 2004</xref>). A more abstract or general framing of the technology, however, would afford a greater range of possibilities for seeing application areas than the more specific framing would, because the latter is constraining the information cues that are noticed and processed. This limiting effect of initial problem formulations is also one of the key reasons why <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206310386228">Danneels’s (2007)</xref> process study on technology leveraging suggests that mental delinking has to occur before a relinking of a particular technological resource with a new market opportunity can be accomplished.</p>
<p>Second, technological experts typically have a lower inclination to deal with market-related issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206310386228">Dougherty, 1992</xref>). Although it has become somewhat of a cliché that technologists believe that products can be sold based purely on criteria such as innovativeness or product functionality, there are many examples illustrating that this is the case (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206310386228">Jolly, 1997</xref>). In particular, as technologists make decisions about the allocation of their time and energy based on their perceptions of how the world works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206310386228">Dougherty, 1992</xref>), they may fail to realize that their assumptions are not appropriate and that it would be a worthwhile activity to identify additional opportunities.</p>
<p>The initial problem framing and the inclination to deal with market-related issues appear to have a strong influence not only on the opportunity identification behavior of technologists but also on that of marketers. While one might intuitively expect that it should be easier for the marketing person to abstract away from the technology than for the deeply involved technologist to do so, we argue for the less intuitive: that people with strong experience in marketing likely face a problem analogous to the one discussed for technology experts and that deep prior experience with a set of customers dominates their search constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206310386228">Shane, 2000</xref>). In particular, it seems that if someone has had deep experience in only serving a particular market, that marketer is drawn toward that particular market domain and entrenched in its specific paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206310386228">Danneels, 2007</xref>). And even if a marketer possesses experience in a variety of domains, that marketer might be inclined to gravitate toward that domain in which he or she possesses the most experience. In contrast, people without marketing experience would be more open to consider a variety of target market options and thus would not tend to stop their search for alternatives prematurely.</p>
<p>In sum, this discussion suggests that overcoming a narrow search horizon is a difficult challenge for people with strong domain-specific expertise. We thus hypothesize the following:</p>
<list id="list6-0149206310386228" list-type="simple">

<title>Combinations of Generalist and Specialist Experience Endowments</title>
<p>So far, our discussion has indicated that both managerial experience and entrepreneurial experience tend to be generalized and divergent, creating cognitive structures that admit the exploration of new solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206310386228">Alvarez &amp; Busenitz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206310386228">Levitt &amp; March, 1988</xref>). On the other hand, functional knowledge like technological experience and marketing experience tends to be specialized and convergent, creating cognitive structures that prefer exploitative solutions. In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206310386228">Kirzner (1979)</xref> argues that specialized knowledge such as technological expertise is usually collected at the expense of generalized knowledge and that experts with specialized knowledge do not fully recognize the value inherent to their knowledge or how to deploy the knowledge to generate economic returns.</p>
<p>Building on these arguments, we suggest that important synergies can be unleashed when specialists and generalists work together on market opportunity identification. While the generalist may not possess the depth of specific knowledge that the expert has, the generalist is the person who identifies business opportunities stemming from the specialist’s knowledge and sees how to mobilize and deploy that specialized knowledge. For instance, the generalist can prod the specialist to think more broadly and more abstractly, via questions probing the limits of the technical or market knowledge, or may suggest taking alternative perspectives on the application of the knowledge. Strong specialist expertise could thus become an asset in market opportunity identification, as deeper expertise can better be deployed into the understanding of how to configure available resources for application in other domains. Hence, once triggered by generalists to think more broadly about their applying knowledge, specialists should find it easier to abstract away from the concrete use of the technology and to contribute to opportunity identification.</p>
<p>This line of reasoning suggests that the combinations of prior experience endowments in the founding team will play an important role in market opportunity identification. While we expect that the aforementioned synergistic effects can be observed with either a managerial generalist or an entrepreneurial generalist present on the founding team, the arguments presented when discussing the unique characteristics of people with entrepreneurial experience suggest their particular aptitude in opportunity identification, that is, ability in the identification of opportunities that surpasses that of managerial generalists. In this vein, we expect that teams that combine specialists and entrepreneurial generalists will identify even <italic>more</italic> market opportunities than do teams that consist of specialists and managerial generalists.</p>

<title>Study Setting</title>
<p>This study required detailed data on market opportunity identification, the founding team, and other organizational characteristics. Since no public data with such information were available, we collected data through a self-administered survey of new firms backed by VC. New firms provide a relatively clean setting for the study of our research question because they have a limited size, are of low complexity, and have short organizational histories. Thus, the identification of firm resources, knowledge, and opportunity sets is less challenging and also more reliable than in established firms, where opportunities for diversification are identified over long time spans and are influenced by a diverse, relatively large, and generally changing set of actors over time. In addition, the resource base itself may change significantly during that time, creating further difficulties in gaining understanding of the “resource-knowledge-opportunity set” triad. Furthermore, we selected VC-backed start-ups because these firms are strongly performance oriented and have the objectives, and potential, to grow rapidly and generate high levels of new wealth. We will comment on any limitations that the choice of our sample may entail in the Discussion section.</p>
<p>The start-ups studied in this article were founded in Germany. Like in many other countries, German technology start-ups have very limited access to traditional sources of financing, such as bank loans, because of information asymmetries and potential agency problems (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206310386228">Amit, Brander, &amp; Zott, 1998</xref>). Given their often considerable funding needs, one important source of funding for technology start-ups is VC. The maturing European VC scene is, in general, closely modeled on the U.S. example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206310386228">Franke, Gruber, Harhoff, &amp; Henkel, 2008</xref>). In Germany, the first VC firms that followed the U.S. model of early-stage investing were established in the 1980s. During the 1990s, the German VC industry experienced a period of considerable growth fueled not only by newly founded domestic VC firms but also by numerous foreign VCs entering the market. Germany now ranks as the third largest European market in terms of invested capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206310386228">Frommann &amp; Dahmann, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As in other economies, German technology start-ups seeking to raise VC are evaluated in a multistage process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206310386228">Franke et al., 2008</xref>). But should a VC in Germany decide to invest in a particular technology start-up, the KfW Mittelstandbank (a bank owned by the German government and the federal states and assisted by the German Federal Ministry for Economics and Labour) may be approached to become a co-investor. Through its start-up fund, the KfW participates in early-stage investments up to the amount provided by the lead investor and subject to the same economic conditions. By leveraging private equity, the KfW thus incentivizes private-sector investment in technology start-ups. Hence, a technology start-up in the United States that would not receive funding because the VC is unwilling or unable to provide the required amount of funding might receive funding in Germany because the VC can obtain matching funds via co-investment by KfW.</p>

<title>Data and Sample</title>
<p>Survey data were collected in 2003 by using a standardized, Web-based questionnaire. Access to the sample of 348 VC-backed firms was provided through collaboration with a professional services firm specializing in Web-based solutions for the VC industry. Following a comprehensive pilot study that included interviews with more than two dozen entrepreneurs, we developed the survey instrument and pretested it with 10 entrepreneurs, 4 venture capitalists, and 9 academics. Prior research considers CEOs and founders highly knowledgeable and valid information sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206310386228">Glick, Huber, Miller, Doty, &amp; Sutcliffe, 1990</xref>), so following a key-informant approach, we addressed the survey directly to founders.</p>
<p>The survey was online for 12 weeks. A follow-up telephone call was conducted after Week 6. We received responses from 142 VC-backed firms, yielding a response rate of 40.8%. Complete data records are available for 133 firms (effective response rate: 38.2%).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0149206310386228">3</xref></sup> Respondent firms had a median founding year of 1999 (mean age of 3.2 years) and fell into different technology areas such as software, laser technology, new materials, and electronics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0149206310386228">4</xref></sup> To test for nonresponse bias, we compared early and late respondents, with the latter serving as a proxy group for nonresponding firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206310386228">Armstrong &amp; Overton, 1977</xref>). No indication of response bias was found in this analysis. Using representative secondary data on VC-backed ventures founded in Germany (data of the German Foundation Panel; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206310386228">Engel &amp; Keilbach, 2002</xref>), we also compared the industry distribution of firms represented in our sample with the general population of VC-backed start-ups. A comparative analysis between the industry classifications available for our sample and the secondary data suggests that our sample tends to only slightly overrepresent firms founded in the area of multimedia and communication as well as the Internet. Moreover, a comparison of the start-up size of firms in our sample with the general population of VC-backed ventures in Germany suggests fairly equal employee counts (7.26 vs. 6.98 employees). Similarly, we find high correspondence in the qualification of the founding team: In our sample, 30.2% of founders had obtained a PhD and 48.1% a university degree, whereas 28.9% of founders in the general population had obtained a PhD and 52.8% a university degree.</p>

<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<p>Following our theoretical development, we are interested in how different knowledge types and experience endowments of firm founders affect the number of market opportunities—identified prior to first market selection and entry of their firms. In other words, how does the combination of education and experience of the firm-founding team affect the size of the firm’s market opportunity set? However, neither <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310386228">Penrose (1959)</xref> nor the entrepreneurship literature provides clear guidance on how to dimensionalize or measure opportunities. For instance, we highlighted that Penrose saw the subjective productive opportunity set of the firm as “all of the productive possibilities that its ‘entrepreneurs’ see and can take advantage of” (p. 31)—with one particularly important category of opportunities being options to diversify into new markets, as diversification moves are instrumental in fueling the growth of the firm. In terms of entrepreneurship research, a recent review of the opportunity identification literature suggests that “despite the emergence of opportunity as a central concept for entrepreneurship researchers, little agreement exists about the definition and nature of opportunities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206310386228">Short et al., 2010</xref>: 41, referencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206310386228">Hansen &amp; Schrader, 2007</xref>). For the purpose of the present study, an empirical measure of market opportunities not only needs to be tied to the firm’s underlying resource base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310386228">Penrose, 1959</xref>) but also needs to take into account that—while the notion of opportunity is a subjective one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310386228">Penrose, 1959</xref>: 41)—respondents can delineate the opportunity concept from pure ideas or dreams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206310386228">Short et al., 2010</xref>). That is, the latter have to be subject to some evaluative process before they can be labeled as opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206310386228">Dimov, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Following such observations, we developed and pretested a multistage survey question capturing the number of market opportunities founders had taken into account for their technological resources prior to first market entry (similar count measures have been used in related research in the entrepreneurship, innovation, and organizational learning literatures; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206310386228">Hill &amp; Birkinshaw, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206310386228">Narin &amp; Breitzman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206310386228">Shepherd &amp; DeTienne, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0149206310386228">Singh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0149206310386228">Ucbasaran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0149206310386228">Zahra &amp; George, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0149206310386228">5</xref></sup> Specifically, in keeping with the Penrosian idea of resource leveraging across domains, we first asked respondents to indicate whether, prior to first market entry, it would have been possible to use their technological resources to produce products or services for application domains (markets) that were completely different from the one pursued. Second, in keeping with the notion that opportunities are different from ideas or dreams, as they require some evaluative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206310386228">Dimov, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206310386228">Short et al., 2010</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0149206310386228">6</xref></sup> we asked respondents to report the number of alternative market opportunities they had systematically analyzed.

The Shannon index, which is appropriate for categorical variables, is calculated as –Σ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>P<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(ln P<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>), for <italic>i</italic> = 1 to <italic>x</italic>, where <italic>x</italic> denotes the number of categories and P<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the proportion of founding team members with an educational specialization in category <italic>I</italic>. In the survey instrument, respondents were asked to report the “educational specializations possessed by the founders.” Categories were given as “management education,” “technological education,” and “other type of educational specialization.”</p>

<sec id="section14-0149206310386228">
<title>Educational level diversity</title>
<p>The Shannon index is also used to measure the diversity in the highest level of education attained by the individual members of the founding team. Following the German educational system, categories were given as “occupational training,” “university degree,” “PhD,” and “other type of highest degree.”</p>

<sec id="section15-0149206310386228">
<title>Management experience, marketing experience, and technological experience</title>
<p>We followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0149206310386228">Wiersema and Bantel’s (1992</xref>: 95) suggestion to use the average level of a given trait in a team to represent the group’s overall characterization. Specifically, respondents were asked to assess the level of knowledge and experience possessed by the founding team in three areas (management experience, marketing experience, and technological experience; answers were recorded on 5-point Likert-type scales ranging from <italic>very poor</italic> to <italic>very strong</italic>). We mean centered all three variables.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0149206310386228">
<title>Entrepreneurial experience</title>
<p>Respondents were asked to indicate the number of founding team members who had previously created a new firm. Given that the size of the founding team varies, our analysis makes use of a proportional measure; that is, we divide the number of founding team members with entrepreneurial experience by the total number of team members.</p>

<title>Control Variables</title>
<sec id="section18-0149206310386228">
<title>Year of market entry</title>
<p>Opportunity identification behavior may depend on the macro environment during the time of firm creation. We thus control for the year the firm was incorporated (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206310386228">Rothaermel &amp; Deeds, 2006</xref>) by determining each firm’s age at the time of the survey (in 2003) and use that age as a control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0149206310386228">
<title>Self-developed technology (vs. licensed-in technology)</title>
<p>Using a 5-point Likert-type scale, respondents reported “the degree to which the technology they sought to commercialize was developed internally.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0149206310386228">
<title>Generality of technological resources</title>
<p>Analysts of firm resources and technological innovation point out that resource fungibility is highly dependent on personal imagination and creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206310386228">Jolly, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310386228">Penrose, 1959</xref>) and suggest that it is formally impossible to predict a technology’s eventual deployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0149206310386228">Rosenberg, 2000</xref>). It could be that some firms’ resource endowments may lend themselves more easily to opportunity identification and application in additional markets. In an attempt to partial out this type of variation from our data, we constructed a measure of technological resource generality, that is, an index that captures the average number of opportunities in a particular technology field represented in our sample. Higher values of this index thus denote technology fields where the identification of additional market opportunities for technological resources is more common. In robustness tests, we calculated a resource generality measure that captures the share of new firms in a particular technology field that considered more than one market opportunity and also substituted the resource generality measure with dummy variables capturing each of the technology areas represented in our study. Results remained consistent across all specifications.</p>

<sec id="section21-0149206310386228">
<title>VC seed funding prior to market entry</title>
<p>We also control for the availability of financial resources, as they may influence founders’ search behavior. Whereas all firms in our sample were backed by VC, only a subset (59%) obtained VC funding during the seed stage <italic>prior</italic> to the initial market entry. We derived a dummy variable that indicates whether the emerging firm acquired seed funding prior to the initial market entry (1), or not (0).</p>

<sec id="section22-0149206310386228">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The dependent variable used in this study is the number of alternative markets considered by founders of technology ventures prior to first market entry. This variable takes on only nonnegative integer values and consists of zeros to a significant degree. Although Poisson regression can be used to model count variables, the negative binomial regression model is preferred when the assumption of the equality of the conditional mean and variance functions is violated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206310386228">Greene, 1999</xref>). The negative binomial model generalizes the Poisson model by introducing an individual unobserved disturbance term that allows the mean and variance to vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206310386228">Hardin &amp; Hilbe, 2007</xref>). It takes the following form: ln λ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = β<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> + ε<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, where λ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> equals the mean and variance of <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> represents the vector of regressors, and exp(ε) is the gamma-distributed error term. Results from zero-inflated negative binomial models were very similar to those in standard negative binomial models, so we report the latter.</p>
<p>Recent studies highlight that endogeneity might pose a problem in empirical management research (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0149206310386228">Shaver, 1998</xref>). For instance, firm founders may construct larger opportunity sets because of unobservable or hard-to-measure factors that may be correlated with right-hand-side variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206310386228">Hamilton &amp; Nickerson, 2003</xref>). Because two-stage least-squares and three-stage least-squares models are not applicable in negative binomial regressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0149206310386228">Wooldridge, 2002</xref>), we followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0149206310386228">Heckman’s (1979)</xref> method to correct for self-selection. First, a probit model was estimated, capturing whether founders identified additional market opportunities. In particular, we estimated whether founders engaged in the identification of additional opportunities as a function of our control variables and our education and experience variables. We also included a variable that significantly predicted this decision but did not significantly influence the count of additional market opportunities: a measure capturing whether founders wrote a business plan prior to the first entry (measured as a dummy variable). Second, we estimated market opportunity counts as a function of identified variables and corrected for a potential self-selection bias by including the inverse Mills ratio, that is, an index that was generated from the probit estimates.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Summary statistics and the correlation matrix of our data are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0149206310386228">Table 1</xref>. The average founding team size was 2.64 individuals, and 41% of all teams had one or more members who had previously created a firm. Founders in our sample considered, on average, 0.75 additional market opportunities, or a total of 1.75 market opportunities, prior to the initial market entry. This descriptive evidence is interesting in its own right, as it indicates that founders of technology ventures often do not take (many) alternative options into account when making fundamental strategic decisions—a finding that mirrors strategy research suggesting that managers may not consider alternative courses of action in their strategic decision making (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206310386228">Schwenk, 1984</xref>). Furthermore, this evidence highlights that it is important to better understand which human capital endowments in founding teams are associated with the identification of a larger opportunity set in new ventures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206310386228">Foss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310386228">Penrose, 1959</xref>).</p>

In a hierarchical analysis, Model 1 estimates a baseline model of controls, and Models 2 to 5 investigate team experience variables and interaction effects. Finally, Model 6 estimates a full model that includes all interactions effects.

<p>Hypotheses 1a and 1b propose that team educational diversity will enhance the identification of market opportunities. Model 2 indicates that both diversity measures (educational specialization and educational level) have positive coefficient estimates, yet only the effect of educational level diversity is significant. We thus claim support for Hypothesis 1b (educational level), while we have to reject Hypothesis 1a (educational specialization).</p>
<p>Next, we examine the effects of different types of founding team experience. In accordance with Hypotheses 2a and 2b, we find that both management and prior entrepreneurial experience have positive and significant coefficient estimates (see Model 3). We also find support for Hypotheses 2c and 2d, which propose a negative effect of technological and marketing experience, respectively.</p>
<p>Finally, Hypothesis 3 proposes the effect of combinations of different types of experience endowments in the founding team. We examine this hypothesis using several interaction effects, flagging the absence or presence of a particular type of experience endowment in the founding team. The positive and significant interactions in Model 4 and Model 6 (full model) indicate that teams <italic>with</italic> entrepreneurial experience identify an <italic>increasing</italic> number of opportunities as expertise in technology and in marketing increases. Models 5 and 6 indicate that these interaction effects are unique to prior entrepreneurial experience, as they do <italic>not</italic> exist for interactions with management experience. Taken together, these results indicate support for this key hypothesis.</p>
<p>Looking at the controls, we note that our technology-related variables self-developed technology and technological resource generality both have positive and significant effects on the number of market opportunities identified. Furthermore, we find that the inverse Mills ratio loses significance once our independent variables are included, which suggests that some correlation exists between the sample selection variable and the independent variables. To understand whether sample selection plays a role in our estimation models, we compared the parameter estimates of the corrected models with those obtained from uncorrected models. This comparison indicated that any differences in the significance and magnitude of the parameter estimates of our independent variables are trivial; that is, sample selection is not substantial.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Following the appeal by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310386228">Penrose (1959)</xref>, this study launched an empirical investigation of the founders’ subjective perceptions of market opportunities based on the founding team’s pre-entry knowledge and experience endowments. Prior research has shown a high correlation between number of opportunities identified and subsequent performance of ventures, so uncovering systematic linkages between the founding team’s pre-entry endowments and number of market opportunities identified is of considerable theoretical and practical relevance.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that teams characterized by diverse educational backgrounds (in terms of level of education) have systematic advantages in identifying multiple market opportunities for their technology ventures. This result is consistent with research on top management teams suggesting that educational diversity is positively related to corporate diversification (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0149206310386228">Wiersema &amp; Bantel, 1992</xref>) and innovation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206310386228">Bantel &amp; Jackson, 1989</xref>). By examining the construction of the firm’s market opportunity set, our results thus extend earlier work on top management teams to the resource-based framework and to a key dependent variable.</p>
<p>Beyond the team’s education, our findings reveal that prior work experience has manifold important influences on the identification of market opportunities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0149206310386228">7</xref></sup> Notably, both <italic>technological experience</italic> and <italic>marketing experience</italic> have a negative effect. This provides rare quantitative evidence indicating that individuals in technology tend to show less appreciation for market-related issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206310386228">Dougherty, 1992</xref>). Furthermore, it appears that individuals with functional marketing backgrounds are also confined and conditioned by their experience in known environments, rather than being open to the identification of novel market opportunities. Their domain-specific expertise seems to constrain their cognitive flexibility, limiting their ability to identify other uses for the firm’s resources. Thus, the person’s marketing expertise is of a first-order rather than a second-order nature; that is, marketers tend to have local market knowledge, not second-order competence to identify alternative markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206310386228">Danneels, 2007</xref>). In this regard, our findings also reinforce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206310386228">Levitt’s (1964)</xref> depiction of “marketing myopia” (i.e., the failure to identify growth opportunities outside conventional industry boundaries).</p>
<p><italic>Entrepreneurial experience</italic> and <italic>management experience</italic> both have positive effects, suggesting that these generalist types of experience endowments are associated with the ability to search more broadly for opportunities. In particular, we extend prior research by showing that founding teams that are strong in these dimensions do better in opportunity identification than teams without such endowments. Furthermore, we find that the <italic>configuration of the founding team endowments</italic> has noteworthy influence on opportunity identification outcomes, as team configurations comprising specialists and entrepreneurial generalists do better than teams endowed with specialists and managerial generalists. These team endowments can be seen to have important synergistic effects: Market opportunity identification is driven not only by the endowments of individual members of the founding team but also by the specific ways in which these endowments combine in the founding team.</p>
<p>Overall, there are two particularly intriguing points that emerge from this analysis: First, entrepreneurial experience is more important than management experience for the identification of opportunities, since the marginal effect size of the former is significantly stronger than of the latter (on the 7% level). This result is further supported by the positive moderating effects of entrepreneurial experience on specialized expertise, both marketing and technological. We did not find similar moderating effects with management experience, which indicates a key difference between managerial and entrepreneurial experience roles in start-up organizations. Notably, the moderating effects of entrepreneurial experience increase both in increasing entrepreneurial experience and in increasing specialized expertise. Second, entrepreneurial generalists who are able to draw off the specialized functional experience of others perform better in market opportunity identification than on their own.</p>

<title>Theoretical Contributions</title>
<p>We believe that these findings provide a number of novel contributions to theory development in the strategy, entrepreneurship, and evolutionary economics literatures.</p>
<sec id="section26-0149206310386228">
<title>Contributions to research in strategic management</title>
<p>We began this article by noting that in spite of the large body of resource-based literature, we possess hardly any knowledge on a particularly important element of the resource–performance link, that is, the identification of markets in which firm resources can create value for end customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206310386228">Kor et al., 2007</xref>). Building on ideas expressed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310386228">Penrose’s (1959)</xref> <italic>Theory of the Growth of the Firm</italic>, the findings of this study contribute to the resource-based framework by showing how founders’ knowledge and experience endowments systematically shape the size of the firm’s market opportunity set and thus allows us to explain and predict the number of strategic growth options that firm founders will identify. In particular, we find that the number of market opportunities identified depends on the combinations of generalized and specialized skills of the team members. Teams composed of only specialists identify far fewer opportunities than those that combine specialists with generalists, especially teams with entrepreneurial endowments. In this vein, our empirical results also support Penrose’s key argument that entrepreneurial talent is a decidedly important human capital endowment in firms because this talent facilitates the identification of opportunities (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206310386228">Kor &amp; Mahoney, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Along these lines, our results provide systematic insights on the antecedents of firms’ diversification moves, so they contribute to the less-developed front end of the literature on firm diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206310386228">Markides, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206310386228">Montgomery, 1982</xref>). Specifically, our findings shed light on how firms can build a capability for identifying market opportunities for the firm’s resources by assembling teams that have particular knowledge and experience endowments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0149206310386228">Teece (2007)</xref> suggests that such a “market-sensing” capability should be viewed as one of the key dynamic capabilities in businesses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0149206310386228">
<title>Contributions to research in entrepreneurship</title>
<p>The results of our study also provide a number of new insights for the literature on entrepreneurship. First, it is of paramount interest to entrepreneurship researchers to understand why some people and not others identify business opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0149206310386228">Shane &amp; Venkataraman, 2000</xref>). Whereas prior research examining opportunity identification mainly highlighted the constraints that people have in opportunity identification (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0149206310386228">Shane, 2000</xref>), the findings of the present study offer direct insights on the key question of which types of knowledge and experience endowments are conducive to the identification of multiple opportunities. In particular, we find that important differences in opportunity identification exist between people with managerial, entrepreneurial, marketing, and technology backgrounds and that people with entrepreneurial endowments have superior abilities in opportunity identification compared with people with managerial endowments. In this regard, the empirical findings of this study remind us of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206310386228">Schumpeter’s (1934)</xref> description of the entrepreneur as a pioneer, identifying new combinations for new markets for the firm.</p>
<p>Second, our findings increase understanding of the role of founding teams in opportunity identification. With few recent exceptions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206310386228">Fiet, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206310386228">Foss et al., 2008</xref>), earlier writings focus either on the role of individuals in opportunity identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0149206310386228">Shane &amp; Venkataraman, 2000</xref>) or on the effects of founding teams after the opportunity has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206310386228">Schoonhoven, Eisenhardt, &amp; Lyman, 1990</xref>). Our results highlight the key role of founding team endowments in opportunity identification <italic>prior</italic> to launch and suggest that team composition plays a major role in this fundamental early stage of the entrepreneurial process.</p>
<p>Third, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to offer empirical evidence examining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206310386228">Kirzner’s (1979)</xref> theoretical discussion on the roles of experts’ specialized knowledge and entrepreneurs’ generalized knowledge. In support of Kirzner, we find that the application of specialized knowledge to market opportunity identification is enhanced specifically by generalized entrepreneurial knowledge endowments in the founding team. In turn, these findings have important implications not only for the evolving body of research on opportunity identification but also for related research on technology commercialization and university technology transfer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0149206310386228">
<title>Contributions to evolutionary economic theory</title>
<p>The findings presented in this study allow us to begin folding evolutionary economic thinking into entrepreneurship research and thereby also extend earlier work in evolutionary economic theory, which, due to interest in the explanation of evolutionary rather than pathbreaking patterns, lacks a theory on organizational habitat selection. The study reveals that a particular type of pre-entry endowment—entrepreneurial experience—opens up a broader array of new market opportunities for the emerging firm, allowing the identification of a broader range of potential organizational habitats. As a result, founders who are able to identify a range of potential habitats prior to the first entry of their organizations are in a position to select an environment that offers more favorable founding conditions. Notably, this choice is likely one of the most fundamental decisions founders take during the gestation stage of their firm and is also one that cannot easily be reversed once the firm has embarked on its path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206310386228">Abell, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206310386228">Michael, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-0149206310386228">
<title>Managerial Implications</title>
<p>There is a long-held belief that innovation relies primarily on the development of new technologies. As a consequence, most firms that have invested heavily in R&amp;D capabilities may have underinvested, or may not have invested at all, in capabilities to identify market opportunities for their technologies. Thus, from a practical perspective, our findings begin to suggest how teams with superior capabilities in the market opportunity identification stage might be configured. These findings should also be of interest to established firms, because prior research provides ample evidence that many established firms underutilize their resources, as they do not pursue a systematic approach for identifying new market opportunities and rely on serendipitous discoveries of such opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206310386228">Danneels, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206310386228">O’Connor &amp; Veryzer, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Along similar lines, the identification of learning traps in market opportunity identification permits us to identify specific strategies that organizations can use to counter these pathologies. Because organizational groups, including founding teams, commonly tend to form based on similarity, familiarity, and proximity, they typically have structural disadvantages in opportunity identification. As a compensating strategy, founders may (temporarily) enlarge the team by including members who possess the required types of human capital in opportunity identification. When developing the opportunity into a business, however, they may want to source the expertise required to implement and exploit the opportunity. From a broader perspective, founders should thus be sensitive to the fact that the very same team characteristics that are helpful in opportunity identification may not be the same that are required for exploiting the opportunity.</p>
<p>In terms of teaching, the above discussion suggests that lecturers need to create awareness of the learning traps in market opportunity identification and highlight the potential inherent to identifying multiple market opportunities for a technological resource. In this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206310386228">Markham, Baumer, Aiman-Smith, Kingon, and Zapata (2000)</xref> indicated that teams rarely identify the most promising opportunities on their first attempts. Guidelines for assessing different business opportunities can be found in works by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206310386228">McGrath and MacMillan (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206310386228">Mullins (2003)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-0149206310386228">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>In interpreting the results of this study, certain limitations must be kept in mind. First, this research was focused on new firms and investigated the identification of opportunity sets prior to their initial market entry. As discussed earlier, new firms provide a relatively clean setting for studying our research question. They are of fairly limited size and relatively low complexity and have only short histories. Hence, a study of resources, knowledge, and opportunities seems to be somewhat less challenging and perhaps also more reliable than in established firms where opportunities for diversification are typically identified over lengthy time spans by numerous internal and external actors. Yet, the characteristics of new firms limit the generalizability and application of our findings to established firms.</p>
<p>Second, our sample comprised new firms backed by VC, that is, a category of firms with strong growth aspirations. Given that such firms are usually started with much professionalism, we may expect that their founders identify a larger number of market opportunities for their resources than do founders of other types of new firms. Because the average firm in the present sample identified just 0.75 additional market opportunities, the choice of VC-backed firms may have been critical to our ability to study market opportunity identification for technological resources in some detail. In addition, it seems likely that the human capital base of VC-backed ventures is somewhat stronger than that of other new firms, given that VCs place high importance on the quality of the venture team in their venture screening process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206310386228">Franke et al., 2008</xref>). Given these particularities of VC-backed ventures, our results may not be generalizable to other types of new firms.</p>
<p>Third, our study faced common challenges associated with measuring the generality of a firm’s resource endowments. Following current research in strategy and innovation management, we argued that resource fungibility has a strong subjective component and can hardly be known <italic>ex ante</italic>. Nonetheless, it could be that some firms’ resource endowments may lend themselves more easily to opportunity identification and application in additional markets. In an attempt to partial out this type of variation from our data, we constructed a resource generality measure based on the commonality of seeking multiple application fields. While this is one potential approach, it may simply reflect the consensus in the community of practice of the technology, that is, an assessment of shared constraints rather than real generality that may come later or what a more creative entrepreneur might have been able to see. Thus, in addition to the reported analysis, we substituted our resource generality measure with dummies for the technological fields encountered in our study and also performed an analysis without any controls for technological resources. Results remained consistent across all specifications. Overall, we consider this threefold approach a viable if imperfect solution to a complex theoretical and empirical problem.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that the data used for this study are of a retrospective nature. Although we cannot completely rule out retrospective bias, several precautions were taken in order to avoid such bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206310386228">Huber &amp; Power, 1985</xref>). First, the survey questions addressed fundamental—and thus more easily remembered—issues in the creation of a new firm, as opposed to fine-grained and thus typically hard-to-remember details (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206310386228">Miller, Cardinal, &amp; Glick, 1997</xref>). Second, we collected primarily hard data (such as the education of the founder), which are less susceptible to retrospective biases than perceptual data are. Third, in preparing this research project, we not only conducted a comprehensive pilot study with more than two dozen founders but also pretested the survey instrument with 10 founders. Both the pilot study and the pretest indicated that the founders had no apparent problem in recollecting the requested information. This observation may not be too surprising, because we know that people have a good memory of events that are important or unusual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206310386228">Malhotra, 2009</xref>) and that the creation of a new firm is usually an event of high importance in an individual’s life. Fourth, as previously noted, the concept of opportunity has been clearly defined neither by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310386228">Penrose (1959)</xref> nor in the contemporary entrepreneurship literature (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206310386228">Short et al., 2010</xref>). Although our pretests indicated that the multistage survey questions used for the present study adequately captured the market opportunity count of founders of technology ventures, we performed additional analysis in order to cross-validate our measure with other measures in our survey instrument. In particular, theoretical considerations would suggest that founders who analyzed multiple opportunities (1) spent a longer time on pre-entry planning and organizing activities and (2) would, on average, be more likely to identify highly innovative market opportunities. The pairwise correlations indicate strong support for these assumptions—for (1) <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 and for (2) <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05—thus providing further support for the measurement used in the present research. In sum, these arguments suggest that retrospective bias should not be a major concern in the present study. Nonetheless, we encourage scholars to engage in longitudinal research on the construction of the firm’s opportunity set, as such research would enable scholars to obtain a fairly detailed understanding of agents’ behavioral processes and thus could complement the present large-scale empirical findings. In this vein, one apparent challenge is the effective sampling of hard-to-detect emerging firms that are also heterogeneous in terms of their founding team composition.</p>

<p>In this article, we have offered a theory and empirical analysis of how a technology firm’s initial human capital endowment shapes the identification of market opportunities for its resources. Our research highlights that entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial imagination are intrinsically important in the resource-based framework. Several interesting opportunities for further research emerge from our findings. In particular, we believe that one promising avenue of future work is to link our research to the notion of speciation, a concept from evolutionary biology that has been borrowed for the study of technological developments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0149206310386228">Levinthal, 1998</xref>) and that also seems to be instructive for research on firm emergence. In the event that a sufficiently novel market opportunity is identified, then we might expect a very different type of new firm—and potentially a new species of firms (i.e., industry)—to be spawned. One may argue that the greater the number of alternative market opportunities considered, the broader the range of organizational habitats identified, and therefore the more likely an exploratory speciation opportunity will be identified.</p>
<p>Our findings also indicate interesting research issues related to the founding team. Because our findings clearly suggest that some team configurations are superior for the opportunity identification stage, future research may want to study the tensions that might exist between configurations facilitating opportunity identification and configurations facilitating the implementation and exploitation of an opportunity. Furthermore, researchers may want to examine the role of social status within founding teams composed of individuals with different knowledge and experience backgrounds. It seems that people with entrepreneurial experience may have a particularly strong influence on other members of the founding team, given their competence in new firm creation. Along similar lines, it would be worth examining the differential impact that “good” or “bad” prior entrepreneurial experience may have on the opportunity identification behavior in technology ventures.</p>
<p>Third, while it was beyond the scope of the present article to investigate what becomes of the subjective opportunity sets created by founders prior to the initial market entry, we want to encourage scholars to do just that in a logical next step that may provide further insights into the underpinnings of new firm creation, diversification, and growth. For example, researchers might ask how firm founders exploit market opportunity sets over time, how they diversify, and which growth trajectories unfold. Notably, these insights would prove interesting not only to strategy and entrepreneurship researchers but also to innovation and marketing scholars.</p>

<p>Within each of the broader market domains suggested by different application areas, it is possible to further delineate more fine-grained market segments—such as selling humidity sensors to hotels or to trucking companies. Arguably, it is more challenging to detect that the underlying plastic can be leveraged across the different application areas than across closely related market segments within a particular area.</p>

<p>Because individuals’ cognitive bases evolve from their experiences, demographic attributes are indicators of their qualities. Although demographic attributes do not covary perfectly with cognitive characteristics, studies of top management teams show that they can serve as useful proxies for the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0149206310386228">Taylor &amp; Greve, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0149206310386228">Wiersema &amp; Bantel, 1992</xref>). They also offer the benefit that they can be assessed relatively objectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206310386228">Hambrick &amp; Mason, 1984</xref>).</p>

<p>Note that our companion study examined the performance effects associated with the identification of multiple opportunities, but the sample used in that study was restricted to 83 observations, whereas the present study draws on the unrestricted and, thus, larger sample.</p>

<p>Count measures such as the one used in this study are frequently used in entrepreneurship and innovation research. For instance, the measure used in the present research is similar to opportunity (venture idea) count measures utilized in studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0149206310386228">Singh (2000)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0149206310386228">Shepherd and DeTienne (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0149206310386228">Ucbasaran, Westhead, and Wright (2009)</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206310386228">Hill and Birkinshaw (2010)</xref>. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0149206310386228">Zahra and George (2002</xref>: 199) proposed that transformation capability (as one capability in the absorptive capacity construct) could be captured as “the number of new product ideas.” Studies in innovation often utilize patent counts to measure the productivity of inventors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206310386228">Narin &amp; Breitzman, 1995</xref>).</p>

<p>While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0149206310386228">Penrose (1959)</xref> focused on the firm’s internal resources, external factors such as the structure of the industry (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206310386228">Lien &amp; Klein, 2009</xref>) play an important role in the evaluation of market opportunities, as they are key in the founders’ subjective assessment as to which organizational habitat (or habitats) may provide the best conditions for prosperous firm development.</p>

<p>Although specialized knowledge is usually collected at the expense of generalist knowledge, we note that individuals can have simultaneous strength in some or all experience domains discussed in this study. Hence, as our empirical measurement follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0149206310386228">Wiersema and Bantel’s (1992)</xref> suggestion to use the average level of a given trait to represent the group’s overall characterization, future studies may want to assess the effects of multiple types of experience endowments per team member.</p>
