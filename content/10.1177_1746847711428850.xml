<p>Rotoshop, a proprietary digital incarnation of rotoscoping, has been discussed as a visually innovative process, but its capacity to tread new ground aurally has been overlooked.

<title>Introduction: Rotoshop and the concept of innovation</title>
<p>Rotoshop, as explained elsewhere in this themed issue, was developed by Bob Sabiston as a proprietary digital incarnation of rotoscoping, the animation practice in which the artist draws over live-action images. Rotoshop has been discussed as a <italic>visually</italic> innovative process, but its capacity to tread new ground <italic>aurally</italic> has been overlooked. This may not be surprising as the sound production practices associated with Rotoshop are not obviously innovative. However, in relation to one aspect of the soundtrack, namely the diegetic voice, there is a particular impetus for thinking through its place in the Rotoshop films to date.</p>
<p>Rotoshop animations have displayed a marked interest in capturing <italic>speaking</italic> human subjects. The process was originally developed for <italic>Project Incognito</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746847711428850">1997</xref>, dir. Bob Sabiston), a series of 25 animated interviews with people in Washington Square Park. The interview format was retained for subsequent Rotoshop shorts such as <italic>Roadhead</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1746847711428850">1998</xref>, dir. Bob Sabiston), <italic>Figures of Speech</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1746847711428850">1999</xref>, dir. Bob Sabiston), the ‘Topic Pot Pie’ shorts for the PBS series <italic>Life 360</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1746847711428850">2002</xref>, dir. Bob Sabiston)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1746847711428850">1</xref></sup> and <italic>Grasshopper</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1746847711428850">2003</xref>, dir. Bob Sabiston), while the monologue has grounded examples such as <italic>Snack and Drink</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746847711428850">1999</xref>, dir. Bob Sabiston), <italic>The Even More Fun Trip</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1746847711428850">2007</xref>, dir. Bob Sabiston) and the ‘Talk to Chuck’ adverts for the banking company Charles Schwab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1746847711428850">2005–2008</xref>). In addition, each episode of the satirical series, ‘Get Your War On’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1746847711428850">2008</xref>), produced for the online newspaper <italic>The Huffington Post</italic>, is based around a telephone conversation. <italic>Waking Life</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1746847711428850">2001</xref>, dir. Richard Linklater), the first Rotoshop feature, is dialogue-heavy, featuring monologues and extended philosophical discussions. Furthermore, as I will argue, the relationship of voice to human identity is explored as a central theme of the second Rotoshop feature, <italic>A Scanner Darkly</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1746847711428850">2006</xref>, dir. Richard Linklater).</p>
<p>The focus on ‘talking heads’ in these films makes them particularly suitable for an investigation into how relationships between body and voice are affected when new ways of presenting bodies on-screen are developed. In 1999, this more general question was raised by Michel Chion, through a new epilogue to the English-language translation of his <italic>The Voice in Cinema</italic> (first published in French in 1984). The epilogue is entitled ‘Cinema’s Voices of the ‘80s and ‘90s’ and in it Chion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746847711428850">1999</xref>[1984]: 171) claims:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>A considerable number of recent movies, not only fantasy films, have focused not so much on altering voices (an old technique, so nothing startling or innovative there) as on discovering new relationships – shocking, terrifying, or picturesque – between voice and body … today filmmakers go much farther in the alteration of bodies, which can engender new possibilities in the relation between body and voice.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite the emphasis on Rotoshop as a visually groundbreaking process, Chion provides a way of considering its potential for a particular type of sonic innovation by suggesting that novel ways of altering bodies on-screen (a visual phenomenon) can involve a reimagining of the relationship between those bodies and their accompanying voices. The key word here, however, is ‘can’: innovation in the voice/body relationship is by no means a necessary consequence of this animation process, and voice and body in Rotoshop can exist in very traditional formations as well as altered ones. In this article, I will discuss an unusual representation of voice in the avowedly experimental short <italic>Figures of Speech</italic>. However, much more tentative innovations are apparent in the coupling (or uncoupling) of voice and body in the feature-length Rotoshop films, <italic>Waking Life</italic> and <italic>A Scanner Darkly</italic>.</p>
<p>The differences in the scale of innovation have, no doubt, something to do with the contrasting production contexts and artistic mindsets involved in making, on the one hand, a short film (<italic>Figures of Speech</italic>) for ITVS, a non-profit independent public television service, and, on the other, a feature-length movie for Indiewood studios (<italic>Waking Life</italic> was distributed by Fox Searchlight and <italic>A Scanner Darkly</italic> by Warner Independent Pictures). In the latter cases, formal experimentation is tempered – rather than completely disallowed – by the perceived need to, variously, prioritize narrative over spectacle, showcase star performances and adhere to conventions of cinematic realism. The analysis of <italic>A Scanner Darkly</italic> and <italic>Waking Life</italic> will consider the extent to which new voice/body relationships are suggested in the context of these potential ‘constraints’. The commentary that precedes it, on <italic>Figures of Speech</italic>, demonstrates what <italic>can</italic> happen to the voice’s connection to the body when formal experimentation is asserted as a production priority.</p>
<p>Before exploring how voice and body have been related in practice in Rotoshop animation, it is necessary to identify the assumptions made in defining innovation in this context. Following Chion’s line of argument, this involves briefly rehearsing claims about Rotoshop’s innovative process in terms of the visual representation of the body, and then considering how voice may enter into a relationship with the image.</p>
<p>As Caroline Ruddell argues in her article in this themed issue, Rotoshop allows a creative play between the digitally animated line and its live-action referent, resulting in a ‘unique expression of the human form’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1746847711428850">Ruddell, 2012</xref>). Paul Ward notes the tendency of Rotoshop to refigure the live-action footage in simpler assemblies of line, colour and texture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1746847711428850">Ward, 2005</xref>: 164), while Nick Bradshaw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1746847711428850">2006</xref>: 43) suggests that the multiplaning effects associated with Rotoshop can complicate the presentation of a ‘natural unity’ between different visual elements. Whether conceived as the producer of a creative tension between animated and photoreal forms or as a procedure that simplifies or complicates the live-action raw material, Rotoshop is seen to possess the capacity to present objects, including bodies, in radically altered visual forms.</p>
<p>For Chion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746847711428850">1999</xref>[1984]: 174), one of the consequences of the increased ‘alteration of bodies’ on-screen is the following:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>The voice is ceasing to be identified with a specific face. It appears much less stable, identified, hence fetishizable. This general realization that the voice is radically other than the body that adopts it (or that it adopts) for the duration of a film seems to me to be one of the most significant phenomena in the recent development of the cinema, television, and audiovisual media in general.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Chion finds the acknowledged separation of voice from a particular face to be an especially noteworthy development because it counters notions of audio-visual synchronization that have become entrenched in the writing on, and practice of, voice in cinema. As will be outlined presently, the principle of synchronization between voice and body has been adopted as the norm in both live action and animated film. The extent of deviation from this norm will, therefore, centrally inform my characterization of particular Rotoshop examples as more or less innovative.</p>
<p>In practice, adherence to the lip-sync norm is more common in Rotoshop animation than deviation from it. One aim of this article is to understand how lip-sync conventions have transferred from live-action film to animation and, subsequently, Rotoshop. This aspect of the argument is discussed in the following section, in which I analyse working practices in animation around voice and synchronization, in terms of their relationship to lip-sync theory developed with reference to live action cinema.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1746847711428850">
<title>Lip-sync: the persistence of an aural tradition</title>
<p>David Laderman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1746847711428850">2008</xref>: 273) notes:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Synchronized sound continues to be the dominant film sound design principle. Michel Chion’s notion of ‘synchresis’ – the appearance in film of a ‘spontaneous coupling of sound and image’ – proves to be the persistent, pervasive underlying concept: most film sound seems to come from, or be linked to, something visual (even if off-screen or subjective).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Laderman’s referencing of Chion to bolster his initial claim about the dominance of synchronized sound underlines the recurrent noting of the principle, from the polemic against sync sound by Soviet Montage filmmakers in the late 1920s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1746847711428850">Eisenstein et al., 1992[1928]</xref>) to the aesthetic and ideological probings of more contemporary writers such as Chion, Rick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1746847711428850">Altman (1980)</xref> and Mary Ann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1746847711428850">Doane (1980)</xref>.</p>
<p>Within this practice, the synchronization between voice and lip movement has been adjudged the most crucial. Doane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1746847711428850">1980</xref>: 34–35), for example, notes:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>There is no doubt that synchronization (in the form of ‘lip-sync’) has played a major role in the dominant narrative cinema … in practice, the level of the dialogue generally determines the levels of sound effects and music. Despite a number of experiments with other types of sound/image relationships, synchronous dialogue remains the dominant form of sonorous representation in the cinema … Sound carries with it the potential risk of exposing the material heterogeneity of the medium; attempts to contain that risk surface in the language of the ideology of organic unity.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, Doane indicates both dominant narrative cinema’s ideological investment in the principle of synchronization (which disguises the actual heterogeneity of sound and image in favour of a naturalized unity) and its vococentrism, which suggests a privileging of the human body, with attached voice, as the key site through which belief in the unified nature of the film is guaranteed. These sentiments are echoed by Rick Altman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1746847711428850">1980</xref>: 69):</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>If it is the dialogue, the language, the words which count, then why show lips moving in time with the sound track? We can best answer this question by recognizing the effect of those moving lips: they transfer the origin of the words, as perceived by the spectator/auditor, from sound ‘track’ and loudspeaker to a character within the film’s diegesis. To put it another way, pointing the camera at the speaker disguises the source of the words, dissembling the work of production and technology.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The centrality of lip-sync to cinema’s effect of transparency is maintained in animation that makes use of voice. In fact, conventional animation production practices are even more vococentric than those for live action cinema. Typically, dialogue is recorded before the animation stage as a guide for the animator: voice, therefore, <italic>precedes</italic> image, with the visuals shaped around the pre-recorded voice. The importance of synchronization as a principle through which to tie image to voice is indicated in the very term given to this initial recorded speech: sync dialogue.</p>
<p>The availability of specialist lip-sync animation software such as Magpie Pro also indicates the desirability of voice synchronization for animators, as does the common practice of filming actors recording the sync dialogue to give the animator a visual reference with which to facilitate the drawing of ‘realistic’ lip movement. The practical guide, <italic>Action! Acting Lessons for CG Animators</italic>, devotes a whole chapter to the issue of lip-sync, and is indicative in the importance it attributes to the practice:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Lip sync is one of those thankless ‘invisible’ animation tasks: the goal of lip sync is for it to be as unnoticed as possible. Like a goalie in soccer, if you do your job right no one even notices that you’ve spent a great deal of time syncing your character’s mouth; it’s only when you ‘let one slip by’ and something calls attention to itself that people notice – and complain. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1746847711428850">Kundert-Gibbs and Kundert-Gibbs, 2009</xref>: 292)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Lip-sync is, therefore, the dominant norm, for both live action and animation. This may be seen to be disappointingly conservative, given the potential influence Steven Connor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1746847711428850">2000</xref>: 11), discussing the introduction of sound in the 1920s, attributes to speech over the representation of the body in animated films:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>The fact of speech gives them new movement and new possibilities of movement, including the possibility of impossible, or fantastic kinds of movement, as the body stretches and contorts into the postures dictated by its utterance.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The promise identified here is the reverse of that asserted by Chion. Whereas Chion explores how new visual practices may alter the relationship between body and voice, Connor considers the visual repercussions of a new soundtrack practice. Although Connor does not explicitly attend to the way the mouth might be animated in relation to voice, the attention is on how speech might inspire a ‘fantastic’ movement in the animated body (of which the mouth is, of course, a part) rather than a ‘realist’ one (for which lip-syncing would be mandatory). For both Chion and Connor, new developments in either image or sound practice have the potential to displace lip-sync as the primary mechanism by which voice and body are related.</p>
<p>To what extent, then, might the specific production practices of Rotoshop lend themselves to the alternatives to lip-sync suggested by Chion and Connor? On the one hand, Rotoshop seems particularly suited to the attainment of a ‘realistically’ animated lip movement to correspond with the voice as the Rotoshop animator is digitally tracing over live-action footage of moving lips. However, fidelity to the live-action source does not <italic>have</italic> to be maintained, and, indeed, the elastic manner in which the animation traces the contours of live action movement can be seen as a defining feature of Rotoshop’s visual aesthetic. Thus, the extent to which realistic lip movement and hard voice sync <italic>are</italic> evident in Rotoshop films, amidst the liberties the animation takes with the live-action footage otherwise, suggests the pervasiveness of lip-sync ideology. It is against this backdrop that the following example, from the collection of shorts <italic>Figures of Speech</italic>, appears so exceptional.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1746847711428850">
<title>(Mis)<italic>Figures of speech</italic>: audio-visual elasticity in Rotoshop</title>
<p><italic>Figures of Speech</italic> comprises a collection of 12 three- to four-minute interviews with subjects filmed between Austin and San Francisco in 1999 and animated just before work began on the first Rotoshop feature, <italic>Waking Life</italic>. On his production company’s website, Bob Sabiston claims ‘the animation in these things is the wildest and weirdest we’ve ever done’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1746847711428850">2</xref></sup> and one sign of this is the flexibility with which lips are visualized and the relationship between voice and mouth is proposed.</p>
<p>Of the interviews accessible online, the ‘Katie Roth’ film is the one that plays most freely with the visual representation of the mouth and its relationship to voice. Here, a young San Franciscan woman talks about her search for a job and, especially, her relationship with an older man which she has decided should end. This talking head is animated in a plethora of styles: there are 21 distinct segments in the film, each visualizing the interviewee in a different way, with no dominant style apparent and no sense that one type of representation is morphing ‘naturally’ into the next.</p>
<p>This means that the film finds at least 21 different ways to visualize Katie’s mouth and the rapidity of the visual turnover, in itself, destabilizes the notion that the lips constitute a tethering mechanism within an image otherwise subject to fluid transformation. Over the course of the film, Katie’s lips range from the pencil-thin to the comically over-inflated. Her teeth are represented individually, but also as a solid block of white filling the mouth, as two solid rows, and, sometimes, are not visualized at all. The colours used to represent her lips and teeth are also in a constant state of flux, not only between the distinct sections but also within two segments that adopt an ever-changing visual palette.</p>
<p>The detachment of lips from teeth, so that they drift around the rest of the mouth, rather than posing as an integrated unit, is another aspect of the film’s visual aesthetic. This is apparent in the first of the two segments in which the colour of the lips is changed in rapid sequence. Here it is the teeth, represented as two solid chunks of brown, with a yellow mouth behind them, that remain steadfast, whilst the lips change colour and slide around the rest of the mouth loosely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1746847711428850">Figure 1</xref>, top left). In this way, even though the overall movement of the mouth offers some correspondence to the vocal sounds, the lips are no longer solely of interest because of their synchronization with a human voice. Instead, they are allowed to join in with the spectacle of animation in flux that is the hallmark of the Rotoshop process visually.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1746847711428850-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>A subsequent segment also uses chunky, bright blocks of colour to visualize the mouth, but without the constantly changing palette of colours. In this moment, the detachment of lips from the rest of the mouth is combined with a lip-layering technique: inflated purple lips twist and turn over a set of pink lips that remain horizontal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1746847711428850">Figure 1</xref>, top right), allowing the film to present two ways of matching mouth to voice simultaneously, neither of which is predicated on a principle of precise synchronization. The pink lips are overly rigid (they cannot always ‘follow’ the movement of the teeth they should encompass (also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1746847711428850">Figure 1</xref>, top right), whilst the purple ones are comically elastic, ‘tripping over themselves’ as Katie vocalizes her indecisiveness over determining the course of her relationship (‘and I’m like, but I, but I, but I, and I, and I, and he, and if, and what about, and what if, but did he really mean this and that, or the other thing?’). The vocal flourish gives rise to two completely different styles of mouth animation, one exaggeratedly ‘unformed’, the other contrastingly static. Attention is drawn to the visual interplay between these two animation styles – which in turn offer comment on the content of the speech – rather than settling mouth and voice into an ‘organic’ relationship with one another.</p>
<p>In addition, there are moments in <italic>Figures of Speech</italic> where lip-sync is abandoned entirely. When Katie says ‘I’m not too happy about my plans for the rest of the day’, her mouth is composed of a dark grey upper lip, two rows of white to indicate her teeth, with a dark grey gap in between the rows, and a lighter grey bottom lip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1746847711428850">Figure 1</xref>, middle left). On her next word, ‘actually’, the different components of her face fall apart, with each lip floating upwards and the two rows of teeth forming a solid triangular block of white that drifts downwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1746847711428850">Figure 1</xref>, middle right). At the same time, Katie’s eyes fall downwards and, within the time it takes her to say ‘actually’ and get towards the end of her next word ‘because’, her face has been reconstituted into a form similar to the one it adopted before its fleeting decomposition: the lips have been transformed into her eyes and the eyes have turned into her lips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1746847711428850">Figure 1</xref>, bottom left). The impression given is that Katie’s face is composed of jigsaw pieces that can fit in any combination.</p>
<p>Clearly, lip-sync cannot be maintained while the mouth falls apart in such dramatic fashion. Whilst the face is reconstituted very quickly, it is significant that the collapse occurs across words rather than simply in the gap between them. An interest is created in the visual capacities of Rotoshop that overrides the desire to coordinate voice and body as a united front: the movement in the image is allowed to take its ‘natural’ course rather than being squeezed into a gap in which there is no competing speech.</p>
<p>The counterpart to the visual collapse of the mouth into discrete components is a moment in which the mouth remains static at a point when it should be in motion, according to lip-sync conventions. The off-screen interviewer has just suggested to Katie that breaking up with her boyfriend will be difficult, to which Katie says ‘I know, because just look at me, even talking about him I smile, you know, I am so screwed.’ The shot that covers this line is out of keeping with the rest of the film, which concentrates on the whole of Katie’s face and, occasionally, features wider shots that incorporate her face and body. Here, though, Katie is framed inelegantly from chest up to the top of her mouth, with the rest of her face disappearing off-screen. As Katie talks about her inability not to smile when discussing her boyfriend, she points both hands towards her mouth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1746847711428850">Figure 1</xref>, bottom right).</p>
<p>Here, special attention is drawn to Katie’s mouth in four ways: through the unusual framing which absents the other significant facial features from the shot and places the mouth in a section of the frame where there are few competing visual elements; through the exaggeratedly bold depiction of the mouth (chunky deep red lips, set apart and with the upper lip drawn as a pout, filled with an unbroken block of white); through the gesturing of the hands towards the mouth; and through dialogue which is explicitly about the mouth’s activities at that moment (observed to be both producing speech and smiling).</p>
<p>Uncannily, despite all these visual and aural cues, the mouth’s movement is characterized by stasis and a relative inflexibility. The mouth moves as a fixed unit to a limited extent, but there is no visual registering of the opening and closing that would be necessary to project a voice. Given the direction of the conversation, it might be possible to see the visual depiction of the mouth as a representation of the smile that Katie claims comes involuntarily to her. However, the mouth is not drawn as a smile and what is made apparent instead is the ability of Rotoshop to isolate a visual element and give it an individual sense of animation, unconnected to the laws of human physiology or the effects of human psychology. At just the moment in the film where the capacity of the human mouth to talk and to make socially symbolic gestures is registered in the dialogue, the decision is taken to animate the mouth in a style that explores abstract qualities of shape, colour and movement. The mouth here exists as a figure, but distinctly <italic>not</italic> one of speech.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1746847711428850">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Voice in <italic>A Scanner Darkly</italic>: Rotoshop and the voco-real</title>
<p>The instance of Katie’s smile in <italic>Figures of Speech</italic> fulfils Chion’s suggestion that new ways of representing the body visually can inspire new relationships between voice and body. The example also elaborates on Connor’s sketching of the possibilities of body animation allowed by the introduction of speech. Speech becomes the occasion for a ‘stretching’ and ‘contorting’ of a particular body part, the mouth, in a way that allows the film to slip away, momentarily, from the strictures of lip-sync. The radical nature of the visualization of the mouth in this short is thrown into sharper relief when compared with the much more conventional manner in which voice and mouth are coupled in <italic>A Scanner Darkly</italic>, the most high-profile (and expensive) Rotoshop animation to date. An organic relationship between voice and body is stressed in the film’s animation style and also made important to its thematic exploration of human identity under threat. In addition, the conventional use of lip-sync is part of the film’s presentation of Keanu Reeves as a particular kind of star.</p>
<p><italic>A Scanner Darkly</italic> is an adaptation of a Philip K Dick novel, in which Bob Arctor (Keanu Reeves), a narcotics agent working in the near future, has been drafted in to infiltrate a small group suspected of trafficking the drug Substance D. When involved in public agency business, Arctor’s identity is protected by a scramble suit: an outfit that screens the wearer’s body with a constantly shifting combination of different facial features and clothing. The suit also contains a voice disguiser that protects the wearer’s aural identity. Arctor is introduced inside his scramble suit giving a scripted speech about the importance of fighting the drug’s distribution. Significantly, his first words are registered through an extreme close-up of his lips. The relationship between the disguised voice and the one that is recognizably that of Keanu Reeves, as well as the relationship of each voice to its visual source, is established here and the manner in which this is achieved indicates the film’s adherence to the conventions of lip-sync.</p>
<p>The first disclosure of Arctor is as a small figure seated at the back of a wide shot of a conference room (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1746847711428850">Figure 2</xref>, top left). The moment that brings the viewer closer to Arctor and reveals Keanu Reeves’s star face in Rotoshopped form, is a visually striking one. It features an ‘impossible’ virtual camera movement through the suit, with an abstract play of patterns registered as the camera penetrates its surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1746847711428850">Figure 2</xref>, top right).</p>

</fig>
<p>Here, despite Rotoshop’s involvement of the live-action image in its process, the pictorial qualities of the animation are privileged over any mimetic ambitions, the balance between the photoreal and the more abstractly animated tipped very much towards the latter: what is being highlighted is the capacity of the virtual camera to traverse physical barriers and the ability of the animator to visually enhance a movement that has no real-life referent.</p>
<p>However, the traces of live-action footage become much more visible as the shot comes to its end, with the camera panning down Arctor’s, and therefore Reeves’s, face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1746847711428850">Figure 2</xref>, bottom left). Two things are striking about this shot, within the film’s visual economy and the conventions of narrative cinema more generally: first, Arctor/Reeves is shown in an extreme close-up, of a type that has no equivalent in the rest of the film. Second, Arctor addresses the camera directly, in a manner that recurs when he is subsequently shown within his scramble suit, but finds no correlation in the film otherwise.</p>
<p>At this point, then, the film’s visual strategies give the viewer every opportunity to recognize the face as that of Keanu Reeves: the live-action referent dominates after a passage in which the image’s uniquely animated qualities have been foregrounded. The rebalancing of the image towards the terms of the photoreal is exacerbated by the heavy-set dark lines that are used to establish the contours of Arctor/Reeves’s face. As Ruddell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1746847711428850">2012</xref>, this issue) observes with reference to Arctor, the animated line is particularly ‘set’ in relation to this character, eschewing the flexible and mutating potential of the Rotoshop process (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1746847711428850">Ward, 2012</xref>, this issue).</p>
<p>The recognizability of the star face is supported by the appearance on the soundtrack of the star voice. Arctor’s first line – ‘this is terrible’ – is given a dramatic emphasis that showcases Reeves’s performance of it: in relation to the aural elements that surround it, it is an intimately ‘human’ voice: the fact that it is a whisper, albeit a pronounced one, indicates an organic controlling of volume that contrasts to the artificially ‘miked-up’ hall echo effect on the voice of the man who introduces Arctor; the slight catch in Reeves’s voice also brings to the soundtrack a human grain that contrasts with the high-pitched shimmering electronic soundtrack playing non-diegetically. These aspects of the vocal performance are complemented by a visual showcasing that also emphasizes intimacy, in the extreme close-up of the mouth and the use of direct address, and indicates the solidly human, in the definite nature of the thick lines that render Arctor’s face.</p>
<p>In the first close-up of Arctor/Reeves, the Rotoshop process is used in a manner that evokes the photoreal: this animated image has, at its source, a living human body capable of projecting a voice through a series of coordinated physical movements. The uncanny ‘floatiness’ often associated with Rotoshop animation (and exploited in parts of <italic>Figures of Speech</italic>) is only present here on a small patch of the screen, Arctor’s teeth seeming to float loosely in his mouth. Rather than diminishing the lip-sync effect, the looseness of the teeth <italic>bolsters</italic> the sense of the <italic>lips</italic> being something contrastingly solid and capable of moving in time with organically produced sound.</p>
<p>After this, the film provides an exterior view of Arctor, clothed in his scramble suit, so that he is seen and heard from the perspective of the audience within the film (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1746847711428850">Figure 2</xref>, bottom right). In one way, the scramble suit represents the Rotoshop process at its animated extreme: live-action footage of a recognizable star playing a fictional character is taken and then worked upon by an animation that assumes a life of its own, drawing attention to the performance and production processes. The distortion between Reeves’s original performance and the one evident in the scramble suit scenes of the finished film is exacerbated by the replacement of his voice in these instances by the distorted voice of another actor, Steve Allen.</p>
<p>There is a difference, though, between the visual and the aural displacement of Reeves in the exterior moments of the scramble suit scenes. Visually, Reeves’s performance is clothed in a myriad of constantly shifting alter egos, the animation displaying the instability and flexibility of line described by Ruddell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1746847711428850">2012</xref>, this issue). Aurally, however, the performance is subject to a single, inflexible displacement. It is significant that the animation still attempts to match lip movement to the spoken word even as one set of lips rapidly morphs into the next. The voice acts to anchor the ever-evolving visual movements to something solid. It takes on neither a flexible vocal character that would mimic aurally the fluid transformations taking place visually, nor a temporal relationship to mouth movement that would disturb the sense of the voice and body’s supposed unity. Instead, it provides a sense of the <italic>vocal</italic> real, even at those moments when the real star’s voice is substituted by another.</p>
<p>This establishes a secure place for voice spatially and temporally, but also thematically, as speech becomes an important indicator of Arctor’s individuality as a human being. In this introductory scene, Arctor imposes his own personality on the lines he is being fed by disagreeing with their sentiments (‘this is terrible’) and diverting from his script. His subsequent breakdown, due to his own addiction to Substance D, is indicated, at points, by his inability to form coherent sentences and, during his ‘rehabilitation’ at a centre that is secretly responsible for producing the drug, his propensity only to repeat phrases spoken by his conversational partners. His physical breakdown (which leads to him being taken into rehab) is prefigured by him listening to a tape recording of his own voice that has been doctored by his housemate Barris (Robert Downey Jr), who is trying to incriminate him. Here, the technological extraction of voice from body prefigures his final collapse, offering the impression that Arctor finds the idea of the uncoupling of speech from its organic source too hard to bear. In terms of the film’s formal, rather than thematic, operations, this separation is never allowed to occur.</p>
<p>In his contribution to this themed issue, Paul <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1746847711428850">Ward (2012)</xref> discusses the troubled production history of <italic>A Scanner Darkly</italic>, which resulted in a more standardized animation process than was originally envisaged. An article in the technology magazine <italic>Wired</italic> describes how Bob Sabiston and his team were fired from the project, due to, among other things, a lack of coordination between animators’ different styles, to be replaced by a group of animators working to the dictates of a style manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1746847711428850">La Franco, 2006</xref>). It is impossible to predict whether the original team would have produced a more experimental aesthetic in terms of the voice/body relationship, but it is true that the final product does exhibit a consistent adherence to lip-sync that conforms to the practice’s pervasiveness in animation more generally. Rotoshop’s potential to ‘riff’ around, rather than simply replicate, its live-action visual template, is subdued in favour of a ‘photoreal’ aesthetic and this is accompanied by a preference for the ‘voco-real’. Even during the scramble suit scenes, when the film’s fictional premise gives licence to a more fluid animation style, the rapid facial transformations are anchored to an unchanging voice, tethered visually to the speaker’s lips with an insistence that contrasts with the variations experimented with in <italic>Figures of Speech</italic>. The result is that voice and body collaborate seamlessly in the construction of identity, whether a robotic one (in the scramble suit scenes) or an organic one.</p>
<p>This coherence is necessary in the context of a film that seeks to solicit the viewer’s interest in and identification with a set of characters, involved in a linearly plotted narrative. The attachment of a particular voice with a particular body needs to be made clear to convince the viewer of the characters’ individual qualities, qualities which are placed under threat, variously, by the deadening effects of Substance D and the oppressive operation of the futuristic surveillance state that the film depicts. Indeed, the film’s late surprise revelation is enabled by the consistency with which a singular robotic voice is matched with a particular scramble-suited figure and a recognizable untreated voice accompanies human figures. In this twist, Arctor’s boss, Hank, hitherto only seen in ‘his’ scramble suit, is revealed to be Arctor’s girlfriend, Donna (performed by Winona Ryder).</p>
<p>The consistent coupling of voice and body also helps to support the film’s showcasing of Keanu Reeves’s star performance. Rotoshop has the potential to disguise the visual identity of its stars completely. The performance of Ryder as Hank is a case in point. Even if it is accepted that Ryder was responsible for the live-action performance of this character, this is not at all evident in the finished film. For most of its duration, Hank appears to be an utterly distinct character to Donna (who <italic>does</italic> resemble Ryder visually and vocally) and is coded as male in obvious ways (e.g. by the character’s name and by the ‘masculine’ qualities of his distorted voice, provided by Mark Turner). It is only in the moment late on, in which Hank pulls off his scramble suit, that the connection is made between Donna and Hank (and Ryder as the performer of both: the action is conveyed in a continuous shot).</p>
<p>Extra-textual material could work to ‘excavate’ Ryder’s performance of Hank, thereby encouraging viewers to understand her status and skill as an actor and star in a particular way. However, this has not been a significant strand in the official publicity around the film or in ‘unofficial’ public discourse such as internet forums. In any case, in terms of the moment-by-moment unfolding of the film, the viewer is not invited to think about Ryder’s qualities as a performer in relation to Hank.</p>
<p>The situation is different with regard to Reeves’s performance. Exceptionally, Reeves figures throughout as a presence who is both disclosed and undisclosed through the animation, as his character is viewed from both exterior and interior perspectives. This is symptomatic of the privilege given the performer within the film’s fictional world: Reeves’s star voice and face are allowed an immediate comparison with different ways of presenting the same character, visually and aurally, and this serves to pinpoint the <italic>unique</italic> qualities Reeves brings to the part.</p>
<p>Kim Louise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1746847711428850">Walden (2008)</xref> suggests that the ‘vacuous’ and ‘blank’ qualities of the Reeves persona lend themselves well to a role that is about the wiping out of a character’s identity. I would argue, though, that the Reeves voice, at least, is bestowed with qualities of humanness, sensitivity and personality in <italic>A Scanner Darkly</italic>, by immediate comparison with the robotic tones of his character’s scramble-suited alter ego. As such, this might suggest a development of the existing star persona, rather than a straightforward confirmation of it.</p>
<p>The alignment of Reeves with a voco-real aesthetic produces a performance that discovers hitherto undervalued qualities in his voice. In this sense, the technological process through which the performance is engineered encourages a familiar star voice to be considered anew. The potential ‘renewal’ in terms of star persona, however, is only made possible by the retention of a conservative aesthetic in the way voice is coupled to body.</p>

<title>Voice in <italic>Waking Life</italic>: roto-realism and slip-sync alternatives</title>
<p>Ruddell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1746847711428850">2012</xref>, this issue) contrasts the uniform solidness of the line in <italic>A Scanner Darkly</italic>, stipulated by the style manual to which the animators had to adhere, with the flexible fashion in which the line moves around its live-action referent in the other Rotoshop feature, <italic>Waking Life</italic>. The latter film is dialogue-heavy, featuring talking heads expounding philosophical ideas to a central character who is never sure whether he is in a waking or dream state. The enhanced flexibility of the animation style, together with the emphasis the film places on speech, holds forth the possibility of an increased experimentation in articulating the relationship between body and voice, in a feature-film setting. However, voice is generally delivered through an adherence to synchronized lip movement, even when the speaker’s body is otherwise subject to visual distortion. Although this is a film about dreams, the dominant principle relating voice to body is a realist one, with a particular version of realism articulated as the cornerstone aesthetic in a key passage of the film, which I analyse presently. Nevertheless, there are also moments of slip-sync,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1746847711428850">4</xref></sup> in which a more fluid arrangement between voice and body is apparent.</p>
<p>Cinema, as a medium and an exhibition site, is alluded to specifically in one scene in <italic>Waking Life</italic>, entitled ‘The Holy Moment’, in which the protagonist floats into a movie theatre and watches a film featuring an exchange about Andre Bazin’s notion of the ontology of cinema and its special claims to realism. The conversation is between filmmaker Caveh Zahedi and poet David Jewell and starts with Zahedi stating that ‘cinema in its essence is, well it’s about the reproduction of reality.’ He represents Bazin’s claim that film has an intense relationship to reality, in terms of its ability to capture the specifics of the profilmic event: ‘it’s about <italic>that</italic> guy at <italic>that</italic> moment in <italic>that</italic> space’. Zahedi notes the theological underpinning of Bazin’s ideas, celebrating film as a record of ‘the ever-changing face of God’ in its capacity to capture people as they really are (that is to say, in this belief system, as manifestations of God). Finally, Zahedi brings the concepts of the ‘moment’ and religious belief together: ‘film can let us see that, you know, can frame it, so that we see, like, “ah! This moment”, you know, holy’.</p>
<p>Visually, Zahedi’s body and face are sketched through bold outlines and his gestures are exaggerated through the Rotoshop process. For example, his hands are disproportionately long as he spreads out his fingers to emphasize the point about the film image being the manifestation of God; his hair blows in the breeze as a solid block of colour, rather than naturalistically.</p>
<p>The stylized effect is enhanced by visual embellishment that emphasizes the connection of Zahedi’s gestures with his words. On the first mention of ‘God’, Zahedi gesticulates with his right hand and this movement leaves a trail of white lines that ‘ping’ into the shape of a star (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1746847711428850">Figure 3</xref>, top left). In the next sentence, the word ‘everything’ is accompanied by a twirling of the hand, generating a swirl of white lines. The use of cartoon effects to emphasize dramatic gestures and vocal delivery is exacerbated on the next utterance of ‘God’, which is accompanied by a ‘punch’ that generates a lightning bolt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1746847711428850">Figure 3</xref>, top right). This is followed by a cupping of both hands on the word ‘creating’ which magically produces a big white star that disappears in a puff of black smoke.</p>
<fig id="fig3-1746847711428850" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1746847711428850-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>These visual embellishments might seem to offer an ironic contrast to a conversation about cinematic realism. However, Zahedi makes clear that Bazin’s notion of realism is not one that simply regards film as a medium that captures the surface appearance of real life. Rather it is one that uncovers a reality held <italic>within</italic> the surface appearance and directs the viewer’s attention to the significance of a moment.</p>
<p>Rather than being ironically juxtaposed to these sentiments, the Rotoshop visual aesthetic operates in a complementary manner. The simplification of line and exaggeration of gesture draw attention to and make significant activity that was already there in the profilmic event. In this way, the capacity Ruddell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1746847711428850">2012</xref>, this issue) sees in Rotoshop to allow for a ‘seeing under’ of the animated image to the live-action referent it traces, is aligned to ideas of cinematic realism that also value the ability of the film image to ‘see under’ the surface appearance of what is captured in the frame.</p>
<p>In relation to voice in the film as a whole, the alignment of Rotoshop with the realist aesthetic advocated by Bazin, via Zahedi, results in the predominant synchronization of voice with the speaker’s body, with any visual embellishment emerging ‘organically’ from the words or their style of delivery. There are numerous instances of this: a woman discusses the extent to which words can also articulate abstract concepts like love, and an image associated with her speech literally escapes from her mouth (a wispy, twinkling cloud emerges as she says ‘the sound comes out of my mouth’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1746847711428850">Figure 3</xref>, bottom left)); an academic discusses the concept of evolution and the film has fun with his impassioned delivery and energetic body language, manufacturing appropriate visual effects when he says ‘telescopic’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1746847711428850">Figure 3</xref>, bottom right), ‘multiplication’ and ‘amplification’; a musician tells the film’s protagonist that ‘fun rules’ and a clown’s face, that had been established as a badge on the lapel of his coat, floats towards the camera. All these examples demonstrate the flexibility of the Rotoshop animation process, with speech encouraging a fantastic movement of the body in the way Steven Connor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1746847711428850">2000</xref>: 11) suggests. However, these instances also remain grounded in material (an utterance, a gesture, an object) that can be assumed to be profilmic in the first instance. There are, though, passages in the film that escape the strictures of a Roto-realist coupling of voice and body.</p>
<p>Slip-sync can occur in any type of film where bodies and voices are combined. It has no special relationship to Rotoshop as such. However, in <italic>Waking Life</italic>, it is notable that the literal synchronization between voice and body is only jeopardized in moments where the medium of audio-visual reproduction is self-consciously alluded to. Specifically, slip-sync is associated in the film with television and cine-film projection. Lip-sync is positioned as the norm that is associated with both the technological spectacle of Rotoshop and 35mm cinema, the dominant qualities of which are explicated in the ‘Holy Moment’ scene. Slip-sync is used here to describe the disturbance of conventional synchronization processes between voice and body in three ways: (1) the ‘slipping away’ of sound (including, but not limited, to voice), that would be expected to synchronize with a particular set of images; (2) the ‘slipping in’ of a voice in synchronization with a seemingly incompatible body; and (3) the ‘slipping around’ of the visual representation of the mouth, with a resultant ‘compromising’ of its role as the element that authenticates the relationship between speaker and voice.</p>
<p>Anything other than straightforward voice-to-body synchronization is first mooted a third of the way into <italic>Waking Life</italic>, in the scene in which a monkey projects a cine-film called ‘Noise and Silence’ for a group of students. This screening is a montage, including excerpts from Akira Kurosawa’s <italic>Dreams</italic> (1990) and a Nirvana concert film. Over this, the monkey reads out a script espousing Situationist ideas about art-making that rejects old forms in favour of ‘the discovery of a true communication’. At the end of his monologue, the monkey takes a bite out of the script, and the film runs out.</p>
<p>The title of the screening, ‘Noise and Silence’, indicates attention to the co-existence of different types of sound. The montage of film clips run silently, with all the noise coming from the sound of the projector and the monkey’s voice, which is strengthened by a microphone, the amplifying quality of which is signalled before he speaks, as the mic is heard thudding against the table on which the projector stands. During the screening of the Bazin discussion, the means of visual and aural projection is kept hidden: it is only at the scene’s very end that a shot of the projector is included. Here, by contrast, there is a deliberate foregrounding of the technology that is producing the audio-visual spectacle contained within the film’s fictional world. Voice becomes part of a non-naturalistic assemblage of sound and vision, with all sounds associated with the bodies in the film clips silenced and a human voice heard to emanate from a non-human form.</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of the film’s dominant ‘invisible’ lip-sync aesthetic, the audio-visual relationship here appears as a new form of communication in the mode described in the monologue, and this is aligned with the presentation of cine-film as a more flexible medium than 35mm. This flexibility is indicated by the mobile, temporary nature of the projector set-up, placed on a school table (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1746847711428850">Figure 4</xref>, top left) and projecting onto a pull-down screen images that have been taken out of their original context and recomposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1746847711428850">Figure 4</xref>, top right). This contrasts with the institutionalized form of 35mm cinema, represented explicitly in ‘The Holy Moment’: even when the projector does appear at the end of this scene, it is viewed in close-up, pointed straight towards the viewer, humming quietly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1746847711428850">Figure 4</xref>, bottom), giving it a fixedness that contrasts with the mobile quality of the technology presented in ‘Noise and Silence’.</p>

</fig>
<p>Lip-sync is preserved to the extent that the monkey’s mouth moves in time with his words. However, there is still a twin challenge to lip-sync ideology here: first, voice is synchronized with a non-human body, in a film that does not otherwise indulge in anthropomorphism; second, human agency fails to produce sound in the conventional manner, as the film clips run silently. As a whole, the scene makes strange the habitual characterization of voice as a sign of the human, in a way that contrasts with <italic>A Scanner Darkly</italic>’s advocacy of the concept, on a formal and thematic level. A different type of challenge to the principle of lip-sync occurs on the two occasions when television, the film’s other alternative to 35mm cinema, is depicted.</p>
<p>In the first instance, the film’s protagonist flicks through a number of channels that are showing different types of programming, including light entertainment (a rodeo show, a DIY fashion show), surreal comedy (a comedian delivers the nonsense line ‘lunatic, macaroni munchkin, with my googat’) and philosophical enquiry (a talking head expounds his ideas about ‘multiple selves’ and another discusses the concept of lucid dreaming).</p>
<p>These excerpts are viewed in rapid succession and present different relationships between voice and vision. Two types of relationship predominate: the first is the reiteration of the Roto-realist lip-sync aesthetic privileged throughout the film. This is evidenced in the only excerpt that is featured more than once in the sequence, that of the philosopher ruminating about the multiple self. Here, any visual embellishment (e.g. starbursts by his mouth as he talks) emanates from a recognizable physical gesture by the speaker. The second relationship involves examples of voices that are not synchronized to on-screen lips but are organized in an arrangement conventionalized over time on television: namely, the use of the voiceover commentator.</p>
<p>Here then, television is portrayed as a medium that habitually features an alternative to the lip-synced voice, namely the off-screen commentary. However, these examples affirm the existence of a televisual convention, rather than challenge lip-sync practice per se. In the sequence, television is also portrayed as being capable of adopting a ‘cinematic’ lip-sync aesthetic.</p>
<p>However, there are two moments which suggest a voice/body aesthetic not aligned to conventions established in either television or dominant cinema. The mouth animations of the comedian spouting gibberish and the woman talking about lucid dreaming are notably more elastic than in the rest of the sequence or in the film as a whole, without abandoning the principle of lip-sync itself. In the comedian’s case, there is a mismatch between the wooden quality of movement of his body and the elasticity of his facial features. These features slide within the frame of his face like a loosely-fitting mask and, even though his lips move in a way that authenticates the accompanying speech as his own, they do so with more exaggeration of gesture than usual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1746847711428850">Figure 5</xref>, top left) and far less precision in timing between lip movement and utterance. Here the visual registration of speech becomes a spectacle in its own right, drawing attention to the pictorial and transfiguring qualities of Rotoshop without tethering the visuals tightly to an anchoring voice.</p>
<fig id="fig5-1746847711428850" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1746847711428850-fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>A similar focus on lip movement as ‘pure’ movement is illustrated through the talking-head shot of the woman speaking about lucid dreaming. Here, the bottom half of the woman’s face provides a surface against which the lips can slide, their movement linked to the similarly free-floating undulation of her glasses and earrings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1746847711428850">Figure 5</xref>, top right). The lips, therefore, are paired with inanimate shapes, rather than being represented as organically tied to the body. The spectacle becomes one in which the viewer’s attention is divided between listening to the woman’s well-reasoned words and watching the play of shapes, including her lips, on the canvas of her face.</p>
<p>In the other montage of television clips, towards the end of the film, the idea of the mouth as inanimate and inorganic is represented on the level of content rather than form. The first excerpt is a snippet from a mouthwash commercial, featuring a pair of false teeth floating in a cup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1746847711428850">Figure 5</xref>, middle left), and the second depicts a puppet preacher giving a sermon, his wooden jaw moving up and down according to the manipulation of the puppeteer’s hand, seen clearly reaching into the puppet’s back (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1746847711428850">Figure 5</xref>, middle right). <italic>Figures of Speech</italic> and <italic>Waking Life</italic> both offer examples of ‘real’ human mouths that are made to float, like dentures in solution, and that are subjected to the overt non-naturalistic manipulation of the films’ artists (albeit animators rather than puppeteers). Here Rotoshop’s ability to ‘make over’ the mouth through distinct styles of animation, in a way that resists a mimetic reproduction of the ‘organic’ body, is commented upon through the action of the scene.</p>
<p>Counterbalancing this in the same montage are extended demonstrations of the lip-synced talking head, whose representation adheres to the dominant Roto-realist aesthetic. The final voice in the sequence belongs to the woman who had been discussing lucid dreaming in the first television montage. However, her visual representation is different, with her lips, as well as her glasses, now fixed in their natural positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1746847711428850">Figure 5</xref>, bottom). This reinforces the notion that the film is only willing to experiment very lightly with dominant aesthetic codes governing the relationship between body and voice: as demonstrated by this talking head, it is the ideology of lip-sync that has the final say.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Of the four <italic>Figures of Speech</italic> films that are readily available online, the interview with Katie Roth represents the one that most often tests lip-sync practices, in the ways I described earlier in this article. The other films are more careful to maintain a sense of integrity between the live-action template, the Rotoshop animation and the connection between voice and the visualization of the mouth. This corresponds to an overriding tendency of the Rotoshop films to accept lip-sync ideology as the taken-for-granted norm. The special connection between Rotoshop and a live-action template is secured most emphatically through the synchronization of speech to mouth movement.</p>
<p>Lip-sync lends human presence to the animated bodies of Rotoshop, underscoring Steven Connor’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1746847711428850">2000</xref>: 5) general claim that ‘the sight of me speaking underlines the fact of my visual inhabitation of the world.’ Arguably, lip-sync becomes even more integral to Rotoshop than live-action cinema or other forms of animation because of its propensity to distort visual perspective through multiplaning effects that flatten different layers of the image and an animation style that puts different elements in disproportionate relationship to each other. With the human body being depicted in such an unpredictable visual field, the sight of an on-screen body speaking carries an increased burden in establishing that body as a privileged inhabitant of the Rotoshopped world. Symbolically, it gives the body a ‘natural’ human shape at the same time that, visually, that body is being unnaturally manipulated through the Rotoshop process. This corresponds to Stephen Deutsch’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746847711428850">2008</xref>: 104) conclusion about the role of sound in abstract non-narrative animation: ‘the more abstract the image, the greater the implicit demand for synchronous aural gesture.’</p>
<p>The Rotoshop animations to date demonstrate an overwhelming tendency to align their voices with bodies in a way that reminds the viewer of the form’s live-action basis. This is not just achieved through lip-sync: voice design, as a whole, operates according to a principle of transparency, which seeks to efface the labour and technological manipulation that produces the voice as it is heard in the final product. When the voice is depicted self-consciously as a technological construct, as in the scramble-suit scenes of <italic>A Scanner Darkly</italic>, its manipulated quality is justified narratively and is, moreover, deployed in a contrasting relationship with Keanu Reeves’s voice that encourages an understanding of the latter’s ‘natural’ human qualities.</p>
<p>Lip-sync is, therefore, part of an overall voice design principle that is traditional in its adherence to the conventions of a transparent realism. This aesthetic appears conservative in comparison to the visual experimentation of Rotoshop, which, in many instances, accentuates the differences between, rather than homogenizes, the layers of animation and the live-action footage that can be ‘seen underneath’. In so doing, voice supports the personality of the on-screen body rather than the personalities of the animators who are expressing themselves through the reimagining of the live-action footage.</p>
<p>Rotoshop animations, then, have not yet demonstrated an artistic licence in relation to the vocal source material to match that of their visual practices. However, returning to the opening quote from Chion, the very fact that Rotoshop visualizes bodies in a new way allows for the possibility that the voice–body relationship will alter: relationships do not need an equal shift on both sides to change. Under Rotoshop’s visual aesthetic there exists the possibility, as shown in points of <italic>Waking Life</italic> and <italic>Figures of Speech</italic>, that the visual presentation of the body will follow an entirely different course to that encouraged by the promptings of the voice. Earlier, I represented Steven Connor’s view that speech in animation can dictate that the movement of the on-screen bodies proceeds in fantastic directions. In the most radical Rotoshop examples, speech loses the monopoly suggested by Connor in orchestrating the movement of the animated bodies. In these instances, the voice loses its privilege of articulating the on-screen body’s human qualities and, momentarily, becomes exposed as a heterogeneous element of form. Under these conditions, voice becomes a catalyst for the creative exploration of the relationship between the real and the imagined that is the defining characteristic of Rotoshop in the visual field.</p>

<p>For reasons of space and focus, in this article I do not explore the representation of body and voice in Rotoshop in relation to gender. However, given the way that lips have been fetishized in the representation of women in visual media, it may be significant that the most formally radical animation of the mouth in Rotoshop makes use of a female body – in any case, scholarship in this area would be enhanced by a study devoted to considering Rotoshop as a gendered practice.</p></fn>
