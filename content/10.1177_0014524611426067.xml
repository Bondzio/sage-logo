<p>Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert</p>
<p>so the Son of Man must be lifted up</p>
<p>that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life</p>
<attrib>(John 3 : 14,15)</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Almighty God</p>
<p>on a mountain top Peter, James and John</p>
<p>looked upon the majesty of Christ Jesus</p>
<p>and from a cloud</p>
<p>heard a voice declaring him to be Your Son</p>
<p>Though we do not live on mountain tops</p>
<p>grant that we too may glimpse his glory</p>
<p>In this hour of worship</p>
<p>we turn from the duties and activities of life</p>
<p>to look again to the One</p>
<p>whose death upon the cross has raised us up</p>
<p>and opened to us the gate of eternal life.</p>
<p>Let sight give way to insight</p>
<p>that the paths of earth</p>
<p>might become for us the road to heaven</p>
<p>through the same Jesus Christ our Lord</p>
<p>Merciful Father</p>
<p>in Christ Jesus</p>
<p>You have called us love our enemy</p>
<p>to walk a second mile</p>
<p>and to do good to those who hate us</p>
<p>You have shown us what true compassion is like</p>
<p>and asked us to care for our neighbour</p>
<p>And by our Lord’s death and rising again</p>
<p>You have promised that the way of love</p>
<p>cannot be defeated by sin or death</p>
<p>What little faith we have</p>
<p>what poor disciples we are</p>
<p>for in comparison to him</p>
<p>our lives are shallow</p>
<p>we lack humility</p>
<p>and our actions betray a want of true goodness and care</p>
<p>Forgive us those things</p>
<p>of which our conscience is afraid</p>
<p>and grant us those good things</p>
<p>which we are not worthy to ask</p>
<p>save through the love of him who is our Saviour.</p>
<p>May the God of love and mercy forgive you and set you free from all your sin</p>
<p>Jesus said, Arise, go in peace, your faith has made you whole</p>
<p>God of light and truth</p>
<p>open our eyes to the glory of Your presence</p>
<p>in the world around us</p>
<p>and in the face of Jesus Christ Your Son</p>
<p>that we may grow into his likeness</p>
<p>to the glory of him who is our Saviour and Lord</p>
<p>and who taught us to pray together</p>
<p>our Father……….</p>

<title>Prayers of Thanksgiving and Intercession</title>
<p>Far beyond the sight of our eyes</p>
<p>far beyond the reach of our minds</p>
<p>You live in glory</p>
<p>immortal, invisible</p>
<p>Almighty and eternal God</p>
<p>Yet we would thank You</p>
<p>that in Your mercy You have allowed us a fleeting glimpse of Your glory</p>
<p>on a hillside or in a garden we have sensed the nearness of Your presence</p>
<p>while listening to music our souls have been lifted to new heights</p>
<p>in precious moments of worship and of prayer</p>
<p>You have spoken to us Your Word of truth</p>
<p>and in the love of our family and friends</p>
<p>we have known an eternal love</p>
<p>And by Your grace in all of these things</p>
<p>hope has been transformed</p>
<p>love renewed</p>
<p>our faith restored</p>
<p>and You have sent us back out into the world</p>
<p>comforted, strengthened and inspired to follow in the way of Christ</p>
<p>Grant to us and to all Christ’s Church</p>
<p>the bright lamp of faith</p>
<p>and when the road is steep and the way hard</p>
<p>let us not stray from the path of truth and love</p>
<p>in Christ Jesus our Lord</p>
<p>Living and loving God</p>
<p>on a mountainside our Lord was transfigured</p>
<p>his face radiant like the sun</p>
<p>so we pray for all who know darkness in their lives</p>
<p>the darkness of warfare</p>
<p>the darkness of hunger and disease</p>
<p>the darkness of injustice and oppression</p>
<p>the darkness of violence and abuse</p>
<p>the darkness of loneliness</p>
<p>May the light of Your love transform such suffering</p>
<p>and through the prayers and actions of Your people</p>
<p>let those in need find shelter, hope and peace</p>
<p>When Jesus returned from the mountain</p>
<p>people brought to him their sick that he might touch them</p>
<p>we pray for all who suffer illness or distress in body, mind or spirit</p>
<p>Bless all who share with Christ a healing ministry</p>
<p>research scientists, doctors, surgeons, nurses</p>
<p>the many people involved in the health services</p>
<p>Use their sympathy and skill to bring about</p>
<p>the relief of suffering and the overcoming of disease</p>
<p>God of time and eternity</p>
<p>on a mountain top Peter, James and John</p>
<p>looked upon the majesty of Christ Jesus</p>
<p>and from a cloud</p>
<p>heard a voice declaring him to be Your Son</p>
<p>Though we do not live on mountain tops</p>
<p>grant that we too may glimpse his glory</p>
<p>In the routine of our daily life</p>
<p>may there be for us moments</p>
<p>when sight gives way to insight</p>
<p>and the paths of earth</p>
<p>become the road to heaven</p>
<p>through the same Jesus Christ our Lord</p>
<p>to whom with the Father and the Holy Spirit</p>
<p>one God, be all glory and praise</p>
<p>now and for evermore. Amen</p>

<p>For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathise with our</p>
<p>weakness but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we</p>
<p>are, yet was without sin.</p>
<attrib>(Hebrews 4: 15)</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With the birth of Jesus</p>
<p>Your Word became flesh</p>
<p>Coming to live among us</p>
<p>Your love was revealed</p>
<p>And then at Easter as he died and rose again</p>
<p>You set us free from the power of evil and death</p>
<p>Promising us life that is full and hope that is eternal</p>
<p>Good and loving God</p>
<p>gathered now as the people of Christ’s church</p>
<p>we praise You for a great high priest,</p>
<p>who shared our humanity</p>
<p>understands our weakness</p>
<p>and prays for our well being</p>
<p>Source of life and truth</p>
<p>he came to serve, not to be served</p>
<p>Son of Mary and Son of God</p>
<p>when in a garden he felt abandoned and alone</p>
<p>he displayed true courage and love</p>
<p>and on Calvary’s cross</p>
<p>he trusted himself into Your keeping</p>
<p>As the season of Lent begins</p>
<p>may Your Holy Spirit lead us</p>
<p>to a deeper awareness of Your presence and promise</p>
<p>a firmer grasp of Your truth and love</p>
<p>and a renewed commitment to following in the way of the cross.</p>
<p>Grant us ears to hear</p>
<p>eyes to see</p>
<p>and a heart to respond to all You have given</p>
<p>and all You continue to promise</p>
<p>in Jesus Christ our Lord</p>
<p>God of grace and mercy</p>
<p>we turn again to You</p>
<p>for today we recall that fasting in the wilderness for forty days and nights</p>
<p>Jesus was tempted to turn stone into bread</p>
<p>Forgive us if instead of helping others</p>
<p>we have used our gifts and powers to satisfy our own needs</p>
<p>We recall Jesus was tempted to throw himself from the temple</p>
<p>Forgive us if instead of nobler demands upon our time and talent</p>
<p>we have sought popularity and the praise of others</p>
<p>And we recall that Jesus was tempted to bow down and worship the devil</p>
<p>Forgive us if having offered the worship of our lips</p>
<p>we have not also offered the worship of our lives</p>
<p>Lead us to an honest appraisal</p>
<p>of what is wrong in our lives and in our world</p>
<p>the things that must be changed</p>
<p>and what we must do to bring that change about.</p>
<p>Grant us a new beginning</p>
<p>and send us out into the world to share with others</p>
<p>the renewed life and hope You have given us in Christ our Lord</p>
<p>May the God of love and mercy forgive you and set you free from all your sin</p>
<p>Jesus said, Arise, go in peace your faith has made you whole</p>
<p>Almighty God</p>
<p>whose Son fasted forty days in the wilderness</p>
<p>and was tempted as we are but did not sin,</p>
<p>give us grace to direct our lives</p>
<p>in obedience to Your Spirit</p>
<p>that in the doing of Your will</p>
<p>we may know Your power to save</p>
<p>through Jesus Christ our Lord</p>
<p>in whose words we further pray</p>
<p>Our Father….</p>

<p><bold><italic>CHOIR: Ubi caritas et amor (CH 4 no 801)</italic></bold></p>
<p>God of all seasons</p>
<p>in Your pattern of life there is</p>
<p>a time for silence and a time for speech</p>
<p>a time for mourning and a time for dancing</p>
<p>a time to be born and a time to die</p>
<p>Trusting that every time and experience of life is embraced in Your providence</p>
<p>we turn again to You</p>
<p>for the refreshment and renewal of our lives</p>
<p>We thank You for this season of Lent</p>
<p>with its invitation to pause and take stock</p>
<p>to reflect upon the things of life that really matter</p>
<p>to reflect upon the people and relationships of life that really matter</p>
<p>to reflect upon the things of faith that really matter</p>
<p>Help us put this time to good use</p>
<p>to listen attentively for the still small whisper of Your voice</p>
<p>and to discern the pattern of Your presence and purpose in our lives</p>
<p>Speak to us in the depth of our hearts</p>
<p>and send us out into the world</p>
<p>with fresh courage and a greater resolve</p>
<p>to bear witness to the goodness and love</p>
<p>You have shown us in Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p><bold><italic>CHOIR: Ubi caritas et amor</italic></bold></p>
<p>God of justice and peace</p>
<p>for forty days and nights</p>
<p>Jesus fasted in the wilderness</p>
<p>Hear our prayer for the suffering places of the world</p>
<p>where people hunger for food and clean water</p>
<p>the harrowing places where people suffer oppression and discrimination</p>
<p>the bleak places of disease and poverty where people face a daily struggle to live</p>
<p>the war torn places where people live in fear and hope is scarce</p>
<p>May the Lord of the wilderness be their strength and their hope</p>
<p><bold><italic>CHOIR: Ubi caritas et amor</italic></bold></p>
<p>God of courage and compassion</p>
<p>during his forty days and nights in the wilderness Jesus was tested</p>
<p>hear our prayer for people facing hard and testing times</p>
<p>people left homeless or made redundant</p>
<p>those who have been victims of crime or domestic violence</p>
<p>those who have grown old and frail and their families who worry and care for them</p>
<p>those whose lives and families have been devastated by illness or accident</p>
<p>all who are lonely or who struggle with a daily burden of disability</p>
<p>those who draw near to death and all who mourn a loved one’s passing</p>
<p>May the Lord of the wilderness be their strength and hope</p>
<p><bold><italic>CHOIR: Ubi caritas et amor</italic></bold></p>
<p>God of grace and mercy</p>
<p>during his time in the desert Jesus found the strength to resist temptation</p>
<p>hear our prayer for those who are not so strong</p>
<p>people caught up in criminal activity or imprisoned</p>
<p>those who drink too much or who have placed themselves in debt</p>
<p>people addicted to gambling</p>
<p>youngsters wasting their lives on drugs</p>
<p>all using their gifts and opportunities in the wrong way</p>
<p>May the Lord of the wilderness grant each of us the opportunity to turn from what is wrong</p>
<p>and to seek again that which is good and fulfilling</p>
<p><bold><italic>CHOIR: Ubi caritas et amor</italic></bold></p>
<p>God of time and eternity</p>
<p>in the end Jesus remained obedient telling Satan to get behind him</p>
<p>In offering You our prayers we pray for an end to all that frustrates Your purpose</p>
<p>and ask for ourselves strength to stand against all that is evil</p>
<p>courage to seek the justice You demand of us</p>
<p>and faith to live and work each day for the coming of Your kingdom</p>
<p>through Jesus Christ our Lord</p>
<p>to whom with the Father and the Holy Spirit</p>
<p>one God</p>
<p>be all glory and praise</p>
