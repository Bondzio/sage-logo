<abstract>
<p>Epoxy-layered silicate nanocomposites were achieved by solution casting method using different amine hardeners as well as different filler surface modifications and their microstructure and oxygen permeation performance have been analyzed. The optimization of the curing conditions was achieved by differential scanning calorimetric analysis and the amount of the amine used to cure the epoxy resin was adjusted according to the number of cross-linking sites present in its structure. Apart from that, the presence of filler was also observed to have catalytic effect on the curing of the polymer. Different amines led to different extents of cross-link density of the epoxy network structure and the oxygen permeation was accordingly affected. The chemical architecture of the surface modifications also affected the morphology and the oxygen permeation through the nanocomposite films. When the interface between the filler and the polymer was optimally designed, the filler was observed to have exfoliation in the polymer matrix which also led to subsequent enhancement in the permeation resistance. On the other hand, when polarity mismatch existed between the filler surface modification and the polymer chains, minimal filler exfoliation and intercalation was observed. The enhanced permeation resistance in the already high barrier epoxy matrix did not affect the adhesive properties of the polymer, thus, confirming their potential for use as barrier as well as adhesive layer in packaging laminates.</p>

<p>The epoxide resins are used in a large number of commercial applications, including surface coatings, adhesives, potting and encapsulation of electronic components, tooling, laminates in flooring and to a small extent in molding powders and road surfacing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412445198">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684412445198">4</xref></sup> The chemical resistance as well as other properties are as much dependent on the hardener as on the resin since these two determine the nature of the linkages formed. Of special mention of applications of epoxy resins is their use in packaging laminates as adhesives. In these laminates, cross-linked epoxy structure is transparent and also contributes to their gas barrier performance (depending on the hardener and extent of cross-linking), which are important criteria for the packaging materials. Other approaches have also been reported to further enhance the permeation behavior of the epoxy polymers in the laminates. One such approach relating to the molecular design is the insertion of rigid groups in the polymer back bone which leads to enhanced resistance to permeant molecules diffusing through the polymer matrix along with improved thermal stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412445198">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412445198">6</xref></sup> Other more simplified approach is the incorporation of inorganic fillers with high aspect ratio which leads to increasing the flow path of the permeant molecules in the polymer matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684412445198">7</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412445198">9</xref></sup> Layered silicate montmorillonite platelets with 1 nm thickness are one such example of high aspect ratio fillers which when dispersed in nano-scale have been reported to enhance the mechanical, thermal, and barrier properties of various polymer matrices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412445198">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684412445198">13</xref></sup> To enhance the compatibility of such inorganic fillers with the low surface energy polymer matrices, their high energy hydrophilic surface is rendered organophilic by exchange of their surface cations (like sodium) with long chain alkyl ammonium ions which also increases the interlayer spacing between the platelets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684412445198">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684412445198">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>A number of studies have reported the synthesis of epoxy nanocomposites after the incorporation of layered silicates and enhanced properties have been ascribed to higher aspect ratio of the filler platelets leading to much higher polymer filler interfacial contacts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412445198">16</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684412445198">20</xref></sup> However, only mechanical properties have been given predominance and less attention has been paid to barrier properties which do not automatically improve along with the improvement in mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412445198">21</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731684412445198">25</xref></sup> Osman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412445198">21</xref></sup> reported the oxygen and water vapor barrier properties of epoxy clay nanocomposites using different filler surface modifications. As a result of interfacial interactions between the filler surface and the polymer chains, significant reductions in the gas permeation were observed. However, the impact of different cross-linking amines was not studied. The goal of the current study was, thus, to study the synthesis and oxygen permeation behavior of epoxy nanocomposite films (drawn on substrate foils) using different hardener amines as well as layered silicates. The fillers were modified with different surface modifications to study the effect of resulting interactions of the polymer and filler on the microstructure development and consequently the oxygen permeation performance of the nanocomposites. The minerals with two different cation exchange capacities were also used in order to analyze the effect of cation exchange capacity of the filler on the morphology and properties of the composites. The curing parameters such as time, temperature and mole ratio of the curing agent to epoxy were also optimized using differential scanning calorimetry in order to have the curing process which provides time for the intercalation of epoxy and amine in the clay interlayers, but is also quick enough to avoid excessive extragallery polymerization. Care was also taken not to hinder the transparency or to increase the bulkiness of the nanocomposite films owing to their potential application in packaging laminates.</p></sec>

<p>Organically modified montmorillonites with trade names Nanofil 804, Nanofil 32, Nanofil 15, Cloisite 30B, Cloisite 20A and Cloisite 93A were supplied by Southern Clay Products (Gonzales, TX). The cation exchange capacity of the Nanofil and Cloisite substrates was earlier measured to be 680 and 880 µEq/g respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731684412445198">26</xref></sup> The epoxy resin, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (4,4′-isopropylidenediphenol diglycidyl ether) with an epoxide equivalent weight 172–176, was supplied by Sigma (Buchs, Switzerland). Tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA), isophorone diamine (ID), ethylene dioxydiethyl amine (EDDA), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and dimethylformamide (DMF) were procured from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Polypropylene (100 µm thick) foils to support the nanocomposite films were supplied by Alcan Packaging (Neuhausen, Switzerland). A surfactant (trade name BYK-307) was used to achieve better wetting and adherence of the neat epoxy coating to the substrate foils and was obtained from Christ Chemie (Reinach, Switzerland).</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0731684412445198"><title>Nanocomposite synthesis and substrate coating</title>
<p>The details on the nanocomposite synthesis can be found elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412445198">21</xref></sup> The amount of the organically modified filler corresponding to 6 wt% was swollen with 25 g of solvent (THF or DMF) for 2 h. Subsequently, the filler dispersion was sonicated (ultrasound horn) twice at 70% amplitude for 5 min each time with 5 min pause in between. The epoxy resin solution (5.3 g in 5 g of solvent) was then added to the filler dispersion followed by similar swelling and sonication cycles. The curing agent (TEPA, ID or EDDA) in an amount corresponding to the amine to epoxy mole ratio of 0.3:1 for TEPA and 0.75:1 for ID and EDDA was then added to the prepolymer filler suspension. It was also required to degas the suspension by sonication for 10 s. The pure epoxy as well as epoxy nanocomposite films were drawn on the PP substrate foils with the help of a bar coater (90 µm gap). The films were dried first at room temperature and atmospheric pressure for 15 min followed by drying under reduced pressure for another 15 min. The films were then transferred in a vacuum oven where they were cured at 70°C overnight, and postcured at 90°C for 4 h. The thickness of the dry films was approximately 10 µm, the method to measure which is reported earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412445198">21</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0731684412445198"><title>Characterization methods</title>
<p>DSC runs for the epoxy-crosslinker samples were obtained on DSC Q 1000 TA instrument. The cells were equilibrated at 30°C followed by heating to the chosen curing temperature. The cells were kept under isothermal conditions for 120 min at the curing temperature. Universal analysis program V3.8B TA was employed for the analysis.</p>
<p>The oxygen transmission rate through pure epoxy and nanocomposite coatings was measured using an OX-TRAN 2/20 ML (Mocon, Minneapolis, MN) at 23°C and 0% RH. The transmission rate of oxygen was normalized with respect to the total thickness of the epoxy or nanocomposite films and the PP substrate foil and the transmission rate through the epoxy or nanocomposite films was subsequently calculated as reported earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412445198">21</xref></sup> An average of four measurements for each coating was reported.</p>
<p>Wide-angle X-ray diffraction was performed on a Scintag XDS 2000 diffractometer (Scintag Inc., Cupertino, CA) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) in reflection mode. The nanocomposite films were step-scanned (step width 0.02° 2θ, scanning rate 0.06°/min) at room temperature from 1.5° to 10° 2θ. To determine the peak positions, the diffractograms were fitted with a split Pearson VII function (diffraction management system software 1.36b).</p>
<p>Bright-field TEM Zeiss EM 912 Omega microscope was used to study the microstructure of the nanocomposites. Nanocomposite films were embedded in an epoxy matrix after etching with oxygen plasma for 3 min. About 70-nm thick sections were microtomed with a diamond knife (Reichert Jung Ultracut E) and were supported on 100 mesh grids sputter-coated with a 3-nm thick carbon layer.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0731684412445198" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>As the nanocomposites were developed with epoxy based adhesives, therefore, no free standing films were generated and the nanocomposite formulations were coated on PP substrates. To enhance the wetting and adhesion between the PP foils and epoxy formulations, a surfactant was added to the formulations and surface of the PP foils was corona-treated. No peeling of the coatings from the substrate was observed which indicated that the epoxy adhesive did not lose its characteristic after the addition of inorganic fillers. The PP substrate was selected on the basis of its consumption in the packaging laminates as well as owing to its high oxygen transmission rate so that it does not hinder measuring the permeation through the pure epoxy and nanocomposite films. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412445198">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates the modified fillers (with two different cation exchange capacities) along with their surface modifications. Nanofil 804 and Cloisite 30B were modified with bis(2-hydroxyethyl)methylhydrogenatedtallowammonium, whereas Nanofil 15 and Cloisite 20A had surface modification of dihydegenatedtallowdimethylammonium. Nanofil 32 was surface modified with benzyldodecyldimethylammonium. On the other hand, dihydegenatedtallowmethylammonium was the modification of Cloisite 93A. The modifications were varied in order to study the effect of different functional groups in the modifications on the morphology and properties of epoxy nanocomposites. For example, benzyl group is expected to generate stronger van der Waals attraction forces between the filler and the epoxy polymer, the hydroxyethyl groups may chemically react with the epoxy groups, thus, tethering polymer chains to the silicate layers. The long alkyl chains on the other hand, allow to generate higher basal plane spacing between the individual filler platelets increasing the chances of polymer intercalation. Different amines (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412445198">Figure 1</xref>) were also used to study their interactions with the surface modifications as well as the performance of the resulting cross-linked epoxy structure.

<p>Optimization of the curing parameters such as curing time, temperature and mole ratio of the ingredients is important owing to the fact that curing of the epoxy takes place inside as well as outside the filler interlayers. Thus, the curing process should be designed to provide time for the intercalation of epoxy and amine in the filler interlayers, but is also fast so as to avoid excessive extragallery polymerization. Too high temperature should also be avoided as it may degrade the substrate. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412445198">Figure 2</xref> shows the DSC plots of epoxy curing runs at different temperatures of 40°C, 55°C, 60°C, 70°C and 100°C, while keeping the TEPA amine to epoxy mole ratio constant at 1:1. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412445198">Table 1</xref> also shows the time to cure at each temperature. At 40°C, the time to cure was more than 60 min, whereas at 100°C, only 11 min were required to cure the epoxy resin. Apart from that, curing at 100°C also led to wrinkles in the substrate foils. The trials runs at different amine (TEPA) to epoxy mole ratios, while keeping the temperature constant at 70°C were also performed and are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412445198">Figure 3</xref>. The curing time increased on decreasing the amine to epoxy mole ratio. 45 min were required for the complete curing in the case of amine to epoxy mole ratio of 0.3:1 at 70°C. From these results, curing temperature of 70°C and epoxy to amine ratio of 0.3:1 were chosen as optimal values as these provided enough curing time necessary for exfoliation (keeping in view the catalytic effect of filler on the curing behavior, thus, further advancing the curing rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412445198">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684412445198">27</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731684412445198">29</xref></sup>), along with maintaining thermal stability of the substrate foils at the curing temperature. Trials were also made to cure epoxy with and without surfactant added to improve the adhesion of the epoxy and epoxy filler formulation with the substrate foils. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412445198">Figure 4</xref>, the DSC thermograms of the epoxy curing in the presence or absence of surfactant were similar and time to cure was also near to 45 min in both the cases (TEPA to epoxy mole ratio of 0.3:1 at 70°C) indicating that the surfactant did not affect the curing behavior of epoxy. In the case of isophorone diamine (ID), an amine to epoxy mole ratio of 0.75:1 was used to cure the epoxy resin owing to presence of two cross-linking moieties in its structure as compared to five sites in the case of TEPA. Time to cure of 60 min was observed for this case.

<p>As mentioned earlier, the presence of filler can also have catalytic effect on the curing rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412445198">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684412445198">27</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731684412445198">29</xref></sup> The effect of presence of filler on the overall curing process was also studied and demonstrated in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412445198">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412445198">6</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412445198">Figure 5</xref>, the presence of dihydegenatedtallowdimethyl ammonium modified clay led to the advancement of the curing reaction significantly (curve II) in comparison to reaction without the presence of filler (curve I). It is because of the acidic nature of the ammonium ions which have been reported to catalyze the epoxy amine polymerization reaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412445198">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684412445198">27</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731684412445198">29</xref></sup> Although with quaternary ammonium ions the extent of intergallery catalysis is reported to be lower as compared to primary, secondary and tertiary counterparts, but it can still be significant. Curve III indicated the curing process carried out at 70°C at a reduced amine to epoxy mole ratio of 0.2:1. The slowing down of the curing process was clearly visible and it took more than 80 min to cure the resin. Similarly, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412445198">Figure 6</xref>, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)methyl (hydrogenated tallow) ammonium modified filler also enhanced the curing of epoxy with ID amine using an amine to epoxy mole ratio of 0.75:1 at 70°C. Complete curing could be achieved in 40 min. On the other hand, using the same amount of filler at lower amine to epoxy mole ratio of 0.5:1 led to sluggish curing and much longer curing time of 80 min. Thus, it was optimum to use the TEPA to epoxy mole ratio of 0.75:1 and ID to epoxy mole ratio of 0.75:1 as reasonable curing times of 30–40 min were achieved at a temperature of 70°C. The influence of curing temperature on the filler exfoliation was also analyzed through X-ray as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412445198">Figure 7</xref>. Using an amine (TEPA) to epoxy mole ratio of 0.3:1, the curing at 70°C led to decrease in the peak intensity (related to the ordering in the filler platelets) in the 6 wt% Nanofil 15 nanocomposite as compared to the same material cured at 60°C, thus, indicating higher extent of filler exfoliation at 70°C. It thus confirmed that the optimal curing temperature as well as time are the most important criteria for the microstructure evolution.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731684412445198">Table 2</xref> shows the details of the formulations used to generate epoxy nanocomposites. The weight fraction of the filler in the nanocomposites was fixed at 6 wt% in order to compare the microstructure as well as oxygen permeation behavior with each other. It was also observed that TEPA amine agglomerated the Nanofil 804 and Cloisite 30B filler suspensions in solvent (with or without epoxy prepolymer). Other fillers with less polar surface modifications remained stable on the addition of TEPA amine to their solvent suspension. Such a phenomenon of ‘degellation’ or ‘deexfoliation’ of the organo-montmorillonite, containing bis(2-hydroxyethyl)methyl (tallow ammonium) as surface modification on addition of polar additives such as amines as cross-linking agents was also reported earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0731684412445198">30</xref></sup> It was suggested that bi- or multifunctional amine molecules may be able to bridge the silicate layers or the N–H groups in the primary and secondary amines may be polar enough to cause reaggregation of silicate layers. However, the use of isophorone diamine as cross-linker did not destabilize the Nanofil 804 and Cloisite 30B filler suspensions, thus, further indicating that the amine chemical structure as well as number of functional groups affect the formulation stability. Even bifunctional m-phenylene diamine did not destabilize the Nanofil 804 and Cloisite 30B filler suspensions confirming that the extent of functional groups in the amine structure also need to be optimized when using polar surface modifications.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684412445198">Table 3</xref> details the basal plane spacing of the fillers powders and fillers in nanocomposites along with the oxygen transmission rates through the pure epoxy and epoxy nanocomposite films. Nanofil 804 filler had a basal plane spacing of 1.85 nm whereas Cloisite 30B, which is the higher cation exchange capacity substrate with same modification as Nanofil 804, had a basal plane spacing of 1.82 nm indicating no impact of the difference in the cation exchange capacity. Similarly, Nanofil 15 and Cloisite 20A also had same basal plane spacing value of 2.74 nm. Cloisite 93A with a surface modification of dihydegenatedtallowmethylammonium demonstrated a basal plane spacing of 2.47 nm which was significantly lower than Cloisite 20A with modification dihydegenatedtallowdimethylammonium, indicating that a slight change in the chemical architecture of the surface modification impacted the immobilization of the modification molecules on the filler surface. The basal plane spacing values increased in the nanocomposites indicating the polymer intercalation in the filler interlayers, however, the presence of basal plane spacing also signified that the fillers could not be completely exfoliated. The absence of signal corresponding to the filler powder in the X-ray diffractograms also confirmed the absence of un-intercalated filler platelets. The basal plane spacing increased to maximum extent in the case of Nanofil 804 filler which also resulted from the better compatibility of the filler modification with the polar epoxy chains. Cloisite 30B composite, on the other hand, had a smaller enhancement in the basal plane spacing. The spacing in the case of Cloisite 93A was also observed to be 4.44 nm even though the surface modification was non-polar and was not expected to have positive interactions with the polymer. However, owing to the higher acidic nature of the ammonium ion exchanged on the surface in this case, its interaction with the epoxy chains can be expected to be much better. A basal plane spacing of only 3.54 and 3.53 was observed in the case of Cloisite 20A and Nanofil 15 composites even though the initial basal plane spacing of the filler was highest, which would have resulted from lower extent of polymer intercalation in the filler interlayers owing to the polarity mismatch between the modification and polymer chains. Nanofil 32 composites were observed to have basal plane spacing of 3 nm irrespective of the amine used to cure the system.

<p>To further supplement the findings of X-ray diffraction Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412445198">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684412445198">9</xref> also show the TEM micrographs of the nanocomposites with various fillers. Nanofil 804 composites were observed to contain large number of single exfoliated filler layers. Apart from that, filler tactoids of varying thicknesses were also present. The platelets were observed to be bent, folded and misaligned. Similar to the case of Nanofil 804, Cloisite 93 A and Cloisite 30B nanocomposites also had extensive filler exfoliation. Thus, it indicates that though X-ray diffraction indicated filler intercalation, the microstructure also contained significantly exfoliated filler platelets. Nanofil 32 composites, on the other hand, were more intercalated than exfoliated, whereas Nanofil 15 and Cloisite 20 A nanocomposites were extensively intercalated. The <italic>d</italic>-spacing of the intercalated tactoids coincided with the spacing values observed in X-ray diffraction. These results, thus, coincide with the notion that more polar surface modifications led to higher extent of filler exfoliation whereas decreased modification polarity led the microstructure to be more intercalated. Such findings were also reported earlier for epoxy and polyurethane nanocomposites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412445198">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0731684412445198">31</xref></sup>

<p>The oxygen permeation values through the pure epoxy matrices cured by TEPA, ID and EDDA amines were observed to be 2.03, 4.81 and 3.02 cm<sup>3</sup>·µm/m<sup>2</sup>·d·mmHg, respectively. It showed that the number of functional sites in the amine molecules affected the epoxy network structure accordingly. The use of TEPA with highest number of cross-linking sites led to higher cross-linking density which also resulted in the least oxygen permeation through the polymer films. On the other hand, use of bi-functional EDDA and ID amines led to lower extent of cross-link density and the oxygen permeation was higher than that of TEPA system. Even EDDA and ID amine systems led to different oxygen transmission through the polymer films owing to their chemical architecture. A decrease of 21% in the oxygen permeation as compared to the pure polymer was observed for Nanofil 804 nanocomposite, whereas composite with higher cation exchange capacity Cloisite 30B filler with same modification as Nanofil 804 resulted in a decrease of 26% in the oxygen permeation. A much higher decrease of 43% in the oxygen permeation was observed for Cloisite 93A nanocomposite. Thus, both catalytic nature of the surface modification as well as polar surface modification were observed to enhance the filler exfoliation which subsequently resulted in significant oxygen permeation reduction. Nanofil 32 also led to a reduction of 8% and 12% in the TEPA and EDDA cured nanocomposite systems. These findings also coincide with the TEM findings, where Nanofil 32 filler was observed to be less intercalated than the Cloisite 93A, Nanofil 804 and Cloisite 30B nanocomposites. Cloisite 20A and Nanofil 15 led to an increase in the oxygen permeation as compared to the pure epoxy. Such a behavior is expected owing to the mismatch between the polarities of the surface modification and the filler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412445198">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0731684412445198">31</xref></sup> and also confirmed the TEM findings. It is also worth noting that the oxygen permeation through the pure epoxy matrices generated by curing with different amines is already very low as compared to other conventional materials used in packaging laminates e.g. polypropylene. Therefore, further reduction in oxygen permeation by the incorporation of layered silicate fillers is challenging. By designing the interface between the polymer and the filler, varying extents of reduction in the oxygen permeation could be achieved. The films also retained their optical properties as the pure epoxy and nanocomposite films were transparent and indistinguishable as seen by naked eyes. The films also did not have increase in the density owing to filler addition. The pure polymer density was measured to be 1.18 g/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412445198">3</xref></sup>, which increased to 1.20 g/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412445198">3</xref></sup> in the nanocomposites.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0731684412445198" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Optimum curing time, temperature and amine to epoxy mole ratio are required for the filler delamination in the polymer matrix. The presence of filler further enhances the rate of curing, thus, this effect should also be taken into consideration while optimizing the curing conditions. The curing time should not be very short or long as it may hinder the polymerization taking place in the interlayers. The different amines led to generation of epoxy networks with different cross-link densities owing to their structure and number of functional groups. Polar and acidic nature surface modifications led to higher interlayer spacing values as well as filler exfoliation in the composites. On the other hand, the modifications with completely non-polar nature were not compatible with the polymer chains, thus, leading to only intercalation of limited amount. The oxygen permeation through the epoxy networks was also affected by the network density as the highest cross-link density network had the lowest oxygen permeation. Coinciding with the TEM and X-ray findings, the oxygen permeation reduction was much better when bis(2-hydroxyethyl)methyl (hydrogenated tallow ammonium) and dihydegenatedtallowmethylammonium were used as surface modifications. Owing to relatively weaker van der Waals forces with the epoxy matrix, the performance of the benzyldodecyldimethylammonium modification was moderate. On the other hand, owing to the mismatch between the polymer and apolar surface modification, dihydegenatedtallowmethylammonium modified filler led to increase in the oxygen permeation. The CEC of the filler substrates had a minor effect on the oxygen permeation performance. The nanocomposite films retained their optical clarity as well as density even after the addition of filler, thus, confirming their potential for use in the packaging applications.</p></sec>
