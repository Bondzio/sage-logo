<abstract>
<p>In this paper, we analyse one aspect of home–school book sharing, namely the activity of borrowing a book. We describe how the borrowing activity is accomplished in daily practice in two Dutch preschools and which emergent literacy practices can be embedded in this routine. We followed fifteen children, aged from two years to four years, and analysed how they were involved in the borrowing activity as part of home–school book sharing. In total we analysed sixty borrowing events. We found three variations of the borrowing act: children were not involved at all; they were involved in a basic borrowing routine; and they were involved in an extended borrowing routine. In the case of no involvement, the teacher chose a book without the child being present, or the child did not get a new book at all. In the other two cases there was teacher–child interaction. The structure of the basic routine is: (1) the teacher orients the child to the activity; (2) the child browses books and selects one; and (3) the teacher acknowledges the child’s choice. In the extended routine there are supplemental orientations to literacy practices, either about (future) reading or about writing down the choice. Microanalysis of borrowing interactions revealed that although both preschools had implemented the home–school book sharing programme, literacy experiences for individual children differed.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1468798411430103"><title>Introduction: Emergent literacy is more than reading books</title>
<p>Literacy is ‘a social and cultural practice (…) embedded in particular social contexts and in the discourses that dominate these contexts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1468798411430103">Papen and Tusting, 2006</xref>, p. 330). People encounter written and symbolic language, such as books, subtitles, lists, environmental print and so on, and assign meaning to it continuously in their daily lives. As children grow up, they learn to interact with their literate environment. In an overview of the origin and development of the concept of ‘early childhood literacy’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468798411430103">Gillen and Hall (2003)</xref> describe how researchers grew to acknowledge the social, cultural and cognitive complexity of literacy. They argue that early childhood literacy ‘is not about emergence or becoming literate, it is about being literate; and it allows the literacy practices and products of early childhood to be acknowledged as valid in their own right’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468798411430103">Gillen and Hall, 2003</xref>, p. 10). Although we appreciate young children’s literacy practices as being valuable in their own right, in the current paper we connect early childhood literacy to an emergent perspective. Vukelich and Christie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1468798411430103">2009</xref>, p. ix) describe emergent literacy as ‘a perspective on early literacy development that contends that children construct their own knowledge about reading and writing as a result of social interaction and meaningful engagement with print.’ By combining a sociocultural perspective with this emergent perspective, a context is created for studying children’s meaningful literacy practices in educational contexts, inside or outside school.</p>
<p>Emergent literacy is seen as a good base for later more formal or conventional literacy learning in school: children who see the relevance of reading and writing, who know about the features and uses of text, whose families value and express literacy, who participate in cultural uses of literacy with their families and for whom literacy is part of their daily life will be better prepared for reading and writing instruction at school (as summarized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468798411430103">Purcell-Gates in Rowsell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1468798411430103">Vukelich and Christie, 2009</xref>). This idea is embraced by policy-makers and society, who value providing meaningful literacy practices to young children in order to stimulate their development and prepare them for schooling.</p>
<p>Emergent literacy is stimulated by providing children with the opportunity to experience the use and relevance of written language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468798411430103">Bus et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468798411430103">Freebody and Freiberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468798411430103">Hall et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468798411430103">Hallet, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468798411430103">Hammerberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468798411430103">Hassett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468798411430103">Leseman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468798411430103">McDonagh and McDonagh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468798411430103">Makin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1468798411430103">Neuman and Roskos, 1997</xref>). A common way of introducing text and written language to children is by reading books. Vukelich and Christie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1468798411430103">2009</xref>, p. 12) even state that ‘storybook reading is the cornerstone of early literacy instruction’. Of course, in line with a broader sociocultural view of literacy, all situations where symbolic language in all its variations plays a role should be taken into account when stimulating emergent literacy. For example, new media and technology influence the ways young children encounter literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468798411430103">Burnett, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468798411430103">Carrington, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468798411430103">Marsh 2004</xref>). With new technologies, new literacy practices emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468798411430103">Rowsell, 2006</xref>). Not surprisingly, we can see children discovering and manipulating these practices. A young boy from our own research project, for example, was prompted to use Internet practices in his pretend play by an (unconnected) computer keyboard in the play area (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468798411430103">Excerpt 1</xref>).

<p>Without dismissing the importance of these modern literacy practices and the need to connect these to more common literacy practices in education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468798411430103">Burnett, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468798411430103">Rowsell, 2006</xref>), the focus of this study is on current practices in early childhood classrooms. Stimulating interest in books and in book reading is a common and important aspect of early childhood education programmes and thus guides the topic of the current study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1468798411430103"><title>Stimulating emergent literacy at home and at school</title>
<p>Children’s literacy development is influenced by their experiences at home and at (pre)school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468798411430103">Holdaway, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468798411430103">Rowsell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1468798411430103">Sénéchal and LeFevre, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1468798411430103">Snow et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1468798411430103">Sylva et al., 2004</xref>). For young children, home is the most important context. When they get a little older, children often spend considerable time in educational settings like preschool. ‘Transactional objects’ can help children to connect the worlds of ‘home’ and ‘school’, for example by letting children bring personal items into the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468798411430103">Hallet, 2008</xref>). Home–school book sharing is a way of introducing such transactional objects from the classroom into children’s homes.</p>
<p>‘Family literacy’ is the common descriptor for ‘activities that involve parents and children in literacy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468798411430103">Rowsell, 2006</xref>, p. 147; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468798411430103">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468798411430103">Bird, 2008</xref>). Educational professionals may try to build on family literacy in the context of school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468798411430103">Rowsell, 2006)</xref> but, more commonly, they try to involve families in school literacy activities. An early example of an attempt to influence family literacy is the reading project in Haringey, London, UK in which schools provided books to six- to eight-year-olds and their parents to read at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1468798411430103">Tizard et al., 1982</xref>). A more recent example is Peers Early Learning Partnership (PEEP) in which parents are actively involved in their children’s school life and literacy activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468798411430103">Evangelou et al., 2003</xref>). The programme Bookstart targets younger children and stimulates parental literacy activities with babies and preschoolers. There are clues that the programme results in families still being involved in literacy activities and oriented towards books two years later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1468798411430103">Wade and Moore, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Home–school literacy practices are designed to stimulate literacy practices in the home environment, to connect home and school literacies and to introduce specific educational literacy practices into families. In home–school book sharing, classrooms provide children with new books to take home and read with their parents every week. Generally, educational programmes mainly focus on the literacy practices of white middle-class society. The literacy practices of children and families from other cultural groups may be different, but no less valuable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468798411430103">Dombey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468798411430103">Hassett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468798411430103">Heath, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468798411430103">Luke, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1468798411430103">Minns, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1468798411430103">Rogoff, 2003</xref>). We do not wish to suggest a deficit view of family literacy, in which families are ‘blamed’ for the low literacy achievement of their children (e.g. as summarized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1468798411430103">Razfar and Gutiérrez, 2003</xref>). Rather, we embrace the viewpoint that ‘Families tell stories, create texts and artefacts, and give children space when they listen to them and support their meaning making. Family literacy can be honoured in schools and out of school as something growing, resourceful, meaningful and strong’ (Pahl cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468798411430103">Rowsell, 2006</xref>, p. 139). However, since literacy-stimulating programmes focus on literacy as it is used in (future) school settings and society, socialisation into the dominant literacy culture may indeed assist children to proceed in their school and societal careers. To acknowledge cultural differences in literacy, educational institutions should acknowledge the literacy experiences children bring from home to school, build on their families’ funds of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1468798411430103">Moll et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468798411430103">Rowsell, 2006</xref>) and use these practices as a basis for school literacy. Although in-school and out-of-school/home settings are not strictly separated and ‘move in and out of each other and bear traces of the other all the time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468798411430103">Rowsell, 2006</xref>, p. 10), schools introduce school literacy into home more easily than inviting home literacy into school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468798411430103">Marsh, 2003</xref>). This is unfortunate, since literacy learning in schools could be enhanced by using the natural resources of family literacy, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468798411430103">Rowsell (2006)</xref> argues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1468798411430103"><title>Stimulating book sharing practices</title>
<p>A family literacy programme that is often used in Dutch preschools is <italic>Boekenpret</italic>, an equivalent of Bookstart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468798411430103">Booktrust, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468798411430103">Moore and Wade, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1468798411430103">Van den Berg and Middel, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1468798411430103">Van der Pennen, 2001</xref>). Like in other family literacy projects, one of the goals is ‘providing book and reading experiences’ to children and parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468798411430103">Bird, 2008</xref>, p. 228). To accomplish this, one of the activities of <italic>Boekenpret</italic> is home–school book sharing: every week the children borrow a book from preschool to take home and read with their parents. The main aims of this activity are to make books available to children and parents, and to teach the child how to select books of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1468798411430103">Van der Pennen, 2001</xref>). Home–school book sharing also stimulates children to experience the ‘intimacy’ of shared reading in the home setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1468798411430103">Merchant, 2008</xref>) and avoids the situation of children reading very different books at home than at school, for example Disney books from the supermarket at home and ‘high-quality’ picture books at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468798411430103">Marsh, 2003</xref>). The practice of distributing school books into the home environment might be accompanied by (individualized) instruction to parents on how to read with their child, for example by providing written instruction with the book every week, to which parents may also reply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468798411430103">Brooker, 2002</xref>), but this is not a common practice in every preschool.</p>
<p>The aim of home–school book sharing programmes is to let children experience the joy of reading and make recreational reading part of their (daily) routine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1468798411430103">Morrow and Weinstein, 1986</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1468798411430103">Nell (1988)</xref>, one important influence on reading for pleasure is to have selected a book that meets the reader’s expectations about what the book will be like and what kind of reading experience it will provide. The act of borrowing a book within home–school book sharing may therefore be essential to the success of the programme.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1468798411430103"><title>Early childhood education in the Netherlands</title>
<p>Before we go into further analysis of the activity of borrowing a school book, we will give a short overview of early childhood education (ECE) in the Netherlands. We deem this to be important because – although it probably resembles ECE in other Western countries – childhood education is influenced by local and cultural beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468798411430103">Huijbregts et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1468798411430103">Tobin et al., 1989</xref>) and contextual information on preschool settings may thus be useful.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, most Dutch children enter kindergarten at age four, one year before compulsory school attendance. Many children under four attend <italic>preschool</italic> or <italic>day care</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1468798411430103">Westenbrink and Versteegen, 2006</xref>). The difference between preschool and day care is that preschools are designed to stimulate children’s (language) development, while day care primarily has the practical goal of enabling parents to go to work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1468798411430103">Van der Vegt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1468798411430103">Van Kampen et al., 2005</xref>). Approximately half of all children with Dutch as a second language currently visit preschool and the Dutch government aims to increase this proportion extensively to prevent developmental delay at the start of children’s school careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468798411430103">Beekhoven et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468798411430103">Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, 2008</xref>). Special ECE programmes are designed to assist preschools with their educational goals. A frequently used ECE national integral programme is <italic>Piramide</italic> (used in 48% of municipalities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468798411430103">Beekhoven et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Piramide</italic> has a strong emphasis on cognitive development and uses individual tutoring to avoid or remediate delays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1468798411430103">Van Kuyk, 2000</xref>). Another national integral programme is <italic>Kaleidoscoop</italic> (used in 16% of municipalities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468798411430103">Beekhoven et al., 2010</xref>), a Dutch version of the US programme High/Scope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468798411430103">Barnett, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1468798411430103">Schweinhart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1468798411430103">Schweinhart and Weikart, 1997</xref>). The language and literacy stimulating programme <italic>Boekenpret</italic> (used in 29% of municipalities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468798411430103">Jepma et al., 2007</xref>), described above, can be used independently or in combination with integral programmes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1468798411430103"><title>Research questions</title>
<p>Marsh and Hallet emphasize ‘the importance of recognising literacy as a social and cultural practice, and, thus, ensure curricular links to the wider world, and the need to engage children as active participants in their learning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468798411430103">Marsh and Hallet, 2008</xref>, p. xiii). The idea that preschool literacy activities are sometimes executed <italic>without</italic> engaging children is therefore problematic. However, this may well be the case. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468798411430103">Brooker’s (2002)</xref> description of home–school book sharing practices in a UK preschool showed that children who did not return their book every week were invited less often to join the book borrowing activity with the teacher. In other words, the specific literacy stimulating practice of home–school book sharing was more elaborate for some children than for others. This study will follow up on this observation by performing microanalyses of children borrowing books as part of a home–school book sharing programme.</p>
<p>Naturally, the analysis and evaluation of family literacy programmes should focus on both the home and school settings: on parents, teachers and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468798411430103">Bird, 2008</xref>). However, the aim of this study is not to evaluate the home–school book sharing element of the <italic>Boekenpret programme</italic>. Rather, it is an attempt to show the subtle yet important differences in the implementation of the programme through microanalysis of literacy activities. In this study we are interested in how teachers use borrowing a book as a subactivity of home–school book sharing in interactions with children. This is important since having implemented an ECE programme does not necessarily mean that every child is approached in a similar elaborate way and that literacy is stimulated in consistent fashion. Our research questions are:

<p>To study teacher–child interactions carefully during the borrowing activity, we will apply discourse analysis. The emphasis we place on borrowing interaction does not mean that we disregard the meaningfulness of other aspects of home–school book sharing. Rather, we want to stress this aspect of the broader literacy activity, since it can easily be seen as just a means to an end that is a necessary yet unimportant step for transferring school books to the home environment. However, the activity of borrowing a book could be meaningful in its own right. Within the activity of borrowing a book, short interactions focusing on literacy may arise. This focus on small ‘mundane’ literacy events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468798411430103">Deunk, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468798411430103">Heath, 1983</xref>) is in line with other scholars emphasizing the importance of carefully observing ‘valuable but fleeting snippets of learning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1468798411430103">Paffard, 2008</xref>, p. 242) in young children’s interactions. To sum up, we do not assume in advance that borrowing a book especially stimulates literacy, but we will use discourse analysis to see if and how aspects of literacy are interactively shaped, how these interactions can be used to stimulate emergent literacy and whether these interactions are similarly involved in interactions with different children.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1468798411430103"><title>Data and methodology</title>
<p>Case studies, ethnographic descriptions and discourse analyses have contributed to the understanding of emergent literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468798411430103">Brooker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468798411430103">Davidson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468798411430103">Freebody and Freiberg, 2001</xref>). Especially the situatedness of literacy and its fluid relevance in ongoing interaction ask for qualitative descriptions. In this study we will combine the information from qualitative descriptions with the information from multiple cases.</p>
<p>The data used in this paper are drawn from a broader study investigating pragmatic development in preschool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468798411430103">Deunk, 2009</xref>). In this longitudinal project, 25 children from four preschools (named A, B, C and D) were followed from approximately age two years and six months (2 y, 6 mo) to four years (4 y, 0 mo) in their respective classrooms. The data were collected between April 2005 and February 2007. All four preschools are located in medium-sized towns in (sub)urban areas in the north of the Netherlands and the focal children were predominantly white and monolingual, from lower-to middle-class families (although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468798411430103">Marsh (2003)</xref> and others have argued that communities cannot be classified as homogeneous groups so easily). During the day at preschool, the children's interactions were recorded every three months. Individual audio recordings for every focal child and an overview video recording were made. The audio recording device was sewn into a little jacket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468798411430103">Figure 1</xref>, the recording device is hidden underneath the ‘fur’ on the back). Each recording consists of the activities and interactions of one child during one morning or afternoon at preschool. Selections of the recordings were transcribed using Jeffersonian conventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468798411430103">Jefferson, 1984</xref>). The research methodology is a combination of ethnography, sociolinguistics and conversation analysis. Scholars who have used similar methodology include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468798411430103">Goodwin (1990)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1468798411430103">Rampton (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1468798411430103">Wells (1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1468798411430103">1986</xref>).

</fig></p>
<p>From this corpus, we collected all the mornings and afternoons in which the activity of borrowing a book as part of home–school book sharing took place. We could only use data from preschools A and C, not from B and D. In preschool B, books are borrowed before the school day starts and the activity therefore fell outside the range of our recordings. Preschool D does not offer home–school book sharing. Preschools A and C use the Dutch literacy-promoting programme <italic>Boekenpret</italic>, of which home–school book sharing is an important element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1468798411430103">Van den Berg and Middel, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1468798411430103">van der Pennen, 2001</xref>). In addition to <italic>Boekenpret</italic>, preschool C uses the integral ECE programme <italic>Kaleidoscoop</italic>. Both classrooms consist of 12–15 children, an experienced teacher (two teachers in preschool C), an assistant and often an intern.</p>
<p>At both preschools, home–school book sharing is organized according to a fixed schedule. Every week, on Tuesdays, children bring their school books back to class and borrow a new one to take home. Our dataset consists of seven Tuesdays at preschool A and four Tuesdays at preschool C, on which old books are returned and new ones are borrowed. In preschools A and C, we followed, over time, 15 children (eight children in preschool A and seven in C) in the age range 2 y, 1 mo to 3 y, 10 mo. Not all children were present on all days, because of illness, because they entered the study later, or because they left for kindergarten. Occasionally recordings are missing due to technical problems or resisting children. When we count the focal children present and recorded on Tuesdays at which book borrowing takes place, we have 60 potential borrowing interactions. Thus, if all children were involved in the borrowing activity every Tuesday, we would be able to analyse 60 borrowing interactions.</p>
<p>The qualitative analysis used in this study is based on the framework of conversation analysis. This can be used to understand contexts by examining the moves that participants make, since participants show their understanding of an event through their actions, which at the same time contribute to the event. In this study, we apply conversation analysis in an institutional context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468798411430103">Heritage, 2005</xref>). Institutional talk differs from ‘ordinary conversation’ in that it is related to specific settings and tasks. It is the talk people use to ‘manage those practical tasks, and to perform the particular activities associated with their participation in institutional contexts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468798411430103">Drew and Sorjonen, 1997</xref>, p. 92). Examples of these types of talk are making emergency phone calls, taking part in a radio interview or having a Socratic dialogue in the classroom. Institutional talk has three basic aspects. First, interaction partners show an orientation to specific goals, relevant to the social institution. For example, the goal of a physician and a patient during a consultation with a doctor may be to clarify the patient’s problem and to formulate a diagnosis and treatment. Second, there are special constraints that define which interactional contributions are appropriate. For example, the doctor is expected to ask detailed questions about the patient’s well-being, whereas the patient should not ask the doctor these same questions. Third, the institutional context is related to specific ways of making inferences. This means, for example, that the doctor should react neutrally instead of emotionally in response to the patient’s problem(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468798411430103">Drew and Heritage, 1992</xref>). Most institutional talk is not as scripted as doctor visits or, to give a more extreme example, a wedding ceremony. Nevertheless, the variation in interactional acts in institutional settings is limited by the goal(s) and constraints of the event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468798411430103">Heritage, 2005</xref>). Institutional talk entails a kind of routine interaction. An example of institutionalized routine interactions in preschool classrooms is given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468798411430103">Berenst (2003)</xref>. He describes the routine of checking attendance during morning circle time, in which teacher and children use ritual language and are oriented to preferred language practices. Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468798411430103">Margutti (2006)</xref> gives an example of institutionalized talk in her analysis of question–answer sequences in instructional whole-class activities. We will use applied institutional conversation analysis to understand how the routine of borrowing a school book takes place in a classroom community and what children may learn from this routine in the light of emergent literacy.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1468798411430103"><title>Three variations in the activity of borrowing a school book</title>
<p>Every Tuesday, the two preschools organize the activity of borrowing a school book as part of the home–school book sharing programme. The activity takes place during free play time: teachers sit somewhere in the classroom with a collection of school books and registration material, while the children are involved in free play. Teachers call for children, who then have to interrupt their activity when it is their turn to borrow a book. It is an individual teacher–child activity. In rare cases the borrowing is organized as a group activity, children do not really borrow a book together but get mutual instruction, pick their book and present their choice to the teacher individually. Children have to present the book they have chosen to the teacher, who registers the choice and puts the book into a special bag, which the children take home at the end of the day. The adult leading the activity is usually the intern (six Tuesdays), but the assistant, teacher or a parent can also be in charge (respectively on two, two and one Tuesday(s)).</p>
<p>At first glance, both preschools organize their home–school book sharing programme and the activity of borrowing a book conscientiously every week. However, the meaningfulness of the activity seems to differ on different occasions. When children are involved in this activity, the borrowing routine sometimes takes a basic form and is sometimes extended with conversation about reading or administering the choice. Sometimes the routine is absent: teachers organizing book loans do not engage in the borrowing activity with every child in the classroom. This happens when the child forgets to bring his or her book from the previous week, when the teacher runs out of time or when the child refuses to cooperate. When a child forgets to bring his or her book, he or she does is not allowed to borrow a new one. When the teacher runs out of time or the child does not cooperate, the teacher may provide the child with a new book without consulting or involving him or her. Obviously it is hard to describe an event that does not happen. We can however illustrate how children and teachers are oriented towards the book loan routine and its non-presence. Sarah (3 y, 2 mo) in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1468798411430103">Excerpt 2</xref> remarks that she did not bring her book because she could not find it at home. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1468798411430103">Excerpt 3</xref>, Miss Trynke and assistant Nora discuss Annet (3 y, 6 mo) who does not want to join the book loan activity.

We will first summarize how many children are involved in each type of borrowing routine (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468798411430103">Table 1</xref>). Then, we describe how the basic and extended routines are interactively organized. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468798411430103">Table 1</xref> gives an overview of the way in which children are involved in the activity of borrowing a school book in the two schools.

<sec id="sec9-1468798411430103"><title>The basic routine of borrowing a school book</title>
<p>The basic routine is solely focused on borrowing a school book. It is, in a way, a very functional perspective on the activity: the child needs to borrow the book as part of the home–school book sharing programme, without acknowledgement that the activity may be used as a platform to talk about aspects of literacy. The basic routine consists of three moves: (1) the teacher orients the child to the activity of borrowing a school book; (2) the child selects a book; and (3) the teacher acknowledges the choice. Of the 60 borrowing interactions, 20 (33%) took the form of the basic routine. All basic routines took place in preschool A (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468798411430103">Table 1</xref>). In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1468798411430103">Excerpt 4</xref>, Peggy (3 y, 7 mo) and intern Alice give a perfect example of the basic borrowing routine.

</table-wrap></p>
<p>In the first move of the basic routine, orientation to the borrowing activity, Alice invites Peggy to come and borrow a book. As was said before, in preschools A and C, borrowing a school book always takes place during free play. This means the child is engaged in another activity and the teacher needs to actively reorient the child to the new – dominant – activity of borrowing. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1468798411430103">Excerpt 2</xref>, Alice approaches Peggy and asks her to take part (<italic>Peggy, do you want to pick a book?</italic> line 2). Peggy responds with an agreement token (<italic>yes</italic>, line 3) and walks towards the location where the books are. In this example, orientation to the new activity goes smoothly, but this is not always the case. For a more detailed description of negotiation between teacher and child in the phase of orientation to the borrowing activity, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468798411430103">Deunk (2009)</xref>.</p>
<p>In the second move, the child selects a book. There is always a box with books to choose from and sometimes a couple of books are laid out on the table. The adult in charge may explicitly point children to these books, like Alice does when she tells Peggy: <italic>look, the box is over there</italic> (line 5). Perhaps contrary to expectations, the phase of choosing tends to lack verbal interaction between teacher and child. Children often browse the books in silence and the time they take to reach their decision may be short. In none of our analysed borrowing interactions did we see children opening the books they were considering, so the only information they have about the book is the visual image on the cover. Furthermore, the teachers generally do not guide the choosing process by talking the child through selection strategies. The only thing teachers sometimes do is to facilitate choosing by orienting children to a limited number of books instead of the complete collection. They may present the child with a couple of books, a choice between two books or only one book, which the child should accept or refuse.</p>
<p>The way in which children indicate their choice of book is straightforward: they generally use verbal and nonverbal deixis. Children often say <italic>this one</italic> or <italic>that one</italic> (in Dutch: <italic>deze</italic> or <italic>die</italic>) in combination with pointing to the book, touching it or showing it. In some cases, a child <italic>only</italic> uses nonverbal means to indicate his or her choice. Just handing a book to the teacher or pointing to a book can thus also serve as a way of making a choice in the routine of borrowing a school book. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1468798411430103">Excerpt 4</xref> shows how the move of choosing is generally fulfilled: Peggy considers some books (for a relatively long period) while Alice is talking to another child. Peggy then indicates her choice by saying <italic>this one</italic> (line 7), which she repeats when Alice does not react. Alice asks for confirmation of the choice in a post-expansion (<italic>do you want to take that one?</italic> line 11), which Peggy confirms.</p>
<p>In the third move, the teacher acknowledges the child’s choice. This may be a very short interaction, like in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1468798411430103">Excerpt 4</xref>, when Alice acknowledges Peggy’s choice by a sequence-closing third move (<italic>okay</italic>, line 15, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1468798411430103">Schegloff, 2007</xref>). With this sequence closing, the joint activity of borrowing a school book is closed and Peggy and intern Alice proceed to their subsequent activities: Peggy walks away to play again and Alice writes down Peggy’s choice.</p>
<p>Children’s book choices are acknowledged most of the time, but not always. Based on our analysis of the data, we can infer that teachers base their (dis)approval of books on the idea that home–school book sharing should provide children with <italic>new</italic> books, meaning that children should not select books they have at home or that they have previously chosen. For a worked example of an interaction in which a child tries to select a non-approved book, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468798411430103">Deunk (2009)</xref>. The wish to reread books is not uncommon for children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468798411430103">Holdaway, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1468798411430103">Sulzby, 1985</xref>) or adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468798411430103">Hopper, 2005</xref>), and studies report positive effects of repeated reading on vocabulary development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468798411430103">Biemiller and Boote, 2006</xref>) and comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1468798411430103">Pressley and Gaskins, 2006</xref>), but the teachers in the preschools we observed discourage children from choosing books they have already read.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1468798411430103"><title>The extended routine of borrowing a school book</title>
<p>It seems that teachers and children do not take advantage of the possibilities the book borrowing activity offers for addressing aspects of literacy when they are involved in the basic borrowing routine (teacher orients child to the activity, child chooses a book, teacher acknowledges the choice). They do, however, in the extended routine: the extended routine is the basic routine <italic>plus</italic> an orientation to literacy. Broadly speaking, the teachers may make two additional moves to emphasize literacy. These moves are made during or after the choosing phase. The first move focuses on (future) reading of a school book and the second focuses on registering the choice. Of the 60 potential borrowing activities, 24 (40%) were extended routines, with a focus on aspects of literacy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468798411430103">Table 1</xref>). We will describe below how the two additional teacher moves are shaped and how aspects of literacy are made relevant through them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1468798411430103"><title>A focus on reading a school book</title>
<p>In the basic routine, the child chooses a book and presents it to the teacher, who acknowledges the choice. Instead of ‘just’ acknowledging and accepting the choice, the teacher can refer to reading by talking about the content of the book, reading a couple of pages to the child or talking about future shared reading at home. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1468798411430103">Excerpt 5</xref> shows how assistant Karla uses the borrowing activity to orient Janet (2 y, 10 mo) towards reading.

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1468798411430103">Excerpt 5</xref>, Janet very quickly (in three seconds) picked a book and indicated her choice by holding it while saying <italic>this one</italic> (line 3). The subtle differences between the basic routine and the extended routine of borrowing a school book start to show in the teacher’s response to the child’s choice. The teacher does not only say <italic>(do you want to take) that one?</italic> (like Alice did, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1468798411430103">Excerpt 2</xref>, line 11), but adds the title of the book: <italic>where is my potty</italic> (line 5). Reading the title of the book directs attention to the content. Janet confirms with an agreement token (<italic>yes</italic>, line 7), but Karla appears to try to elicit more confirmation and asks <italic>you think that’s a nice book?</italic> (line 9). Janet does not respond with the projected agreement. However, she is sharing attention for the book and orients the focus to the picture on the cover of the book (<italic>there!</italic> line 11). This is an opening to talk about the topic of the story, which Karla and Janet indeed do. Together they formulate the topic and the ‘problem’ that motivates the rest of the story (K: <italic>well, what’s he doing?</italic>, J: <italic>peeing</italic>, K: <italic>yes</italic>; and K: <italic>she lost her potty</italic>, J: <italic>yes</italic>, lines 13–19). Books for young children generally have the basic structure of an initiating event or problem, which motivates a goal, multiple attempts to achieve this goal and a final resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468798411430103">Berman and Slobin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1468798411430103">Norbury and Bishop, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1468798411430103">Stromqvist and Verhoeven, 2004</xref>). By focusing on the content of the book, Karla prepares Janet for the story that will be read at a later time. Acquiring information about the content and structure of a text before reading is an effective strategy for children who read themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1468798411430103">Pressley and Gaskins, 2006</xref>) and who are being read to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468798411430103">McGee and Schickedanz, 2007</xref>). Karla further explicates the relevance of focusing on the content of the book by explicitly embedding the choosing activity within the broader event of home–school book sharing. She does this by referring to the use of the book at home (<italic>are you going to read this with mummy and daddy?</italic> line 20) and the intermediate action (<italic>I’ll put it in your bag Janet (.) yes?</italic>, line 24). Putting the chosen book in the bag is an instrumental way of acknowledging the choice by the teacher. This means the borrowing activity can be closed and the child can leave the borrowing scene, which Janet indeed does. Had Janet stayed, an additional reference to literacy could have been made, as we see in the interaction in which there is a focus on registration of the choice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1468798411430103"><title>A focus on registering the choice</title>
<p>When the child has selected a book, the teacher has to process this choice: she writes down the book title in a folder and the child’s name in the book, and puts the book in the child’s special book bag. Although teachers always register the child’s choice, this move is not always part of the mutual borrowing routine. In the basic routine, teachers register the choice after the interaction is closed and the child has left the borrowing scene. However, sometimes children stay while teachers register the choice. This is an opportunity for teachers to orient children to the registration process, which involves reading and writing. An example of an orientation to registration is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1468798411430103">Excerpt 6</xref>.

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1468798411430103">Excerpt 6</xref>, Miss Trynke verbalizes the things that she herself has to do to process Kirsten’s choice: placing the book in the special book bag (<italic>shall I put it in your bag</italic>, line 1) and writing the child’s name in the registration folder (<italic>I’ll put your name in it (1,6) &lt;Kirsten&gt;</italic>, lines 3–5). Miss Trynke alternates between an orientation to registration and to future reading. After she has written down Kirsten’s name in the registration folder, she refers to future reading (<italic>you can nicely read it at home with mummy right?</italic>, line 7). Kirsten in her turn identifies a trouble source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1468798411430103">Schegloff, 2000</xref>) and says her older sister always reads her books <italic>(no Brit wants to read it always</italic>, line 9), and Miss Trynke gives an other-initiated repair (<italic>oh Britney?</italic>, line 10). Miss Trynke will resume this topic later, but inserts a sequence of private speech when she needs to write down the date in the registration folder <italic>(°er which date was it? (.) November three° (0,7) °October three? (3,0) °well° (2,4) °three ten o six°-</italic>, lines 12–18). This sequence is an example of peripheral learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1468798411430103">Wenger, 1998</xref>) as it situates Kirsten as a bystander with literacy experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468798411430103">Larson, 1999</xref>). Miss Trynke proceeds straight into a renewed take up of the previous topic: Kirsten’s sister reading the book (<italic>can your sister read well</italic>, line 18 and <italic>can she read well to you?</italic>, line 21). This topic was still active for both speakers, so they do not have to go through a reopening sequence. After this second orientation to reading, Miss Trynke shifts again to organizational matters: she puts the book in the special bag and instructs Kirsten to ask a new child to enter the borrowing activity.</p>
<p>The registration that is part of the home–school book sharing programme provides an opportunity for making expert acts of reading and writing explicit to children. There are of course many moments in which teachers could orient children to mundane everyday yet practical uses of literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468798411430103">Barton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468798411430103">Deunk, 2009</xref>), but the point is that registration of the chosen book is one of these adult real life uses of written language and teachers could emphasize these practices as well. The registration follows naturally from choosing the school book and holds authority for expert readers, as all registration systems do. Sometimes children experience this authority of written text themselves, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1468798411430103">Excerpt 7</xref>.

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1468798411430103">Excerpt 7</xref>, Nicole chooses a book, which intern Ellen acknowledges (<italic>yes? (.) do you want that one (0,3) okay</italic>, lines 2–4). Initially, it looks like the borrowing activity of Nicole and Ellen follows the basic pattern and Nicole is about to walk away. Intern Ellen then reopens the activity when she notices in the registration folder that the book is not new to Nicole (<italic>oh no (.) you’ve already had that one! you’ve already had that one! (1,2) ↑look↑ (.) you’ve already had that one (.) just pick another book okay?</italic>, lines 6–8). The authority of registration is emphasized by Ellen when she points to the registration folder and repeats that Nicole has ‘already had that one’. The authority of the registration reaches far: the borrowing activity is reopened because it is written in the folder that Nicole has chosen this book before.</p>
<p>In the example of Nicole and Ellen, the routine is extended almost ‘by accident’: if Nicole had chosen a different book, she would have walked away after Ellen acknowledged the choice (and she almost did). Extending the basic routine to include the move of registration seems fairly easy, since this move is already present for the teacher. Postponing the mutual closing of the activity until after the registration move would thus increase opportunities for the child to become oriented to everyday adult reading and writing practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1468798411430103"><title>Different children, different involvement in book borrowing interactions</title>
<p>In the previous paragraphs we described how the routine of borrowing a school book can take different forms and how the extended routine gives more opportunities for orienting children to literacy practices. In an ideal situation, all borrowing activities take the extended form, thereby making optimal use of the literacy stimulating potential. However, since routines are sometimes absent or basic, it is important to check whether some children within a classroom experience less meaningful and rich borrowing interactions than others. To this end we listed all 60 book borrowing routines on the 11 observed Tuesdays and counted how often the 15 focal children were involved in different types of borrowing routines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468798411430103">Table 2</xref>).

<p>We acknowledge that the dataset is too small to draw firm conclusions, but it is striking that some children seem to be involved more in extended routines than others. The extended routine was scarce in preschool A to start with. When children are involved in borrowing a school book in preschool C, it is an extended routine. However, in both schools, children are sometimes not involved at all. Furthermore, some children seem to be left out more often than others. Reasons for not involving children in the borrowing routine are that the child did not bring his or her book from the previous week, the child resisted joining the book loan interaction or the teacher ran out of time.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1468798411430103" sec-type="discussion|conclusion"><title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>The idea that there is more to literacy than the ‘technical’ skill of reading and writing is now widespread. Literacy plays an important role in everyday life in the Western world and through socialization children can discover its role and function. To ensure that all children are prepared for later literacy learning in educational settings, society tries to stimulate emergent literacy in young children via early childhood educational institutions, educational television shows, family programmes and so on. A frequently used attempt to stimulate early literacy is to increase shared book reading in educational settings and at home. Home–school book sharing programmes are a common way to accomplish this. In this study we focused on the Dutch home–school book sharing programme <italic>Boekenpret</italic>. We did not focus on the shared reading sessions of parents with their children, although this would have been interesting as well. Instead, we analysed a subactivity within the broader event of home–school book sharing, namely the activity of borrowing a school book. We expected that this form of teacher–child interaction could lead to meaningful literacy interactions in itself, so we were interested in whether and how this activity was constructed in two preschool classrooms.</p>
<p>We first addressed the question: How is borrowing a book within home–school book sharing interactively shaped in the classroom? We found that, as is common for institutionalized talk, borrowing a school book is a routine interaction. Teacher and child are oriented towards the goal of borrowing a school book and there are appropriate contributions from each of the participants. However, we found two versions of the routine: a basic and an extended version. In the basic routine the teacher orients the child towards the activity of borrowing a school book, the child selects a book and the teacher acknowledges the choice. The extended routine contains additional references to literacy. These references to literacy may be directed towards reading the book (talking about the title, topic or story, or pre-reading), or to the registration of the choice in which adult writing and reading play a role. We see a difference between the two preschools in how often borrowing a school book is organized by the basic or extended routine. Children in preschool C are involved more often in the extended routine than children in preschool A (75% (18 out of 24) in preschool C and 17% (6 out of 36) in preschool A), while in preschool A the basic routine is used more often (56% (20 out of 36) basic routine in preschool A, none in preschool C). Furthermore, sometimes the children are not involved in the activity of borrowing a book at all (28% (10 out of 36) in preschool A and 25% (6 out of 24) in preschool C).</p>
<p>This leads directly to the second research question: How can the interaction of borrowing a school book be used to stimulate literacy? Obviously, when children are not involved in the interaction of borrowing a school book, it does nothing for emergent literacy. Of course, these children may still experience book sharing at home, but the activity of borrowing the book does not contribute to their literacy activities. However, the basic routine of borrowing a book does not seem to be too stimulating either. In this version of the activity, the teacher and child focus only on the end goal, namely selecting a book to take home, without paying attention to more meaningful aspects such as which type of book to choose and how to make a good decision. Only within the extended routine of borrowing a school book are aspects of literacy made explicit. This version of the routine may therefore be useful in stimulating emergent literacy. In an ‘ideal’ extended routine the teacher would help the child to choose a book by talking about the reading wish, making a provisional selection of a book, talking about its content and reading a couple of pages before finalizing the choice, and then the teacher would register the choice in the registration folder while talking about what she reads and writes. There is one teacher in preschool C (Miss Trynke) who occasionally does engage children in this kind of ideal extended routine, and there is one child in preschool A (Sarah) who always ‘reads’ the book of her choice herself before it is put in her special book bag to take home, but it is clear that much can be improved to increase the potential of the extended routine. On a positive note, the extended routine builds on the basic routine, so it should be fairly easy for teachers and other leading adults to add moves to their current activities and thereby make the borrowing routine more meaningful for children.</p>
<p>The differences we found in the way that the activity of borrowing a school book is constructed led to this question: Do preschool teachers use the book loan activity similarly in the interactions with different children in the playgroup? Or in other words, are some children more often in extended routines than others, leading to different opportunities to learn for different children? Indeed, some children seem to be ‘better off’, being involved in extended forms of the book borrowing routine. We mentioned the reasons for not involving children in the borrowing routine (not returning the book from the previous week, not cooperating in the borrowing activity or lack of time). It is important to understand the reasons for <italic>involving</italic> the children in the extended routine, by studying the contextual or sequential circumstances related to elaborations in the activity of borrowing a school book. In the light of the formative mission of early childhood education, it is disturbing that not all children appear to be involved in similarly rich interactions. Knowledge on when and how these interactions are most meaningful and the contexts in which they occur would thus be valuable.</p>
<p>With this paper we hope we have illustrated the value of using microanalytic interactional methods to study the usefulness of educational activities. At first sight, both preschools in our study used home–school book sharing as part of their literacy stimulating policy. Only after a second more detailed examination of an element of this educational event did we see how different this activity can be for different children. Differences were not only found between schools, but also within schools. We would like to argue that microanalysis can be a useful tool to understand how children can learn in preschool settings. In addition, it can be used to formulate practical advice for preschool professionals on how to increase the meaningfulness of the educational activities they engage in with young children.</p>
<p>The activity of borrowing a book can play its own role in literacy-promoting home–school book sharing programmes, rather than being ‘just’ a way of providing families with books. Taking a close look at a mundane activity like borrowing a book, and the different forms this routine may take, can help teachers, assistants, interns and parents to see the literacy-stimulating potential of this activity and build on it. The finding that some children are less involved in extended meaningful borrowing activities than others may prompt educational professionals to keep an eye on the literacy experiences of individual children. Furthermore, the description of the extended borrowing routine may help teachers to adapt their existing practices to create a more meaningful literacy event when involving children in borrowing a book. They could do this by verbally guiding the child when selecting a book, referring to the content of the chosen book and to future reading, and by involving the child in the act of registering the choice.</p>
