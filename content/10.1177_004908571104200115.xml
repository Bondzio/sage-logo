<p>After 1996, when the first Public Report on Basic Education (PROBE) was released, PROBE team has again made a significant contribution in the field of elementary education. The present PROBE report has been prepared largely by the same team (Anuradha De, Reetika Khera, Meera Samson and A. K. Shiva Kumar) on the basis of data collected in 2006 largely in the same villages that were covered by the PROBE survey in 1996, in Rajasthan, undivided Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh by applying the same tested methodology of PROBE 1996 on the by and large same sample size. This time upper primary section has also been included in the report.</p>
<p><italic>PROBE Revisited</italic> is an earnest effort to take stock of the significant changes in the delivery of primary education in the decade 1996 to 2006, and to assess the impact on school access and quality in the north Indian rural schools. The report focuses on the major progress that took place in the PROBE states and Himachal Pradesh in terms of availability of schools, educational facilities in schools, provision and impact of mid-day meals scheme on participation, surge in enrolment rates, decrease in the number of never enrolled children and shrinking of social and gender gaps. At the same time, it finds that fundamental problems remain the same as it was in 1996 particularly in the case of teaching–learning process and the teacher’s related issues. Mindless rote learning still dominates.</p>
<p>After introducing the report and its implication the report begins with analysis of major policy initiatives undertaken by the central and state government after 1996, such as Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, The National Curriculum Frame-work, policy related financing education including education cess and the Right to Education Act, 2009. In Chapter 3, the findings of the survey on the school environment at primary stage has been analysed and concluded that the situation is mixed with expansions of schooling facilities and improvement in infrastructure. It also focuses on the functioning of government schools and emergence of private schools in rural areas. The chapter critically examines the findings of the survey on the teacher-related concerns, such as profile of the teachers, shortage of teachers, pupil–teacher proportion and change in the teaching–learning process. In Chapter 4, the report tries to relate the school and family context of the child. It concludes that the socio-economic context and family attitudes influence educational outcome.</p>
<p>In Chapter 5, for the first time, the PROBE survey looks at the situation of middle schooling and examines all aspects for quality schooling at the level in detail. It finds that the demand for middle level schooling has grown substantially over the past decades or so, but children from more disadvantaged groups, particularly girls from these groups, mostly dropped out just after completing grade 5 or between 6 and 8. Chapter 6 of this report takes the stock of ongoing revolution in Himachal Pradesh and critically examines the successful implementation and delivery mechanism of government school in the state. The chapter concludes with how the ‘system works’ and sustained systemic improvement is possible. In Chapter 7, the report presents the conclusion of the survey and discusses the critical areas and concern that require immediate attention and integrated efforts for achieving the goal of education for all.</p>
<p>The report <italic>PROBE Revisited</italic> is not a simple revisit of the 1996 PROBE but the present report goes beyond by extending the focus in many ways. Though it is not an all-India report on elementary education but the outcome of this report may be useful for educationists, planners and policy makers, funding agencies and NGOs, who are involved in planning, administration and implementation of elementary education, and researchers across the social sciences and all those concerned with elementary education in India.</p>
