<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine reports of diabetes learning needs by youth with type 2 diabetes and their family support person (FSP) and to examine correlations of these perceptions with demographic variables.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145721713485305">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Data were analyzed from the Participant Needs Assessment (PNA), a routinely self-administered questionnaire designed to assess learning needs, in 191 youth (mean age = 14.0 ± 1.9 years, duration 8.78 ± 6.30 months; 36% black, non-Hispanic; 40% Hispanic; 20% white) enrolled in the TODAY (Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth) study. Youth and their FSPs completed the PNA at scheduled study visits, rating their learning needs on a 5-point scale, with higher scores indicating higher needs. Paired <italic>t</italic> tests and ANOVA were used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145721713485305">
<title>Results</title>
<p>There were no differences in reported learning needs by gender, although scores on the Teen Issues scale approached significance, with girls reporting higher needs than boys. Youth and FSPs were similar on their reports of needs on 3 scales (Ordinary Day, Nutrition, and Living With Diabetes), but youth reported higher needs than FSPs on Focus and Teen Issues.

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Youth with type 2 diabetes and their FSPs have high levels of ongoing learning needs despite completion of a standard diabetes education program. Continued assessment of learning needs, follow-up education, and behavioral approaches are warranted for these high-risk youth.</p>

<body>
<p>The recent increase in the incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes in youth has created challenges in assuring family-friendly approaches to help youth and their families to manage this complex disorder. The vast majority of research on diabetes education in youth is based on standards of care for youth with type 1 diabetes and/or adults with type 2 diabetes. While such data can be helpful in developing programs, youth with type 2 diabetes are different from youth with type 1 diabetes in that they are obese, often have a first-degree relative with type 2 diabetes, are more likely to come from underrepresented minority groups, and have comorbidities associated with insulin resistance. Thus, their educational needs may be substantially different from youth with type 1 diabetes.</p>
<p>The prevalence of childhood obesity is higher in nonwhite populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721713485305">1</xref></sup> The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study found a higher proportion of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in youth aged 10 to 19 years and in ethnic minority populations (6% non-Hispanic white, 22% Hispanic, 33% African American, 40% Asian/Pacific Islanders, and 76% Native American).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721713485305">2</xref></sup> In addition, membership in these ethnic minority populations has the potential to require different approaches to manage diabetes, obesity, and cultural differences.</p>
<p>Little research exists on the learning needs of youth with type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to describe learning needs in diabetes self-management as reported by youth with type 2 diabetes and their designated family support persons (FSPs), who are enrolled in the TODAY study (Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth). TODAY is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, 3-arm clinical trial designed to evaluate treatment options in type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents. Prior to TODAY study randomization, youth and their FSP were required expected to master a standard diabetes education program, demonstrated by achievement of at least 80% accuracy on quizzes that accompanied lessons of basic self-management skills.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721713485305">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Educational topics addressed in the TODAY study are based on recommendations established by the American Diabetes Association with the National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education as well as the AADE-identified 7 health-related self-care behaviors that determine the effectiveness of diabetes self-management education.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721713485305">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721713485305">5</xref></sup> The behaviors include healthy eating, being active, monitoring, taking medication, problem solving, reducing risks, and healthy coping. Thus, there is a need to understand factors associated with ongoing learning needs in youth with type 2 diabetes and their FSPs once they have demonstrated mastery of basic diabetes self-management knowledge and skills. The following research questions were addressed in this analysis:</p>
<list id="list1-0145721713485305" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Is there a difference by age or ethnicity in the perceptions of learning needs in diabetes self-management as reported by TODAY study youth participants and designated FSPs?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are the differences between youths’ and designated support persons’ perceptions of learning needs for diabetes self-management?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Controlling for duration of diabetes, do youth and FSP perceptions of diabetes self-management behaviors change over time?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Knowledge of appreciable variation between youth and FSP reports of learning needs for diabetes self-management would help diabetes educators to more effectively direct education and support to youth with type 2 diabetes and their families. Such knowledge may also guide development of future intervention studies.</p>
<sec id="section5-0145721713485305" sec-type="methods">
<title>Research Design and Methods</title>
<p>The TODAY study included 704 youth with type 2 diabetes from 15 clinical centers. Inclusion criteria included diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, age from 10 to 17 years, duration of diabetes less than 2 years, and BMI of at least &gt; 85%. The 3 treatment arms in the main study included treatment with metformin, metformin plus rosiglitazone, and metformin plus an intensive lifestyle intervention. The primary aims of the study were to compare these 3 treatment approaches on glycemic control, safety, and cost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721713485305">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Prior to randomization into TODAY, patients and their FSP participated in a standardized diabetes education program developed for the study and delivered by a study diabetes educator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721713485305">6</xref></sup> Content included diabetes medications, self blood glucose and ketone monitoring, blood glucose goals, treatment of hypo/hyperglycemia, nutrition, exercise, and self-esteem issues. Youth age 12 years and older also received instruction in teen content such as pregnancy prevention, driving, smoking, and alcohol use.</p>
<p>This substudy used a longitudinal descriptive design. Data were drawn from youth and their FSPs in the TODAY study. The following sites participated in this small study: Massachusetts General Hospital, Joslin Diabetes Center, Case Western Reserve University, Baylor College of Medicine, and the State University of New York Upstate. These sites closely reflected the ethnic and gender distribution, as well as duration of diabetes, of the general TODAY study population. Demographic and clinical data were provided at the time of randomization in the TODAY study and were reported to the authors by the Coordinating Center for the TODAY trial. The Participant Needs Assessment (PNA), a self-administered questionnaire designed to assess learning needs, was completed every 2 months during the first year of TODAY study involvement, then every 3 months in subsequent years. The sample for the longitudinal analysis included all youth and FSPs who completed at least 3 PNA forms over time. The completion of 3 PNA forms corresponded to duration of TODAY study participation.</p>
<sec id="section6-0145721713485305">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>At routine follow-up visits after baseline randomization, the diabetes educators asked the youth and the FSP to complete the PNA form, on which they each rate the youth’s learning needs related to diabetes self-management behaviors on a 5-point Likert-type scale. The responses were used as a guide to direct the focus of diabetes education and support at each follow-up visit.</p>
<p>The PNA was developed by the TODAY diabetes educators to assess learning needs of participants and FSPs as they entered the trial having completed the standard diabetes education Program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721713485305">3</xref></sup> Its intent was to correlate with behaviors needed to successfully manage type 2 diabetes, including use of diabetes medications, medical nutrition therapy, self-monitoring of blood glucose and urine ketones, exercise, and self-esteem issues. Additional teen issues were assessed for youth age 12 and older and include alcohol and drug use, pregnancy and diabetes, and driving concerns for the teen with diabetes. Youth were instructed to check the box that most closely states how they rate their learning needs related to diabetes care, using a scale of great, good, fair, poor, or awful, where 1 is <italic>doing great</italic> and 5 is <italic>doing awful</italic>. Thus, higher scores indicate greater learning needs.</p>
<p>The PNA contains 5 main content areas. The first area, Focus, includes blood glucose monitoring, medication, hypoglycemia, and exercise/activity. Not an Ordinary Day encompasses management of sick days, ketones, special occasions including parties and time away from home, as well as problem solving. The third area is Nutrition Nibbles, which examines dietary habits related to healthy food choices, portion sizes, food shopping skills, and label reading. Teen Issues includes driving, relationships, alcohol and drugs, and sex and pregnancy. The last area is titled Living With Diabetes and asks the youth and FSP to reflect on self-esteem, support systems, and feelings about current weight. There is a sixth section that allows the youth and FSP to identify other areas that they feel are important to diabetes management and were not included within the other categories. Data from the open-ended question were not analyzed because the majority of forms were left blank.</p>
<p>Because the PNA form was developed for the TODAY study, the reliability of the scales was examined. For the youth’s responses, alpha reliabilities for all scales were in the acceptable range for a new scale (Focus = .66, Not an Ordinary Day = .72, Nutrition = .8, Teen Issues = .79, Living With Diabetes = .68). For the FSP’s responses, all scales with the exception of Not an Ordinary Day showed acceptable internal consistency (Focus = .69, Not an Ordinary Day = .52, Nutrition = .85, Teen Issues = .80, Living With Diabetes = .77).</p>

<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Data were entered into an Excel™ (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA, USA) spreadsheet and double-checked by a research assistant and 1 of the authors (MG). SPSS (v 16) was used for the analyses. Research questions 1 and 2 were analyzed with paired <italic>t</italic> tests and 1-way analysis of variance, using baseline data. Research question 3 was analyzed using analysis of variance, 1 for the youth and 1 for the FSPs, first without controlling for diabetes duration and then with diabetes duration controlled.</p>

<sec id="section8-0145721713485305" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The final study sample for this analysis included 191 youth and their FSPs. The youth had a mean age of 14.0 (± 1.9 years) and duration of type 2 diabetes of 8.88 (± 6.3) months. The sample reflects the population at the participating sites with 36% non-Hispanic black, 40% Hispanic, 20% non-Hispanic white, and the remainder other. Females composed 66% of the sample.</p>
<p>The results for question 1 are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721713485305">Table 1</xref>. There were no significant differences in learning needs by gender, although scores on the Teen Issues scale approached significance with girls reporting higher needs than boys. There were no differences by racial/ethnic group.</p>

<p>Changes in learning needs for youth and FSPs over time are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145721713485305">Table 3</xref>. For 82 dyads, there were 3 visits recorded, about 3 to 6 months apart. For youth, learning needs decreased over time for Focus and increased over time for Teen Issues. When duration of diabetes was controlled, these differences disappeared, although trends for decreased needs over time were found for Focus and Nutrition. FSPs reported that their child’s learning needs decreased over time for Not an Ordinary Day, Nutrition, and Living With Diabetes. When duration of diabetes was controlled, only Nutrition remained statistically significant, and trends were found for Focus and Living With Diabetes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145721713485305">Table 3</xref>). Thus, despite having completed a standard diabetes education program, learning needs did not decrease consistently over time.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>Self-management of type 2 diabetes is complex, involving attention to diet, physical activity, medication administration, and self-monitoring of blood glucose levels, all of which need to be mastered to achieve successful metabolic control and quality of life. This research is the first to report learning needs over time in a relatively large cohort of youth with type 2 diabetes who had demonstrated mastery of a standardized diabetes education program. Since nutrition is such an important component of management of type 2 diabetes, it is heartening to see that learning needs in that area decreased over time. In other areas, learning needs did not decrease over time. Thus, the findings suggest the importance of ongoing systematic assessment of learning needs to improve self-management in youth with type 2 diabetes and their families.</p>
<p>Learning needs in youth with type 2 diabetes have not been previously characterized by gender or racial/ethnic group. With regard to gender, only in teen issues (pregnancy, driving, etc) did girls have higher learning needs than boys. Since pregnancy issues are prominent in this age group, and girls tend to be more physically mature than boys, this result is not surprising. It was unexpected, however, for there to be no difference in needs by racial/ethnic group. A recent survey of 103 adolescents with type 2 diabetes found that nonwhite race was significantly associated with poorer metabolic control, after adjusting for covariates which included age, gender, BMI, and health insurance status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721713485305">7</xref></sup> This difference in metabolic control may be related to self-management behaviors, such as sedentary time and physical activity. Following diet and exercise guidelines were reported by the minority adolescent patients in this study to be the most challenging aspects of diabetes care. The discrepancy in results between these 2 studies may be that we did not analyze our data by white and nonwhite status.</p>
<p>In a recent qualitative study of 10 African American adolescents with type 2 diabetes and their mothers, Auslander and colleagues examined perceptions of resources and barriers to self-management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721713485305">8</xref></sup> Themes identified included psychosocial resources such as the mother’s role as a primary support person, progression of self-efficacy and coping, awareness of the seriousness of diabetes, and positive peer support. Both adolescents and mothers confirmed the need for mothers to remind the adolescent of diabetes self-management responsibilities. Barriers included the presence of comorbidities, dietary challenges, fitting in with peers, and financial concerns. With the exception of financial concerns expressed by parents, the mothers and adolescents shared generally similar perceptions of the resources and barriers to managing the adolescent’s type 2 diabetes. In this PNA study, the quantitative data from a much larger sample suggest, however, that FSPs and youth with type 2 diabetes have different perceptions of learning needs, with youth reporting significantly greater learning needs than their FSPs. These needs may vary over time. These findings are in contrast to those found previously in youth with type 1 diabetes, where FSPs tend to report higher learning needs than youth, and that agreement was associated with better metabolic control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721713485305">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In general, the findings indicate that learning needs decreased over time as reported by youth and FSPs, with the exception of teen issues. It makes sense that perceived learning needs related to teen issues would increase as youth enter and proceed through puberty and adolescence. Interestingly, most of the trends over time disappeared once diabetes duration was controlled in the analysis, suggesting that as patients and FSPs have time to adjust to having diabetes, their comfort increases, as has been found in short-term studies of youth with type 1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721713485305">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although this study represents the first longitudinal study of diabetes learning needs in a relatively large sample of youth with type 2 diabetes and their FSPs, the findings need to be viewed in light of several important limitations. First, the sample was drawn from youth participating in a large clinical trial (TODAY), which required a long-term commitment on the part of youth and their FSPs. This requirement may make the sample less representative of the larger population of youth and families dealing with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Second, the major instrument used into this study was developed for the study by diabetes educators participating in the TODAY trial. Internal consistency reliability estimates were, for the most part, acceptable for a new instrument. But several scales, especially those for the FSPs, had lower than acceptable reliabilities, and findings from those scales should be interpreted with caution.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, these findings suggest that youth with type 2 diabetes and their FSPs have significant learning needs even after demonstrated mastery of a standard diabetes education program. Ongoing assessment and education are warranted, and the use of a tool such as the PNA used in this study may assist educators and clinicians to do so. In addition, youth and their FSPs had differing perceptions of learning needs, suggesting that both need to be involved in care and education to reduce the potential for conflict. Finally, while learning needs decreased over time, youth and FSPs still had high learning needs after approximately 6 months of follow-up. Diabetes educators and others involved in the care of these youth and families need to assess needs and provide education throughout the care trajectory.</p>
