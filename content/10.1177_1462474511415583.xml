<sec id="sec1-1462474511415583"><title>David F. Greenberg (ed.), <italic>Building Modern Criminology: Forays and Skirmishes</italic>, Ashgate: Surrey, UK, 2010; 524 pp. (including index, introduction and acknowledgements): 978-0-7546-2874-3, £115.00</title>
<p><italic>Building Modern Criminology</italic>, edited by David F. Greenberg, is a collection of previously published articles and chapters written by Greenberg<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1462474511415583">1</xref></sup> over the prior four decades (publication dates range from 1972 to 2008). The chapters of this volume offer a wonderful illustration of how a scholar can influence a discipline through high-quality, thought-provoking work that is theoretically, logically, historically, and methodologically rigorous.</p>
<p>The volume is divided into three sections, the titles of which illustrate the breadth of Greenberg’s work: ‘Causes of crime’, ‘The effects of the criminal justice system’, and ‘Understanding the criminal law and criminal justice system’. My personal favorite is the first chapter, ‘Delinquency and the age structure of society’ (originally published in 1977), which in my opinion is still one of the most important essays in the study of juvenile crime and juvenile justice. He also includes theoretical, historical, and quantitative analyses of: crime rates; the influence of class, gender and racial inequality on crime and punishment; deterrence; changes in punishment over time; causes and consequences of high incarceration rates; and international variation in the use of capital punishment. Some articles offer entirely novel investigations, while others respond to prior work by evaluating and at times reanalyzing data to uncover questionable assumptions and overstated results. Since the topics are many and the insights he derives even greater, I continue by discussing themes shared among them rather than individual chapters.</p>
<p>In the introduction, Greenberg reflects on his unique career trajectory, and one that includes no formal postgraduate education in any social science discipline. Greenberg began his criminological experience as a third grader being questioned by the police for burglary, continued it as an activist in the anti-Vietnam War movement, earned a PhD in physics from the University of Chicago, served as an adjunct teacher in the Social Science Department at Columbia University, helped write the American Friends Service Committee’s book, <italic>Struggle for Justice</italic>, and finally obtained a position as an assistant professor in Sociology at New York University, where he is today. Greenberg explains why he made each decision along this circuitous path; rather than being driven by predetermined standards or goals, at each turning point he made a practical decision given his options and interests at the time. And this practicality is exactly what makes his career’s work so meaningful. He considers important problems given his interests at the time and uses whatever tools are appropriate, rather than having his questions or methods for answering them predetermined by standards set either by himself, others, or current scholarly trends. In contrast to scholars who are equipped to do only one category of work, whether it is quantitative, qualitative, historical, or theoretical, Greenberg’s vita includes all of them. Thus the author of <italic>Mathematical Criminology</italic> is also at ease discussing functions of criminal law throughout modernity, based on historical texts.</p>
<p>We see the practicality of Greenberg’s work in his theoretical repertoire as well. As he states in the introduction, ‘Not knowing whether any specific theoretical tools will, in fact, clarify the world, I do not commit myself dogmatically to any of them. Only an ideologue would’ (p. xv). He borrows and tests ideas from Marx, Durkheim, Elias, critical gender scholars, and even rational choice theorists, among others. The chapters show a strong commitment to understanding the context within which any criminological problem arises, and using the right set of ideas for that particular context and problem. He uses theories as ‘resources for the theorist to use in understanding the world, not as divinely inspired doctrine’ (p. xiv). Moreover, his understanding of each theory is deep and impressive, as he analyzes and searches for the true meaning of Durkheim, Marx, or other theorists rather than importing and applying empirically these ideas uncritically.</p>
<p>Greenberg’s approach to scholarship is also evident in his use of logic throughout each chapter. In stark contrast to much of the research published in current criminological journals, in which authors test and reformulate existing theories using fairly prescribed formulae, Greenberg approaches each criminological problem as a logical puzzle. Each and every assumption and theoretical premise he covers is scrutinized and debated through a series of logical steps to determine if it is plausible, and what it would mean for his inquiry if it were true. No ideas are immune from this scrutiny, regardless of whether they are long held tenets inherited from Marx or Durkheim, or assumptions underlying rigorous statistical computations. As a result, each and every chapter in this volume illustrates the importance of careful critical thinking and the necessity of resisting the urge to rush into theorizing or analyzing data.</p>
<p>Even those familiar with Greenberg’s work will find the volume illuminating. I was very fortunate to have been a student of his, yet even I was surprised with how much I learned about good criminological scholarship by reading this collection of his work. The volume highlights Greenberg’s important role within the study of crime and criminal justice over the course of his career, but more importantly, it is a terrific example of careful, thoughtful, and essentially practical scholarship. I will recommend it to graduate students and colleagues, especially junior colleagues, since it offers a model of quality criminological thinking.</p>
