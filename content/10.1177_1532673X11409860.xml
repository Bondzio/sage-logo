<abstract>
<p>Our understanding of the impact of party conventions on opinion regarding presidential candidates is based largely on aggregate-level analysis. Extant individual-level investigation has been limited by the assumption that conventions are monolithic information events that exercise uniform effects. Using panel data, we show for the first time that conventions exercise two independent effects, which can counteract or reinforce each other depending on individual characteristics and information consumption. First, we demonstrate how exposure to speeches exercises a persuasive effect that benefits the convening candidate, even when partisanship is controlled. Second, we demonstrate how conventions exercise an atmospheric effect that activates general partisan bias. We find that observed postconvention changes are attributable to the combination of these separate but simultaneous effects. We also explore how individual partisanship conditions speech effects and find evidence that partisanship influences the decision to listen but is unlikely to influence the impact of a message already heard.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During every presidential election, each major political party convenes to adopt a platform and formally nominate its presidential and vice presidential candidates. The question of who will be nominated is now settled in advance of the conventions, but the traditional attention conventions garner, and the continued willingness of the parties to invest resources in them, allow conventions to function as campaign events without equal. Convention speeches by the nominees and their key allies are scheduled during “prime time,” and they are televised by the major broadcast and cable news networks. As a result, the speeches draw a wide audience composed of both interested partisans and independents. Conventions are capable of causing large shifts in the aggregate split of candidate support, almost always in favor of the convening candidate. These “bumps” are attractive targets for study and have drawn considerable scholarly attention. Even though the conventions perform other notable functions related to maintaining party cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532673X11409860">Trent &amp; Friedenberg, 2000</xref>) and framing public political discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532673X11409860">Campbell, Cherry, &amp; Wink, 1992</xref>), a survey of the relevant literature reveals that most quantitative analysis has focused on the aggregate shifts in candidate support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532673X11409860">Campbell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532673X11409860">Campbell et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532673X11409860">Gelman &amp; King, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532673X11409860">Holbrook, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532673X11409860">Stimson, 2004</xref>). This focus has been fruitful as researchers have succeeded in modeling the shifts as functions of aggregate-level variables such as preconvention candidate support, retrospective economic evaluations, and approval ratings of the sitting president.</p>
<p>Aggregate movement, however, is dependent on individual-level change, and we have an incomplete understanding of how individuals are affected by conventions. The creative use of panel data collected around the conventions has recently provided researchers with some understanding of <italic>who</italic> is likely to be affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532673X11409860">Hillygus &amp; Jackman, 2003</xref>). A complete understanding of <italic>how</italic> the changes individuals undergo are generated will require not only recognition of differences in individual characteristics but also recognition of variation in how individuals experience conventions. Conventions are long, taking place over a span of several days. The information environment surrounding the electorate during conventions is complex. Some forms of information, such as partisan political symbols, slogans, and imagery, saturate the environment and are difficult to avoid exposure to. Other forms, such as televised convention speeches, require a conscious decision to consume.</p>
<p>As a next step toward building a more complete understanding of how conventions influence individual opinion, we isolate televised convention speeches—the central events of conventions, consisting of unfiltered information directly from the convening party—and demonstrate how they exercise a persuasive effect on individual-level candidate evaluations that is distinct from the impact of the surrounding convention atmosphere. In addition, we examine the degree to which the effects of both the speeches and the convention atmosphere are conditioned by a key individual characteristic: partisanship.</p>

<title>Conventions in the Context of Campaign Effects Literature</title>
<p>Modern campaign effects scholarship evolved from early efforts to understand how campaigns measured up alongside other variables thought to influence election outcomes. These early studies found that preferences remained mostly static over the course of campaigns, that preferences were largely determined by demographic characteristics and party identification, that campaigns merely reinforced predispositions, and that those most likely to be influenced by campaigns were least likely to pay attention to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11409860">Campbell, Converse, Miller, &amp; Stokes, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532673X11409860">Lazarsfeld, Berelson, &amp; Gaudet, 1944</xref>). The resulting “minimal effects” consensus persisted until the 1990s. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1532673X11409860">Zaller (1992)</xref> proposed that predispositions themselves are shaped and reshaped by the kinds of elite opinions encountered during campaigns. However, he noted that opposing groups of elites often put out competing messages during campaigns; therefore, detection of campaign effects will depend on not only the distribution of political awareness and ideological allegiance in the electorate but also the relative intensity of campaign messages. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532673X11409860">Bartels (1993)</xref> found that campaigns only occasionally generate notable changes in opinions, but he wondered if the effects of campaigns might be “more fugitive than minimal” (p. 267). He attributed the development of the “minimal effects” consensus to a tendency among researchers to focus only on large aggregate shifts in opinion. Bartels suggested a reconceptualization of the type of effects researchers should look for, perhaps only expecting notable aggregate shifts when campaign messages are distinctive, consistent, and clearly in favor of one side.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532673X11409860">Finkel (1993)</xref> noted a flurry of survey data and studies during the 1980s documenting an increase in the instability of vote intention during campaigns. After examining data from these campaigns, Finkel concluded that although campaign effects may be minimal in the sense that precampaign preferences explain the vast majority of votes, campaigns play a key role in ensuring that voters correctly cast votes in accordance with their preferences. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532673X11409860">Holbrook (1996)</xref> asserted that campaigns are relevant precisely because they enable the public to bring their voting behavior in line with their predispositions. By highlighting the informational role of campaigns, these researchers expanded the scope of the campaign effects literature beyond persuasion and into investigations of partisan activation.</p>
<p>As part of the reconsideration of the role and importance of campaigns, some scholars began to focus their efforts on the sets of events that actually constitute campaigns. Emerging recognition of the importance of understanding campaign processes spurred interest in specific, prominent campaign events such as nominating conventions and debates. Research in this vein indicates that conventions are capable of moving the aggregate split of candidate support, acting to bring it in line with objective economic and political conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532673X11409860">Campbell et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532673X11409860">Gelman &amp; King, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532673X11409860">Holbrook, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532673X11409860">Shaw, 1999</xref>). The renewed focus researchers have placed on high-profile campaign events has consistently yielded evidence that they matter, and, as a result, debates and conventions have joined presidential approval and retrospective economic evaluations as determinants in some contemporary models of candidate support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532673X11409860">Shaw &amp; Roberts, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532673X11409860">Stimson, 2004</xref>) and election forecasting models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532673X11409860">Linn, Moody, &amp; Asper, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In a departure from the aggregate-level focus of convention effects studies, a recent individual-level study of the 2000 election by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532673X11409860">Hillygus and Jackman (2003)</xref> found that individual voter preferences are responsive to nominating conventions. A key innovation was their use of panel data collected around the conventions to test for individual-level effects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532673X11409860">Hillygus and Jackman (2003)</xref> treated the conventions as monolithic “intervening events” (p. 588), expected to produce an individual-level effect that would vary only based on individuals’ a priori characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532673X11409860">1</xref></sup> As they did not directly measure variation in exposure to information across individuals during the conventions, the authors were not able to isolate the effects of the actual convention speeches on individual opinion, a limitation that we take as a point of departure.</p>

<title>Measuring Convention Effects</title>
<p>Conventions provide parties with opportunities to dominate and structure the political narrative, to frame issues, and to remind the electorate what they stand for. They provide chances to define, on favorable terms, the information shortcuts voters use to structure their choices. Conventions bring closure to acrimonious primary battles and give partisans a chance to coalesce around the nominees of their respective parties. Convention speeches provide a showcase for young, up-and-coming political talent and allow elder statesmen opportunities to solidify their political legacies. More importantly, they give the electorate an opportunity to get an intimate feel for the people vying to occupy the highest levels of government. Sometimes, after the dust settles, events during the conventions become a part of the lore of our political culture: George Bush’s “Read my lips: No new taxes” promise, Pat Buchanan’s “Culture War” speech, the video introduction of Bill Clinton as “The Man from Hope,” or Al and Tipper Gore’s onstage kiss.</p>
<p>Despite the variety of pressures exerted on the electorate during conventions by the parties and by individual convention speakers, most researchers have focused on the immediate cumulative impact of conventions on opinion polls. This is intuitive; since the introduction of the partisan primaries, the overriding purpose of holding conventions has been to sway public opinion toward the convening candidate to win the general election. Because of its immediate relevance to the final vote, candidate preference has been the dependent variable of choice. However, using change in vote preference as a measurement of the immediate effects of conventions on public opinion has inherent limitations. Conventions can have a meaningful impact on individuals without influencing their candidate preference ordering—exposure to campaign information during conventions can influence the likelihood of <italic>acting</italic> or <italic>participating</italic> based on preexisting preferences. Such changes are just as important to final vote totals as changes in the aggregate split of candidate preference.</p>
<p>We propose <italic>candidate evaluations</italic> as an alternative metric with which to measure postconvention shifts in individual opinion. Candidate evaluations allow a comparison of how individuals feel about the candidates in relation to one another, just as measures of candidate preference do, but they also allow for measurement of intensity of feelings about individual candidates. Evaluations of candidate traits or characteristics are often measured on ordinal scales, making them more sensitive than binary measurements of candidate preference. A great deal of convention campaigning emphasizes candidate characteristics, a strategy found to be effective by scholars.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1532673X11409860">2</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11409860">Lewis-Beck, Jacoby, Norpoth, and Weisberg (2008)</xref> show that when voters are asked about candidate support, they are likely to reference personal attributes, including record and experience, qualification and abilities, and personality traits. In fact, they argue that some citizens “may simply think about voting choices in terms of the candidates’ own personal characteristics” (p. 256). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11409860">Lewis-Beck et al. (2008)</xref> place candidate evaluations alongside other important factors that feed into the “funnel of causality” that leads to vote, such as partisanship, issues, and socioeconomic status. Furthermore, they believe candidate characteristics have the potential to mitigate other important factors that influence the voting act: “No candidate, of course, can totally escape association with the foreign and domestic policies, or with the group interests, of his party. But this tie may vary a great deal based on the background of the candidate and the circumstances of a given election” (p. 42). In all, there is considerable support in the literature for the assertion that studying candidate evaluations will allow the detection of meaningful individual-level changes in opinion during convention periods.</p>

<sec id="section4-1532673X11409860">
<title>Theory and Hypotheses</title>
<p>Despite evidence that conventions impact public opinion, there has not been sufficient individual-level investigation into <italic>how</italic> these important campaign events generate such shifts. For members of the electorate, the potential to be impacted by the flood of campaign information produced during conventions depends on exposure to it. In the introduction, we suggested that exposure can be voluntary or involuntary and that the distinction can make a difference. Extant individual-level analyses of convention effects have not measured variation in information exposure and are limited to explaining whom the convention periods impact. Drawing from the literature on campaign effects and conventions, we formulate and test four hypotheses that address these gaps.</p>
<p>First, we consider the effects of voluntary exposure to the prime-time speeches made by the nominees and their most prominent allies. The speeches are unique in that they are unfiltered by third parties; the speakers deliver information directly to the electorate. The presentation of these speeches is traditionally uniform, and the speeches are shown without interruption and in their entirety. They are the main events of the conventions, and although viewership has declined over the last few decades, the speeches can draw vast audiences made up of partisans of both stripes as well as independents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532673X11409860">Karabell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532673X11409860">Shafer, 1988</xref>). Speech consumption represents a conscious decision to learn about and evaluate the candidates by direct observation. Through control of the format and a monopoly on presentation, the convening party can present their candidate as the exemplar of positive values (and simultaneously demonize the opposition candidate). Consequently, speeches have the potential to influence voters of all stripes. Our expectation is that when preconvention evaluations and individual partisanship are controlled, speech consumption will have a significant influence on postconvention evaluations, in favor of the convening candidate. Increased exposure to convention speeches will improve individual evaluations of the convening candidate’s characteristics and damage corresponding evaluations of the opposition candidate, regardless of individual party affiliation.</p>
<p>Second, we consider the effects of exposure to the information environment surrounding the speeches. During conventions, the atmosphere is abnormally politicized, saturated with partisan slogans, symbols, and imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532673X11409860">Campbell et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532673X11409860">Trent &amp; Friedenberg, 2000</xref>). Partisan ads permeate nonpolitical media programming, and politics seeps into the everyday discussions that surround people at work and in the home. The literature on party identification has long shown that partisanship serves as a useful heuristic for voters and plays a key role in electoral decisionmaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11409860">Campbell et al., 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532673X11409860">Rahn, 1993</xref>). Increasing the visibility and accessibility of party during conventions makes it a convenient social-psychological rallying point. For this reason, partisanship has an increased potential to structure postconvention evaluations and decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532673X11409860">Grant, Mockabee, &amp; Monson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1532673X11409860">Zaller &amp; Feldman, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Interested members of the electorate can also choose to consume convention coverage via print media, the radio, network or cable television, or the Internet. Although evidence from the 1980s and early 1990s indicates that traditional media convention coverage has favored the convening candidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532673X11409860">Holbrook, 1996</xref>), the recent explosion of sources for political coverage tailored to distinct ideological viewpoints (and their cultivation of partisan audiences eager to consume reporting from congruent perspectives) makes it a simple matter for individuals to apply a partisan screen during their information searches.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532673X11409860">3</xref></sup> In our view, both involuntary exposure to ambient political messages in the environment and voluntary consumption of coverage are likely to increase the role of partisanship in structuring opinion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1532673X11409860">4</xref></sup> Consequently, we hypothesize that after preconvention evaluations and exposure to the convention speeches are controlled, respondent partisanship will exercise significant explanatory power on postconvention evaluations. Relative to those who identify with the opposite party, partisans’ postconvention evaluations will favor their own party’s candidate, regardless of who is convening. Of course, political independents are also awash in the sea of information surrounding the conventions. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1532673X11409860">Zaller (1991)</xref>, we expect (when speech exposure and preconvention evaluations are held constant) that those without party affiliation will express postconvention opinions similar to those of members of the party with the informational advantage (typically the convening party).</p>
<p>Third, we expect that partisanship will influence the constitution of the audience for the televised portions of the conventions. Although few functioning members of society will be able to completely avoid the hoopla surrounding the conventions, extended exposure to the prime-time convention speeches certainly involves a conscious choice. Partisans, who spend significant cognitive resources cultivating trusted sources of political information, will find it difficult to expose themselves to the convention speeches of the opposing party’s nominee, lest they encounter information that does not fit with their preconceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532673X11409860">Bartels, 2002</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that partisans will be biased toward self-exposure to convention speeches by candidates and officials of their own parties and less likely to consume speeches by opposition politicians.</p>
<p>Finally, we take another page from Bartels, who argues that party identification acts as a “pervasive dynamic force shaping citizens’ perceptions of, and reactions to, the political world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532673X11409860">2002</xref>, p. 138) and has suggested that “it would be desirable from a theoretical standpoint to allow for the possibility that party identification conditions the impact of media exposure (via selective perception) in addition to mattering in its own right” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532673X11409860">1993</xref>, p. 283). If partisanship exerts a bias on information processing as well as a bias on information exposure, then it is reasonable to expect that the persuasive effects of convention speeches will be enhanced when the partisanship of the convening candidate and the listener are aligned and diluted when the partisanship of the convening candidate and the listener are mismatched. In short, partisans will be more responsive to messages that are in line with their predispositions, an idea commonly expressed in the literature on partisan biases in information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532673X11409860">Bartels, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532673X11409860">Goren, 2002</xref>). In accordance, we hypothesize that partisanship may exert such a conditional effect on the proposed relationship between speech exposure and candidate evaluations.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>The data for this article come from the National Annenberg Election Study (NAES) 2004 Democratic and Republican Convention Panel Studies. In 2004, the NAES conducted two separate convention panels, each consisting of a pair of interviews—one paired set of interviews before and after the Democratic convention and the second paired set before and after the Republican convention.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1532673X11409860">5</xref></sup> For the Democratic panel, interviews were administered during the 10 days before the Democratic convention (July 16-25) and again during the 10 days after the convention (July 30-August 8). For the Grand Old Party (GOP) convention panel, respondents were interviewed during the 10 days before the convention (August 20-29) and were reinterviewed during the 11 days following the convention (September 3-13). Because of the tight timing of questionnaire delivery around the convention periods, the 2004 NAES convention panels allow us to isolate the effects that events during the respective conventions had on individual respondents’ conceptions of a multitude of both candidates’ favorable and unfavorable personal attributes.</p>
<p>In this article, we use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to examine how the conventions affected individual respondent evaluations of John Kerry (the Democratic nominee) and George W. Bush (the incumbent president and GOP nominee). Although the variables we wish to explain (postconvention candidate characteristic evaluations) are measured on 11-point ordinal scales, we combine the observed values into candidate evaluation indexes that are best treated as continuous; thus, OLS is the appropriate method. Our core test consists of two series of regressions. The first series focuses on evaluations of Kerry and Bush after the 2004 Democratic convention. In this series, there are separate tests for Kerry’s positive traits, Kerry’s negative traits, Bush’s positive traits, and Bush’s negative traits. The second series of regressions is identical, except that it focuses on evaluations after the 2004 GOP convention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1532673X11409860">
<title>Variables and Measurement</title>
<p>Within each convention panel, once before the given convention and again afterward, respondents were presented with a series of 16 distinct characteristics and asked how well each one applied to the respective candidates on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 indicating <italic>does not apply at all</italic> and 10 indicating <italic>applies extremely well</italic>. Eleven positive characteristics were referenced, whereas five negative traits were referenced.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1532673X11409860">6</xref></sup> To strike a balance between thorough and concise investigation of the effects of conventions on individual-level candidate evaluations, we take all of these numerous measures of opinion regarding various candidate traits and collapse them into candidate evaluation indexes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1532673X11409860">7</xref></sup> For each convention panel, we create four paired sets of pre- and postconvention evaluation indexes—two sets (one for positive traits and one for negative traits) for each candidate. Positive and negative candidate traits are treated separately because of the basic conceptual difference between them and because of the different ways that candidates themselves reference them during conventions. Higher values for responses to the questions regarding positive traits are more favorable to the candidate being evaluated, whereas higher values for responses to the questions regarding negative characteristics are less favorable for the candidate under evaluation. Each index represents the average score across all answered questions for a given respondent. Scores for each characteristic are included in a given respondent’s index only if that respondent provided one in both waves of his or her panel. The reliability of the individual items within each index is high, with Cronbach’s alpha never falling below .80 for any group of measures within a single index.</p>
<p>We isolate convention effects on indexed <italic>postconvention candidate evaluations</italic> by holding <italic>preconvention evaluations</italic> constant. These preconvention evaluations should explain all of the variation in postconvention evaluations, except in cases where information introduced during the convention exercised effects. This remaining variation is what we are interested in and is explained by other independent variables measuring exposure to convention speeches and bias activated by the information environment surrounding the conventions.</p>
<p>The first of these independent variables, <italic>speech exposure</italic>, is a composite measure constructed from responses to questions about time spent watching each of three major convention speeches. We chose to operationalize speech exposure in this way because the major speeches delivered during a given convention are likely to have a cumulative impact on evaluations. Respondents were asked to indicate the amount of each speech they watched on an ordinal response scale ranging from <italic>none</italic> to <italic>the entire speech</italic>. For the tests pertaining to the Democratic convention, our composite measure averages voluntary exposure to speeches by John Kerry, John Edwards, and Bill Clinton. For the tests pertaining to the GOP convention, the measure averages voluntary exposure to speeches by George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and Zell Miller. The resulting continuous variables are scaled so that respondents reporting no exposure to any speeches receive a value of 0, whereas respondents who reported watching every minute of every speech receive a value of 1.</p>
<p>To create our second independent variable, we recoded the responses from two linked party identification questions into three mutually exclusive dichotomous variables: <italic>Democrat</italic>, <italic>Independent</italic>, and <italic>Republican</italic>. Respondents who identified themselves as partisan “leaners” were included in the partisan dummy variables. Within each test, the dummy variable for partisans of the convening party was designated as the excluded category.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1532673X11409860">8</xref></sup> Finally, to determine if additional explanatory power could be derived from modeling the persuasive potential of speech exposure as conditional on individual partisanship, we constructed a series of interaction terms by multiplying values of each party dummy variable against values of the speech consumption variable.</p>

<p>Before embarking on an individual-level investigation of convention effects, it is worthwhile to take a cursory look at the aggregate-level changes resulting from the conventions. To examine the effects of the conventions on candidate evaluations at the aggregate level, we compared the pre- and postconvention indexes of candidate evaluations and applied significance tests. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11409860">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11409860">2</xref> summarize the effects of the Democratic and Republican conventions on aggregate-level candidate evaluations and break down the aggregate effects of the conventions based on respondent partisanship.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11409860">Table 1</xref> shows that prior to the 2004 Democratic convention, on aggregate, evaluations of Kerry’s and Bush’s positive characteristics were comparable (a difference of less than one tenth of a point). Evaluations of the candidates’ negative traits favored Kerry over Bush. When aggregate evaluations are broken down by respondent party affiliation, a strong relationship between preconvention trait evaluations and partisanship is evident, with partisans giving favorable ratings to their party’s candidate and unfavorable ratings to the opposition candidate and with independents giving middle-of-the-road scores to both candidates. Interestingly, partisan polarization regarding candidate traits was stronger regarding evaluations of positive traits. Mean evaluations of negative candidate traits were more uniform across partisan groups.</p>
<p>On aggregate, the 2004 Democratic convention improved evaluations of Kerry’s positive characteristics. This aggregate improvement was driven by a significant shift among Democratic identifiers and a comparatively larger shift among political independents. Republicans were not significantly moved. Improvement of aggregated evaluations of Kerry’s negative traits did not reach statistical significance, although among Democratic identifiers only there was a significant improvement. For Bush, there was no demonstrable aggregate effect on evaluations of his positive characteristics and no significant movement among the subgroups of partisan identifiers. There was a statistically significant postconvention worsening of aggregate evaluations of Bush’s negative traits, fueled in large part by shifts in opinion among Democrats. Aggregate data paint a picture of the effects of the Democratic convention that is consistent with both “partisan activation” campaign effects literature and models that show a partisan bias in dealing with information. Views of both candidates changed in favor of the convening candidate, but the change appeared to be driven largely by supporters of the convening party.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11409860">Table 2</xref> indicates that just prior to the 2004 GOP convention, Bush received slightly more favorable mean evaluations regarding his positive traits than did Kerry. Evaluations of the candidates’ negative traits favored Kerry over Bush. Respondent partisanship again exhibits a clear relationship with preconvention evaluations, and this polarization is once again more visible in aggregate evaluations of positive candidate characteristics. Like its Democratic counterpart, the Republican convention had its largest aggregate-level impact on evaluations of the positive traits of the convening candidate. Aggregate evaluations of Bush’s positive characteristics improved significantly post convention. Remarkably, this shift cut across party lines; on average, Democrats actually improved their evaluations of Bush slightly post convention. Independents were (once again) especially moved, increasing their mean ratings of Bush’s positive traits by almost half a point. Meanwhile, evaluations of Kerry’s positive traits were damaged after the GOP convention, but this shift was driven completely by changes among GOP-identifying respondents. Aggregate evaluations of both candidates’ negative traits were unmoved. Overall, an aggregate examination again yields results largely in sync with expectations generated by the partisan activation and partisan bias literature; most of the aggregate change appears to be due to shifts among partisan supporters of the convening candidate’s party. However, the pattern of change among those without party affiliation cannot be ignored. Independents experienced the largest shifts in aggregate evaluations of the convening candidates’ positive traits after both conventions. The conventions present the convening candidates in the best possible light, and this simple bivariate analysis suggests that independents, although only a small part of the electorate, are exceptionally persuadable.</p>
<p>It is also worthwhile to precede our individual-level tests of convention effects with an examination of patterns of exposure to campaign information during conventions. Doing so allows for a direct test of our hypothesis concerning the relationship between individual partisanship and voluntary exposure to convention speeches. Although it is near-impossible to accurately measure the levels of individual involuntary exposure to campaign symbols and slogans during the conventions (bumper stickers, yard signs, radio and television ads, etc.), respondent self-reporting regarding time spent watching the convention speeches provides us with a convenient measure of how individual partisanship shapes voluntary exposure to the more substantive campaign information contained within the speeches.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532673X11409860">Table 3</xref> shows that partisan affiliation acts as an information filter. Although there was not wide variation across partisan groups in the percentage of people tuning in to watch part of the speeches, partisans of the convening party were more than twice as likely to watch the major speeches in their entirety than were independents or opposition partisans. Likewise, opposition partisans were much more likely to completely avoid the speeches than were partisans of the convening party. Independents were the least likely to watch the speeches in their entirety, a finding consistent with decades of research indicating that those without partisan affiliation are the least likely to pay attention to campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1532673X11409860">Zaller, 1992</xref>). It is worthwhile to note that independents were slightly more likely to watch some of Kerry’s speech than they were to sample Bush’s, probably a reflection of the fact that Kerry was the unknown quantity at this point compared with the incumbent Bush. Although these patterns of exposure leave room for the speeches to affect voters across the partisan spectrum, they also show that party affiliation is an important constraint on the possible aggregate impact of speech information on the electorate.</p>

<p>Our first hypothesis predicts that increased exposure to the Democratic convention speeches will yield more favorable evaluations of Kerry and less favorable evaluations of Bush. We find evidence that meets this expectation. After the Democratic convention period, ceteris paribus, respondents who watched more of the Democratic speeches expressed improved evaluations of Kerry both in terms of his positive and negative traits. At the same time, respondents who took in more of the speeches were more likely to think less of Bush regarding his negative traits. Although speech exposure did not significantly damage evaluations of Bush’s positive traits, it is worthwhile to note that there were no instances where increased exposure to the Democratic speeches significantly harmed Kerry or helped Bush. These results demonstrate that voluntary exposure to the Democratic speeches broadly impacted viewers in a direction favorable to Kerry.</p>
<p>The second hypothesis creates the expectation that individual partisanship will be a significant predictor of postconvention evaluations for both candidates, and that is precisely what the data show. After controlling for preconvention evaluations and exposure to convention speeches, Republican identifiers were likely to give Kerry significantly worse ratings, and Bush significantly better ratings, than were Democratic identifiers (the omitted category). That respondent partisanship significantly predicted postconvention evaluations of positive and negative traits for both candidates is strong evidence that the partisan atmosphere surrounding the Democratic convention made individual partisanship a more salient decision basis. This ambient effect is in evidence even after controlling for the effect of exposure to the focused Democratic message delivered by the convention speakers.</p>
<p>The dummy variable for independents failed to reach statistical significance across all four tests, indicating little difference between the effects of the convention atmosphere on those without party affiliation and Democratic identifiers. This result is evidence that in addition to activating partisan bias among Democrats and Republicans, the atmosphere surrounding the Democratic convention also worked to sway independents toward the convening candidate, even after controlling for exposure to the Democratic speeches.</p>
<p>Our fourth hypothesis suggests that individual party affiliation may condition the impact of exposure to the Democratic speeches on postconvention candidate evaluations. Specifically, the expectation is that increased speech consumption would sway Democrats more easily than Republicans (even after holding preconvention evaluations constant). Meanwhile, independents—who typically display lower levels of political knowledge than partisans—may have the largest potential to be swayed toward Kerry by increased exposure to the Democratic speeches. We examined the possibility that superior explanatory power might result from allowing interactions between the speech exposure variable and the party affiliation variables by comparing the estimates generated by these new unconstrained models against the estimates generated by the original constrained models. <italic>F</italic> tests revealed that allowing the Democratic speeches to exercise unique marginal effects on candidate evaluations for each category of partisan self-identifiers never offered increased predictive power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1532673X11409860">9</xref></sup> Although partisanship influenced exposure to Kerry’s speech, insignificant <italic>F</italic> statistics indicate that partisanship did not condition how the speeches impacted perceptions of the candidates.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1532673X11409860">Table 5</xref> displays the results for the series of tests regarding evaluations of George W. Bush and John Kerry, respectively, after the 2004 Republican convention. Consideration of our first hypothesis creates the expectation that when respondent party identification and preconvention evaluations are held constant, increased exposure to Republican convention speeches will yield more favorable postconvention evaluations of George W. Bush and less favorable postconvention evaluations of John Kerry. The data show that the effects of the 2004 GOP speeches were consistent with this expectation. Higher voluntary exposure to the GOP speeches yielded more favorable evaluations of Bush’s traits. Increased exposure to Republican speeches also led to significantly worse ratings for Kerry.</p>

<p>The second hypothesis leads to the expectation that individual partisanship will be a significant predictor of postconvention evaluations of both candidates, and, again, the results confirm this relationship. At the end of the GOP convention period, when preconvention evaluations and exposure to GOP convention speeches were controlled, Democratic-identifying respondents were significantly more likely to express worse evaluations of Bush and better evaluations of Kerry compared with their Republican-identifying counterparts. Respondent partisanship predicted candidate evaluations, after the GOP convention, for both candidates’ positive and negative traits. These results show that (like during the earlier Democratic convention period) the atmosphere surrounding the Republican convention activated partisan bias regarding candidate trait evaluations and that this effect persisted regardless of exposure to convention speeches.</p>
<p>Unlike during the Democratic convention, the information environment surrounding the GOP convention did not have a consistent impact on candidate trait evaluations among political independents (after controlling for other factors). Although postconvention attitudes among independents were statistically indistinguishable from postconvention attitudes among Republicans regarding the positive traits of both candidates, independents were less likely to move with Republicans regarding consideration of the candidates’ negative traits.</p>
<p>Our fourth hypothesis suggests that partisan bias in information processing makes it likely that increased exposure to the Republican speeches would not exercise as strong a persuasive effect among Democrats as it would among Republicans (or independents). However, <italic>F</italic> tests resulting from a comparison of the estimates generated by the conditional and linear-additive model pairs indicate that in three out of four cases, the constraint implicit in the linear-additive model holds—partisanship did not significantly condition the impact of exposure to the Republican speeches.</p>
<p>There was one instance (postconvention evaluations of Bush’s negative traits) where the multiplicative conditional model form provided a significantly better fit to the data. Although the majority of tests from both conventions indicate that speech exposure can be expected to exercise a uniform effect on evaluations, it is worthwhile to examine the sole instance where partisanship appeared to condition the persuasive power of the speeches—a more complicated model is to be preferred as long as it offers greater explanatory power. Unfortunately, because variables of interest (speech exposure and the partisan dummy variables) are now constitutive elements of interaction terms, their associated coefficients as reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1532673X11409860">Table 5</xref> can no longer be interpreted as average effects on the dependent variable (postconvention evaluations). In addition, a complete understanding of the effects of the conditioning variables (the partisan affiliation dummies) on the relationship between speech exposure and evaluations is not attainable by examination of the interaction term coefficients alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532673X11409860">Brambor, Clark, &amp; Golder, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1532673X11409860">Table 6</xref> presents separate slope coefficient estimates and standard errors for the marginal effect of speech exposure on postconvention trait evaluations (derived from the multiplicative conditional model estimates) for each of the mutually exclusive partisan groups.</p>

<p>Increased speech consumption during the 2004 GOP convention significantly improved evaluations of Bush’s negative traits, but this effect was limited to Republican identifiers only. Speech exposure did not significantly affect evaluations of Bush’s negative traits among independents or Democratic identifiers after other factors were controlled. Given the amount of time the electorate had to become acquainted with Bush during his incumbency, it is likely that exposure to the GOP convention speeches simply reminded independent and Democratic viewers of what they had come to dislike about Bush over the course of his first term.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>This investigation brings additional individual-level scrutiny to bear on presidential nominating conventions, which have almost always been examined at the aggregate level. Our approach to modeling convention effects builds on previous work by integrating a measure of exposure to the convention speeches alongside measures of individual characteristics. This innovation enabled us to detect simultaneous but independent campaign influences on individual opinion—an instrumental, information-consumption-driven <italic>persuasive</italic> effect, and a separate, atmospheric, social-psychological <italic>partisan bias-activating</italic> effect.</p>
<p>The focused information delivered to the electorate during the conventions in the form of speeches by the candidates and their closest supporters had a clear persuasive impact. After both conventions, increasing exposure to speeches yielded candidate evaluations increasingly favorable to the convening candidate. This effect persisted even after respondent partisan affiliation and preconvention evaluations were controlled. In addition, after each convention, we detected emergent partisan bias regarding postconvention candidate evaluations. Regardless of which party was convening, candidates were guaranteed more favorable postconvention evaluations among individuals sharing their party affiliation, even after controlling for preconvention evaluations and exposure to the televised prime-time speeches. Therefore, this emergent bias must be the result of the partisanship-soaked atmosphere surrounding the speeches—the convention “hoopla.” The conventions appear to be times when the parties, through brute-force media saturation, maximize their roles as social-psychological group rallying points.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1532673X11409860">10</xref></sup> The easy accessibility of partisan affiliation during conventions allows partisanship an increased role in individual-level judgment of candidate traits.</p>
<p>The effect of the convention atmosphere on candidate evaluations was not limited to partisans. In most cases, movement among political independents was indistinguishable from movement among partisans of the convening party. This congruence is understandable, given the information advantage held by the convening party. Even in the few cases when the behavior of independents differed significantly from the behavior of convening partisans, those differences were less than half the magnitude of the gulfs between Democratic and Republican identifiers.</p>
<p>Including a measure of speech consumption also allowed us to examine how partisanship biases information exposure and information processing during conventions. Our findings mesh well with the established body of literature describing the tendency of partisans to update primarily based on “friendly” information sources, but with some caveats. It appears that the conditional effect of partisanship on the relationship between exposure to speeches and candidate characteristic evaluations comes during the earliest opportunity. Party affiliation influences the initial decision to expose oneself to convention speeches (and, by extension, to the opportunity to be persuaded), but partisanship does not appear to regularly condition the persuasive impact of speech consumption on postconvention candidate evaluations.</p>
<p>Our investigation should encourage researchers interested in campaign effects to continue looking under the aggregate-level hood. Examination of aggregate data alone suggests that postconvention changes in opinion are due largely to adjustments made by partisans of the convening candidate’s party and that conventions do not really impact independents or opposition partisans. However, our individual-level analysis shows how this conclusion is misleading and incomplete. Each convention period is shown to exercise simultaneous, independent effects at the individual level that can partially nullify and conceal each other at the aggregate level. After the Democratic convention period, any significant persuasive effect of the Democratic speeches on Republican viewers was counterbalanced by the activation of general Republican partisan bias, leaving the convention’s aggregate effect on Democrats and independents (for whom the “hoopla” and speech effects reinforce each other) more easily detectable. This pattern was mirrored after the Republican convention—the persuasive effects of the GOP speeches on Democratic viewers were masked at the aggregate level by the simultaneous activation of Democratic partisan bias, helping movement among Republicans stand out.</p>
<p>In this article, we have attempted to supplement the rich aggregate-level understanding of convention effects with an individual-level investigation grounded in what we see as the complementary instrumental and social-psychological traditions of campaign effects studies. We present evidence that conventions exert both instrumental and social forces on potential voters and that the interaction of these forces can be better understood by an analysis that takes both aggregate and individual levels into account. Our results also invoke some normative considerations regarding the relationship between information and democratic choice. The purported benefit of democratic elections is the opportunity for citizens to impact how they are governed by making informed choices. There are few better opportunities than the conventions to become informed about candidates in our system. Although the candidates’ speeches attract wide audiences, many of the most politically invested members of the electorate pass on these informational opportunities, instead opting to rely even more heavily on the social group cues that are so visible during convention periods to form their opinions.</p>

<p>Each panel consisted of a separate sample of respondents, without overlap. Respondents from the Republican Convention panel were not asked about their experiences regarding the preceding Democratic convention. Although it would be worthwhile to analyze the differences between individuals who viewed one or both conventions, the 2004 National Annenberg Election Study (NAES) did not include the questions necessary to conduct such an analysis. Analysis of how information asymmetries impact postconvention opinion is a fruitful target for future research.</p>
