<title>Objective:</title>
<p>In 2008, Queensland Health mental health services participated in a quality incentive payment scheme referred to as the Clinical Practice Improvement Payment.

<p>In January 2008, Queensland Health introduced a pilot bonus quality incentive payment scheme, referred to as the Clinical Practice Improvement Payment (CPIP), to promote and encourage service improvement by rewarding good-quality care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212460599">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212460599"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212460599"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212460599">4</xref></sup> The CPIP User Guide describes CPIP as operating as a ‘pay for reporting’ model such that incentive payments are made to clinical units on the basis of achievement of indicators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212460599">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212460599">2</xref></sup> At the commencement of the CPIP initiative, five clinical practice areas had submitted clinical indicators that were endorsed by the scheme, including stroke, emergency medicine, pharmacy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mental health. Our aim in this paper is to contribute to, and report on, the outcomes of introducing a payment for the clinical indicator, schizophrenia post discharge one to seven day follow-up, in adult mental health services (MHSs).</p>
<sec id="section5-1039856212460599">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The period immediately following discharge from an acute mental health facility has been identified as a time of increased risk for suicide, disengagement from care, medication non-compliance, relapse and rehospitalization for consumers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212460599">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856212460599"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212460599"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856212460599"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856212460599"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212460599"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856212460599"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856212460599"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212460599"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856212460599">14</xref></sup> The importance of this period for continuity of care is reflected in the inclusion of a post-discharge community care indicator as part of the National Mental Health Key Performance Indicators,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856212460599">15</xref></sup> which are routinely collected by MHSs in Australia. Recent publication of data for this indicator in The Report on Government Services 2012<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856212460599">16</xref></sup> has indicated that while national efforts to improve on this indicator have been underway since 2005 across the majority of Australian states, only modest improvement over 5 years has been achieved.</p>
<p>Since October 2005, Queensland Health adult MHSs have been involved in a clinical improvement network, the ‘Mental Health Clinical Collaborative’ (MHCC). This network was established to bring together mental health clinicians from across the state to collaboratively drive service improvement in key clinical topic areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856212460599">17</xref></sup> The MHCC comprises a clinical chair, manager and data analyst who are supported by a state-wide steering committee that is sponsored by the State’s Director of Mental Health. An important element of the approach adopted by the MHCC has been the development of clinical indicators to enable clinicians and services to monitor and review practice.</p>
<p>The treatment of schizophrenia in inpatient and community MHSs is amongst the topic areas addressed by the MHCC. Clinical indicators developed in this area include the community follow-up of consumers following discharge from acute mental health facilities. In 2006, the MHCC conducted a review of data on community follow-up following discharge from an adult acute inpatient service for people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Information obtained from a snapshot state-wide chart audit in June 2006 indicated that consumers with a diagnosis of schizophrenia could expect to wait on average 8.25 days (range: 4.67–19.24 days) before face-to-face contact with a community MHS within the district from which they were discharged. This slow time to follow-up and variation in practice was identified as a high priority area for service improvement.</p>
<p>The clinical indicator, referred to as ‘schizophrenia post discharge one to seven day follow-up’, was reviewed in a subsequent snapshot chart audit conducted in November 2006. Data from this review demonstrated a reduction in the average follow-up time to 7.32 days (range: 3.71–9.86 days) across the state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856212460599">17</xref></sup> While encouraged by this progress, MHCC member clinicians acknowledged that further improvement was necessary to demonstrate best practise. Opportunely, at this time Queensland Health commenced implementation of a clinical improvement strategy, known as the CPIP, and invited clinical networks to nominate indicators for inclusion in the scheme. The MHCC Steering Committee identified this as an opportunity to trial the incentive approach underpinning CPIP, to encourage further improvement in follow-up, proposing that payments awarded be directed to the clinical teams engaged in the follow-up. In 2008, the MHCC successfully submitted the schizophrenia one to seven day follow-up indicator for inclusion in the Queensland Health quality incentive payment program.</p>
<p>The CPIP was implemented by the branch responsible for promoting and progressing service improvement activities within Queensland Health, the Clinical Practice Improvement Centre (CPIC), and was rolled out in three phases, the first of which was a pilot project. Throughout the length of the project, $AUD 8 million was allocated annually across all clinical areas. Clinical indicators were selected through the CPIC on the basis of a number of criteria, including a high disease burden, evidence base, links to service improvement strategies that are under clinicians’ sphere of influence and the ability to be measured and monitored over time. Business Rules were distributed throughout Queensland Health for all three phases of the scheme that outlined the process for how payments were to be made to districts, how districts would be notified of payments for which they qualified, how payments could be spent and which clinical indicators were accepted in each phase of the project. The schizophrenia post discharge one to seven day follow-up indicator was selected for inclusion in each of the three phases of the project.</p>
<p>During involvement in the payment incentive scheme, MHSs across the state engaged in service improvement activities focused on improving follow-up. Over this period services attended six-monthly state-wide forums to share improvement initiatives and benchmark performance. In addition, staff from the MHCC visited services and presented service and region-specific data to senior level management meetings, committees and forums on request. In November 2010, services were informed that in Phase III of the CPIP project minimum targets for achieving payments were to be introduced for the payment period July to December 2010 and beyond. The following results document the outcomes of participation in this scheme from January 2009 to June 2011.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section7-1039856212460599">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Sixteen services, representing all MHSs with public acute adult inpatient units in Queensland, participated in the scheme. All services were active members of the MHCC since October 2005, participating in collecting and reporting on clinical indicators for review at state-wide forums to drive service improvement. All sites participated under a pseudonym. These de-identified MHCC site names have been used to report individual service data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1039856212460599">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>All MHSs taking part were informed that community follow-up occurring in the target period for eligible consumers would attract a CPIP and lump sum payments would be provided every six months for the length of the program. These payments were provided to the governing health service district with the allocation of funds within the MHS the responsibility of the MHS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212460599">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212460599">2</xref></sup> Payment tariffs were adjusted throughout the scheme to meet annual allocated funds, and ranged from $AUD125 to $AUD200 per eligible consumer. Throughout the data collection period, services were able to review their progress using a secure intranet site and were also provided with six-monthly updates at state-wide MHCC forums. In November 2010, services agreed to the establishment of targets to further drive service improvement. Consequently, discharging facilities were required to achieve a minimum follow-up percentage of 55% to receive the incentive payment.</p>
<p>It is notable that the indicator used for CPIPs differs in several ways from the indicator reported as part of the National Mental Health Key Performance Indicator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856212460599">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856212460599">16</xref></sup> To be eligible for inclusion, the consumer involved needed to be aged between 18 to 64 years, meet the criteria for the Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) schizophrenia and have been discharged from a mental health treating unit to Queensland MHSs during the reference period. When consumers were discharged to facilities outside of Queensland Health MHSs no payment could be made. All follow-up clinical contacts were required to be conducted in a face-to-face, or videoconference, modality with a community mental health professional (including allied health, nursing and medical disciplines) and restricted to those in which the consumer participated. Unlike the national indicator, follow-up contact made through other modalities (for example telephone) was excluded. The one to seven day follow-up period excluded any follow-up occurring on the day of discharge.</p>
<p>Data were collected from pre-existing Queensland Health databases in which data related to the indicator were stored in the course of usual business. Data on service provision were collected from a state-wide application known as the Consumer Integrated Mental Health Application (CIMHA). Information on consumer diagnosis and discharge dates was accessed from other existing enterprise data systems: the Queensland Health Admitted Patients Data Collection (QHAPDC) and Transition II – Clinical Benchmarking System.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1039856212460599">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data from the period January 2009 to June 2011 were extracted and analysed using Minitab and crystal reports. The proportion of consumers with the DRG schizophrenia (18–64 years) seen by a community mental health professional, via in-person or videoconference contact, within 7 days following discharge from public acute adult MHSs was calculated by dividing all separations from the mental health acute adult inpatient unit that are seen by a community mental health professional within 7 days following discharge, by the total number of completed overnight separations from the mental health acute adult inpatient unit.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All 16 MHSs participated in the CPIP scheme during the period January 2009 to June 2011. During this period, a total of 9622 discharges meeting the DRG schizophrenia occurred across the state. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1039856212460599">Figure 1</xref> shows the average state-wide results for the six-month payment periods from January 2009 to June 2011. It demonstrates an upward trend across the state in the average percentage of eligible consumers being followed up within the target one to seven day period. In particular, the second half of 2010 shows the state-wide average at the target 55% and then exceeding this target (62%) in 2011.</p>

</fig>
<p>To further investigate this trend, statistical process control (SPC), a methodology demonstrated to be an effective means of analysing data about healthcare processes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856212460599">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856212460599"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856212460599"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856212460599"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856212460599"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856212460599">23</xref></sup> has been applied. This process enables the identification of variation, and Matthes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856212460599">18</xref></sup> contend that SPC has advantages over traditional statistical methods of analysis because it is able to project future performance ranges, based on past performance, and provide a visual display that is easily interpreted by clinicians. SPC enables the identification of common cause variation, a consistent pattern of variation common to the whole process, or special cause variation, which looks at variation considered outside the normal process.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1039856212460599">Figure 2</xref> provides the SPC graph for state-wide results across the January 2009 to June 2011 period for all 16 MHSs. The figure demonstrates an upward trend across the period. During the May 2010 to June 2011 period, there is a run of 16 data points above the centre line. This represents a period of special cause variation and indicates a change in the direction of improved performance across the state. Also notable is the period between December 2010 and February 2011. This period shows a dip in performance during the month of December 2010, which is expected, as the state of Queensland was affected by natural disasters, and also demonstrates recovery to higher than expected levels for the period of January to February 2011.</p>

This graph demonstrates improvement at individual services across similar time periods. We note that due to the inability of services to track and follow up consumers referred outside of Queensland Health MHS, no services were expected to achieve 100% follow-up. Within this limitation, the follow-up achieved across services for the July to December 2010 period averaged 55%, with a range of 44–78%, and for the January to June 2011 period the state averaged 62%, with a range of 43–74%. In total only 4 out of 16 services reached the minimum target of 55% in the 2010 period, which improved to 10 out of 16 sites in the 2011 period. The median days between discharge and follow-up in July to December 2010 was five days, with a range of three to eight days, and the January to June 2011 period median was also five days, with a smaller range of two to seven days.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Queensland adult MHSs have been engaged in service improvement activities aimed at improving the proportion of consumers, with the DRG schizophrenia, followed up in the community within seven days of discharge from an adult acute mental health unit. Incentive payments for achieving follow-up within the target period have been available to services as a means of encouraging improvement. Over a two and a half year period, services across the state have attracted more than one million Australian dollars in payments for meeting this indicator. National data on community follow-up within seven days of discharge from hospital provides a nationwide picture of modest gains over a 5-year period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856212460599">16</xref></sup> While the MHCC indicator represents only a subset of the national indicator for a specific diagnostic group, the improvements evident for the MHCC indicator appear to be greater over a smaller time period, with an increase in six-month state-wide averages from 39% to 62% in two and a half years. This improvement picture provides some support to the application of incentive payments in shifting state-wide performance in mental health clinical practice.</p>
<p>It is important to note that direct comparison of the MHCC indicator to the national indicator is not possible, as the indicators are defined differently. The MHCC indicator was developed by clinicians to promote ‘best practice’ and consequently permits only face-to-face contact with consumer participation and is confined to the high-risk DRG schizophrenia for an adult-only population (18–65 years). Moreover, even direct comparison across jurisdictions in the national dataset is not possible due to definitional differences and challenges across states in obtaining data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856212460599">16</xref></sup> While it might be argued that limiting the target group to the DRG schizophrenia reduces the number of consumers requiring follow-up, it is worth pointing out that this DRG represents approximately 50% of consumers receiving adult acute mental health inpatient services in Queensland.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856212460599">17</xref></sup> This, in addition to the application of stricter requirements for the indicator, in particular the exclusion of telephone contact as a follow-up modality, makes the achievement of state-wide improvement over this relatively short time frame worth mentioning.</p>
<p>In terms of the trajectory of improvement noted in the results, more notable gains appear to have occurred in the latter part of 2010. The timing of this shift coincides with two events. The first being the establishment of a minimum target for services to achieve before securing a CPIP and the second being the occurrence of significant state-wide natural disasters that devastated the state and increased pressure on services and community resources. As expected, a slight dip in performance is apparent and likely reflects the displacement of staff and consumers during the disaster period. Remarkably, an immediate recovery followed by ongoing improvement is then evident and provides further credibility to the view that incentive payments can support ongoing sustainable state-wide change that is robust to external pressures. The impact of introducing minimum achievement targets, combined with incentive payments, may provide additional motivation for further improvement. However, it is apparent from the snapshot picture of individual service performance that while all services demonstrate improvement, not all services show the same degree of improvement.</p>
<p>While improvement in this clinical area has occurred across the state and appears to be stable and sustained, despite significant external challenges, it is unlikely that incentive payments alone, with or without targets, are totally responsible. A multitude of political, clinical and contextual factors are likely to have had exerted complex influences on service improvement; some of these are identifiable and others remain implicit. For example, it is difficult to separate the influence of the state-wide service improvement methodology implemented through the MHCC on these results. This process has been demonstrated to provide a vehicle conducive to practice change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856212460599">17</xref></sup> In particular, during the 2010–2011 period MHCC staff increased service visits and commenced providing regular data updates for review by local mental health clinical networks. These processes are likely to have driven service improvements at the local level by making services more aware of the practice and increasing motivation to match or exceed performance of their peers. Other factors likely to have attenuated the degree of change, by lessening the impact of the incentive payment, include the way the CPIP scheme was administered. These included challenges such as significant delays (six months) in services receiving funds, handling fees of 10–20% from district/hospital finance areas, restrictions on what teams could spend the money on and, at times, challenges in identifying where the funds had been directed.</p>
<p>These factors notwithstanding, the results presented across this relatively short timeframe suggest that the implementation of incentive payments, in the framework of a state-wide service improvement methodology, can support state-wide service improvement in a mental health context. Moreover, it would seem reasonable to suggest that the introduction of additional measures, such as minimum target setting, may further encourage improvement efforts. While the improvements obtained appeared to demonstrate some robustness to external challenges, the long-term sustainability of the improvement remains to be tested and further study following removal of the payments may provide the answer. Despite this, the results presented across this relatively short time frame are encouraging.</p>
