<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Therapies using renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or both, are generally selected for the purpose of renoprotection in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The renoprotective effect of these drugs is closely related to their antiproteinuric effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320311412811">1</xref></sup> However, more intensive treatment is required for CKD patients with a relatively high level of proteinuria to achieve a clinical remission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320311412811">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320311412811">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recent clinical and experimental studies have proposed a novel mechanism of renal injury by aldosterone, and aldosterone secretion is, at least in part, independent of angiotensin II.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311412811">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320311412811">5</xref></sup> In addition, spironolactone, a classical aldosterone blocker, has antiproteinuric effects in non-diabetic CKD patients undergoing therapy with the RAS inhibitors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320311412811">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470320311412811">10</xref></sup> However, there is insufficient evidence of the effects of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, in these patients. The present study investigated the effects of eplerenone in non-diabetic CKD patients who showed persistent proteinuria even when treated with RAS inhibitors.</p>

<title>Patient selection</title>
<p>This retrospective study included patients who were treated in the outpatient clinic at the Jikei Daisan Hospital, Tokyo, between October 2008 and January 2009, and fulfilled the following criteria: urinary protein excretion (UPE) of 1.0 g/gCr or more within 6 months before starting eplerenone therapy and with UPE of 0.5 g/gCr or more at baseline, in spite of treatment with either ACE inhibitor or ARB or both over 6 months. Patients with diabetes, nephrotic syndrome, creatinine clearance (Ccr) of less than 50 ml/min or serum potassium of 5.0 mEq/l or more, and those who were treated with corticosteroid or immunosuppressants, were excluded.</p>
<p>A total of 24 patients were eligible for this study. Three patients dropped out during the follow-up and thus were excluded from the analysis. The reasons for dropping out were a change from eplerenone to another antihypertensive medication due to insufficient blood-pressure control, an increase of leukocytes after eplerenone use and self-interruption. Finally, the data from 21 patients for 12 months were analysed. Of these 21 patients, eight used Ca-channel blockers and five used hydrochlorothiazide (combination of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide) at baseline. As for RAS inhibitors, 11 patients were treated with both ACE inhibitor and ARB, while 10 patients were treated with either ACE inhibitor or ARB. Seven patients used statins, but none used erythropoiesis-stimulating agents or vitamin D. The medications could be changed at the discretion of the doctor in charge. However, there were only minor changes in medication during the study period. Informed consent was obtained from all patients before administration of eplerenone was started.</p>

<title>The clinical characteristics at baseline and the effects of eplerenone on clinical variables</title>
<p>The baseline characteristics of the patients are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470320311412811">Table 1</xref>. The histological diagnoses of renal biopsies in these patients were: IgA nephropathy 10, focal segmental glomerular sclerosis 5, benign nephrosclerosis 4, unknown 2 (biopsy not performed). The effects of eplerenone on clinical variables, including the mean arterial pressure (MAP), UPE, eGFR and serum potassium level, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470320311412811">Figure 1</xref>. MAP decreased at 4 and 6 months after starting eplerenone. However, the value of MAP at 12 months showed no statistical difference in comparison with the baseline value. The average UPE at baseline was 1.2 g/gCr, decreasing to 0.8 g/gCr at 2 months (−35%), 0.7 g/gCr at 4 months (−40%), 0.6 g/gCr at 6 months (−52%) and 0.8 g/gCr at 12 months (−38%). The levels of eGFR decreased at 4 and 6 months after starting eplerenone. However, the value of eGFR at 12 months showed no significant difference in comparison with the baseline value. The average serum potassium at baseline was 4.3 mEq/l, increasing to 4.5 mEq/l at 2 months, 4.6 mEq/l at 4 months, 4.5 mEq/l at 6 months and 4.6 mEq/l at 12 months.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigated the effectiveness and safety of the selective aldosterone blocker eplerenone in non-diabetic CKD patients. The UPE was reduced by 38% at 12 months in comparison with that at baseline. This reduction in the UPE was compatible with that shown in previous studies using spironolactone in similar subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320311412811">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470320311412811">10</xref></sup> The finding that the addition of eplerenone to RAS inhibitors was effective in the reduction of proteinuria in these patients is interesting, especially considering that a relatively low dosage (25–50 mg/day) was administered. In addition, the low dosage of eplerenone therapy was tolerated and seemed to be safe. Only a slight increase in the serum potassium level was found, and no patient dropped out because of uncontrolled hyperkalaemia. These results are consistent with previous studies showing a low incidence of hyperkalaemia in patients with renal diseases treated with aldosterone blockers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311412811">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320311412811">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470320311412811">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320311412811">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The antiproteinuric effect of eplerenone was likely to be independent of blood pressure control. A modest decrease in blood pressure was observed after the start of eplerenone therapy. However, this decrease in blood pressure was not statistically significant after 12 months of therapy, whereas the reduction in UPE was found still to be significant. In addition, ΔUPE was independent of ΔMAP. These results are consistent with previous studies showing a blood pressure-independent antiproteinuric effect of aldosterone blockers in patients with renal diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311412811">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320311412811">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470320311412811">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320311412811">12</xref></sup> The current study showed that ΔUPE was correlated with eGFR at baseline. In other words, the reduction of proteinuria was more noticeable in patients with modestly impaired renal function than in those with preserved renal function at baseline. The mechanism underlying this finding is largely unknown. A recent study using an animal model of metabolic syndrome-induced renal injury showed increased expression of mineralcorticoid receptor (MR) in glomerular podocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320311412811">5</xref></sup> A similar increase of MR in glomerular podocytes may underlie such a condition of compensatory hypertrophic glomerular injuries in the setting of modestly impaired renal function. It is not certain at present whether ‘aldosterone escape’ may be responsible for the different antiproteinuric effects of eplerenone between individuals, because we did not measure the plasma aldosterone concentration before treatment. Further studies are therefore required to resolve these issues regarding the antiproteinuric effect of the aldosterone blockers, including eplerenone. The EVALUATE study, a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial evaluating the antialbuminuric effect of a low dose of eplerenone, is ongoing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470320311412811">13</xref></sup></p>
