<p><italic>Building Globalization</italic> is one of the first books to examine directly the political economy of architectural production in a globalizing world. It joins a small but growing cadre of scholarship focused on the proliferation of architecturally innovative urban mega-projects in cities around the globe. Taking as its starting point the main producers of the urban built environment, both architects and those government officials who contract them, Xuefei Ren argues that decisions about what to build are made with an eye to the symbolic capital such projects provide in an increasingly competitive global economy where urban investments in towering office and residential projects will signify a city’s worthiness as a site of global capitalist development. The logic shared by architects and officials alike is that “starchitecture” will draw foreign investors to a city, thus further fueling the cycle of local economic development, which produces resources that can in turn be invested in the building of global cities. In theoretical and analytical terms, this book argues that iconic architecture drives urban economic growth and thus a country’s position within the global economy. Building her argument around the case of China, Ren skillfully demonstrates that local authorities, enabled by the rescaling of state power, take advantage of the larger global dynamics of capitalism, particularly as they relate to architectural firm organization, and produce cityscapes that might be conceived of as “urban development on steroids.” That the book focuses on China, arguably the quintessential site for the emergence of such landscapes, contributes to its importance and originality.</p>
<p><italic>Building Globalization</italic> has many things to commend in substantive, methodological, and theoretical terms. Of particular significance is the focus on the global logic of architectural firm organization and reach. Drawing on an impressive array of quantitative data on which architectural firms of what size and design ethos (i.e., a “boutique” as opposed to corporate character) are working where, this book offers insights into how the intensified global competition for building contracts and the hegemony of large corporate firms helps homogenize and heterogenize the built environment of global cities. Homogenization in design aesthetics happens when building prototypes and construction processes increasingly converge around a more narrowed set of materials and ideas derived from a few leading global architectural firms that ultimately come to dominate cityscapes worldwide. Heterogeneity in built form results from the imposition of a narrower yet more globally legible architectural aesthetic across a wide array of national settings, thus producing hybrid cityscapes displaying both old and new architectures. The latter is particularly likely in late industrializing countries, like China, where rapidly accelerating or upscale urban developments were off the agenda until recently, meaning many traditional building forms and urban uses still exist. The development of hybrid cityscapes resulting from the mix of old and new is interesting not just in visual terms, but also because it produces conflict. The latter is seen in the form of accelerated competition between local and global architects (or even among global architecture firms) to dominate new cities and grab new contracts around the world, in the form of controversy between historic preservationists and the state, or between the state and those citizens whose neighborhoods and traditional forms of life are under threat by new urban development projects and the land use transformations they require. Many of these issues are expertly addressed in the chapter on the controversy surrounding the Bird’s Nest stadium and other buildings commissioned for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.</p>
<p>This book’s mixed methodology serves it well, offering the opportunity for Ren to provide several insightful observations about the transnational character of architectural production, drawn primarily from the qualitative and quantitative data on firm location. One perhaps surprising conclusion is that some of the most innovative “boutique” firms prefer to locate their headquarters in relatively unexciting or non-global cities (as with Rem Koolhaas’s office in Rotterdam), because of the problems of distraction. Another is that having a strong but oversaturated real estate market at home can drive a leading architectural firm abroad (as with the growing number of Tokyo-based firms that now work internationally). Finally, that there seems to be little national, regional, or city correlation between the location-based production and consumption of building designs that are generated by boutique architectural firms: the top 20 cities hosting suppliers of boutique firms did not correspond to the top cities where their works are sited. Further, there seems to be a developmental bias at play here: there are almost no cities of the Global South on either the production or consumption lists for the boutique firms that are central to the global spread of iconic architecture.</p>
<p>In its focus on the ways that Chinese officials use iconic architectural projects to draw international firms and investors directly into their cities, the larger framing ethos of this book echoes much of the important work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306112457769">Saskia Sassen (1991)</xref> on the shift from industry to services as the basis for global economic competitiveness of cities and nations around the world. Still, one cannot but wonder what happened to the fundamental industrial and manufacturing activities that continue to thrive and serve as the basis for China’s current status as a global economic power house. Indeed, China has resources to build large megaprojects and iconic buildings precisely because of its strong manufacturing base. Thus the question emerges as to the impact of China’s overall economic development trajectories on the rise and pervasiveness of iconic architecture. If there is an absence in the book, it is its failure to fully address the national developmental context of China. By focusing on four key transnational trends ranging from the integration of the global economy and the liberalization of trade services, to the development of telecommunications, to the ascending importance of the global economy in postindustrial cities, and the rescaling of state power at the metropolitan level—the impact of national conditions is given short shrift.</p>
<p>To be sure, the main emphasis of the book is transnational architectural production, not the national context of urban policy. But given the book’s singular focus on China, one wonders to what degree domestic factors also influenced the adoption of these building projects and styles, whether in terms of available domestic resources or with respect to the peculiarities of metropolitan/local administration in Chinese cities that make “state rescaling” in China different than in most other countries. It also should not be forgotten that China’s non-democratic political system makes land expropriation relatively easy, in no small part because people can be forcibly displaced from properties that are selected as new building sites, thus paving the way for large mega-project development. The failure to more deeply address these domestic political and economic conditions does not take away from the overall contributions of the book, however, because there is so much original material and innovative reflection contained in the focus on transnational architectural production and its consumption in China. In this regard, <italic>Building Globalization</italic> is an important book sure to generate new debates in the fields of urban sociology, cultural sociology, and the sociology of organizations and work, by highlighting their intersections with each other and the field of global political economy.</p>
<p>Given the latter framing, it is also fitting that the book ends with a call to activism (of sorts). Ren provocatively devotes a short but stimulating final section, posing the question of what it might take to enable local architectural responses that both critique modernist architectural ideals and challenge the injustices associated with China’s destructive and seemingly untrammeled overbuilding. While the answers to this important question may remain relatively elusive, perhaps even to those Chinese architects who are on record seeking a more vernacular aesthetic, what is clear from this book are the power structures that any reformer would face if that were their aim: an array of internationally networked, transnational architectural firms working in alliance with local bureaucrats whose main objectives are the attainment of material and symbolic resources through the development of iconic cityscapes. In documenting the complexities of this process, Ren’s book is a necessary companion to anyone who seeks to build an alternative urbanism in a world where transnational architectural production increasingly empowers and is empowered by economic globalization.</p>
