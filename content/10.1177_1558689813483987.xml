<p>The field of mixed methods (MM) research facilitates “coming at things differently.” Traditional forms of data gathering using one method for data collection may not be adequate for answering complex questions that sometimes require a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods in one study. Although the number of MM studies continues to grow, it is clear from the literature that newcomers and seasoned MM researchers encounter praxis/practice barriers that concern the “how-tos” of integrating MM findings. More philosophical concerns center on issues regarding whether or not paradigmatic stances can be mixed or can coexist. Still other concerns center on research conundrums that reside within and between our disciplinary contexts, such as the impact of and interfacing with newly emergent technologies for data analysis and collection with MM research. Some of these barriers are conscious whereas others are unconscious.</p>
<sec id="section1-1558689813483987">
<title>The Mixed Methods Community Is Multiple and Mixed</title>
<p>We think it is important to <italic>expand the conversation</italic> about what MM is in order to grow, challenge and dialogue among the diverse approaches that are reflected in the MM research community. MM is traditionally defined as requiring (necessarily) the use of both qualitative and quantitative methods or data.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1558689813483987">1</xref></sup> The “traditional” definition, however, if taken in a rigid and reductionist manner, may serve to exclude some important researchers and practitioners. We envision, therefore, an MM research and inquiry that includes “multiple and mixed” research projects that facilitate and reside at the intersections of multiple methods, purposes, kinds of data, and levels of analysis (e.g., micro, meso, macro), as well as a range of academic disciplines, paradigms, axiologies, stakeholders, and cultures of research and practice. Having said this, it is critical not to lose sight of the importance of <italic>centering the research question</italic> and constructing the appropriate design for the specific research question in a particular research context. Given the complexity of research problems that traverse any one disciplinary point of view, we argue for reaching out across our disciplinary divides to explore the deployment, when needed, of a <italic>plurality</italic> of <italic>methodological approaches and philosophical perspectives</italic> and methods techniques that are both multiple and mixed. We acknowledge that in pursuing these pluralities, researchers may not only gain greater insights but also experience challenges as well as setbacks. Most important, we acknowledge <italic>that there is no one methodological or methods bandwagon</italic> that will fit all the research problems and prospects as the MMR community moves forward.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of the exciting heterogeneity and at times contentious issues we see in the field of MM. Some researchers/practitioners emphasize that MM is about data (qualitative and quantitative). Some envision themselves as methodologists, emphasizing the construction and/or selection of the best systematic research design for each research study. Some identify themselves as empirical scientists, attempting to apply different methods tools, without focusing on a paradigmatic stance. Other researchers/practitioners emphasize philosophy and the continued importance of paradigms (e.g., constructivism, pragmatism, realism, postpositivism, dialectical pluralism, and transformative). Others contend that MM is a political movement (not just a broadening of the scientific enterprise) by focusing their efforts toward social justice initiatives that hold promise of reducing various inequities with regard to power and wealth and respect, and others examine the intersections and interconnections among gender, class, ethnicity, sexual orientation, “disabilities,” and other inequities. Still others emphasize the many new and exciting qualitative and quantitative approaches that interface with MM. Some MM researchers/practitioners/stakeholders argue that different ontologies/epistemologies should <italic>interact</italic> (e.g., in equal-status or interactive designs); others prefer quantitatively driven MM approaches; and others are increasingly emphasizing the importance of qualitatively driven MM. It is important to strive to welcome and dialogue with these differing initiatives within MM in the <italic>Journal of Mixed Methods Research</italic> (<italic>JMMR</italic>).</p>
<p>We view thoughtful theoretical and praxis/practice diversity and turbulence within the MM community as a positive and <italic>necessary moment</italic> within the historical context of mixed and multiple methods research. Such turbulence provides the space for innovation and productive dialogue across our methods and paradigmatic standpoints. It is in the gaps between points of view where we may go after new knowledge(s) and newly emergent practices and designs. Such a turbulent environment asks each of us to be reflexive on our own researcher standpoint and be open to dialogue across our paradigmatic and methods comfort zones. Making MM a space for such dialogue and collaboration will encourage and perhaps foster engagement with emergent methods, philosophies, technologies, disciplines, perspectives, and ways of practice to facilitate the answering of the complex interdisciplinary research questions we face today and as we move forward. Complex questions may require multiple mixed methodologies and methods approaches, and much more.</p>

<sec id="section2-1558689813483987">
<title>The Mixed Methods “Skills Gap” and Its Impact on Teaching the Next Generation of Researchers</title>
<p>Many first-generation MM researchers were initially trained in the use of one primary method. Using an innovative method often required them to reach out across their own “<italic>methods comfort zone</italic>;” to think outside their normal everyday methods routine. These early practitioners of MM were often self-taught and are referred to as “first-generation faculty” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1558689813483987">Creswell, Tashakkori, Jensen, &amp; Shapley, 2003</xref>, p. 620). At the same time, there is a lack of pedagogical literature on the challenges of teaching students MM and a paucity of MM course offerings, coupled with a growing demand often fueled by some academic program requirements that now require students to take a MM course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1558689813483987">Frels, Onwuegbuzie, Leech, &amp; Collins, 2012</xref>). There remain many pedagogical issues surrounding teaching students two different methods, methodologies, and worldviews—qualitative and quantitative—and how to combine them in a research process and in a research study.</p>
<p>The teaching of MM may upend a student’s philosophical, methodological standpoint (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1558689813483987">Hesse-Biber, 2010</xref>). A qualitative researcher, whose research goal is to get at lived experience and is comfortable with an “interpretative” methodology that assumes there are “multiple realities,” might decide to deploy an MM design by following up a qualitative in-depth interview component with a survey, with the goal of generalizing his or her qualitative findings. Moving from understanding to generalization of findings will also require a shift in philosophical approach toward a postpositivist stance that holds the assumption that there is a “reality” out there waiting to be discovered. This type of MM praxis/practice, then, may create a type of philosophical dissonance on the part of this researcher. Practicing MM can mean deploying multiple theoretical perspectives linked to the use of qualitative and quantitative methods. Can a researcher trained in qualitative methods with interpretative philosophy practice postpositivism? Can a postpositivist practice an interpretive method? Or is a dialectical/dialogical team required?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1558689813483987">
<title>Moving the Field Toward Team-Based/Interdisciplinary Mixed Methods Praxis/Practice</title>
<p>Increasingly “team” projects involving researchers from different disciplines may become more prevalent. The importance of looking beyond our disciplinary boundaries, a process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1558689813483987">Laurel Richardson (2006)</xref> terms “de-disciplining,” holds the promise of envisioning alternative ways of asking questions as well as imagining new ways to structure our research in order to get at complex ideas. We see MM as working well in teams constructed to include mixed/multiple perspectives, values, knowledge, and skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1558689813483987">Johnson, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1558689813483987">Johnson &amp; Stefurak, in press</xref>).</p>
<p>The field of MM can learn much from scholars who have worked at the borders of multiple disciplines and have sought to create dynamic integrations of ideas from different disciplines. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1558689813483987">Klein’s (1990)</xref> research into personality attributes associated with interdisciplinarians notes that they excel on “reliability, flexibility, patience, resilience, sensitivity to others, risk-taking, and have a thick skin, and a preference for diversity and new social roles” (p. 182). Klein suggests that as the gap between disciplines and their number increases, on say, a given research team, so does the overall communication gap (p. 183). To practice interdisciplinary research requires good communication skills and good teamwork among MM researchers from different disciplines and, in the classroom setting, among faculty and their students.</p>

<sec id="section4-1558689813483987">
<title>Academic Departmental Methods Traditions</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1558689813483987">Jennifer Platt’s (1996)</xref> research into the history of sociological methods from 1920 to 1960 provides important insights that can be generalized to the MM research community. She notes that when one examines the history of discipline-specific methods in the United States, <italic>the practice of methods</italic> is strongly influenced by departmental culture. These departmental cultural pressures extend to the types of departmental methods course offerings, and how any given department allocates methods resources for training the next generation of researchers. In addition, certain research practices may come to dominate publications and teaching of methods at the departmental level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1558689813483987">Platt, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Academic methods traditions, then, can pose barriers for the acceptance of MM into certain departments and within any given department’s course offerings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1558689813483987">Green and Preston (2005)</xref> see this as a process of moving departments toward “specialisms” whereby “university faculties and departments are . . . ‘oriented’ towards a particular qualitative or quantitative research specialism (or groups of specialisms)” (p. 168). This is, for example, how qualitative methods, in particular, urban ethnography, came to define and form “The Chicago School of Sociology” in the 1920s, even though some of the founders of the Chicago School of Sociology, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1558689813483987">Robert Park, Ernest Burgess, and Roderick McKenzie (1925)</xref>, were prominent users of quantitative methods as well as mixed and multiple methods approaches applied to the study of inner-city urban life (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1558689813483987">Bulmer, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1558689813483987">Hesse-Biber, 2010</xref>). Pressures toward specialism can also extend to those publishers of social research and to social policy makers who may be wedded to one frame of methods reporting—qualitative or quantitative but not both.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1558689813483987">
<title>The Move Toward Mixed Methods Guidelines and the Impact of Funding Agencies</title>
<p>The pressure to specialize in one method or methodology can also come from funding agencies. Some funding agencies may only support or strongly urge the researcher to use a particular research method and/or methodological perspective (e.g., postpositivism). Such a move may compel some researchers to go with the funders’ preferences. The sociologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689813483987">Alvin Gouldner (1971)</xref> worried that a “utilitarian culture” had grown up around the practice of social research that “tends towards a theoryless empiricism in which the conceptualization of problems is secondary and energies are instead given over to questions of measurement, research or experimental design, sampling or instrumentation” (p. 82). Other researchers feel that this explanation is too specific in that it places the onus of blame or credit onto funding agencies while ignoring other factors such as departmental culture in understanding the denial of funds to MM projects (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1558689813483987">Platt, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Although it is important to legitimate MM in the eyes of funders, a movement for any single set of standards can have the unintended consequences of narrowing and concretizing MM research practice and limiting the innovation of methods, practices, and theories during the exploration of complex issues using a MM approach. As members of the MM community work with government funding agencies in their countries, we hope they/we will emphasize that no one (“single,”“ultimate,”“correct,”“final,”“static”) set of standards will ever fit all MM research questions, topics, nations, disciplines, and contexts. We emphasize that there are multiple MM paradigms and approaches now, and there are many more to come in our future.</p>

<sec id="section6-1558689813483987">
<title>Some “Gaps” and Opportunities</title>
<p>As editors of the forthcoming <italic>The Oxford Handbook of Multiple and Mixed Methods Research</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1558689813483987">Hesse-Biber &amp; Johnson, in press</xref>), one of our <italic>Handbook</italic> goals has been to uncover important “gaps” with regard to topical areas and issues that were missing from the current literature on MM. We identified some topics and areas within the MMR field that we feel are timely and important to address.</p>
<p>First, we were surprised that <italic>JMMR</italic> has not yet published an article centered on ethical issues in conducting MM research. Ethical issues reside across the research process. It is crucial for MM researchers to continually reflect on their ethical standpoints throughout their research project, as they may encounter thorny ethical issues after an MM project is in progress. For example, an MM research deploying a sequential design that first collects self-report (quantitative) data using a structured questionnaire and then seeks to obtain in-depth interviews from a subsample of their participants may violate ethics policies with regard to confidentiality. This specific instance occurs if the researcher neglects to obtain participants’ permission at the outset to be identified and sampled for a second qualitative component. Ethical issues can arise when an MM researcher indirectly links data in the public domain collected from social networking sites to locate a target sample for further study. With the advent of Internet technologies, additional ethics issues arise and can become thorny. An example might be taking personal online data from the public domain when users who generate these data are not aware that you are using information from their personal networking site for your MM research project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1558689813483987">Acquisti &amp; Gross, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, we would like to see MM authors team with researchers from “different but similar” areas. For example, MM has much in common with multimethod research, methodological pluralism, and action research (including participatory and critical action research). Also, MM researchers interested in social justice issues and promoting social change have much in common with qualitative and quantitative researchers focusing on this kind of research practice.</p>
<p>Third, we would like to see more MM authors retool methods and traditions that are historically located in either qualitative or quantitative research and bring them into MM, transforming them along the way into MM methods and traditions. One example is in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1558689813483987">Johnson (2010)</xref>, where he constructed a grounded theory (GT) method labeled MM-GT. This mixed method was not to replace other GT methods but rather to add to the researcher’s toolbox an MM-GT method for others to use and extend. From the quantitative side, some possibilities are hierarchical linear modeling, cluster methods, and person-oriented methods that do not just look at group aggregates and that explore and explain processes and context rather than only testing hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689813483987">Jason &amp; Glenwick, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Fourth, there are many very important and exciting qualitative traditions that will fit very well with qualitatively driven and interactive (equal-status) MM research approaches. For example, much more work is needed in the MM community in the areas of indigenous methods, intersectionality, and conflict/critical theory research.</p>
<p>Fifth, emergent technological developments arising from digital platforms such as Web 2.0 and mobile devices and their applications promise to change the landscape for research theory and praxis/practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1558689813483987">Hackett, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1558689813483987">Hesse-Biber, 2011</xref>). These technologies are pushing the current praxis of mixed methods research, rendering obsolete, perhaps, some of our current thinking about mixing methods praxis—such as how MM researchers collect data that blur the boundaries of time (synchronous/asynchronous) and space (blurring the line between reality and virtual and augmented realities). Ethical boundaries as well will become blurred, as the line between private and public information becomes fluid, especially when sometimes highly personal information can be obtained publically from social networking sites such as Facebook. What ethics rules apply with regard to informed consent as research moves online? How will the meaning of informed consent change as new forms of online interaction arise? What does confidentiality mean in a cyber environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1558689813483987">Gunkel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1558689813483987">Hesse-Biber &amp; Griffin, 2013</xref>)?</p>
<p>The exponential growth of “big data,” arising from newly emergent user-generated and streaming digital data from networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook, will place pressures on MM researchers to transform traditional modes of collecting and analyzing data generated from these sites. Big data “is [sic] too big, moves too fast, or doesn’t fit the strictures of your database architectures. To gain value from this [sic] data, you must choose an alternative way to process it [sic]” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1558689813483987">Dumbill, 2013</xref>, p. 1).</p>
<p>How will MM researchers incorporate big data and “big analytics” (i.e., large-scale algorithms developed to understand the meanings contained within individual social networking outputs)? In the coming years, big data methods and analytics may also drive and challenge MM researchers to rethink and innovate and produce new paradigmatic perspectives and research designs and structures. In turn, MM perspectives and praxis can provide models for interpreting and deriving critical insights that that may give a more complex understanding of big data that can bring a set of new questions and understanding to the trending data currently extracted from user-generated social networking sites.</p>
<p>Sixth, we would like to encourage dialogue across international, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary research sites whereby MM researchers can share their data, knowledge, and learning—a MM research “global village,” if you will (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1558689813483987">Hesse-Biber, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1558689813483987">McCluhan, 1994</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1558689813483987">
<title>Continuing the Dialogue: Future Challenges and Opportunities</title>
<p>We leave you with a set of challenges and opportunities that are ripe for creating circles of conversations that encourage dialogue among the diversity of members of the MM community. To dialogue does not mean to have the goal of “winning” over those with whom we disagree. It is about listening deeply across our differences—paradigmatic differences, praxis differences, and so on. These are exciting areas for new, collaborative research. It is within the process of dialogue that holds enormous potential to unlock synergy that will continue to sustain MM research as a whole. We list seven “conundrum clusters” that the MM community can benefit by addressing as we move forward.</p>
<list id="list1-1558689813483987" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>What kind of knowledge(s) does MM produce? What is the role of theory in MM research? Is the MMR movement about methods or something more? What interests can or could be served by such an approach? How can MMR harness synergy toward the goal of enhancing credibility of evidence?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What do you view as the (a) the shared and distinctive character of mixed and multiple methods approaches to social inquiry and (b) the options and the pros and cons, of mixing/making multiple at the level of method, methodology, and assumptive worldview/paradigm?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What do we mean by <italic>integration</italic> of difference in MM, and where and how is it done?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>There is a movement toward best practices in MM research today. Is it premature to institutionalize a set of guidelines or new “gold standard” or set of “best practices” for what is “good” MMR? How can MM approach the issue of standards while still remaining creative and adaptive to each research context?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Two of the primary differences between qualitative and quantitative research have been about how one should frame causation and generalizability. How can MMR contribute to this conversation? Specifically, how can MMR bridge qualitative and quantitative understandings of these concepts and improve research?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How can we harness MMR for social justice and social transformation in the short run and in the long run?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How can we encourage and promote viable mixed methods “team based” research approaches that incorporate multi-level (micro, meso and macro) layers of inquiry? Such a mixed methods, multi-level research design holds promise of providing a fuller contextual understanding of complex issues (see: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689813483987">Börner, et. al’s., 2010</xref> work on team-based science).</p>
