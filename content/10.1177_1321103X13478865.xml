<abstract>
<p>In this study I explored, with Chelsea, her journey of becoming a music teacher. At the time of the study, Chelsea had completed her second year of teaching. Together, we revisited the artifacts of her undergraduate coursework and practicum experiences (journals, online forum posts, videotapes of her own teaching, written reflections of her teaching). We engaged in a narrative exploration of her journey of becoming a teacher as Chelsea provided written and verbal narratives of “then and now”— a process of ethnographic hindsight in which Chelsea was able to provide both emic and etic lenses of the experiences revisited via the data. A thread of connection and detachment is pervasive throughout the data and the interpretation of themes as Chelsea’s path toward becoming a teacher is positioned in the juxtaposition of these stances.</p>

<p>What we understand to be “reality” is interpreted or reflected-on experience … Only as we begin moving into the life of language, thematizing, symbolizing, making sense, do we begin to single out certain profiles, certain aspects of the flux of things to attend to and to name. Once we begin doing that, we begin orienting ourselves to what we think of as the “real”. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1321103X13478865">Greene, 1978</xref>, p. 24)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Chelsea is a music teacher. As she was a former student in our music education program, I followed her progress from pre-service through her second year of teaching. As a novice teacher, Chelsea was exemplary among her peers in lesson plan design and in her ability to articulate her strengths and shortcomings. As a teacher-educator, I know that working with weaker students tends to produce points of tension in my own practice and, as a result, I often find myself giving them more attention and support. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1321103X13478865">Britzman (1994)</xref>, too, explored the experiences of student teachers. She states that in her study, “my focus is what happens to a student teacher when practice does not lead to competence” (p. 55). Like Britzman, I learned of the vulnerabilities that student teachers face as they cautiously negotiate the space between themselves as learner and teacher.</p>
<p>Through this study, I sought to understand how the pre-service experiences of one <italic>successful</italic> student teacher might inform my capacity to better support all our students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1321103X13478865">Wolcott (1998)</xref> describes a key informant as “an individual with whom one spends a disproportionate amount of research time because that individual appears to be particularly well-informed, articulate, [or] approachable” (p. 338). Chelsea’s mature self-awareness and willingness to self-disclose enabled her to effectively fulfill that role. Thus, this inquiry served to scaffold my own understanding of a young teacher’s learning process and the issues that other novice teachers may face.</p>
<p>A key element in Chelsea’s early success was that she valued and actively engaged in reflective practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1321103X13478865">Burnard &amp; Hennessy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1321103X13478865">Clark, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1321103X13478865">Schön, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1321103X13478865">1987</xref>) throughout her education and teaching experiences. As a pre-service teacher Chelsea sought to develop her unseasoned teacher presence; even then she seemed woefully aware of its absence. Though outwardly engaged in the classroom, Chelsea revealed—in hindsight—that inwardly she lacked confidence. She remembered feeling uncomfortable in her own body, not knowing what to do with her hands or worried about every word she spoke. She confessed to having felt overly self-conscious when teaching and worked to hide her insecurities.</p>
<p>Chelsea noted that she frequently used the term “real teacher” when she would talk with her peers. She anticipated that she would someday become a real teacher as though this day would arrive as easily as turning the page on the calendar. While later engaged in this study, Chelsea shared that, as a pre-service teacher:<disp-quote>
<p>I made a very big deal about some hypothetical “big moment” in which I would transform into the “real teacher” I idealized. What I have learned since then is that polished “teacherlyness” isn’t something bestowed upon a person after completing a student teaching milestone. It is something honed and developed over many years of reflective practice. (Written reflection, August 6, 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For the purposes of this study, I invited Chelsea to partner with me to revisit her archive of pre-service journals and teaching videos and reconsider her narrative as a fledgling music teacher.</p>

<title>Research method</title>
<p>Narrative inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1321103X13478865">Clandinin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1321103X13478865">Clandinin &amp; Connelly, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1321103X13478865">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1321103X13478865">Elbaz-Luwisch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1321103X13478865">Reissman, 2008</xref>) is a form of qualitative research that focuses on the way people make meaning of the events in their lives and their interactions with others through the vehicle of story. Narrative inquirers “keep in the foreground of [their] writing a narrative view of experience, with the participants’ and researchers’ narratives of experience situated and lived out on storied landscapes as [their] methodological frame” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1321103X13478865">Clandinin &amp; Connelly, 2000</xref>, p. 128). Not only do human beings share stories, but “the stories we tell shape the meaning and texture of our lives at every stage and juncture” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1321103X13478865">Witherell &amp; Noddings, 1991</xref>, p. 1). Narrative inquirers affirm that storying one’s life is a basic human activity whereby people connect past, present, and future, enabling a sense of becoming in contexts remembered, lived, and envisioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1321103X13478865">Barone, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1321103X13478865">Barone &amp; Eisner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1321103X13478865">Barrett &amp; Stauffer, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, Chelsea and I collaboratively engaged in narrative inquiry in a layered approach. We re-examined her pre-service narratives as well as the narratives created as she wrote and verbally storied feelings and ideas about those earlier experiences through the lens of her more sophisticated understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1321103X13478865">Kincheloe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1321103X13478865">Lyons &amp; Laboskey, 2002</xref>). The storied representation of the study, as an article that includes and values narrative as a way of knowing, serves as the culminating layer in this narrative inquiry.</p>
<p>Data included Chelsea’s teaching video and written responses from her first methods course (elementary general music, second year in our program), collaborative journals she wrote with a peer in a (third year) choral methods course, and videos and online journal posts from her (fourth year) student teaching internship. Data also included the written responses that Chelsea constructed two years later as she re-read her earlier narratives (a longitudinal span of five years). Audio-recorded reflections—talk-alouds offered in real time as we viewed the videos together—were particularly informative. Memories lived and relived in the viewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1321103X13478865">Clandinin &amp; Connelly, 2000</xref>) served as a catalyst for Chelsea’s reflections on those experiences. She was able to articulate spontaneously, yet thoughtfully, what she was thinking at the time of her undergraduate schooling and at the time of the study and, as a more-knowledgeable teacher, could evaluate her own teaching and classroom environment with both emic and etic perspectives. Throughout this research process, we drew upon the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1321103X13478865">Duke (2004)</xref> and, particularly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1321103X13478865">Schmidt and Zenner (2008)</xref> as examples of retrospective narrative research in teacher education.</p>
<p>We approached the data with ethnographic hindsight as we engaged in a metacognitive process of reflection on reflective practice:<disp-quote>
<p>for the knowledge that can be made in hindsight can take on abstract significance, making from the past new ways to conceptualize the constellation of our present … Hindsight is a play of meanings, a strategy or signification, a possible resource for both learning and unlearning … Hindsight can be thought of as a deconstruction of experience, that is to say, a work of thought, second thoughts, actually, and, at its best, allows imagination its surprising depth and breadth. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1321103X13478865">Britzman, 2003</xref>, pp. 12–13)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The time spent exploring the original data while storying the relived experiences provided a space for Chelsea to metacognitively “think about her thinking.” The unique combination of etic and emic lenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1321103X13478865">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>) generated from Chelsea as the “outsider” now looking into her own early teaching experiences allowed us to recognize her emerging teacher presence. Chelsea functioned as the “more knowledgeable other” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1321103X13478865">Vygotsky, 1978</xref>) for the less experienced self she saw in the videos and whose words she read in her own journals.</p>

<title>The development of Chelsea’s teacher presence</title>
<p>I engaged in a reflexive process of moving among the literature, data analysis, and member-checking conversations with Chelsea as I analyzed the data from these lived experiences, shared and remembered. A theme of <italic>connected detachment</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1321103X13478865">Bresler, in press</xref>) emerged as Chelsea gradually realized that her teacher persona blossomed as she learned to focus on her students rather than on her experiences, particularly her insecurities. Her experience of the classroom moved from self to a focus on learners as she expanded her interaction “beyond her ‘teaching bubble’” (Chelsea, interview, June 24, 2010) and recognized the limitations resulting from her <italic>narrow peripheral awareness</italic> of the entire classroom. Chelsea learned to detach herself from her own experience of the classroom and thus became more aware of the experiences of the students in her classroom. Chelsea’s motivation to <italic>develop a teacher presence</italic> supported this transition of thoughtful “letting go” that enabled the connection with her students for which she was striving. These themes are explored in the following sections.</p>
<sec id="section4-1321103X13478865">
<title>Connected detachment</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1321103X13478865">Bresler (in press)</xref> argues for <italic>connected detachment</italic>, proposing that detachment and connection need not be viewed as opposing forces but “are most generative when regarded as complementary.” She suggests:<disp-quote>
<p>that the field of research methodology can greatly benefit from moving beyond the dichotomy of detachment versus connection. The challenge of qualitative research is maintaining an interested connection to what we study, as well as detachment from our habitual forms of seeing and judging, upholding the necessary distance involved in disciplined scholarship … Connection is invested in the process of inquiry, involving a certain amount of equanimity about the outcome.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As Chelsea and I mutually engaged in researching her narratives of experience, we negotiated this juxtaposition of connection and detachment. The “then and now” negotiation of our collaborative inquiry—supported by the narratives of Chelsea’s lived experience—provided a window into Chelsea’s emerging teacher persona. This theme emerged throughout our meetings as Chelsea provided a detached lens to a world with which she was intimately connected.</p>

<title>Limited peripheral awareness</title>
<p>Looking into the first set of videos with their accompanying requisite journals, Chelsea noted her insecurities in a first-time teaching experience. As a second-year student, Chelsea found the elementary general music classroom a good fit. Revisiting a videotape and reflective journal from these early teaching experiences, Chelsea remembered the lived experiences of her younger teacher-self and inserted comments in the journal (<italic>italicized</italic>) as a more experienced other. Though she had not noticed it at the time, her limited awareness of what was occurring in the classroom beyond her own peripheral vision was now glaringly apparent to her.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When I first began my visits to my assigned school’s music room, I definitely felt the need to sit back and observe. This was my first hands-on experience with teaching <bold>real</bold> students and I felt somewhat intimidated at first. I thought it would be best to watch the teacher and become familiar with the workings of her classroom. (Chelsea, original teaching journal, April 4, 2006)</p>
<p><italic>I wasn’t comfortable to get right into it. I sat for a week and just watched her teach. Back then it was an issue for me that I didn’t think I was “ready.” I wanted to watch [the teacher] as a model, but it was really my insecurities that kept me at the back of the room.</italic> (Chelsea, reflective comments, June 24, 2010)</p>
<p>By the second week, I was able to participate in the activities and provide scaffolding to struggling students during group work. I began to consider the kinds of lessons I might want to present to the students. I wanted to try my best to evaluate their abilities and choose something that would be a step in a new (but feasible) direction.</p>
<p>The first lesson I chose to present was the <italic>Mexican Hat Dance</italic> form lesson<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1321103X13478865">1</xref></sup> that I had prepared as a class assignment. I felt very comfortable with my planning of this lesson and I was confident that I could execute it well. (Chelsea, original teaching journal, April 4, 2006)</p>
<p><italic>That was me saying, “MY lesson is planned to the nth degree and I had every step planned out.” I was so confident writing it. I would think and think, it seemed so easy to put it down on paper, but that actually turned out to be to my detriment. I was so stuck on my lesson. I was confident with my lesson plan but not with myself as a teacher. I counted on the lesson plan more than on myself.</italic> (Chelsea, reflective comments, June 24, 2010)</p>
<p>My first bump was maintaining focus throughout the lesson. Once the students became involved with the music, the excitement was creating a bit of havoc. The students wanted to “frog hop” into the air or dance with their friends. (Chelsea, original teaching journal, April 4, 2006)</p>
<p><italic>Obviously, here I did not understand why this was happening. I did not know that some of them already knew this song. I didn’t tap into that at all.</italic> (Chelsea, reflective comments, June 24, 2010)</p>
<p>I wanted the students to feel free to move and express the music physically but their activities weren’t related to the music. Linda has her students seated on the floor which I found to be difficult. In reviewing the video, I thought it would be much more productive if the students were seated in chairs in a half-circle. The students would still be able to move and talk, but they would have some sense of “space limitations” in their chairs and wouldn’t be tempted to roll around on the floor. (Chelsea, original teaching journal, April 4, 2006)</p>
<p><italic>I don’t care so much about that anymore. Now I always have my students sit on the floor. At the time I needed some controls in place. I thought the kids needed some kind of outside situation to “keep them in” but really, it wasn’t so much about their chairs as about what I was doing. I felt like, because I planned the lesson so well, that the reason it wouldn’t go wrong wasn’t anything I was doing, it must have been something about the classroom arrangement. It’s not like I thought I was anything so great, but I had planned this so well, it should have gone so well, how could this not be working?</italic> (Chelsea, reflective comments, June 24, 2010)</p>
<p>Overall, I think the lesson went relatively well. The students all responded well to me and they enjoyed learning the A/B dance with partners. I was impressed with their ability to analyze the music in their own words. Sometimes I would ask a question in fear that I wasn’t being clear, but they were all very quick to respond. (Chelsea, original teaching journal, April 4, 2006)</p>
<p><italic>But now when I watch the video, it’s only one or two kids that respond, not the whole class. It was like the class was a collective—if one kid said something, she was a representative of the collective group. I was so reassured to have someone on board, that I took it as everyone being on board. It’s very telling now when I read this—I remember that I thought it was going so well because I was getting the answers that I wanted, but only from a few children. Now, I teach more to the individual child and I see them more as people than as a “mass.” That is when it started feeling more “real” to me—I was realized I was teaching “real kids.”</italic> (Chelsea, reflective comments, June 24, 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like many novice teachers, young Chelsea focused entirely on how she was functioning as a teacher and her own experience of the classroom, admitting, “I couldn’t see past the third row of kids” (Chelsea, reflective comments, June 24, 2010).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>When I look back at this video, I can see that I had no strategies for pulling the students together. I asked them to stand when the music changed and they started jumping around like frogs. Why am I dancing around? I don’t think I had any teacher presence at this point.</italic></p>
<p><italic>I’m really good with the kids up front, but there’s like this wall at my arm’s length. I’m talking to the few students within my teaching bubble that extends only to my arm’s length and I’m oblivious to what else is happening. There are students in the back of the room already performing the dance that I am determined not to teach until later in the lesson! Because one little girl is giving me the answers I need, I focus only on her and I assume everyone else is on board</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>I think when you’re a beginner and you write a lesson plan, you follow it completely step by step, no matter what. You can be the most organized person in the world. I went to the Dollar Store and bought all these hats. I wrote out my lesson plan in so much detail. And to be honest, it’s funny, because I remember sharing this video and thinking it was good.</italic> (Chelsea, reflective comments, June 24, 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although well prepared for the lesson, Chelsea struggled to manage the classroom, not noticing children outside her limited peripheral awareness. A more mature Chelsea had the distance needed to reflect on this personal teaching scenario; she shared this “aha moment” as she re-storied this event.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>I learned that I sometimes over-think a lesson plan to the point of being emotionally tied to it for my own success. The lesson goes very well as planned, but there have been times when the tides change. I could not switch gears! There comes a point where I have thought so long about a lesson that any movement away from my “vision” is like a black hole, which is what happened in this lesson. The students were obviously ready to move on to the next activity yet—out of fear—I clung to every step of my lesson plan. I was scared that the students would be leading me instead of me leading them.</italic> (Chelsea, reflective comments, August 7, 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a more secure teacher, Chelsea offered a window into the insecurities that plagued her as a young teacher. More connected to her own experience in the classroom than to the learner’s, she was unable to detach herself from her lesson plan. Her confidence was drawn from her musical and pedagogical thinking done prior to the teaching event rather than her ability to engage musically with students during the teaching event.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>I was worried about how I was perceived as a teacher—my self-image was so shaky. I didn’t want people to know that I felt so insecure. I always talked about becoming a “real” teacher. But this first lesson made me realize something that started my journey—I was teaching “real children!” I don’t know who I thought would be in the class, but they were living, breathing kids with unique personalities—not a “collective” of second graders!</italic> (Chelsea, reflective comments, June 24, 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Confidence and competence share a symbiotic relationship with risk-taking. That our incompetence might be revealed to self or others on our path to “becoming” is inherent in the growth process but not a transparency easily shared. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1321103X13478865">Erickson (1987)</xref> notes, “Risk in the form of a potential threat to positive social identity seems inherent in the process of learning” (p. 345). The willingness to take risks and realize the journey of becoming that teaching requires played a key role in Chelsea’s momentum toward becoming the real teacher she envisioned herself to be.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1321103X13478865">
<title>Beyond the “teaching bubble”</title>
<p>As Chelsea viewed and reviewed the data, she realized the extent of her limited awareness to what was actually happening around her in the classroom. Until she revisited her teaching videos four years later, Chelsea did not realize that, in her first years as a pre-service teacher, she functioned within what she now described as a “teaching bubble.” She watched herself engage—quite effectively—with only those students within her arm’s reach. If those students were engaged and seemed to interact with appropriate musical ideas, she assumed the entire class was on board.</p>
<p>Chelsea enrolled in the Choral Methods course in the next year of her undergraduate program. She interacted with her peer, Amanda, through buddy journals as the two students corresponded about their onsite classroom experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1321103X13478865">Blair, 2012</xref>). It was in “seeing the teacher in the other” that Chelsea’s bubble began to expand and, with it, her teacher persona blossomed. As Chelsea and Amanda described classroom events and difficult scenarios, and discussed ideas and potential lesson plans, Chelsea’s attention began to focus on the learners and less on herself. As the two students provided one another with much needed mutual affirmation (“I know you can do it! You’re a great teacher!”), Chelsea began to see the teacher in Amanda. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1321103X13478865">Gipps (2002)</xref> suggests, “If identity is conceived as concerned with persuading others and oneself about who one is, and what one is able to do, the judgment of others is critical” (p. 80). Not convinced that the mentor teachers in their assigned schools saw them as competent, their affirming judgments of one another’s progress seemed critical to their emerging teacher confidence.</p>
<p>Further, this noticing of Amanda’s becoming helped Chelsea see the teacher in herself. When less focused on herself, her sense of self as a teacher was, paradoxically, strengthened. In hindsight, she saw this as turning an important corner on her way to becoming a real teacher.</p>

<title>Developing a teacher presence</title>
<p>Throughout her final internship experience (the last semester in the undergraduate program), Chelsea and her peers engaged in online blogging to reflect on their own experiences and to support each other with comments about their blog posts. In the fulltime internship, the gap between novice and mentor teacher may seem perplexingly wide as the interns step into smoothly functioning learning communities. In her original journal post, as a student teacher, Chelsea described her strategy for bridging this gap. The comments she made after re-reading that post during our study meeting follow the post.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>So far things at my school have been going very well. My transition into independent teaching is happening much sooner than I thought it would, and oddly enough, it feels fantastic! (I only say “oddly enough” because the thought of taking over for a <italic>real</italic> teacher was a very scary thought just a few weeks ago).</p>
<p>From day one, my mentor teacher introduced me to her students as a “co-teacher” rather than a college student intern. I cannot express how much this simple introduction has improved my confidence in the classroom. Many of my pre-student teaching fears involved wondering: “How will I be perceived by my students? Will they be open-minded about learning from me?” When I was introduced as a <italic>fellow teacher</italic>, it made it very easy for the students (and me!) to understand my role and the ways we all should interact. In their minds, I was just another teacher instead of an awkward and doubtful novice. It was also a huge “A-ha” moment for me. <italic>I’m</italic> a teacher!—or so very close to becoming one. I suddenly had no problem putting on my “teaching pants” and jumping into things. It is funny how being provided a little bit of status can improve confidence. (Chelsea, intern/student teacher blog post, September 9, 2008)</p>
<p><italic>It was amazing how my mentor teacher was able to hone in on exactly what I needed psychologically at the start of my student teaching experience! I obviously had a very boxed-in definition of what a “real teacher” was in my mind back then. As a pre-service teacher, I wasn’t completely sure about my role in the classroom. That was quickly remedied when my mentor teacher made it clear that she saw me as a peer. I knew right then—on my second day of student teaching—that more than anything, I wanted to work hard to fill the role that my mentor teacher had suggested. I decided not to wait for it to “feel right” and I just went for it.</italic> (Chelsea, written reflection, August 6, 2010)</p>
<p>I am usually my happiest whenever I am very organized, and very “in control” of my own destiny. I often sit back and think <italic>so much</italic> that I begin to feel anxious about teaching before I ever actually get up there and do it. Since I know this so well about myself, I decided to really try my hardest to let all that go and just “jump in” without being so analytical. (Chelsea, intern/student teacher blog post, September 9, 2008)</p>
<p><italic>But what I remember is that “jumping in” was not exactly easy for me to do at first in my student teaching placement. In the beginning, I was really hard on myself when I didn’t like the way I phrased a question to a class, or if a lesson I planned didn’t go over well.</italic> (Chelsea, written reflection, August 6, 2010)</p>
<p>The way my mentor teacher modeled lessons, allowed me to teach her lessons, then gradually encouraged me to teach my own lessons was a great strategy and what I call “teacher persona scaffolding.” (Chelsea, intern/student teacher blog post, September 9, 2008)</p>
<p><italic>I think having a model for developing my teacher persona was very important. Since young teachers often look from the outside in, they are often wrapped up in their own teacher-image more than anything else. I think they often struggle to stay true to their personal identity when developing their teacher personas. Filling the shoes of “teacher” requires much more than simply applying your current “self” to a classroom environment. I had to figure out how to develop an entirely new version of myself. A young teacher shouldn’t be figuring out how teaching can fit into them, but how they can fit into teaching. After all, the teaching profession shouldn’t be about the teacher and their personal identity as much as it should be about the students and their learning experiences. When I first began mirroring my mentor teacher’s teaching patterns, it was a little awkward—like wearing a pair of pants that didn’t fit very well. Over time and with practice, I could ask essential questions and guide student learning in my own way. I was no longer a photocopied version of my mentor. Rather, I was able to recognize what made her teaching persona effective and I eventually understood what effective teaching looks like enough to make it work in my own way.</italic> (Chelsea, written reflection, August 6, 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Chelsea struggled with her desire to be a self-described real teacher. She felt confident to design lessons and admitted that she would overcompensate for her weaknesses by overthinking the teaching scenario she was planning. Unsure of how to look like a teacher, Chelsea intentionally took on her mentor’s persona, her ways of being in the classroom. Not yet knowing how to fit into teaching, she put on another’s way of being that gradually “fit” as her own personality became infused with her sense of self as a music teacher. As Chelsea detached herself and became less self-conscious in the classroom, her doubts about how others perceived her diminished. This detachment from self, with greater connectedness with the learners in her classroom, paradoxically connected her to her teacher-self.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>My previous definition of a “real teacher” has changed. It extends far beyond being able to stand up in front of a class and guide musical experiences. I think now that being a “real teacher” is having the ability to reflect upon my own daily act of teaching and how to alter what I do to best suit the learning needs of my students. It isn’t only the understanding of what goes into effective teaching, but putting it into practice.</italic> (Chelsea, interview, August 7, 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Chelsea now sees the uncertainties of the classroom experience that once plagued her as the fertile ground for musical and pedagogical growth. As a teacher in the making, dynamically engaged with learners and classroom environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1321103X13478865">Hansen, 2001</xref>), Chelsea affirms that the “I have arrived as a teacher” moment she had hoped would magically occur has occurred now that she has let that notion go. She has become a teacher.</p>

<title>Narrative as a vehicle for reflective practice</title>
<p>In teacher education, the scaffolding of reflective practice is equally as important as the development of content knowledge and pedagogical strategies. The writing and revisiting of narratives is but one strategy that teacher educators may employ to foster reflective practice. For Chelsea, it was particularly effective. Throughout this study, I became more acutely aware of the ways novice teachers yearn to see themselves as teachers. I am grateful for Chelsea’s candid remarks and intentional voyage into a past that she revealed to be fraught with uncertainty. Journaling to support reflective practice is strategic to teacher growth; this process of revisiting one’s own narratives enabled Chelsea to find peace of mind amidst the uncertainties of becoming a real teacher.</p>
<p>Chelsea’s process of storying her narrative—her thoughts and feelings as expressed in written journals and blogs—helped to shape her teacher persona. For Chelsea, the writing of narratives became a safe place to name the experience and, in the naming, she began to call herself a music teacher. She used the narrative space between self and future teacher-self to explore her evolving sense of self, reveal weaknesses and a lack of confidence, and to see a teacher that could not engage beyond her teaching bubble. As Chelsea found ways to expand beyond her teaching bubble, to see classrooms as places where real children live and learn, she lost her insecure non-teacher self and found a self that could fully be present to the learners in her classroom. For Chelsea, being (outwardly) present to her learners paradoxically reconnected her (inwardly) to herself as someone who is dynamically engaged with musical learners.</p>
<p>On a summer day when Chelsea and I met to view her videotapes together, Chelsea entered the room, arms full with journals and videos, and greeted me with a smile. “I was a little nervous to watch the VHS tape today; since I don’t have a VHS player anymore, I couldn’t preview it. But,” she added, “it’s okay. I’m not that teacher anymore.”</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1321103X13478865">Witherell and Noddings (1991)</xref> suggest that “the teller or receiver of stories can discover connections between self and other, penetrate barriers to understanding, and come to know more deeply the meanings of … her own historical and cultural narrative” (p. 94). As both teller and receiver of her narratives, Chelsea lived and relived, told and retold her narratives of learning to teach. She re-entered her own experience, with layers of detachment and connection, as she came to understand the dynamic nature of being a teacher. Chelsea is at peace with being at sea as she now thrives on the uncertainty of being a real teacher. Her ability to critically evaluate her own teaching and to narratively negotiate her teacher persona proved to be empowering—self-empowering. Engaging in narrative in the moment and in purposeful retrospection allowed Chelsea to bear witness to the temporal and experiential nature of becoming a teacher. Rather than looking for a point of arrival, Chelsea has embraced the journey.</p>

<p><italic>Mexican Hat Dance</italic> is a folk dance that is popular throughout Mexico. It has a clear A/B form with repeating sections that alternate throughout the piece. In this lesson, students were to collaboratively determine the form while listening to the music and initially demonstrated their ideas about the form by alternately standing and sitting (thus the inappropriate hopping). Students then were to work together to put large “A” and “B” cards in the correct order, held by student volunteers in the front of the classroom. Students then learned a simplified version of the traditional dance in which the dance movements change, corresponding with the form of the music.</p>
