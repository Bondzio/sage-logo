<body>
<p>Yes, the time has come for embracing interdisciplinary perspectives in understanding team dynamics. If there is one group phenomena that requires it (especially today), it is teamwork and collaboration. Why? Teams are critical to our agencies, industries, and organizational functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1046496413480245">Tannenbaum, Mathieu, Salas, &amp; Cohen, 2012</xref>); our productivity and creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1046496413480245">Thompson &amp; Choi, 2012</xref>); and our economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1046496413480245">Edmondson &amp; Nembhard, 2009</xref>). Teams save lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1046496413480245">Neily et al., 2010</xref>), generate new knowledge and patents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1046496413480245">Wuchty, Jones, &amp; Uzzi, 2007</xref>), and are crucial to our national security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1046496413480245">Hackman, 2011</xref>). It is imperative that we fully understand influences on what groups and teams do, feel, and think, as well as what hinders or facilitates their effectiveness.</p>
<p>Teamwork and collaboration are at the heart of how groups act, behave, think, and feel. These two elusive constructs are dynamic, complex, multilevel, emergent, and episodic. And while progress has been made in understanding these constructs as well as it antecedents, mediators, and outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1046496413480245">Ilgen, Hollenbeck, Johnson, &amp; Jundt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1046496413480245">Mathieu, Maynard, Rapp, &amp; Gilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1046496413480245">Salas, Stagl, &amp; Burke, 2004</xref>)—more is needed, much more. I submit that the next leap of new insights and knowledge about groups and teams will come from interdisciplinary thinking, methodologies, and perspectives. Only interdisciplinary research will give novel and deeper insights. The time has come, then, for all of us to embrace, apply, and be motivated by interdisciplinary perspectives to team and group phenomena. The time has come, and it is a must, in my opinion. So, what should we do to advance this cause? It will not be easy (Waller, see essays in this special section) and it will not be for everyone. Some will engage; others will not. Some will see value; others will not. Some will seek and use these interdisciplinary perspectives; others will shy away from them. In fact, I think, effective, fruitful, and rewarding interdisciplinary research in any field is a tall order. The forces against interdisciplinary research, at this point at least, are greater than those for it. That is, there are too many biases, fears, stereotypes, barriers to overcome (see this special section). There are professional challenges as well, as some schools and colleges do not reinforce collaboration across disciplines. And so we need to move away from focusing on the trees at the expense of the forest. Waller’s illustrates these points in the exchange she notes. When, the <italic>questioner</italic> does not understand (nor lets go) the purpose of the researcher’s aim—to identified behaviors that make a difference—the questioner gets lost (my opinion) in his/her own methodological <italic>trees</italic> by ignoring or not seeing the forest. But Meyer’s comments offer some hope. He states that the fundamental role for incorporating other disciplines methodologies must be driven by the research question of interest. He points to disciplines that have developed useful methodologies that are used by many (communication science, organizational behavior) successfully. Yes, encouraging news. And I offer these ideas on how to start.</p>
<sec id="section1-1046496413480245">
<title>Engage in a Respectful, Open, Critical Dialogue</title>
<p>We need to engage in a dialogue to learn, not to confront or tear down different thinking or methodologies. We need a constructive, back-and-forth dialogue—a critical dialogue, but with learning in mind. And INGRoup (Interdisciplinary Network for Group Research)—the network and the conference—could be (and should be) the catalyst for that. INGroup is well positioned to do this, albeit some engineering is needed in how these opportunities are orchestrated during the conference (see Waller, this section). On a personal note, my career over the years has been enhanced by listening, reading, and speaking to scholars and practitioners that have different views and tools for what I am interested in understanding (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1046496413480245">Cannon-Bowers &amp; Salas, 1998</xref>). So, at a minimum, we must engage in a dialogue. We owe that to our field.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1046496413480245">
<title>Try Them</title>
<p>Why not? Is there is a promising tool or approach from a different discipline that could help me better understand team dynamics? Why not try it? Why not learn about it? Why not see what it can yield? Why not explore its strengths and weaknesses as well? Tools such as social network analysis, historiometric analysis, and online video-based data analysis techniques—just to name a few—are very promising. This does not mean we have to accept them as they come. We, of course, need to critically evaluate them to determine how robust they are and if they fit our research purposes. But trying them would be a great step.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1046496413480245">
<title>Seek Partnerships</title>
<p>Again, why not? Collaborate with and seek those who complement you. As noted above, I have found throughout my career that scholars from other disciplines are willing to partner. I usually make a compelling case about why they are needed and why the partnership is beneficial. Sometimes these partnerships lead to long lasting professional and personal relationships. You have to find common ground, especially common research goals and ideas. Partnering with scholars from other disciplines cannot only inform us, but is almost a requisite in many funding agencies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1046496413480245">
<title>Educate, Disseminate, and Rely on Science</title>
<p>If we engage in a dialogue, seek partnerships, and try new interdisciplinary tools, then we should not forget to also advocate. That is, we educate our community on what worked and why, and what new insights it gave us about team dynamics. We participate in panels and conferences and discuss the insights, lessons learned, and what made a difference in applying interdisciplinary perspectives. Further, we publish our findings. We disseminate. And those tools, perspectives, and ideas that are robust and reliable will advance our knowledge and get vetted in our journals. That is how it is supposed to work. The scientific process separates the wheat from the shaft. And, this way, we all win.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1046496413480245">
<title>Have Fun</title>
<p>Yes, fun! My experiences in interdisciplinary research have been very rewarding and fun! During my Navy days, we sought to understand team decision-making under stress—known as the TADMUS project (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1046496413480245">Cannon-Bowers &amp; Salas, 1998</xref>). We adopted different conceptual frameworks (from cognitive psychology, engineering, computer sciences) and methodologies to triangulate and yield a better picture of how teams performed in complex, stressful, demanding, and high-stakes settings. And we learned a lot! It was not easy. In fact it was hard, but at the end it paid off. The journey was rewarding, and full of personal satisfaction that we had made a difference (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1046496413480245">Salas, Cannon-Bowers &amp; Johnston, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Now, I am not so naive to think that these ideas are all you need. But, sometimes simplicity is powerful. And in this case it might be. Never the less, the <italic>devil is in the details</italic> of how one composes and manages an interdisciplinary research team. It is the moment-to-moment actions that matter. It is the culture of collaboration that we set. It is the norms for acceptance of interdisciplinary ideas and methodology that matters. How do we establish that? I would rely on what we know about effective teams (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1046496413480245">Table 1</xref>). For example, drawing on my own experiences, the multidisciplinary teams I have been engaged with have common goals, a shared mental model of the end product, and a knowledge of what role each discipline plays. This is key—role clarity. When things were not going well, we huddled and self-corrected. The PI (team leader) was the coach and promoter of dialogue—a trust builder. The PI set the climate for cooperating and fostered information exchange. Over time, we all developed a sense of collective, and of being a diverse team with mutual respect and mechanisms to resolve conflict. This is a partial list.</p>
