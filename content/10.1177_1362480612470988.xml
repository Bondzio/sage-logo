<p>Janne Kivivuori’s <italic>Discovery of Hidden Crime</italic> is one of the best social histories of criminology in print. It focuses on the scientific, cultural, and political origins of the self-report delinquency survey, but in many ways is a broader history of criminology itself, a sociology of criminological knowledge. It offers a sociology and social history of not only US but also international criminological knowledge, for Kivivuori casts his net broadly, dealing with the advent of self-reporting in the United States and Nordic countries and, to a lesser extent, Germany and the UK as well. In addition, the book is so well written that it is hard to put down. It is, as he puts it, the ‘story of an <italic>idea</italic>’ (p. 4), the idea of hidden crime.</p>
<p>The book even has a plot line. It starts with a mystery—how can we break into that locked room to discover the amount of hidden crime?; it chronicles the long search for the tools to pry open the lock; and it shows how criminologists finally broke into the room where the treasure lay. Kivivuori does not argue with others who attribute the first use of self-reports to the sociologist Austin Porterfield, who initiated the first <italic>published</italic> self-report study in 1940. However, he goes back and back, to Quetelet’s constant ratio doctrine,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1362480612470988">1</xref></sup> Charles Booth’s social surveys, the many examples of hidden crime in the novels of Emile Zola, the Progressives’ social survey method, WEB DuBois’s proxy reporting method,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1362480612470988">2</xref></sup> a small, unpublished self-report survey that Sutherland evidently conducted in the 1930s (p. 79), and the early sex researchers. Porterfield was not alone when he jimmied that lock.</p>
<p>So successful is the self-report method that today it may be the most frequently used method to study crime and delinquency (p. 2). It has become so popular, Kivivuori writes, because ‘the method allows international comparisons that by-pass problems caused by national differences in criminal law and recording practices’ (p. 2). Thus we can speak ‘of standardized mass confessions on an industrial scale’ (p. 5).</p>
<p>Let us compare Kivivuori’s book with another recent work that deals extensively with crime statistics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1362480612470988">Jock Young’s (2011)</xref> <italic>The Criminological Imagination</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1362480612470988">Young (2011</xref>: 19) writes of criminology’s ‘obsessive concern with natural scientific and statistic method, of numerical othering, of distancing from the subject matter, of bracketing off issues of power and inequality’. He pays a lot of attention to self-report studies but believes that ‘it is rare’ for the latter ‘to have any internal check as to validity’ (2011: 28). Indeed, he mocks as ‘rank implausibility’ (2011: 35) the self-report finding that ‘there is little variation between the levels of juvenile delinquency’ in terms of class, sex, and race. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1362480612470988">Young (2011</xref>: 40) thinks it acceptable to use survey research for ‘ballpark figures’, he is essentially anti-measurement. Self-report studies, in his view, are an instance of the witless positivism that destroys the criminological imagination.</p>
<p>Kivivuori, in contrast, sees self-report surveys as ‘a reliable and fairly valid means of measuring the prevalence and incidence of crime especially in juvenile and young adult populations’ (p. 3). Contrary to what Young claims about findings of little variation in levels of delinquency, one of the early self-report studies, the Cambridge-Somerville Youth Study, found that there is a core group of delinquents who commit a majority of the offenses (p. 103). Moreover, not long after the self-report method became embedded in social science, Short and Nye began studying the method itself to improve its reliability and validity. They and others sufficiently strengthened the method that it became the basis for influential theorizing about the causes of crime.</p>
<p>Young attacks the self-report survey for moral reasons. There is an irony here, for as Kivivuori shows, the method ‘was born in a moral framework, as a means of attacking punitive attitudes toward criminal offenders’ (p. 3). The irony shows, I think, that moralistic criminology cannot hang its hat either on statistics (‘positivism,’ in Young’s language) or on anti-statistics. Young’s argument fails in part because he has not recognized this historical truth.</p>
<p>I have only one criticism, and it is small: Kivivuori’s failure to mention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1362480612470988">James Scott’s (1999)</xref> influential book <italic>Seeing Like a State</italic>. Scott is chasing very different game (his book is about ‘how certain schemes to improve the human condition have failed’), but it <italic>is</italic> concerned with ‘state projects of legibility’, with governmental efforts to rationalize, standardize, and turn ‘a social hieroglyph’ such as hidden crime ‘into a legible and administratively more convenient format’ (1999: 3). I do not want to imply that Kivivuori ignores the political implications of self-report studies; he is thoroughly aware of ‘the hidden crime research programme’ as ‘means of improving the state’s capability to see citizen behavior’ (p. 7). However, he is more interested in the normalizing implications of self-report studies, their ‘normal-because-prevalent argument’ aimed, originally, at decriminalization and making punishments less severe. Thus he veers away from considerations of governmentality into discussions of changing norms and efforts ‘aimed at genuine relaxation of both legal-juridical and therapeutic modalities of power’ (p. 16). But surely the self-report method is part of what Scott talks about when he writes of ‘seeing like a state’: making citizens’ behaviors more ‘legible’ and thus controllable.</p>
<p>Kivivuori’s book belongs to a social science genre that I revere: one on the ironies of social control. I was also pleased with the attention he pays to scientific rhetoric. In my book on <italic>The Criminal Brain</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1362480612470988">Rafter, 2008</xref>), I identified a genre of nostalgic criminology; here Kivivuori writes of ‘satire in science’ (p. 8)—the satirical approach of those who sought to break through the barrier to hidden crime. We need to become more aware of scientific modes, tones, and genres. Above all, this book is valuable as a social history of criminology, one that will, I hope, stimulate courses in this field.</p>
