<abstract>
<p>This study examined the extent and patterns of usage of web courses, and their contribution to the academic and social perceptions of 964 undergraduate students with and without learning disabilities studying in higher education. Students were asked to complete four questionnaires examining the usage patterns of various adaptive technologies and their contribution to the student. The questionnaires assessed <italic>Perceptions of Learning through Online Usage; Accessibility of Campus Computing; Hope Scale and Subjective Well-being Scale</italic>. A detailed examination of the usage patterns of online courses revealed that, compared to the comparison group, students with LD log more often into the course sites, going into the forum more frequently and leaving significantly more messages on the forum than students in the comparison group. Findings indicated that students with LD are more familiar with assistive technology and use it more than the comparison group. Students with LD reported higher scores on the <italic>Hope</italic> scale, they felt an increased drive to find different pathways to attain their goals, as well as being motivated to pursue those goals, and their subjective well-being was higher that of the students in the comparison group.</p>

<p>An increasing number of studies in recent years have shown that between a third and a half of students with special needs require some form of adaptive software or hardware to enable them to use e-learning and other information and communication technologies effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219410392047">Fichten, Nguyen, Barile, &amp; Asuncion, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022219410392047">Madaus, Gerber, &amp; Price, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022219410392047">Wolfe &amp; Lee, 2007</xref>). Research has shown that the integration of computer technologies into education is uniquely beneficial to students with special needs, on both the academic and the socioemotional levels, especially for students with learning disabilities (LD) who experience deficiencies in basic academic skills as well as social difficulties through their development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219410392047">Raskind, Margalit, &amp; Higgins, 2006</xref>). Nowadays, many computer programs have features that meet the needs of students with LD. Information and communication technologies support writing, spelling, planning, organizing, editing, and calculation in such a way that users feel more able to express their opinions and their needs. Technological developments have highlighted the potential of assistive technologies for special needs populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022219410392047">Fichten, Asuncion, Barile, Fossey, &amp; Robillard, 2001</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-0022219410392047">
<title>Students With LD in Higher Education</title>
<p>Available data on undergraduate students with LD show that they compose about 5.6% of the entire student population in various postsecondary institutions in Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022219410392047">Students With Learning Disabilities Rights, 2008</xref>). Similar data have shown that in the United States in 2004 about 11% of university undergraduates had a disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022219410392047">T. D. Snyder &amp; Dillow, 2007</xref>). In addition, the observation made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022219410392047">Gregg’s (2007)</xref> review is that approximately 17% of the individuals with LD will compete for higher education entrance exams and 11% of students who graduate high school will enroll in institutions providing 4-year courses. In Canada, for example, the number of postsecondary learners with LDs increased to 16% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022219410392047">Fichten, Jorgensen, Havel, &amp; Barile, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the ever-increasing numbers of students with LD who are turning to higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022219410392047">Hadley, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022219410392047">2007</xref>), studies reveal that these students face various difficulties in coping with academic skills as well as in the social and psychological domains. Most have significant deficiencies in reading, writing, and/or in mathematics as well as in spatial orientation, short- or long-range memory, organization, and time management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219410392047">Heiman, 2006</xref>). Researchers suggest that the lack of special and effective transition programs for students with LD to postsecondary education makes the transition even harder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022219410392047">Cummings, Maddux, &amp; Casey, 2000</xref>). As such, students with LD who enter higher education have to deal with their difficulties and/or with their ineffective learning strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022219410392047">Vogel &amp; Adelman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219410392047">Winter &amp; Yaffe, 2000</xref>) and to adjust to new social and academic requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022219410392047">Brinckerhoff, McGuire, &amp; Shaw, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>To succeed in their studies, students with LD often have to devise special study methods, which usually require extra time and energy and increase fatigue. Students need to develop efficient competences for time management and for coping with academic tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022219410392047">Heiman &amp; Precel, 2003</xref>). Another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022219410392047">Rabiner, 2008</xref>) indicates that, on average, college students who report having attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder fare less well than their peers in various domains. For example, compared to non-LD students, they have lower grade point averages (GPAs); are more concerned about their academic performance, report higher levels of emotional distress and social concerns; are at increased risk of vulnerability and isolation, low self-esteem, and difficulty in responding to daily demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022219410392047">Roer-Strier, 2002</xref>); often exhibit emotional and social difficulties, and experience of loneliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022219410392047">Wiener, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0022219410392047">
<title>Assistive Technology</title>
<p>The number of postsecondary students with LD, coupled with meaningful progress in instructional technology, has led to considerable development in the field of assistive technology for postsecondary students with LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022219410392047">Bryant &amp; Bryant, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022219410392047">Bryant, Bryant, &amp; Raskind, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The term <italic>assistive technology</italic> is defined as “any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022219410392047">Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, 2004</xref>, sec. 602). Within the comprehensive review of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022219410392047">Raskind and Higgins (1998)</xref>, assistive technology referred to any technology used to bridge the gap between the person’s abilities and the demands of the environment, which can compensate for their specific deficits. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022219410392047">Lewis (1998)</xref> added that the ease of technology usage can promote students’ ability to overcome barriers regarding academic difficulties as well as promote interpersonal interaction skills, such as networking capabilities.</p>
<p>Assistive technologies (ATs) offer alternative formats especially related to academic needs, such as reading, writing, and calculation, and have become a mandatory tool in higher education. Using the different facilities of AT programs may increase the independence of students with LD, facilitate learning, raise motivation for active participation in their academic studies, and encourage the students with LD to acquire and develop compensatory strategies for coping with their difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022219410392047">Wolfe &amp; Lee, 2007</xref>). The use of ATs helps students to transform the environment to be more accessible to them, reduces their dependence on other people, and enables them to express their abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022219410392047">Getzel, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The different AT programs that are provided for students with LD may help and support them to reduce deficits in literacy skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022219410392047">Crivelli, Thomsom, &amp; Andersson, 2004</xref>). They provide students with LD with adaptive ways to compensate for their deficiencies, enabling them to gain access to previously inaccessible materials and information, in particular for reading, writing, planning, organization, memory skills, and math deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022219410392047">MacArthur, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219410392047">Ofiesh, 2007</xref>). Moreover, AT contributes to the development of social interactions and improvement of the students’ general sense of well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219410392047">Dole &amp; McMahan, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The usages of AT serve as essential accommodations for students with LD. As presented in various studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022219410392047">Lindstrom, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022219410392047">MacArthur, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022219410392047">Madaus et al., 2008</xref>), the variety of accommodations provided offer a greater opportunity to students with LD to succeed in their academic studies in higher education. The specific accommodations reflect the most effective tools possible to establish accurately the students’ ability to accomplish their academic assignments and to allow their success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022219410392047">Madaus et al., 2008</xref>). Among the available ATs offered to students with LD at the Open University of Israel (OUI), we find various technologies such as reading and scanning software, Word Equation, voice recognition, audio books, and Dragon “NaturallySpeaking” software. In addition, most of the courses have websites on the Internet. In a recent pilot study on students with LD at OUI regarding the different usage of AT and their advantages and disadvantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022219410392047">Heiman et al., 2010</xref>), it was found that most students used various AT programs. For example, for reading, 55% of the students with LD used speech synthesis (English or Hebrew text-to-speech software), 41% used audio books, and 18% used a zooming feature; for writing, 45% used a spell-checker and 23% used a tape recorder; for time organization tools, 23% used a personal data manager.</p>

<title>Website Courses</title>
<p>Most Western universities make use of advanced technologies to improve their distance teaching. Distance education, which means a continuum of technology-mediated settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022219410392047">Banerjee &amp; Brinckerhoff, 2002</xref>), focuses mostly on asynchronous computer-based distance education courses, which appear in many variations. These kinds of courses might help students to cope with their studies and share social life in general, but mostly suggest new ways of coping for students with LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022219410392047">Banerjee &amp; Brinckerhoff, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The interactive model of web courses (studying via the Internet) can provide academic and social benefits. Web courses can promote student–student and student–instructor interactions. Regarding academic aspects, web courses provide pedagogical and technological alternatives to face-to-face tutorial meetings for students who are unable to attend the group meetings or for students with various disabilities. The website courses provide constant academic updates as well as online discussion forums. The asynchronous nature of web courses permits the learner to reflect prior to responding to a message, and therefore it usually allows a better analytic respond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022219410392047">Harasim, 1990</xref>). These asynchronous forums often replace face-to-face meetings, and so participants can become part of a virtual community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022219410392047">Berge &amp; Collins, 1993</xref>). As for the social learning environment (e.g., small-group discussion, part of the virtual social community), the learners often perceive themselves as reflecting more on their own thoughts and perceptions than when in a face-to-face class or with their peers.</p>
<p>Website courses include additional enrichment learning resources, links to databases and Internet sites related to the course of study, multimedia materials related to the course subject, and individual and group communication between students and tutors and among the students themselves. In some of the courses, computer-mediated tutorials almost entirely replace the tutorial sessions in the study centers. The university system can operate interactive distance teaching through broadband communication. From the university academic’s experience, the communication with the tutor helps the student to understand the subject and to distinguish between the main ideas and might emphasize or interpret the academic material.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022219410392047">
<title>The Open University</title>
<p>OUI serves as a higher education distance learning institution. The model of OUI is a model that integrates “traditional” distance learning with new computer-based methods. The academic materials are based on written books that are accessible in digital and voice versions, face-to-face tutoring meetings, and distance video lessons. In addition, all courses have a website that operates as a virtual learning center and includes e-books and expert lectures that can be viewed from a distance. In some of the courses, there are tutoring meetings through advanced video systems. These lessons are recorded and can be seen in the course website as many times as the students require.</p>
<p>The uniqueness of OUI is focused on its open admissions policy, its high academic standards, and the extremely flexible self-study method (e.g., online interactive discussion forums, written materials mailed to the student), which allows students to advance at an individual pace. Unlike traditional universities, OUI students may choose attendance at face-to-face tutorial sessions in study centers close to their area of residence, online interactive courses with instructors and peers via the Internet, or individual at-home study from specially prepared written materials mailed to the student. OUI offers its students the choice of a full or a blended learning model. Students who choose the blended model combine face-to-face meetings with online support (via the Internet) through website courses to supplement the traditional means of distance education, such as books and study guides. Thus, learning at the OUI is primarily conducted through self-study of written material, supported by advanced technologies to improve its distance teaching.</p>
<p>Aspects of distance education developed by OUI, along with the university’s open admission policy, enable every individual to realize and fulfill his or her academic ability. Support services offer, especially for students with LD, an excellent opportunity for academic study. Thus, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219410392047">2010</xref>, there were more than 2,500 students with LD attending the OUI. Many of them require some form of assistive software or hardware to use a computer effectively to help overcome various difficulties and barriers in their studies.</p>
<p>The University Center for Learning Disabilities offers academic and social support as well as specific accommodations. Among the accommodations that may be suggested are specific accommodations for the entrance exams and during academic studies, an increase in the use of ATs, provision of academic workshops for students with LD, and specific academic counseling.</p>
<p>At OUI, the accommodations are individually determined and are based on the specific results of the student’s diagnosis. The various accommodations could refer to academic aspects such as written or reading tasks, time management, and/or to the physical environment (e.g., a special room for exams). Students with LD can consider using different types of accommodation during their academic studies. From earlier research on the accommodations within 88 community colleges for students with LD, it was found that these students significantly increased their academic score performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219410392047">Ofiesh, 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-0022219410392047">
<title>Social Aspects in Online Courses</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022219410392047">Scott (2007)</xref> reviewed social identity theory in connection with virtual groups in the media. Social identity theory argues that social belonging is an important part of one’s self-concept; it also helps to define individual feelings of membership or nonmembership in a specific group. When incorporating virtual communication into social identity, individuals can express their feeling of belonging, or lack of belonging, to the virtual group in which they are taking part without a face-to-face interaction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022219410392047">Reynard (2008)</xref> instigated the debate on the benefits of social networking tools and the value of social networking skills within learning environments. He found that social networking requires a less controlled, user-generated environment. In other words, when users utilize popular computerized tools, such as posting messages, downloading media files, and updating personal information, within a learning environment, this cannot be considered as a social networking environment.</p>
<p>The model of social information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022219410392047">Crick &amp; Dodge, 1994</xref>) describes the individual process of interpreting cues and feedback in social situations. Social information processing can be considered as one of the most challenging domains for individuals with LD in that it brings together their cognitive difficulties (e.g., attention, memory, reasoning, focusing, and organization) and their social difficulties. In addition to the social aspect, we intend to examine hopeful thinking and aspects of perceived well-being and their relationship to academic performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022219410392047">
<title>Hope Measure</title>
<p>Since the 1950s, physicians and psychologists have pointed to the role of hope in health and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022219410392047">Cheavens, Feldman, Woodward, &amp; Snyder, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022219410392047">C. R. Snyder (2002)</xref> defined <italic>hope</italic> as a positive motivational state that is based on an interactively derived sense of success and claimed that people typically think in terms of goals. The theory of hope, which is part of a cognitive model, involves two main components: (a) agency (the motivation to pursue the goals) and (b) pathways (strategies and planning to meet goals).</p>
<p>Agency thinking involves thoughts about one’s ability to initiate and sustain movement along pathways toward desired goals, even when faced with impediments; the concept of pathways thinking involves thinking about the capacity to find effective ways to reach desirable goals and reflects the perceived ability to produce successful avenues to desired goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022219410392047">Cheavens, Feldman, Woodward, &amp; Snyder, 2006</xref>). Both agency and pathways thinking must be present in some degree for hope to succeed. A study on adolescents with LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022219410392047">Lackaye, Margalit, Ziv, &amp; Ziman, 2006</xref>) indicated that adolescents with LD reported lower levels of hope, lower self-esteem, and prolonged feelings of distress compared to adolescents without LD. The lower <italic>hope</italic> scores of the students with LD can be viewed as an expression of the frustration or prolonged feelings of distress that students with LD carry from childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022219410392047">Lackaye et al., 2006</xref>). Given these findings, we may assume that similar differences will appear and influence the perceptions of students with LD in higher education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022219410392047">
<title>Well-Being</title>
<p>Subjective well-being consists of people’s own evaluations of their lives. Subjective well-being is defined as an individual’s evaluation of his or her life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022219410392047">Diener &amp; Lucas, 2000</xref>). One’s subjective well-being is an important component in promoting positive adjustment and appears to play an essential role in individuals’ emotional and social stability.</p>
<p>The evaluation of well-being has been examined as a global construct of evaluations of personal life experiences in relation to various ranges of emotions and pleasant or unpleasant moods, such as happiness, joy, satisfaction, pain, anger, and stress. Others have examined key factors that are integral to well-being including, for example, individual behavior and coping skills, socioeconomic status (education, income, social status), social support networks, employment or working conditions, access to health care, and gender and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022219410392047">Fletcher, Bryden, Schneider, Dawson, &amp; Vandermeer, 2007</xref>) and have studied how individuals evaluate or perceive their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022219410392047">Diener &amp; Lucas, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022219410392047">Diener and Lucas (2000)</xref> found that well-being was strongly correlated with higher self-esteem, freedom from worries, and positive and pleasant experiences. In the current study, we expect that the perceptions of the overall well-being of students with LD will be significantly lower than those of students without LD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022219410392047">
<title>Purpose of the Study</title>
<p>Many earlier studies reported on the difficulties and the barriers faced by students with LD when studying in higher education institutions. In addition, it was found that ATs contribute to the achievement of students with LD, enhance their motivation, make their life more accessible, and offer them an opportunity to develop or to maintain social networks and to promote their hope for success. Previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219410392047">Dole &amp; McMahan, 2005</xref>) suggested that AT may enhance social relationships and improve the individuals’ sense of well-being. Although there is sufficient research on students with LD in a higher education environment, research connecting the use of technology and emotional and social aspects is limited. Thus, it is interesting to examine the relationships and the contribution of the usage patterns of website courses and of ATs among students with LD studying at OUI.</p>
<p>As previous studies have focused on the social contribution of networking through the Internet, we were interested in examining whether website courses and the usage of AT also contribute to the perceived well-being of students with LD and their hopes and plans to meet their desired goals. In addition, as was previously suggested, the measures of well-being, hope, and social networks are positively correlated among adults; therefore, we presume that the same pattern will appear among mature students with LD, but we assume that students with LD will report lower levels on the above measures. The current study had several goals:</p>

<title>Participants and Procedures</title>
<p>The study included 964 undergraduate students at OUI (535 male and 429 female) studying different courses in the social sciences, such as sociology, psychology, education, management, and economics. Their age range was 17 to 57 years (<italic>M</italic> = 28.5, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.01).</p>
<p>The participants were divided into two groups: 363 students with LD (188 male and 175 female) and 601 students without LD (347 male and 254 female) as a comparison group. The mean age for the students with LD was 28.5 (<italic>SD</italic> = 6.99) with an age range from 17 to 54, and the mean age for the non-LD group was 28.62 (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.24) with an age range from 17 to 57.</p>
<sec id="section11-0022219410392047">
<title>LD sample</title>
<p>All the participants with LD were registered at the university’s Disability Support Center, and most of them received accommodations such as additional time during examinations, overlooking of spelling mistakes, and permission to recess during examinations. The students with LD had been formally diagnosed prior to the research study by their school district psychological services agency when they were in high school, as adults by the university diagnostic center for LD, or in municipal or private psychological centers. Their diagnosis as LD was based on the criteria in Israel for LD classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022219410392047">Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports, 1996</xref>), which includes achievement test scores at least 2 years below grade level and average or above-average intelligence with a marked deficit in academic achievement. In addition, the definition of LD incorporates exclusion criteria such as absence of extreme behavior, absence of neurological problems, of sensory impairments, and absence of problems presumed to be the result of environmental, economic, or cultural factors. The diagnostic assessment included instruments such as the <italic>Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219410392047">Wechsler, 1991</xref>), <italic>Bender-Gestalt Test</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022219410392047">Koppitz, 1975</xref>), and achievement tests regarding learning processes mainly in reading, writing, mathematical calculation, or mathematical reasoning. All participants with LD were identified as having problems such as difficulties with reading, writing, and/or spelling in their first language (Hebrew). According to the Israeli Law of Special Education and the Israeli regulations for privacy protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022219410392047">Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports, 1996</xref>), specific test scores were unavailable to the research team. However, by definition, for an LD diagnosis, the IQ score must be in the normal range.</p>
<p>The questionnaires were sent to 700 students with LD who registered at the OUI’s Office of Disabled Student Services. All of them had previously been identified as having LD. The students were asked to complete the questionnaires sent to them by e-mail and to e-mail them back to the authors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0022219410392047">
<title>Comparison group</title>
<p>The comparison group was matched on gender and academic department with the students in the LD group. To ensure a matching group with similar characteristics, 800 students without any known disabilities (400 male and 400 female), who were at least in their 2nd year of study and taking online courses in the social sciences department, were chosen at random from the university students’ mail list files.</p>
<p>Over a period of 2 to 3 weeks, about 10 e-mails were returned as wrongly addressed and 20 questionnaires were excluded from the study as they were incomplete. Thus, we obtained a total of 964 completed questionnaires (63.3%) out of 1,500 questionnaires.</p>
<p>As the students’ age covered a wide range, the participants were divided into two groups according to their mean age (28.56). Results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed 593 students within the lower mean age group (non-LD = 362, LD = 231) and 338 students within the higher mean age group (non-LD = 208, LD = 130). No significant differences were found between the age groups and participants’ groups (LD, non-LD), <italic>F</italic>(1, 931) = 0.15, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05. As presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022219410392047">Table 1</xref>, no significant differences were found between the students with and without LD regarding age, GPAs, and academic credit.</p>

<title>Comparison of Students’ Reports</title>
<p>To compare reports of students with and without LD, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed with the following five dependent variables of students’ measures: contribution of the use of online courses, usage patterns of website courses, the usage of AT, <italic>Hope Scale</italic>, and well-being.

<p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022219410392047">Table 2</xref>, significant differences emerge for usage patterns between the two groups. For example, it was found that students with LD more frequently log onto the course sites (80% enter the website at least three times a week, compared to 65% of non-LD students); 31% of students with LD reported they leave messages at least three times a week, compared to 26% of non-LD students; students regard the use of these sites as an important opportunity to exchange views with the course coordinators and the tutors (57% with LD, 50% non-LD); and 30% of the students with LD consider themselves as active in the website courses regarding reading academic material, such as additional papers, articles to read, and so on provided by the course tutors, compared to 21% of non-LD students.</p>
<p>Regarding the usage of AT, students with LD were more familiar with AT, felt more comfortable using the technologies and use them more frequently than the comparison group. Examining the contribution of the use of online courses for academic and social aspects, results revealed no significant differences between groups. It appears that students with LD as well as students without difficulties were satisfied with both the academic as well as the social aspects of the web courses. Students with LD reported higher scores on the <italic>Hope Scale</italic>, and their perceived well-being was higher than that of the non-LD group.</p>
<p>To examine the frequency of use of the website courses, the students were divided into three groups according to their usage of the website (scale scores from 1 to 5): (a) the most active users who reported frequent usage (scores from 2.8 to 4), (b) the medium users (scores from 2.4 to 2.8), and (c) the infrequent users of the website courses (scores from 1 to 2.4). A two-way analysis was performed with students with LD versus non-LD and the usage of the website. No significant interaction was found between students’ groups and three levels of usage of the website.</p>
<p>Univariate analysis (ANOVAs) between the above three groups of usage and students’ reported measures revealed that students who reported frequent usage of the web reported higher suitability of the AT to their needs than the other groups. In addition, students who were frequent users reported higher academic and social contribution of the website course compared to medium and infrequent users. Students who used the website only occasionally (infrequent users) reported lower scores on the <italic>Hope Scale</italic> compared to students who reported medium and high usage of the websites. No significant differences emerge for perceived well-being and web usage (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022219410392047">Table 3</xref>). Means, standard deviations, and <italic>F</italic> values are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022219410392047">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study described and analyzed the characteristics of the usage patterns of online courses among undergraduate students with and without LD, compared the academic and social contribution of online courses and AT to the students, and examined the relationships between hope and perceived well-being with students’ groups and the online courses and AT measures. We were also interested in the measures that can predict feelings of hope among each group of students.</p>
<p>Given the variety of different ways to access to technology, ATs provide students with LD with adaptive ways to compensate for their deficiencies, enabling them to gain access to previously inaccessible materials and information and lessening the academic barriers to reading, writing, information organization, and memory areas. We expected that the technology would also promote students’ social networking, would promote students’ hope of success, and would enhance their motivation to pursue the goals.</p>
<p>Consistent with previous studies, examination of usage patterns found that students with LD visited the websites more frequently, felt more comfortable using the technologies, and utilized more multitask online learning strategies (e-learning, PowerPoint, CD-ROM, and WebCT) than the comparison group. The web course facilities allow students with LD to log more often into the course sites, to “visit” the forum, and to leave messages on the forum. Students with LD reported they felt comfortable with using the web courses; they regard the use of these sites as an important opportunity to ask the tutors questions and to exchange views with the course coordinators. They reported less difficulty using the online assignment system for posting assignments via the Internet. However, in spite of the generally positive views of the usage of the web courses, students with LD did not perceive it as an essential factor that promotes their academic achievements or facilitates their social networking.</p>
<p>Significant differences emerge in the use of AT between the two groups. Consistent with the objectives of AT, findings indicate that students with LD are more familiar with AT and use it more often than non-LD students. In addition, we found in this study that many undergraduates without disabilities often use the AT for services that facilitate their studies. For example, most students (in common with other individuals) frequently use the spell-checker, listen to books on CD, use the read-aloud facility, may change the background of their screen, use large print, and so on. We assume that while initially AT was developed for individuals with different disabilities, nowadays individuals without any diagnosed disabilities may benefit from these technological facilities, and they perceive global usage of the web courses and the AT as integral tools of their academic studies.</p>
<p>Previous studies examining the academic adjustment and social coping of students with and without LD have yielded inconsistent results. Some studies revealed that LD is negatively associated with psychological symptoms of distress during the early stages of college studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022219410392047">Sanders &amp; DuBois, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219410392047">Winter &amp; Yaffe, 2000</xref>). Other research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219410392047">Huebner, Thomas, &amp; Berven, 1999</xref>) found no significant differences in adjustment between college students with and without LD. Examination of the differences between the students with and without LD showed that students with LD reported significantly higher scores on the <italic>Hope Scale</italic>, they felt an increased drive to attain their goals and were motivated to pursue those goals, and their subjective well-being was higher that of the comparison group. We can view these results in various ways. First, for many students with LD who were probably frustrated during their school years, it is not obvious or expected that they will be studying in a demanding institute of higher education. Some of them did not succeed in finishing high school or had low academic achievements, so the ability to belong to and study in higher education means personal success, satisfaction, a feeling of self-fulfillment, and pride at being able to achieve their goals. Second, we can suggest that students with LD are more motivated to succeed, to find various ways to cope with their academic difficulties, and are expected to attain more effective learning strategies than the non-LD group. The significant differences regarding perceived subjective well-being can also be viewed as a part of the students with LDs’ personal realization, achievement in academic life, and feeling of being recognized by society.</p>
<p>Although it was found that students with a high <italic>Hope Scale</italic> score more frequently used the course website, reported greater usage of AT, and described higher efficient academic usage, regardless of the group differences, we must refer to these results with caution. As this is a correlative study, it is not clear whether our findings suggest that the frequent and intensive usage of the website courses contributed to students’ hope or whether students with high <italic>Hope Scale</italic> scores use and benefit from the website courses.</p>
<sec id="section24-0022219410392047">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>The findings have important implications for both practice and future research. With respect to practice, institutes of higher education are responsible for providing the necessary framework and should make appropriate study guidance available to students who choose to utilize it. At OUI, study guidance workshops are offered to students, and they are encouraged to participate in them. We propose that institutions of higher education encourage students with LD to enroll in such workshops and that they continue their efforts to help and support these students. We assume that appropriate learning strategies and skills can help these students to deal better with academic tasks and enable them to reduce stress and to benefit from social support.</p>
<p>The present study contributes to our understanding of the contribution of website courses to academic and social-emotional aspects of students with and without LD in higher education institutions and may contribute to a deeper understanding of the various perceptions of students, especially students with LD, regarding the benefits of using ATs. The study underscores the importance attributed by LD students to adaptive computerized technologies in general and to online discussion forums in particular. The findings highlight the need to encourage LD students to utilize online learning technologies effectively. In addition, it raises the awareness of both the planning and pedagogical design team and of academic personnel to be sensitive to the needs of learners with LD, as they develop and implement online learning and design website courses that meet these students’ needs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0022219410392047">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>A clear limitation of the current sample is that it did not distinguish among different specific types of LD. Another limitation of our study is the exclusive reliance on students’ self-report. It would be desirable to include objective and externally validated measures, such as the mean GPA scores of the university and tutors’ reports on the academic adjustment of students with LD. Despite these limitations, we believe the present study adds to the growing literature on the contribution of website courses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0022219410392047">
<title>Future Research</title>
<p>Additional research should include students in other colleges and universities and should differentiate between different aspects of students diagnosed with LD. Further studies should be expanded to include the perspective of tutors and course coordinators and should reexamine these topics at different stages of study, for example in the first year compared to the last year of study. Moreover, valid assessment should be developed to assess the specific learning deficiencies of LD students, which is appropriate in the university setting and takes into account the demands and the students’ needs to adjust to higher education.</p>
