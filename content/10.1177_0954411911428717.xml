<abstract>
<p>Investigations into tissue-preserving orthopaedic treatments should consider the tribology of articular cartilage; where simulations using animal joints are a predominant choice. However, very few studies have investigated the differences between human and animal cartilage. The aim of the present study was to characterise the differences in geometry and mechanical properties of human, porcine, bovine and ovine articular cartilage. Creep indentation was performed on osteochondral plugs taken from the superior region of femoral heads of all these species. Cartilage thickness was measured via the resistive force change of a needle descending through cartilage and bone. A biphasic finite element model was used to derive equilibrium elastic modulus and permeability. Results showed that human cartilage was significantly thicker than all other species tested. A positive correlation was found between femoral head diameter and cartilage thickness when comparing between species of quadrupeds. Human cartilage had the largest equilibrium elastic modulus, which was significant when comparing against porcine and bovine. However, porcine cartilage had significantly lower permeability. Significant differences in geometry and mechanical properties of articular cartilage were found between all species tested. It is necessary to consider these variations when choosing animal tissue to represent human.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Osteoarthritis is a debilitating disease causing disability and pain that affects 80% of people older than 75 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411911428717">1</xref></sup> Total joint replacement is the standard treatment for end-stage arthritis; this involves extensive removal of bone, which can limit revision options in younger patients. This has encouraged further research into less invasive, early intervention treatments which aims to delay or even prevent the development of osteoarthritis. Studies of novel early intervention cartilage substitution biomaterials need to consider the tribology of articular cartilage as well as the biomaterial intervention. Preclinical methodologies frequently make use of animal tissue or animal studies. However, studies that compare the biomechanical properties between human and animal articular cartilage are limited.</p>
<p>Athanasiou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411911428717">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411911428717">3</xref></sup> studied the biomechanical properties of articular cartilage in the hip and knee from quadrupedal and bipedal species. Canine, rabbit, cynomolgus monkey and baboon were used and important biomechanical differences between animals were established; however, these species are not commonly used in modern in-vitro studies involving cartilage.</p>
<p>The effect of hemiarthroplasty of the hip has been studied in vivo and in vitro. Canines have been commonly used to study hemiarthroplasty designs in vivo,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411911428717">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411911428717">6</xref></sup> and studies on ovine joints have also been performed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411911428717">7</xref></sup> These studies involved post-implantation investigations, such as macroscopic visual inspection of joints, histology and scanning electron microscopy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411911428717">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411911428717">7</xref></sup> In-vitro studies have used bovine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411911428717">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411911428717">9</xref></sup> and porcine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411911428717">10</xref></sup> osteochondral samples to investigate the tribology of articular cartilage. These have involved friction studies of osteochondral samples (extracted from the animal’s joint) against itself or against a biomaterial over a period of 1–2 h when reciprocating motion was applied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411911428717">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411911428717">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The tribological function of articular cartilage is directly associated with the intrinsic mechanical properties; in particular stiffness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411911428717">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411911428717">12</xref></sup> and fluid content.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411911428717">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411911428717">15</xref></sup> These intrinsic mechanical properties are governed by the micro-architecture of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM of articular cartilage consists primarily of proteoglycan, collagen II, interstitial water and dissolved ions. The proteoglycan content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411911428717">16</xref></sup> and degree of collagen II crosslinking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411911428717">17</xref></sup> contribute to the stiffness of articular cartilage in compression; whereas the degree of anisotropy of collagen II has been related to the tensile stiffness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411911428717">18</xref></sup> Fluid retention is associated with both the interaction between the interstitial fluid and solid matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411911428717">19</xref></sup> and the electronegative charge of glycosaminoglycans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411911428717">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The loads and motions applied to the articular cartilage in the body affect the production and micro-architecture of the ECM. Most cartilage samples used for the investigation of articular cartilage are taken from quadrupeds; however, the loads and motions experienced in the joint are different compared with bipeds (humans).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411911428717">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411911428717">22</xref></sup> Physiological makeup of the cartilage may also vary and be species dependent.</p>
<p>Despite many studies over several decades using porcine, bovine and ovine cartilage samples to investigate function and the effect of biomaterials, the authors are not aware of any studies that have examined the biomechanical differences in articular cartilage between these animal and human tissues.</p>
<p>Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanical differences between human and animal articular cartilage of the femoral head which are commonly used for in-vitro research studies (porcine, bovine and ovine). The following were compared: femoral head geometry, cartilage thickness, equilibrium elastic modulus and permeability.</p>

<title>Specimens</title>
<p>Femoral heads were acquired from the hind legs of six pigs (3–6 months old), sheep (≈4 years old) and cows (18–24 months old) no longer than 24 h after slaughter. All were slaughtered for inclusion in human consumption and the age of the animals was determined by availability in the food chain. Six human femoral heads were obtained at surgery carried out due to femoral neck fractures (UK National Ethics Committee approved, 06/MRE03/73). The specific ages of the patients who donated these samples were not known. Visual inspection of all articular cartilage samples showed no signs of degradation or swelling. Specimens were stored fully immersed in phosphate-buffered saline solution at 4 °C for up to 24 h until transfer to the laboratory. Samples were then wrapped in tissue soaked in saline solution and frozen at –20 °C until testing (up to a maximum of 30 days).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0954411911428717">
<title>Specimen preparation</title>
<p>Prior to testing, the specimens were thawed in a warm water bath and the diameters of the femoral heads were measured in the posterior/anterior and superior/inferior directions using a Vernier calliper (±0.01 mm). Osteochondral plugs (Ø = 9 mm) were extracted using a stainless steel corer halfway between the ligamentum teres/articular cartilage junction and the articular cartilage/femoral neck junction on the superior section of the femoral head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411911428717">Figure 1</xref>). The aim of the study was to examine the use of animal cartilage to represent human in functional testing where the loads and motions mimic that of a human joint. Therefore, this location was chosen because it is the primary weight-bearing region of the human femoral head and this would be translated to the animal samples in the mechanical testing. This standardised method of locating the point of interest was similar to that used in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411911428717">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411911428717">23</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>To ensure stability in the indentation apparatus, the inferior bone end of each osteochondral plug was flattened leaving approximately 5–8 mm of bone for fixation. Throughout this entire procedure, saline solution (0.9%) was used to maintain osteochondral hydration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0954411911428717">
<title>Mechanical behaviour of articular cartilage</title>
<p>In order to investigate the time-dependent response of the articular cartilage and hence calculate the mechanical properties, creep indentation was performed on each osteochondral plug. The custom-made indenter apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411911428717">Figure 2</xref>) allowed a constant load to be applied to the articular cartilage surface through a rigid indenter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411911428717">24</xref></sup> Both a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) (RDP D5-200H; Electrosense, Pottstown, PA, USA) and a piezoelectric force transducer (Part No. 060-1896-02; Electrosense) were included in the indenter design to measure the indenter displacement and resistant force respectively. The sensitivity of the LVDT was 0.4 µ m at 10 mm range and the sensitivity of the load cell was 0.04 N. The plug was attached to the indentation rig beneath the indenter with the use of a collet. A linear bearing was used to reduce friction within the apparatus. The velocity of the descending indenter was controlled by a silicon oil-filled dashpot (to avoid the indenter impacting the articular cartilage surface). The resistive force of the dashpot was measured over a range of 1 to 25 mm/s and the relationship between resistive force and falling velocity was linear with slope of 0.16 N/mm/s. The maximum reduction in applied force due to viscous damping was worked out to be 6.30 × 10<sup>−4</sup> N or 0.08% of applied force, and hence assumed to be negligible. Data from the force transducer and LVDT were stored on computer using LabView 8 software (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA).</p>

</fig>
<p>A constant load of 0.8 N was applied perpendicular to the cartilage surface through a rigid hemispherical indenter (Ø = 3 mm). The full load was applied within 0.2 s of the indenter contacting with the cartilage surface. The point of indenter/articular cartilage contact was taken when the load rapidly increased. The creep deformation response due to fluid flow was monitored over 1 h, which was in the range of previous studies (0.25–3 h).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411911428717">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954411911428717">28</xref></sup> The LabView 8 software collected data at 5 Hz throughout the test. To allow the data to be more manageable and to reduce the effect of noise, 10 data points were averaged at 4.8, 6, 12, 24, 30, 60, 120, 240, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 3000 and 3600 s; these were then plotted. All specimens were immersed in saline solution throughout the test to prevent dehydration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0954411911428717">
<title>Thickness measurements</title>
<p>After indentation, the osteochondral samples were allowed to recover fully by immersing in saline solution for 30 min. The plugs were then housed in a stainless steel bath filled with saline solution and placed in a mechanical testing machine (model 3365; Instron, High Wycombe, UK). A needle (Ø<sub>max</sub> ≈ 0.5 mm) was also attached to the Instron machine perpendicular and no higher than 1 mm above the articular cartilage surface. The needle was set to descend at a constant feed rate of 4.5 mm/min through the articular cartilage and subchondral bone. The resistive load was recorded at a frequency of 10 Hz and a graph of needle displacement versus resistive load was produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411911428717">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>As the needle travelled above the articular cartilage surface, negligible load was recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411911428717">Figure 3</xref>, point (a)). When the needle contacted the articular cartilage surface, the load gradually increased. This point was taken when the load increased above 0.01 N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411911428717">Figure 3</xref>, point (b)). As the needle travelled through the articular cartilage, the load gradually increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411911428717">Figure 3</xref>, point (c)) until it reached the much stiffer bone, where the load rapidly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411911428717">Figure 3</xref>, points (d) to (e)). The tide mark at the osteochondral interface made defining the exact location of the cartilage/bone interface difficult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411911428717">Figure 3</xref>, point (d)). Therefore, this point was calculated by equating the linear equations corresponding to the linear trend lines pre and post needle/bone contact. These trend lines were extrapolated using the points 0.1 mm prior to and post gradient change and all trend lines had an <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> of no less than 0.95. The needle displacement between points (b) and (d) was taken as articular cartilage thickness. Thickness measurements were performed four times on each osteochondral plug (approximately 4 mm apart and 2 mm equidistant from the centre of the plug) and the mean was calculated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0954411911428717">
<title>Mechanical properties</title>
<p>The results from the creep indentation and thickness tests were both used to derive the intrinsic material properties: equilibrium elastic modulus and permeability. This was completed with the use of an axisymmetric biphasic poroelastic finite element (FE) model (ABAQUS, version 6.9-1, Simulia Corp. Providence, RI, USA). The model used a material property-deriving methodology proposed by Lei and Szeri<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954411911428717">29</xref></sup> and contact-dependent methodology described by Pawaskar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411911428717">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>The articular cartilage was modelled as a poroelastic material (CAX4RP, four-node elastic and pore pressure elements) with 80% water content and a void ratio of 4. The Poisson’s ratio was assumed to be zero to allow maximum compressibility. For simplicity, the bone was modelled as an elastic solid (CAX4R, four-node elastic elements) with an elastic modulus of 17 GPa and a Poisson’s ratio of 0.3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0954411911428717">31</xref></sup> The cartilage contained 1125 elements in total with the mesh density greatest at the point of indenter contact. The bone contained 225 elements uniformly distributed in both the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> axis. The 316 stainless steel indenter had a stiffness five orders of magnitude greater than cartilage, and was therefore modelled as a rigid incompressible solid. The model assumed there was frictionless contact between the indenter and articular cartilage and permeability was constant throughout the testing procedure.</p>
<p>In the model, load was increased from 0 to 0.8 N and applied through the hemispherical indenter to the cartilage surface over a 2 s period and then held constant for further 3600 s, similar to the in-vitro experiments. The predicted curve produced from the FE model after this 2 s period was automatically adjusted to fit the experimental curve produced during the in-vitro indentation of articular cartilage using MATLAB v7.4 (MathWorks Inc., Boston, MA, USA). This was carried out by altering the equilibrium elastic modulus and permeability incrementally. The aim of the curve fitting was to reduce the sum of least square error.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954411911428717">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411911428717">30</xref></sup> After curve fitting, the resulting equilibrium elastic modulus and permeability were taken as the actual mechanical properties of the individual articular cartilage sample. The initial steepness of the curve affected permeability results whereas the final plateau affected the elastic modulus. An example of a curve fitted graph is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411911428717">Figure 4</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the current study variations between different species of quadrupeds commonly used in in-vitro assessments were successfully examined in terms of geometry of the femoral heads and intrinsic mechanical properties of articular cartilage. These results were compared with human femoral heads.</p>
<sec id="section15-0954411911428717">
<title>Femoral head geometry</title>
<p>A positive correlation between femoral head size and body weight was observed when comparing between species of quadrupeds. Bovine had a significantly larger femoral head compared with all species and ovine had the smallest. This comparison was not made in previous studies due to lack of variety of quadrupeds tested. Porcine femoral heads were found to be the most similar to human heads in terms of geometry, which could be due to the similar body weights of the two species.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0954411911428717">
<title>Articular cartilage thickness</title>
<p>A positive correlation between femoral head diameter and cartilage thickness was established when comparing animal species (excluding humans). However, this correlation was not observed in a previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411911428717">2</xref></sup> where baboon had thicker cartilage compared with canine even though canine had a larger femoral head diameter. This suggests that femoral head diameter is possibly positively correlated with cartilage thickness between species of quadrupeds only.</p>
<p>Athanasiou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411911428717">2</xref></sup> compared the thickness of articular cartilage from the hip of a variety of species including human, also using a needle probing method. It was indicated that human cartilage (1.39 ± 0.16 mm) was significantly thicker than canine (0.47 ± 0.14 mm), baboon (0.68 ± 0.14 mm) and bovine (1.26 ± 0.17 mm) cartilage. The current study also found that human femoral heads exhibited significantly thicker articular cartilage than quadrupeds. Another study by Athanasiou et al. compared cartilage thickness taken from human, bovine, canine, cynomolgus monkey and leporine knee joints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411911428717">3</xref></sup> It was also concluded that human exhibited the thickest cartilage compared with the other species.</p>
<p>In a previous study by Simon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954411911428717">32</xref></sup> it was suggested that, within the same species, thickness was positively correlated with magnitude of deformation. However, the strength of these correlations was not presented. In the current study, a weak correlation between thickness and magnitude of deformation was observed in the bovine samples (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.60); however, no correlation was observed for human, porcine and ovine tissue.</p>

<sec id="section17-0954411911428717">
<title>Articular cartilage biomechanical properties</title>
<p>The biomechanical properties of articular cartilage taken from human and quadrupedal hips were determined. The differences in equilibrium elastic modulus between species were found to be significant when comparing human against bovine and porcine but not ovine. Simon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954411911428717">32</xref></sup> also concluded that human cartilage exhibited stiffer properties than bovine cartilage from both the patella and ankle joint.</p>
<p>However, an earlier study by Athanasiou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411911428717">3</xref></sup> examined differences in the mechanical properties of knee cartilage between bovine, canine, human, monkey and rabbit. It was found that human cartilage was not significantly different from that of other species in terms of stiffness and that human cartilage was not the stiffest. Athanasiou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411911428717">2</xref></sup> also concluded that the size of the animal (body weight) does not correlate with stiffness of hip cartilage when comparing between species. The current study also did not find a correlation between animal body weight and stiffness.</p>
<p>The present study considered tissues from various species which were not age matched, since the animal tissues were collected from species at a time when they were most commonly slaughtered for commercial food production. This provides useful information where young animals are used in fundamental studies of cartilage tribology. However, further work is needed to map progression of cartilage change with age in individual species. This would be important in ensuring animal cartilage properties are appropriately matched to human.</p>
<p>In the current study porcine cartilage exhibited significantly larger permeability than all of the other species. Human cartilage exhibited less permeability compared with porcine and bovine cartilage samples; however, ovine cartilage was the least permeable, although these differences were not significant except when comparing human and porcine. Athanasiou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411911428717">2</xref></sup> examined the permeability of cartilage for all their species and concluded that human cartilage was the least permeable.</p>
<p>It must be noted that the limitation of fitting data to single values for elastic properties (equilibrium elastic modulus and permeability) is that it only provides a localised material property for a specific specimen. The constitutive equations also emphasised the intraspecies variability between specimens.</p>
<p>The difficulties in fitting the initial region of the curve must also be taken into consideration. It has been well documented that in this region, the experimental and theoretical creep deformation differ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0954411911428717">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0954411911428717">35</xref></sup> This difference is due to a number of factors. For example, in the model used in the current study, friction between the indenter tip and cartilage surface was assumed to be zero. However, initially during indentation of cartilage, friction does occur as a function of time, which is difficult to model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0954411911428717">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0954411911428717">34</xref></sup> Also, initial loading conditions between the experimental and theoretical creep tests are also difficult to match exactly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0954411911428717">36</xref></sup> Another limitation of the model is that it is exhibits linear isotropic homogeneous mechanical properties. Therefore, it does not take into account the well documented depth-varying properties of cartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0954411911428717">33</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The current study has shown that articular cartilage mechanical properties, thickness and geometry of femoral heads differ significantly between different species. Therefore, it is necessary to consider these variations when choosing animal tissue to represent human. Mechanically, ovine cartilage modulus and permeability were the most comparable to human; however, the diameter and shape of the femoral head and the thickness of the cartilage were the least comparable. Porcine femoral heads were the most acceptable in geometrical terms and bovine cartilage exhibited the most similar thickness. The tissue choice is therefore likely to be a compromise and will be dependent on the application.</p>
