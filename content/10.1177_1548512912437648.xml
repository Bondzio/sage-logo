<p>Reusability, interoperability and composability have been studied for a long time. While reuse has been pronounced as the key issue for success in large and complex system development, interoperability and composability have been recognized as underlying challenges for reuse. Interoperability has been defined as an information exchange capability to support processes that cross systems’ boundaries, and composability is delineated as the capability to assemble systems in various combinations. These problems hit simulations and simulators as well as a wide range of military systems. This special issue is aimed at presenting the recent efforts in the air warfare simulation domain that try to tackle some or all of them. Air warfare simulations have long been utilized by the defense modeling and simulation community. Efforts which target developing models for the agents of air to air, air to ground and surface to air combat have resulted in extensive literature including electronic warfare, command and control systems, weapons and platform modeling. Meanwhile the advances in distributed and agent-based simulation technologies have enabled a wide range of constructive, virtual and live warfare simulations to be developed. Recently, as a variety of models and simulations are ready and available, the defense community is facing the problems of reusing, interoperating and composing them.</p>
<p>Papers of this special issue report the results of recent studies from the air warfare simulation domain that achieve technical contributions against these tough methodology problems of modeling and simulation. Three of the papers of this JDMS Special Issue attack reuse at particular levels. While Özkan, et. al presents generic dynamic models for air to surface missiles, Aruk, et. al contributes with various reusable simulation models and components for airborne torpedo attack. Zipfel adds another bit with his reusable simulation library for aerospace vehicle simulation, namely CADAC<?h-0.5?>+<?h-1?>+ (Computer Aided Design of Aerospace Concepts). The fourth paper on the other hand, from Alpdemir, et. al presents a simulation infrastructure to tackle interoperability and composability. The editor kindly provides the following overview of these special issue papers:</p>
<list id="list1-1548512912437648" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>In “Modeling of Dynamics, Guidance, and Control Systems of Air to Surface Missiles”, B. Özkan, M.K. Özgören and G. Mahmutyazıcıoğlu present generic dynamics models for air to surface missiles with associated guidance and control schemas. They not only provide models for single part missile geometries, but also express dynamics of two part missiles. This paper contributes in reuse for air warfare simulations at the model level. They provide reusable dynamics models and augment them with typical acceleration based and angle based guidance laws, acceleration and angle control systems and present an implementation of expressed models. With scenario runs and post analysis they present a typical use case of these models while promoting the user to reuse them in various purposes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In “Modeling of an Airborne Torpedo Attack and Implementation on a Simulation Environment”, F. Aruk, A.F. Güven, H.M. Genç and C.C. Okutan present the reusable models and components they developed to simulate an air borne torpedo attack. This paper contributes to this special issue by developing a series of reusable models to support the simulation of an air warfare mission. The aircraft model, torpedo free fall, water entry and underwater run models have been developed by the authors. They then implement these models as reusable simulation components for a simulation infrastructure, namely VR-Forces.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In “CADAC: Multi-Use Architecture for Constructive Aerospace Simulations”, P.H. Zipfel presents an aerospace vehicle simulation framework, namely CADAC (Computer Aided Design of Aerospace Concepts). It is a hierarchical class library that supports aircraft, missiles, satellites or ground targets. This study tackles the reuse problem in air warfare simulation by developing a reusable code. The paper presents the requirements for this infrastructure, the architecture designed and multiple use cases. While the first paper introduces reusable math models and the second paper presents reusable simulation models and components, this paper focuses rather on a library for systematic and structured reuse practice.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In “SiMA: A DEVS Based Modeling and Simulation Framework to Support Model Composability”, M.N. Alpdemir, A. Kara, F. Deniz and D. Bozağaç present a simulation software framework that supports reusability through enabling interoperability and composability of models. SIMA – Simulation Modeling Infrastructure of this study is based on a well-defined modeling formalism DEVS as the model execution mechanism that supports composability. After introducing the formal background, the authors present the SIMA architecture. Then they report performance metrics over some case studies. With this last paper that contributes with a composability infrastructure, the special issue covers a wide span from reusable models to reusable components, from class library to a simulation infrastructure.</p></list-item>
