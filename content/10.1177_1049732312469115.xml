<abstract>
<p>Recently, researchers have focused on the benefits of e-mentoring for young people with disabilities, such as greater access to sources of information and support. Relatively few researchers have explored the problem of unsuccessful e-mentoring relationships, i.e., mentors and mentored individuals who withdraw from an e-mentoring program before completion. Our findings promote understanding of the dynamics of unsuccessful vs. successful e-mentoring relationships for youth with disabilities. Using qualitative methods, we focused primarily on negative online experiences. We compared the e-mentoring process of six “unsuccessful” pairs of mentors and mentored students who withdrew from an e-mentoring program with three exemplary “successful” pairs who fully completed the program. Our findings revealed different communication patterns in the two groups. Whereas the unsuccessful pairs used a more formal style and distant tone, the successful pairs used an informal and supportive style. We discuss these differences, including the components that are essential to success.</p>

<p>E-mentoring, also known in the literature as telementoring, online mentoring, or virtual mentoring, refers to a relationship in which a mentor provides guidance and support to a mentored individual via distance communication technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312469115">Miller &amp; Griffiths, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312469115">Single &amp; Single, 2005</xref>). Since the early 1990s, scholars who have conducted e-mentoring programs have focused on developmental or instrumental growth of at-risk youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312469115">iMentor, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312469115">MentorNet, 1997</xref>). Concurrently, researchers began to explore the feasibility and utility of these programs, focusing primarily on the contribution of e-mentoring to personal development and empowerment of youth. Findings retrieved from these studies have indicated that e-mentoring programs can provide greater access to various sources of information and support. E-mentoring might also increase accessibility to mentorship for various populations in terms of freedom of time and location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312469115">Ensher, Heun, &amp; Blanchard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312469115">Rhodes, Spencer, Saito, &amp; Sipe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312469115">Thomson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In recent years, scholars and researchers have revealed the potential benefits of e-mentoring for people with disabilities. The accessibility of e-mentoring allows people with disabilities to communicate with other people with or without disabilities, to share personal experiences and to pursue academic and vocational opportunities. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312469115">Cohen and Light (2000)</xref> conducted an e-mentoring program for adolescents and young adults with cerebral palsy who used augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). The researchers found that e-mentoring conducted by successful users of AAC (i.e., the mentors) might be effective in easing the transition from secondary school to young adulthood.</p>
<p>An example of a national e-mentoring program that matches mentors and mentored individuals with similar disabilities is Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking &amp; Technology (DO-IT). The program is aimed to encourage individuals with disabilities to participate in postsecondary academic programs and careers through outreach programs to students with disabilities, disability awareness training, and information dissemination. Findings of evaluation studies indicated that DO-IT established a favorable environment in which to provide psychological, academic, and career support for youth with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312469115">Burgstahler &amp; Crawford, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312469115">Burgstahler &amp; Cronheim, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, most researchers conducting e-mentoring studies, whether they targeted populations with or without disabilities, have emphasized the benefits of the process rather than potential problems or less-than-favorable outcomes. They have addressed e-mentoring challenges—such as sustaining the utility of the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312469115">O’Neill &amp; Gomez, 1998</xref>), computer and Internet skills, intrinsic motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312469115">DiRenzo, Linnehan, Shao, &amp; Rosenberg, 2010</xref>), frequency of communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312469115">Rhodes et al., 2006</xref>), and coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312469115">Cravens, 2003</xref>)—but have discussed those challenges from the perspective of successful relationships, i.e., mentors and mentored individuals who completed a mentoring program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312469115">DiRenzo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312469115">Shpigelman, Weiss, &amp; Reiter, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312469115">Single &amp; Single, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Eby and her colleagues have explored negative mentoring experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312469115">Eby, Butts, Durley, &amp; Ragins, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312469115">Eby, Butts, Lockwood, &amp; Simon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312469115">Eby, McManus, Simon, &amp; Russell, 2000</xref>). The researchers developed a taxonomy of negative mentoring experiences from the mentored individual’s perspectives. They identified five distinct types of negative mentoring experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312469115">Eby et al., 2000</xref>):</p>
<list id="list1-1049732312469115" list-type="order"><list-item><p>General dysfunctionality, in which the mentor has personal problems that might interfere with his or her ability to tutor the mentored individual effectively;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A mismatch within the dyad, in which one or both parties report that there is a mismatch in values, work styles, and/or personality;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A lack of mentor experience, in which the mentored individual perceives the mentor as deficient in interpersonal or technical skills;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Manipulative behavior, in which the mentor misuses his or her position of power (e.g., dictatorial mentor behavior, inappropriate delegation, deceit, credit taking); and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Distancing behavior, in which the mentor neglects or intentionally excludes his or her mentored individual from important meetings or events.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The above studies were focused primarily on negative experiences of face-to-face mentoring conducted in academic or vocational settings, and on the mentoring experiences of young adults without disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312469115">Eby et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312469115">Johnson &amp; Huwe, 2002</xref>). E-mentoring relationships, too, might become ineffective when problems relating to the two parties are raised. These problems can lead to the premature termination of a relationship, feelings of disappointment, or regret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312469115">Scandura, 1998</xref>). Although negative experiences are certainly a component of all human interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312469115">Duck, 1994</xref>), researchers have not yet explored unsuccessful e-mentoring relationships, i.e., mentors and mentored individuals who withdraw from an e-mentoring program.</p>
<p>In our study, we addressed this gap by analyzing the negative experiences of an e-mentoring program. We also addressed the issue of unsuccessful experiences in the context of disability, i.e., young mentors and mentored individuals with disabilities who withdrew from the e-mentoring program before completion. In addition to self-reports, as used in previous mentoring studies, we analyzed raw data, i.e., the electronic correspondence of the pairs (mentor and mentored individual). Using qualitative methods, we compared the e-mentoring process of six “unsuccessful” pairs who did not reach completion with three exemplary “successful” pairs who fully completed the program. In particular, we explored differences between the two types of relationships (unsuccessful vs. successful) in terms of communication, relationship dynamics, and the issues discussed. We present information about these e-mentoring experiences from the perspectives of both the mentors and the mentored individuals.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312469115" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>We explored a developmental e-mentoring intervention program created to provide social and emotional support for adolescents with disabilities (mentored students) by young adults who also had disabilities (mentors), via primarily asynchronous electronic communication (e-mail). The coordinator of the program instructed the mentors to serve as adult role models for the mentored students, to share their life experiences, and to focus on positive aspects of the disability experience. The coordinator of the program matched each mentor separately with two mentored students based mostly on gender, shared interests, and hobbies. She instructed the pairs to communicate primarily via e-mail over an 8-month period. Each participant was required to send at least two messages per week. In addition, the pairs were required to meet face-to-face on three occasions during the program. Between these meetings, the pairs continued to communicate via the Internet. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312469115">Shpigelman et al. (2009)</xref> fully described the intervention, including the webmail software and ethical considerations, in a previous publication. In this article, therefore, we present only a brief description of the intervention program.</p>
<p>The e-mentoring intervention was implemented according to the following four phases: (a) November and December: “personal acquaintance,” which consisted of introductions and searching for topics of mutual interest; (b) January and February: “moderated communication,” which focused directly or indirectly on issues that concern adolescents, such as social life, family relationships, studies, career, travel, and other issues that the mentored students raised (during this phase, each pair had to meet individually face-to-face for the first time); (c) March and April: “online activities,” during which the pairs were engaged in online activities, such as playing web games, planning a trip via the retrieval of information from Web sites, chatting online, and sharing information (during this phase there was a group face-to-face meeting organized by the program coordinator with all mentors and mentored students); and (d) May and June: “saying goodbye,” which meant preparing the mentors and the mentored students for the end of the program, including planning a common souvenir, such as creating a web album or presentation (it also included a last individual face-to-face meeting aimed to achieve closure to the process).</p>
<sec id="section2-1049732312469115">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The e-mentoring program, a new offering under the auspices of an established Israeli mentoring project, was designed to provide an accessible environment for communication and support of young people with disabilities. The mentored students were Israeli adolescents age 15 to 20 years who studied at special education schools for students with developmental, physical, emotional, and/or behavioral disabilities. They were referred to the e-mentoring program by the special education school staff (teachers and consultant) and were recommended based on their need for social and emotional support. After referral, the first author connected with the students, interviewed them, and screened them based on two inclusion criteria: (a) their ability to communicate via the Internet, and (b) their interest in participating in the e-mentoring program.</p>
<p>The mentors were Israeli university students age 22 to 28 years; most (67%) were women. Each mentor had at least one disability, such as a visual, hearing, or physical impairment. The students applied to serve as mentors through the national mentoring project. The coordinator, in collaboration with the first author, screened the candidates through personal interviews. The inclusion criteria for selecting the mentors were: (a) computer and Internet proficiency, (b) Internet access, and (c) a strong willingness to contribute via an e-mentoring program, including a commitment to the process (online and face to face). The program originally consisted of nine mentors and 19 mentored students. Two mentors and six mentored students withdrew during the program, resulting in the completion of the program by seven mentors and 13 mentored students. In this article, we refer to the six pairs who did not complete the program as having had “unsuccessful” relationships.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732312469115">
<title>Design and Analysis</title>
<p>To examine the dynamics that might lead to unsuccessful e-mentoring, we compared the six unsuccessful pairs to a sample of exemplary successful pairs. We selected exemplary successful pairs based on two inclusion criteria: (a) pairs who had exchanged more than 50% of the required messages (i.e., two messages per week over an 8-month period), and (b) pairs who had been evaluated as most successful in the postevaluation questionnaire by the mentors, mentored students, coordinator, and teachers. This screening process resulted in the selection of three exemplary successful pairs.</p>
<p>We conducted a qualitative thematic analysis of all 448 electronic messages exchanged by the participants, 120 retrieved from the six unsuccessful pairs and 328 retrieved from the three successful pairs. In addition, we conducted a qualitative thematic analysis of the responses to the postevaluation questionnaire completed by participants from the successful pairs (three mentors and one mentored student) and from the unsuccessful pairs (one mentor and two mentored students). We defined the themes inductively through the constant comparative method, with particular attention to differences between the unsuccessful and successful pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312469115">Patton, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The first author initially assigned thematic codes to the responses to reflect themes emerging from the data, a process often referred to as open coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312469115">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990</xref>). In a second wave of analysis meetings, we grouped the codes, eliminated redundant codes, and arranged them into major themes and subthemes to facilitate analysis of thematic interrelationships, a process often referred to as axial coding (Strauss &amp; Corbin). As the analysis proceeded, we constantly reexamined the data to determine relationships between thematic categories with implications for theory building. To enhance trustworthiness and reduce bias, we incorporated triangulation through use of multiple data sources (e-mail messages and evaluation questionnaire responses) and multiple analysts. In addition, we examined changes in the themes over the major phases of the e-mentoring program.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732312469115">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049732312469115">2</xref>, no pattern emerged related to the demographic variables, such as age and disability type of the unsuccessful pairs compared to successful pairs. Regarding gender, it might appear on the surface that female mentors were more successful than male mentors. This conclusion cannot be supported, however, because there were two other male mentors who completed the program and who seemed to develop successful relationships with their mentored students. We excluded these pairs from the present study because they did not reach the high inclusion criteria that we set for the most successful pairs.</p>

<p>The mentor’s academic discipline might be related to the quality of the relationship, as indicated in the tables. The unsuccessful mentors specialized primarily in science disciplines, such as computer science and industry, or in the humanities. In contrast, the successful mentors specialized in therapeutic disciplines, such as psychology, occupational therapy, and social work. Furthermore, face-to-face contact might be important in view of the fact that all pairs who completed the program met on at least one occasion. The most successful pairs conducted at least two face-to-face meetings, whereas the majority of the unsuccessful pairs did not meet during the program.</p>
<p>The thematic analysis also indicated a difference in the dynamics of the e-mentoring process conducted by the unsuccessful pairs compared to the successful pairs. In the next sections, we present the themes in relation to the major phases of the program, starting with the first e-mail. We focus on three of the four periods of implementation of the program: November and December (personal acquaintance), January and February (moderated communication), and March and April (online activities). We have excluded the last phase of the program (May and June) from the data analysis because it did not include both comparison groups (unsuccessful vs. successful). The unsuccessful pairs ended their relationships by the end of the third phase of the program.</p>
<sec id="section5-1049732312469115">
<title>The First E-Mail</title>
<p>In general, the first e-mail messages sent by the mentors and mentored students from the two groups (unsuccessful and successful) were similar in terms of content or issues discussed. The pairs followed the instructions of the program, i.e., introduced themselves and coordinated expectations. However, the first e-mail sent by the unsuccessful mentors seemed to be more formal and distant in style or tone than the first e-mail sent by the successful mentors. To illustrate, an unsuccessful mentor who wanted to get to know his mentored student presented his questions and expectations as an instructional list:
<disp-quote>
<p>I am your mentor in this e-mentoring program. I hope we will become distance friends and correspond via e-mail whatever we would like to.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<list id="list2-1049732312469115" list-type="simple"><list-item><p>- Have you heard about this e-mentoring program? Who told you about it? What do you know about the program?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- We will correspond via e-mail from now until the end of June.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- What are your expectations from this program? What do you expect from me as your mentor?</p></list-item></list>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I expect to get to know you and of course I will tell you about myself.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, the successful mentors introduced themselves in a friendly and informal way, communicated interest in the mentored students, and added emoticons (emotion icons) such as smiley faces, as indicated in the message below:
<disp-quote>
<p>Hi X, ☺</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>My name is Y and I will be your mentor during the year. I am 28 years old and I study occupational therapy at the university. I wish you could tell me about yourself. What class are you in? What are your hobbies? And anything else you would like to tell me. If you have questions, send them to me and I will try to answer them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, analysis of the first messages indicated that the unsuccessful mentors initiated the online conversation through a general request such as, “Tell me a little bit about you,” whereas the successful mentors asked direct and specific questions such as, “How many siblings do you have?” “What do you study?” “What are your hobbies?” To summarize, the first e-mails sent by the unsuccessful mentors were less personal, less direct, and more general and formal than the first e-mails sent by the successful mentors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732312469115">
<title>The First Phase: Personal Acquaintance</title>
<p>The unsuccessful pairs did not communicate frequently, whether it was caused by the mentor or the mentored student: “I have not received an e-mail from you for a while” (a mentored student). “Unfortunately, I can’t reach you, why don’t you reply to my e-mails?” (a mentor). One of the six unsuccessful pairs ended the relationship at this initial phase. The mentor of this pair sent four e-mails and received no response from the mentored student. In effect, the mentored student ended the relationship before starting it, as reflected in the last message sent by his mentor: “I have to say goodbye because I have realized this is your decision. I wish you good luck in your studies, health, and happiness.”</p>
<p>In contrast, the successful pairs communicated on a weekly basis, as required. Mutual commitment and ongoing feedback were major components of their communication. The mentors were very supportive and gave positive feedback for every e-mail they received from their mentored students: “I was so glad that you made an effort and replied to my e-mails.” Even when the mentors did not get a response from their mentored students, they conveyed their feelings using a first-person pronoun, for example:
<disp-quote>
<p>I miss you! I got used to receiving a quick response from you! I am just kidding, of course you don’t have to reply so quick . . . I am just curious to know how you are, is everything ok?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, during this phase, the successful mentors attached files and links of amusing Web sites. The mentored students who had difficulty in expressive written communication skills (e.g., misspellings) also expressed their feelings by using emoticons, such as a smiley face, a wink, and a heart.</p>
<p>Whereas the successful pairs began to build their relationships and to express their feelings, five of the six unsuccessful pairs revealed little knowledge of how to build an online relationship via text-based communication. For instance, a male mentor did not seem to know how to make contact with his mentored students. First, he suggested communicating by online application, such as ICQ or MSN Messenger (instant messaging programs used primarily for text-based, synchronous communication over the Internet), before an initial contact was established. He did not develop a conversation to motivate the mentored students. Furthermore, the mentor ignored a mentored student’s questions and disclosure of personal information. When the mentored student asked, “Where did you find the animation you sent me in the first e-mail? Can I ask you what disability, impairment you have? I would like to tell you a little about myself, I don’t live with my parents,” the mentor replied, “I study engineering and computer sciences, master degree :-) What do you study?” In general, we found that responding specifically to the mentored students’ questions was a critical step toward the development of trust and openness.</p>
<p>An interesting exceptional or “outlier” case involved one of the six unsuccessful pairs who seemed to have a good start. We refer to this case as the “exceptional pair” when reporting results for all phases of the program. During this phase, both the mentor and the mentored student coordinated expectations, disclosed personal information, and responded to each other’s questions and comments. It led the mentored student to disclose her learning difficulty: “By the way, I might have a few misspellings, so I hope it won’t be too difficult for you to understand my e-mails.” The mentor responded as a successful mentor commonly would, i.e., she expressed empathy and tried to guide her mentored student: “Anyway, I also have misspellings but you know what, there is an option of checking and repairing misspellings (at the top of the screen there is a blue V with the letters ‘abc’).”</p>
<p>In this regard, it is important to note that this mentor tutored another mentored student who did complete the program. We return to the exceptional pair in subsequent sections below. To summarize, we found a different pattern related to the establishment of an e-mentoring relationship in the electronic correspondence of the unsuccessful pairs compared to the successful pairs. The unsuccessful pairs communicated at a less frequent pace and did not disclose personal information. Another difference between the two types of pairs was the unresponsiveness of the unsuccessful mentors to the mentored students’ questions and comments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732312469115">
<title>The Second Phase: Moderated Communication</title>
<p>The unsuccessful pairs continued their pattern of less frequent communication. In some cases the mentored students were enthusiastic to start the correspondence but the mentors did not reply: “I would like to start the correspondence with you. I am waiting for your response” “Why don’t you send me e-mails anymore? Where are you? I sent you many e-mails and you don’t reply so if you can, send me a response.” In other cases, the mentored students did not reply to the mentors. Most of the unsuccessful mentors, furthermore, responded to their mentored students’ lack of collaboration with criticism and the use of primarily second-person pronouns in a tone that could be read as accusatory: “You were the one who asked to conduct a meeting but now you don’t reply to my e-mails. Are you still interested?” “I don’t know why you don’t reply at all. Is there a special reason?” Two other pairs of the six unsuccessful pairs ended the relationship during this phase, when the mentors decided to withdraw from the program.</p>
<p>The unsuccessful mentors seemed to perceive the e-mentoring relationship as an instructional process, as indicated in a message sent by a mentor to his mentored student: “Is there anything I can help you with, via the Internet? Maybe searching information for you or helping you in homework?” The mentor offered his academic assistance, but the mentored student expected to have a more social, emotional, and two-way relationship: “So far I don’t need any help but I would like to know if you need my help.”</p>
<p>The unsuccessful mentors treated mentorship as unidirectional and did not accept help from their mentored students. They also continued to ignore some of the mentored students’ messages. For example, a mentored student sent a message to his mentor asking him indirectly about his disability. When the mentored student failed to get a response, he decided to ask again by sending a direct message: “I would like to know what your disability is.” Finally, the mentor replied but did not disclose his disability: “I don’t think it is the right time to tell you about it, maybe later.” He continued by criticizing the mentored student’s lack of collaboration: “I don’t know how to create a good atmosphere of discussion between us. You don’t reply to any of my questions and don’t write anything about you.” After this response, they exchanged a few short messages and then the mentored student stopped writing.</p>
<p>In contrast, the successful pairs continued to communicate twice a week, as required. The mentors motivated their mentored students to respond through reflection and using a first-person pronoun: “I so miss your e-mails . . . I feel good when an e-mail is waiting for me” “You didn’t write me all week. What a pity I very much like getting your e-mails. I hope that everything is ok with you.” They also used a technique of indirect discussion to motivate the mentored students to disclose personal information, including their disability. For instance, a mentor wrote to her mentored student, “You wrote me that you don’t like parties. I also don’t like parties because dancing is pretty difficult for me—I have a problem in my legs and I get tired quickly.” The mentored student responded, “I also have a problem in my foot, I don’t like to dance at all, in the past I even fell down the stairs.”</p>
<p>The successful mentors used other encouraging strategies, such as using picture communication symbols, being attentive to the mentored students’ communication needs and abilities (online chat), and initiating creative activities that motivated the mentored students to collaborate:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have been thinking how we can get to know each other better and I would like to suggest playing a game. In each e-mail we will ask each other one question and then we will respond to it and ask a new question. I will start.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another successful strategy was using a conversational style rather than a distant tone. Successful mentors wrote about their daily life and used a lot of punctuation in their messages (such as, exclamation points, question marks, and ellipses) as indicated in a mentor’s message: “Right now I am at the university, I have a two-hour break and I am so hungry!!! I fantasize of eating flat bread with Falafel [an Israeli food].” The pairs also integrated humor in their messages: “I am so tired today that when I ate cereal, I almost put water in the bowl instead of milk (yuckkk).” Some of the mentored students also used humor: “Don’t worry, X [mentor’s name], it is utter nonsense, are you kidding?” One of the mentors described this banter on the postevaluation questionnaire: “The correspondence was on daily issues but we were also laughing, sharing small things that bothered us as well as made us happy and joking.”</p>
<p>The exceptional pair from the first phase (one of the six unsuccessful pairs) seemed to deepen their relationship in this phase, especially after the mentor and the mentored student discussed their respective disabilities. The mentored student was the one who raised this question: “May I ask what disability you have? Is it a congenital condition?” This mentor collaborated and disclosed her disability:
<disp-quote>
<p>No problem, it is not a congenital condition, I got it a few years ago. I had a brain tumor and the surgery resulted in a disability, for example I have problems with my balance, I have paralysis on the ride side of the face, I have difficulties in memory and understanding, and so forth. The important thing is that I am healthy now and I study, I go on with my life. I think that if you start thinking “Oh, I am miserable, why did it happen to me,” then it would be very hard dealing with it and moving on.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As in the case of the successful pairs, the openness of the mentor motivated the mentored student to disclose her disability and feelings:
<disp-quote>
<p>You are right about our difficulties of participating in various activities. It is sad sometimes. I experience it also, many times I want to go outside and hang out but I have a mobility difficulty so I find other things to do at home, I paint or read books. I am really proud of your ability to move on, succeed, and study despite your difficulty. I am glad to know you deeply and I feel that I have a new friend that I can tell my personal things to. I hope you feel the same ☺.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To summarize, during this phase the unsuccessful mentors perceived the e-mentoring relationship more as an instructional and unidirectional process and continued to overlook the mentored students’ expressed needs. In contrast, the successful pairs deepened their relationships by attentive and responsive communication. The mentors engaged their mentored students in online activities using a conversational and supportive style.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049732312469115">
<title>The Third Phase: Online Activities</title>
<p>Three of the six unsuccessful pairs had ended the e-mentoring relationship in the previous phases. The other three pairs ended the relationship during this phase. One female mentor suddenly stopped writing, although her mentored students continued sending messages. This mentor did not send a closure message to her mentored students. Another male mentor also decided to withdraw from the program but sent a closure message to his mentored student:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have to leave the program but it is not because of you, it is a personal issue. It was nice corresponding with you. I learned a lot from our conversations. I wish you good luck in your future and may your dreams come true.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The exceptional pair, who had begun to develop a good relationship during the previous phases, also ended the relationship in this phase. The mentored student decided to end the relationship after the first face-to-face meeting. At the end of the previous phase, the pair met face-to-face for the first time. Then, the mentored student tried to develop a conversation about her face-to-face experience but, for whatever reason, the mentor failed to respond to her questions. Finally, the mentored student sent a closure message: “I prefer not meeting you at all because I think we should disconnect our relationship because it is hard for me. I am sorry but this is the situation and I can’t continue. I really appreciate you.”</p>
<p>The mentored student talked with her teacher and disclosed that the precipitant for her decision to end the relationship was seeing the disability of the mentor and realizing she wanted a nondisabled mentor. After the mentor talked with the teacher and coordinator, she understood the decision of the mentored student and sent a closure message disclosing her feelings and supporting the mentored student’s decision:
<disp-quote>
<p>I accept (sad) your decision because I am sure you gave it a lot of thought and it was not a simple decision for you. I just want to tell you that if you decide to talk to me in the future, not necessarily on a regular basis, even if just writing without a response, just saying what you think and feel, you are always welcome to do it. I am here and you have my e-mail address. I wish you a good and happy future.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nonetheless, she was disappointed, as expressed in her response to the postevaluation questionnaire: “I have tried to make her [the mentored student] disclose herself, sometimes it worked but at the end I have figured out that it was not enough.”</p>
<p>As opposed to the unsuccessful pairs, the successful pairs grew closer in this phase, and they shared feelings and difficulties. In accordance with the ideal of a reciprocal relationship, the mentors disclosed their personal experiences even more, as indicated in a mentor’s message:
<disp-quote>
<p>Everything is fine with me although today I am a little bit angry… I hate that people tell me that I am wrong when I know that I am right (they told me that I didn’t send the right form) and sometimes people don’t know my exact hearing degree … You met me and you know that I speak naturally but I can’t hear like everyone and people think that I do, although they know that I hear only in one ear and it is possible when I use a hearing aid and the other ear is absolutely “impaired”… I know it is hard to remember it, maybe because I speak naturally… but sometimes it is frustrating.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The personal self-disclosure of the mentor motivated the mentored student to provide support as well. In response to the above message, the mentored student wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think you should use a hearing aid because a) it will be easier for you and b) people will see it so they will be more patient with you and they will talk louder and it will make it easier for both sides.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The other two successful pairs had to develop their relationship. The mentors facilitated the relationships by using encouraging strategies to draw the mentored students out. They initiated new online activities which were authentic and related to daily experiences. For example, a mentor initiated an activity and presented it as a personal favor rather than as a task:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have a personal request. I need your assistance in completing a task. Would you agree? I need to create a dictionary for children. I need to find words starting with the letter A. I have already found some words such as … [the mentor wrote words in Hebrew] but I need your help finding more words. Would you please send me words starting with A?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It seemed that the online activities motivated the mentored students to collaborate. The encouraging strategies led to active participation of the mentored students, i.e., they began to initiate questions:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have a dilemma. Next Saturday I have two events in two different places. Both are good but I have to choose where I would like to go. Have you had such a situation that you had to choose between two things?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The increasing participation of the mentored students positively influenced the level of enjoyment and satisfaction of the mentors, as indicated in the responses to the postevaluation questionnaire: “I enjoyed when he [the mentored student] began to write more intensively and I felt the relationship was important for him and he expressed responsibility.” To summarize, in this phase the remaining unsuccessful pairs ended their relationships as a result of developments in the previous phases. In contrast, the successful pairs strengthened their relationships through online activities. They also sustained their relationships until the end of the program.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732312469115" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We investigated in depth the negative experiences of six mentoring pairs (mentor and mentored student) with disabilities who withdrew from an e-mentoring program and compared them to three exemplary pairs with disabilities who successfully completed the program. We focused on the differences between unsuccessful and successful relationships to reach a better understanding of the preconditions to successful e-mentoring. Although unsuccessful experiences might be imagined as the opposite of successful experiences, an empirical study was needed to explore and confirm this. To our knowledge, to date, only one researcher has addressed this issue from the perspective of young adult mentors and mentored adolescents who withdrew from a mentoring program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312469115">Spencer, 2007</xref>). Spencer explored a face-to-face mentoring program. Our study is the first to address the issue of unsuccessful experiences in the context of an e-mentoring program. In addition, our study is the first to address the issue of unsuccessful experiences in the context of disability.</p>
<p>Through qualitative thematic analysis of electronic correspondence and a postevaluation questionnaire, we discovered divergent dynamics of the e-mentoring process associated with unsuccessful and successful outcomes. Our findings support findings of previous research indicating that gender, age, and disability type do not critically influence the mentoring process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312469115">Beyene, Anglin, Sanchez, &amp; Ballou, 2002</xref>). However, when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312469115">Smith-Jentsch, Scielzo, Yarbroug, and Rosopa (2008)</xref> compared the impact on peer mentoring of different modalities (face-to-face vs. electronic chat), they found that electronic chat was more effective for those with women mentors. Their finding, in view of the fact that most of the successful pairs in our study were led by women mentors, might suggest a link between the mentor’s gender and the success of e-mentoring relationships.</p>
<p>The findings of the present study also revealed different communication patterns in the two groups (unsuccessful and successful). The unsuccessful pairs experienced communication infrequencies, whereas the successful pairs communicated on a frequent basis. As indicated in previous mentoring studies, frequent contact has been found to be a major component in the process and has been strongly associated with positive youth outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312469115">DuBois, Holloway, Valentine, &amp; Cooper, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312469115">Jekielek, Moore, Hair, &amp; Scarupa, 2002</xref>). In online environments, individuals who conduct text-based communication can feel present through frequent contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312469115">Bierema &amp; Meriam, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312469115">DiRenzo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312469115">Ensher et al., 2003</xref>). Time delay, especially during asynchronous communication, can promote frequent contact by providing time to read, think, and reflect before submitting the electronic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312469115">Rochlen, Zack, &amp; Speyer, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>At the same time, however, response delays might increase anxiety, especially in an exchange in a developmental e-mentoring program that should be based on trust. When the mentored individuals or the mentors do not receive a timely response, they might wonder about the meaning of unexplained delays, which is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312469115">Suler (2002)</xref> called the “Black Hole Phenomenon.” This phenomenon might lead to anxiety and accompanying angry feelings, and finally to termination of the relationship. In a situation of communication delay, the responsiveness of the mentor seems to predict the continuation of the online relationship. In our study, the relationships led by mentors who responded to their mentored students’ lack of response with criticism and an accusatory tone were terminated at early phases of the program. The relationships led by mentors who provided ongoing positive feedback were sustained until the end of the program.</p>
<p>The unsuccessful mentors used a more formal style and distant tone. Although the program coordinator had provided training and support, it seemed that the unsuccessful mentors did not know how to develop an e-mentoring relationship. As indicated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312469115">Rhodes et al. (2006)</xref>, not all people succeed in developing an online relationship. In their research, either the mentor or the mentored individual was uncertain how best to use the online format, and so the contacts never moved beyond brief superficial exchanges. The researchers concluded that e-mentoring relationships should be built around a specific focus or some topics of discussion, as done in the present study through online activities developed primarily by the successful mentors.</p>
<p>As opposed to the unsuccessful pairs, the successful mentors used a conversational style (including emoticons, slang, nicknames, and humor), asked direct questions, and attached files and links of Web sites. Creativity was a major characteristic of a successful e-mentor. In face-to-face mentoring programs, the communication usually occurs naturally during academic and social activities, such as helping with homework, playing cards and board games, playing outside, watching movies, and attending community events. The mentored individuals are engaged in the program through tangible activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312469115">DuBois et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312469115">Grineski, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312469115">Thompson &amp; Kelly-Vance, 2001</xref>). In e-mentoring programs, the participants have to invest more effort to develop communication that is based primarily on text, with fewer visual or vocal cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312469115">Leh, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312469115">Spencer (2007)</xref>, who explored face-to-face mentoring relationship failures, found that the mentored individuals’ lack of motivation might be a barrier to success. The findings of the present study emphasize the need for recruiting creative mentors who are able to motivate the mentored individuals through online activities.</p>
<p>The above difference in the dynamics of the two groups (unsuccessful and successful) might be partially explained by the participants’ perceptions of the e-mentoring process. It seemed that in the successful pairs, both the mentors and mentored students perceived e-mentoring as a two-way developmental and supportive process, whereas the unsuccessful pairs, especially the unsuccessful mentors, perceived it as a unidirectional and instrumental process. As found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312469115">Beyene et al. (2002)</xref>, relational mutuality is an important component of success in any mentoring program. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312469115">O’Neill, Asgari, and Dong (2011)</xref> additionally noted that the development of relational mutuality requires a process of trade-offs between mentored individuals’ satisfaction or perceived success and the intended outcomes. They found that e-mentoring demands a working understanding of how the various parts of the program interact. Our findings support the trade-off perspective based on mutual and attentive communication. The mentors and the mentored individuals have to perceive their roles as active participants. Accordingly, they have to adapt their online communication to the other’s needs and abilities, especially when the participants are people with a wide range of disabilities.</p>
<p>The difference in the communication styles between the two groups might also be partially related to the educational or vocational background of the mentors. As indicated in the results (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732312469115">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049732312469115">2</xref>), the unsuccessful mentors specialized primarily in humanities and science disciplines, whereas the successful mentors specialized in therapeutic disciplines. The mentor’s educational or vocational background might play a vital role in developmental e-mentoring programs, which focus on social and emotional support, personal development, and empowerment of the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312469115">Morrow &amp; Styles, 1995</xref>). Few researchers have explored the influence of the mentor’s characteristics on the mentoring outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312469115">Sánchez, Esparza, &amp; Colón, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312469115">DuBois and Silverthorn (2005)</xref> found that mentors with backgrounds in helping professions (teacher/guidance counselor; minister/priest/rabbi; doctor/therapist/social worker) might have a relative advantage in promoting educational, vocational, and health outcomes. A meta-analysis that focused on the effects of mentoring programs on youth provided additional support for the benefits of having a mentor with prior experience and success in helping roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312469115">DuBois et al., 2002</xref>). Our findings suggest that the mentors’ background characteristics might be critical to success in an online environment where communication is based primarily on text and includes few verbal communication cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312469115">Barnes, 2003</xref>). The link between the mentors’ background characteristics and the outcomes of an e-mentoring program should be further explored.</p>
<p>The above findings support the e-mentoring literature by pointing out basic strategies that counter negative dynamics and are, therefore, essential to success. These strategies include sustaining a frequent pace of communication, mutuality, trust, and responsive and emphatic communication. In addition, supplementary face-to-face meetings contributed positively to the relationships of the successful pairs, as also supported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312469115">Liang &amp; Grossman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312469115">Seeger, 2007</xref>). This might lead to the conclusion that a successful e-mentoring program should be “computer-mediated communication primary,” as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312469115">Ensher et al. (2003)</xref>. In this type of program, the majority of mentoring interactions (i.e., more than 50%) are conducted online but can also be supplemented by other media tools, such as synchronous online communication, with the aid of audio tools (microphone), video tools (webcam), or face-to-face interactions. Adding visual and vocal components to the online communication might be valuable for youth with disabilities who are more likely to experience social isolation compared to nondisabled youth, and so might need to experience the presence of the other person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312469115">Parkyn &amp; Coveney, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312469115">Pottie &amp; Sumarah, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312469115">Whitehouse, Durkin, Jaquet, &amp; Ziatas, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A previous study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312469115">Shpigelman et al. (2009)</xref> provided additional support for this conclusion. “Live” communication (synchronous online communication and/or face-to-face meetings) in which mentors and mentored individuals with disabilities achieved a sense of presence seemed to contribute to online bonds. Our present findings suggest, however, that this might occur only when participants have achieved some level of self-awareness and acceptance of self with disability. The discussion of disability in the electronic correspondence highlighted the difference in communication style between the unsuccessful and successful groups. Both groups perceived disability as a private issue, but only the successful pairs deeply discussed it. Participants seemed to need a strong bond before they were able to open up and share information about disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312469115">Keller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312469115">Parra, DuBois, Neville, &amp; Pugh-Lilly, 2002</xref>). As soon as the successful mentors established a strong bond with their mentored students, they raised disability as a topic using a sensitive strategy, i.e., they discussed it through other issues (e.g., the inability to dance at parties).</p>
<p>In contrast, the unsuccessful mentors either chose to ignore the mentored students’ questions related to disability or introduced their disability in terse and distant format. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312469115">Eby et al. (2000)</xref>, distancing behavior, i.e., when the mentor neglects or intentionally excludes the mentored individual from important events, or is perceived as not having time for the mentored individual, might lead to the termination of the mentoring relationship. Regarding the issue of disability, scholars and researchers have found that sharing a similarity (disability) as well as the “invisibility” of the disability in an online environment allows people to feel more comfortable talking about their problems and needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312469115">Cole, Nolan, Seko, Mancuso, &amp; Ospina, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312469115">Høybye, Johansen, &amp; Tjørnhøj-Thomsen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312469115">Liang &amp; Grossman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312469115">Seeger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312469115">Vilhauer, Mcclintock, &amp; Matthews, 2010</xref>). Our findings support the literature and indicate that online relationships have considerable potential to empower youth with disabilities.</p>
<p>Although the successful pairs seemed to perceive their similarity (disability) as an advantage, matching pairs on the basis of disability might trigger complex dynamics that have not been adequately studied. If not addressed, these complexities could affect the completion of the program. In the case of the exceptional unsuccessful pair, for example, the mentored student experienced difficulty when the disability of her mentor became visible. This finding, viewed in conjunction with the unwillingness of another unsuccessful mentor to disclose his disability, raises the issue of disability identity. Particularly, it raises a question about the readiness of a person with a disability to participate in developmental e-mentoring programs that require high levels of self-disclosure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312469115">Joinson, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732312469115">Watson (2002)</xref> interviewed 28 disabled people about their self-identity and found that the majority rejected a description of themselves as “disabled people,” meaning that although they had an impairment, they did not perceive themselves as different from nondisabled people. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312469115">Gill (1997)</xref> expanded this discussion and described four steps of integration in disability identity development. The fourth type, “coming out,” refers to the internal conflict between self and the ideal image we wish to present to others. This conflict might be reflected in early steps, when people with disabilities might feel uncomfortable associating with disabled peers.</p>
<p>In our study, the mentored student of the exceptional pair might have been in an early step in disability identity development; i.e., she was categorized as a “disabled pupil” who studied at a special education school but wanted to be integrated into society by having a nondisabled mentor, as observed by the coordinator. This exceptional case emphasizes the importance of considering how much a mentored individual embraces a positive disability identity when assigning a mentor. Youth with disabilities who have developed a positive disability identity, or are in advanced steps of the process, as in the case of the successful pairs, can use the potential of e-mentoring to enhance their personal growth. These youths would be more open to disclosing personal information, to sharing experiences, and to asking for advice from mentors with disabilities, and in return would be empowered by the process.</p>
<p>To summarize, we encountered two of the five distinct types of negative experiences found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312469115">Eby et al. (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312469115">Spencer (2007)</xref> in face-to-face mentoring programs: lack of mentor experience and distancing behavior. These two negative experiences can apparently contribute to termination of e-mentoring relationships. In addition to what we might predict from the literature, however, our findings suggest that the shared experience of disability interacts with mentoring dynamics in interesting, complex ways. Young students and their slightly older mentors are still figuring out the place and importance of disability in their identities. This process could intensify the impact of negative mentoring experiences. Distant or delayed responses, lack of personal engagement, and failure to take and give emotional support might feel all the more disturbing when a participant is trying to share something as fraught with social consequences as having a disability. Furthermore, ambivalence about one’s own disability complicates one’s feelings about bonding with a mentor or mentored student with a disability.</p>
<p>Our findings reveal three components that are especially critical in a developmental e-mentoring process for youth with disabilities:</p>
<list id="list3-1049732312469115" list-type="order"><list-item><p>The mentor’s characteristics: Having prior experience and success in helping roles and text-based communication which might foster the use of a warm, conversational communication style, and a creative approach to engaging the mentored individuals in the process (e.g., through innovative online activities);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Occasional real-time or “live” communication that includes synchronous online communication and/or face-to-face meetings to enhance the sense of connection; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Disability identity encompassing self-awareness and acceptance of self and others with disability.</p></list-item></list>
<p>By examining the dynamics of unsuccessful e-mentoring relationships, the present study contributes to our understanding of preconditions for successful e-mentoring programs aimed at youth with disabilities. Attending to negative online experiences can be enlightening; however, exploration of conditions for success is needed. As noted above, the link between the mentor’s characteristics (including gender and academic/vocational background) and the success of e-mentoring should be examined in the future. In addition, future research should include quantitative as well as qualitative measures, such as questionnaires that measure outcomes and perceptions of the e-mentoring process.</p>
<p>Researchers should also examine the experiences of the average pairs, i.e., the pairs that do not fit neatly into the category of “unsuccessful” or “successful,” to illuminate nuances of the dynamics leading to success. Finally, our study did not include a nondisability comparison group because the e-mentoring program was initiated for youth with disabilities. In the future, it might be informative to explore similarities and differences in the experiences of youth with disabilities compared to youth without disabilities during an e-mentoring process. Such data can enhance general knowledge about the interpersonal dynamics of e-mentoring and can yield additional information applicable to improving the effectiveness of e-mentoring for young people with disabilities.</p>
