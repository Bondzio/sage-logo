<p>Jadwiga E. Pieper Mooney’s work is a rich historical account of reproductive politics in twentieth-century Chile, with special focus on the capital of Santiago. The author highlights class divisions and gender alliances, contradictions between ideologies proclaiming the sanctity of motherhood and family and the resulting policies that limit women’s lives, and the many instances of women’s agency that culminate in the transformation of the meanings of womanhood.</p>
<p>Chapter one, “Public Health, Managed Motherhood, and Patriarchy in a Modernizing Nation,” covers the first half of the twentieth century. Industrialization exacerbated gender hierarchies by narrowly defining women as the mothers of Chilean citizen-workers and restricting women to the domestic sphere. The material deprivation of poor women and their children gained national attention as physicians claimed medical expertise—and with it political power—over the problem of “unfit motherhood,” the alleged cause of poor maternal health and high infant mortality. Middle-class women mobilized to rehabilitate poor mothers and surveil their compliance with state initiatives. Policymakers ignored the structural causes of women’s poverty or the relevance of contraception and abortion for women’s health while various groups of women strove to defend or challenge pro-natalist discourses.</p>
<p>In chapter two, “Local Agency, Changed Global Paradigms, and the Burden of Motherhood,” Pieper Mooney traces Chile’s shift from pro-natalism to a focus on population control from the 1930s through the 1960s. Unsafe abortions created an epidemic of maternal mortality and prompted uniquely Chilean “pro-life” policies focused on saving women’s lives. Influenced by international population control paradigms, Chilean physicians seized on contraception as the solution to maternal mortality and uncontrolled fertility, which allegedly threatened Chile’s modernization. Maternal mortality decreased, but family planning remained under the control of researchers and practitioners, who exploited Chilean women by administering contraception without consent and limited contraceptive choices.</p>
<p>Chapter three, “Planning Motherhood under Christian Democracy,” analyzes ongoing population concerns from 1964 through 1970 under the Christian Democratic government that prompted alliances between physicians, politicians, and the Chilean clergy to institutionalize family planning. Strikingly, while the Catholic Church officially condemned contraception, Chilean bishops accepted it as the only possible alternative to abortion in the Chilean context. Authorities continued to frame family planning as a tool for preserving the family and Chilean society, while women’s sexuality remained shackled to motherhood and marriage.</p>
<p>Inconsistencies in women’s status under Allende’s socialist Unidad Popular government from 1970 to 1973 is the focus of chapter four, “Gendered Citizenship Rights on the Peaceful Road to Socialism.” Right-wing opposition to Allende proclaimed essentialist ideas about women-as-mothers while leftist Allende supporters focused on class inequality and ignored gender inequities or compartmentalized them as “women’s issues.” The government restricted access to family planning without regard for women’s needs when officials grew suspicious of international influences over Chilean family planning agencies during the Cold War. Paradoxically, conservative women simultaneously legitimated public, politicized motherhood with their efforts to overthrow Allende through protests such as the March of Empty Pots and Pans.</p>
<p>In chapter five, “From Mothers’ Rights to Women’s Rights in a Nation under Siege,” Pieper Mooney chronicles the emergence of “subversive motherhood” under Pinochet’s dictatorship from 1973 to 1990. Women claimed to fulfill gendered responsibilities to their families by publicly mobilizing against the dictatorship’s brutality. In doing so, they dramatically expanded the concept of motherhood by demanding rights that went beyond their family roles and changing discourse from one of mother’s rights to that of women’s rights. Significantly, women mobilized across class lines in their efforts toward redemocratization.</p>
<p>Chapter six, “International Encounters and Women’s Empowerment under Dictatorship and Redemocratization” and the Postscript follow women’s mobilization from the Pinochet dictatorship through the election of Michelle Bachelet, Chile’s first woman President, in 2006. Chilean women at home and those exiled abroad created powerful international networks with other feminists across “First World”–”Third World” divides and used their international connections to promote changes within Chile. While Pieper Mooney is careful to illuminate women’s agency throughout the volume, chapters five and six comprise an especially compelling account of women’s mobilization in extraordinarily difficult contexts and across significant social divisions.</p>
<p>The only real shortcoming of the book is the lack of an explicit discussion of methodology. The bibliography reveals the depth and breadth of Pieper Mooney’s sources, including original data collection, newspapers, films, periodicals, government reports, and academic sources, but the absence of a detailed discussion of her fieldwork and interviews and how these were combined with secondary data sources will leave some readers frustrated. Additional quotes and more direct engagement with the interview data would have also been welcome. Nonetheless, this is a well-written, detailed account of twentieth-century Chile that also makes a substantial contribution to the fields of women’s history, gender politics, reproductive politics, and globalization.</p>
