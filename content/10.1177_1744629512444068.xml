<p>Health inequities arise from the societal conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age, referred to as social determinants of health. (Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health, 2011)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>On 21 October last year in Rio de Janeiro, the UK (along with other member states of the UN) agreed and signed the Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744629512444068">World Health Organization, 2011</xref>). In signing this declaration, the UK affirmed that ‘health inequities within and between countries are politically, socially and economically unacceptable, as well as unfair and largely avoidable’ and pledged to ‘develop policies that are inclusive and take account of the needs of the entire population <italic>with specific attention to vulnerable groups</italic>’ (emphasis added).</p>
<p>While the state parties could not agree on a list of who is included in the category of ‘vulnerable groups’, it is absolutely clear that in the UK and elsewhere people with intellectual disabilities experience stark inequalities in their health, dying prematurely and being at risk of a wide range of physical and mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744629512444068">Emerson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744629512444068">Glover and Ayub, 2010</xref>; World Health Organization and World Bank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744629512444068">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>So, what needs to be done? A good starting place is to consider the implications of the three overarching recommendations of the final report of the WHO special commission on addressing the social determinants of health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744629512444068">World Health Organization, 2008</xref>):</p>

</list-item>
</list>
<p>To <italic>improve the daily living conditions</italic> of people with intellectual disabilities we will need to act on such fronts as: breaking the pervasive and enduring link between child poverty and intellectual disability; ending the ridicule, bullying, abuse and victimization of people with intellectual disabilities in our communities; and ending the exclusion of people with intellectual disabilities from roles and activities which our societies value (e.g. employment, parenthood). Progress on these areas would also help to <italic>tackle the inequitable distribution of power, money and resources</italic>. But here we also need to make much greater progress on sharing the power that underlies policy development and implementation with people with intellectual disabilities. </p>
<p>The emphasis on needing to <italic>measure and understand the problem and assess the impact of action</italic> should come as music to the ears of all who are involved with the <italic>Journal of Intellectual Disabilities</italic>. After all, isn’t that what our journals are fundamentally about? It would be nice to think so, but I fear the reality is somewhat different. First, as in many other areas of health and social research, our research endeavours have systematically neglected the majority of people with intellectual disabilities, those who live in the world’s low and middle income countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744629512444068">Emerson et al., 2012</xref>). Second, the focus of our research is all too often dominated (often implicitly) by models that pay no more than lip service to the importance of the wider context in which ‘people are born, grow, live, work and age’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744629512444068">Emerson et al., 2006</xref>). Where is the research that really helps us to understand the ways in which poverty, social exclusion, ridicule, bullying, abuse and the victimization of people with intellectual disabilities shape their health and well-being? More importantly, where is the research that provides evidence of how to either reduce the risks of exposure to such pervasive adversities or counteract their effects?</p>
<p>You may have noticed that none of the three overarching recommendations are about providing better health care. This is not to say that improving access to timely and effective health care is not relevant, far from it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744629512444068">Disability Rights Commission, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744629512444068">Mencap, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744629512444068">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744629512444068">Michael, 2008</xref>; World Health Organization and World Bank, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744629512444068">2011</xref>). Rather, it takes us to one of the mantras of the health inequalities movement: <italic>why treat people without changing what makes them sick?</italic>
