<p>This article seeks to understand the relation between form and content of biblical passages, focusing especially on the word ‭םימאות‬, ‘twins’. First, the six attestations of the word occur in pairs in the books of Genesis, Exodus and the Song of Songs. Second, they are highlighted through linguistic devices that in themselves have affinity with duality: geminates, alliteration and (numerical) paronomasia. Moreover, the number ‘two’ occurs in all texts and is evoked through the use of its homophone ‭ינש‬, ‘scarlet’, and through duplication of words. Thus, it is suggested that the language of biblical passages including the ‘twin’ word exteriorizes and emphasizes the twin concept by means of devices that mimic the twinning formally.</p>

<p>Previous studies on twins in the Hebrew Bible have pointed out the ambiguous nature of the concept, which incorporates the opposites of love and hatred, union and rivalry. It has been proposed that the latter element of conflict often prevails over harmony in the case of biblical twins—contrary to other ancient Near Eastern pairs that are presented as an inseparable unit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309089212466470">1</xref></sup> While the existing scholarship mainly focuses on the concept and content of the biblical twin, this article will connect these findings with the formal level of biblical text using the word ‭םימאﬨﬨ‬, ‘twins’. It will show that the neighboring language formally emphasizes and externalizes the duality of the twin content. First, I will briefly introduce the six sections of text and their immediate context in which twins are mentioned. Then I will discuss their form and its possible implications for the meaning of the units.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0309089212466470">2</xref></sup> In conclusion, I will formulate an answer to the question: How and in what way does the language matter in passages talking about and using the word ‘twins’?</p>
<sec id="sec1-0309089212466470">
<title>Six Pairs: Twins in the Hebrew Bible</title>
<p>While the Hebrew Bible overflows with brother pairs, the twins among them are rare.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0309089212466470">3</xref></sup> The mentioning of them as twins is even scarcer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0309089212466470">4</xref></sup> Esau and Jacob are twins according to Gen. 25.24—however, only once are they named as such. Elsewhere their relationship is expressed in terms of brotherhood, not distinguishing it from ordinary siblings.</p>
<p>The six attestations of ‭םימאﬨﬨ‬ in the Hebrew Bible appear in pairs: two in Genesis (Gen. 25.24; 38.26), two in Exodus (Exod. 26.24; 36.29) and two in the Song of Songs (Song 4.5; 7.4). Each of the pairs deals with a different kind of twins. In Genesis the twins are human; in Exodus, they are inanimate (one usage of the word is talking about double beams of the Tabernacle); and in the Song of Songs, the twins are animals as a metaphor for human body parts. Furthermore, there is a considerable amount of material between the occurrences of ‭םימאﬨﬨ‬ in the respective books, meaning that the occurrences belong to different stories or parts of the story.</p>
<p>In the book of Genesis the word ‭םימאﬨﬨ‬ occurs for the first time at the birth of Esau and Jacob. As was the case with Sara, Rebecca too was initially barren.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0309089212466470">5</xref></sup> When pregnant at last, things do not go unnoticed. The unborn babies are struggling in her womb, leading Rebecca to invoke the Lord.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0309089212466470">6</xref></sup> He gives an oracle-like answer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0309089212466470">7</xref></sup> Immediately afterwards the pregnancy ends and twins are born.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0309089212466470">8</xref></sup> The first and second of the pair are described and given a name: Esau—redhead; and Jacob—heel grasper (Gen. 25.25–26). It is not until ch. 38 that the second pair of twins is mentioned: Perez and Zerah, sons of Tamar and Judah. They are born after their mother had taken the seed that lawfully was hers. Judah, initially unaware of the fact that his daughter-in-law was carrying his children, was planning on punishing her for her adultery. When he realizes that he and not she is the wrong-doer, the confession is sealed with the birth of their sons (Gen. 38.13–30). While Jacob overtakes Esau later on in life, Perez does not postpone matters but already takes the firstborn place during birth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0309089212466470">9</xref></sup> In both stories the pregnancies are preceded by a time of waiting and uncertainty—the family line and thus God's promise is at stake. While the male characters sit on the fence, the female characters take the lead. Rebecca invokes God, hoping he will help her; Tamar undertakes action herself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0309089212466470">10</xref></sup> The newborn twins intensify in both stories the sibling rivalry that recurs in many of the patriarchal narratives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0309089212466470">11</xref></sup> Their strife has prenatal roots.</p>
<p>Another pair of pairs occurs in the book of Exodus, in chs. 26 and 36.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0309089212466470">12</xref></sup> In the former, God gives direction to build the Tabernacle. The ‘twin’ word occurs when describing the beams on top that should be coupled like twins. The passage is technical, with many numbers and measures. In ch. 36 the passage is repeated almost literally when the Israelites actually build the Tabernacle following the instructions as given by God to Moses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0309089212466470">13</xref></sup> This connection between command and execution has also been found in other biblical and extra-biblical accounts of temple building. Hurowitz states that</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>this seemingly monotonous, repetitious section is not just a superfluous description and listing of the parts of the Tabernacle; rather, it is a step-by-step account of the entire construction process: fabrication, inspection, assembly and furnishing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0309089212466470">14</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This account is necessarily closely related to the command given, as noted by Walter Houston and Brevard S. Childs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0309089212466470">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The word ‭םימאﬨﬨ‬ is used, finally, in the Song of Songs. In Song of Songs 4 the male character is describing his beloved, comparing her body parts to various elements from the environment. Not the eyes or the hands but the breasts are seen as twins, more specifically twin calves of the roe. The path followed in his description is one that starts at the top of the body and ends at the bottom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0309089212466470">16</xref></sup> In Song of Songs 7 the opposite direction is followed. Again we come across the twin breasts. The verses are identical except for the addition in Song 4.5 of the words ‘which feed among the lilies’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0309089212466470">17</xref></sup> Scott Noegel and Gary Rendsburg discuss the verses as a pair that ‘attunes the listener's ear to the nuances of the text’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0309089212466470">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The use of the word ‭םימאﬨﬨ‬ in the three books mentioned shows some differences besides the remarkable similarities that will be discussed later on. The human twin in Genesis, as is the case in other ancient Near Eastern stories, introduces the concept of rivalry as well as of brotherhood. The twins hate and love each other at the same time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0309089212466470">19</xref></sup> When the word is used in its metaphorical sense the element of strife disappears. The doubling of the beams of the Tabernacle stands for a firm construction with solid joints. The same counts for the breasts of the beloved that are in perfect harmony. In these cases the root underlying the noun seems to connect with the paronomastically related root ‭םמﬨ‬, ‘to be complete’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0309089212466470">20</xref></sup></p>

<title>Twisting and Twirling Twins</title>
<p>In what follows, the focus will be on the form of the text of the passages and the question of whether it is meaningful.</p>
<p>First, there is the fact that the word ‭םיםוﬨ‬ appears pairwise in three books of the Hebrew Bible. The most obvious connection can be found in the book of Exodus. In the first passage God gives instructions to build the Tabernacle; in the second passage these are repeated during the implementation. The two passages relate to one another as the parts of a parallelism in which there is structural and semantic correspondence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0309089212466470">21</xref></sup> In the Song of Songs the two attestations also show close affinity. There is again a semantic overlap; however, structurally a chiasm is used. The initial order of description from top to bottom has been reversed. The birth of the twin brothers in Genesis is related as well. The exact wording differs more than in the case of the metaphorical examples, but the circumstances and motives of a leading female character, brotherly strife and reversal are present in both. Therefore, we can rightfully consider the two passages a pair as well. By doubling the passages in which the word ‘twin’ is used, emphasis is put on these passages in general and more specifically on the twins mentioned in them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0309089212466470">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Secondly, the passages use three devices that add to the emphasis on the twins: geminates, alliterations, and (numerical) paronomasia.</p>
<p>Before continuing, I would like to make an observation about the distinction between the consonant as letter and as sound with regard to the above-mentioned features. While in ancient civilizations such as that of the Greco-Roman world or the ancient Near East an alliterative effect was primarily meant as aural, one cannot exclude the visual aspect as soon as the text was written down.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0309089212466470">23</xref></sup> Therefore, the alliteration works visually as well. For Biblical Hebrew this is of importance with regard to its use of <italic>matres lectionis.</italic> That these were considered meaningful can be seen in rabbinical commentaries that do discuss the choice for either <italic>scriptio plena</italic> or <italic>defectiva</italic>, of which I will give examples later on.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0309089212466470">
<title>Genesis 25 and 38</title>
<p>In Gen. 25.22–25 the twins Esau and Jacob are born:</p>
<disp-quote>

</fig>
<p>And the children crashed into each other in her and she said: ‘If it is so, why is it that I?’ and she went to ask the L<sc>ord</sc>. And the L<sc>ord</sc> said to her: ‘Two people are in your womb and two nations shall be separated from your innards and one nation will be stronger than the other nation and old will serve young’. And when her days to give birth were full, behold, twins in her womb. And the first came out red all over like a garment of hair and they called his name Esau.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Verse 22 opens with the geminate form ‭וצצﬢﬨיו‬, ‘and they crashed’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0309089212466470">24</xref></sup> The plural confirms that Rebecca is pregnant with twins. The action of bumping into each other is further emphasized by the use of the fricative ‭ו‬. Just as the sound is formed by a friction, a collision of phonemes in language, so the boys collide and will collide into each other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0309089212466470">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>In what follows no more ‘real’ geminates occur, that is, as defined by grammar in terms of root consonants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0309089212466470">26</xref></sup> However, a remarkable pile up of alliterations is used, in which the repeated consonants occur inside a single word and not, as usual, in successive words.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0309089212466470">27</xref></sup> Although the new feature does not fit the grammatical definition of geminates, it at least seems to mimic the geminate form.</p>
<p>The alliteration might explain the exceptional spelling of ‭םייג‬ in the <sc>mt</sc> instead of ‭םיוג‬. The variant, as it appears here, is not present elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0309089212466470">28</xref></sup> Being surrounded by other forms with similar characteristics, such as ‭םיםאﬨל‬, ‭ﬢיﬠממ‬, ‭םאלמ‬, ‭ﬨוﬨי‬, ‭דוטבבו‬, it supports the hypothesis that the author deliberately chose words and combinations in which two identical consonants occurred. Rather than a scribal error we might have to deal with a remarkable linguistic feature that in itself highlights something else. The repetition of signs reaches its climax in v. 24, in which all words contain a repeated consonant. Although not all of them have retained their consonantal value and thus can be heard, the gemination fully works on the visual level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0309089212466470">29</xref></sup> It also works on the semantic level; it is exactly in v. 24 that the twins Esau and Jacob are born. This observation concerning alliteration concurs with Scott Noegel and Wilfred Watson's suggestion with regard to geminates that ‘the device [i.e. geminate clustering] may function to denote reiterated action (e.g. Ps 12:7) or multiplicity of object (e.g. Isa 7:19)’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0309089212466470">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the second passage in Genesis, Gen. 38.26–29, no geminate roots occur. In the verse of the birth itself, v. 27, a high number of alliterations can be found. Some of them are audible; all of them are visually perceptible:</p>
<disp-quote>
<fig id="fig2-0309089212466470" position="float">
<graphic alt-version="no" position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_0309089212466470-fig2.tif" xlink:type="simple"/>
</fig>
<p>And it was at the time of her birth-giving, and behold, twins in her womb. And it was when she gave birth and he put out a hand and the midwife took and bound around his hand a red thread, saying, ‘This one came out first’.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In comparison to Genesis 25, the pair in Genesis 38 gets less emphasis through alliteration. Jacob and Esau are indeed primary characters in the book of Genesis and for many chapters their life is the main focus of the book. Moreover, besides their unity, conflict is far more present in their lives than in that of the later twins.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0309089212466470">31</xref></sup> According to Rashi and other rabbinical sources, the brothers Perez and Zerah, born in Genesis 38, are both righteous, hence the <italic>scriptio plena</italic>, while in the case of Jacob and Esau only one was, as the defective writing shows.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0309089212466470">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to the true geminate and a geminated kind of alliteration, a third and last formal element draws attention to the passages in Genesis. In Gen. 25.23 the word ‭ינש‬, ‘two’, is mentioned twice, the first time right before ‭םייג‬ and the second time between ‭דנטבב‬ and ‭םיםאל‬. The repetition of what turns out to be the key concept of the passage, twinning, is in itself meaningful. However, it is only part of what the form ‭יוש‬ accomplishes in the text. Its double occurrence attracts attention, to make us aware of the possibility of more sophisticated wordplay.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0309089212466470">33</xref></sup> In order fully to understand this, one has to read the birth of Esau and Jacob together with the other twin birth in Genesis, that of Perez and Zerah.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0309089212466470">34</xref></sup> In Gen. 38.28 the form ‭יוש‬, ‘red (thread)’, recalls the double mentioning of ‭יוש‬, ‘two’, in Gen. 25.23. The numerical paronomasia is supported by the use of the word ‭חושאד‬ in the same verse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0309089212466470">35</xref></sup> The word also occurs in Gen. 25.25. Moreover, the red thread is indeed bound upon the hand of the second son, as this paronomasia suggests, even though he put out his hand first. Also in the case of Jacob and Esau, Esau came out first, but Jacob will twice take his place as firstborn son—showing that brotherly strife is inherent to twin births.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0309089212466470">36</xref></sup> This idea is not unique to the Hebrew Bible, as a closer look at the role of twins in the ancient Near East reveals. As Victor Matthews notices, ‘twins came into the world not only bringing twice the life of a single birth, but also the death brought on by sibling rivalry’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0309089212466470">37</xref></sup> The ancient literature has brought forth many stories featuring two brothers, often but not necessarily twins, in conflict.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0309089212466470">38</xref></sup> According to Raymond Kuntzmann in his work on twins in the ancient Near East,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>the record of a twin birth has become an element of language, a symbol, a structural component of the text. This is undoubtedly the primary function of the twin symbolism to present interchangeable characters because they are issued from the same broken unity, yet different.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0309089212466470">39</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This assumption renders it more plausible that various devices based on repetition of consonants occur to support and highlight the meaning of the text. While the twin concept allows the telling of a double tale which develops on two different and often opposite tracks, the above-mentioned formal features underscore this by means of gemination of consonants, words and meaning.</p>

<title>Exodus 26 and 36</title>
<p>In Exod. 26.24 and 36.29 the building of the Tabernacle is described:</p>
<disp-quote>
<fig id="fig3-0309089212466470" position="float">
<graphic alt-version="no" position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_0309089212466470-fig3.tif" xlink:type="simple"/>
</fig>
<p>And they shall be twins from downwards and together they will be complete above the head of it into one ring; thus shall it be for them both, for the two corners they will be. (Exod. 26.24)</p>
<fig id="fig4-0309089212466470" position="float">
<graphic alt-version="no" position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_0309089212466470-fig4.tif" xlink:type="simple"/>
</fig>
<p>And they shall be twins from downwards and together they will be complete to the head of it into one ring; thus he did to them both, for the two corners. (Exod. 36.29)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Neither of these passages consists of geminate forms. However, alliterations occur within the word boundaries as well as across them, as was the case in the Genesis fragments. The most frequently repeated consonants are ‭ו‬, ‭י‬, ‭ש‬, ‭ח‬ and ‭ט‬. Notice that the consonants of the ‘twin’ word are among them. In the case of the ‭ו‬ the alliteration only works on the visual level since some of them are <italic>matres lectionis.</italic> Besides the ‘twin’ word in a dissimilar spelling, two words differ in each half of the verses. In each half the verbs differ in aspect. The imperfect is used for the command while the execution is expressed in the perfect tense.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0309089212466470">40</xref></sup> In the second half the verb ‭חיח‬ has been replaced by a form of ‭חשע‬. Other minor differences are a change in preposition and an additional suffix or verb. This feature has been called <italic>polyprosopon</italic> by Noegel and Rendsburg.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0309089212466470">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, the word ‘two’ occurs once in Exodus 26, and two times in Exodus 36. The ‘twin’ word appears twice in each verse.</p>
<p>Before turning to the numerical paronomasia that occurs in the larger context of Exodus 26 and 36, I want to draw attention to a paronomasia in the verses themselves. The words ‭םיםאﬨ‬ and ‭םיםﬨ‬ show such close resemblance that they are more than mere alliteration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0309089212466470">42</xref></sup> They create an impression of an etymological relationship connecting twins with completeness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0309089212466470">43</xref></sup> The hasty reader would mistakenly see two twins in the verses.</p>
<p>The numerical paronomasia occurs in the larger context. In Exod. 26.1, 26.31 and 26.36 the word ‭ינש‬, ‘scarlet’, is used to describe the color of the curtain of the Tabernacle. Also in Exod. 36.8, 36.35 and 36.37 this word occurs. In combination with ‭ינש‬, ‘two’, which appears in Exod. 26.19, 21, and 26 and Exod. 36.24, 26 and 30 (twice), ‘scarlet’ forms a wordplay on the number ‘two’. Notice that these are exactly the same words that generate the paronomasia in Genesis between the two parts of the pair. The feature in Exodus is slightly different, having the full wordplay in both parts rather than as a connection between the separate parts.</p>
<p>To conclude, the order of describing the building of the Tabernacle has been reversed in the second passage. Instead of going from furnishings (Exod. 25) to the structure of the Ark (Exod. 26), the actual construction starts with the structure (Exod. 36) to end with the furnishings (Exod. 37). Nahum Sarna has interpreted this in the following way:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>By presenting the building of the Ark first, the former injunctions highlight the symbol of the covenant as the focal point of the entire enterprise and place it at the apex of a hierarchy of values. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0309089212466470">44</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This element of reversal is reminiscent of the struggle of the twin brothers in Genesis who try to reverse the order of birth. In the case of Jacob and Esau, this is only realized later on in life, whereas Perez takes the lead already during birth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0309089212466470">45</xref></sup> In Exodus the reversal happens between the A and B part of the pair; in Genesis an additional reversal is located in each part of the pair, that is, one twin brother changes places with the other twin brother.</p>

<p>Your two breasts are like two young deer, twins of a gazelle. (Song 7.4)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In ch. 4 geminate roots are used in the proximity of the ‘twin’ word: in v. 5 the word ‭םיםשוש‬, in v. 6 the word ‭םיללע‬. In ch. 7, the geminate roots occur in v. 3 with ‭ךווש‬ and again ‭םיםשוש‬. These words alliterate due to their grammatical structure. They add up to manifold alliterations elsewhere in the verses. The first three words of both Song 4.5 and 7.4 share the consonants ‭ש‬ and ‭י‬. Notice that the ‭ש‬ sound occurs in all of the geminates as well, except for one where another sibilant, the ‭ע‬, is used.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0309089212466470">46</xref></sup> In two cases the sibilant even is the double consonant. Furthermore, as was the case in the other examples, the word ‘two’ appears here as well, twice in each verse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0309089212466470">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>The numerical paronomasia involving the number ‘two’ is built on the words ‭ינש‬, ‘two’, ‭וינש‬, ‘your teeth’, ‭ינש‬, ‘scarlet’, and ‭םינשוש‬, ‘lilies’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0309089212466470">48</xref></sup> In Song 4.3 the scarlet meaning is used. Also, the form of ‭וש‬, ‘tooth’, occurring in Song 4.2 forms a numerical paronomasia with these words.</p>
<p>The third element evoking a connection with the number two is ‭םיושוש‬, ‘lilies’, in Song 4.5. Two remarks can be made based on these observations. First, it is obvious that the linguistic possibilities to play upon the form ‭ינש‬ and upon the theme of twinning are explored extensively in this passage, beyond what one finds in the prosaic passages of Genesis and Exodus. We can ascribe this to the genre of poetry that tends to densify language and its features.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0309089212466470">49</xref></sup> Second, the passage in Song of Songs 4 shows that the paronomasia on the number ‘two’ could be and has been achieved with words other than ‭ינש‬, ‘scarlet’. This makes the consistent use of the word in the six passages under discussion less of a necessity but more of a deliberate choice.</p>
<p>In Song of Songs 7 a shorter version of the verse in Song of Songs 4 has been repeated. The ‭םיושוש‬, ‘lilies’, are now mentioned before instead of after the metaphor of the breasts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0309089212466470">50</xref></sup> As such the geminates, alliteration and numerical paronomasia are retained. The word ‭ינש‬, ‘scarlet’, does not occur in the passage. Instead the ‘ivory tower’, ‭ךשחלדזם‬, recalls the number ‘two’ as well as the homophonous teeth mentioned in Song of Songs 4. Both are white—the tower and the teeth—the latter having previously been contrasted with the red of the lips. As a result, though absent, the word ‭ינש‬, ‘scarlet’, is here understood as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0309089212466470">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>As was the case in the previous examples, reversal is apparent in the Song passages as well. While in Song of Songs 4 the body of the beloved is described top to bottom, this description is reversed in Song of Songs 7. The reversal only takes place between the A and B part of the pair, not among the twins in each of the parts.</p>

<title>Crimson Couples: The Coining of Twins and Color</title>
<p>It is remarkable that every time the word ‭םיםאוח‬ occurs a numerical paronomasia on the number two can be found in its proximity. Even more striking is the fact that the word ‭ינש‬, ‘scarlet’, is used every time as well, notwithstanding the possibility of paronomastic alternatives such as ‭ןש‬, ‘tooth’, or a form of ‭ינש‬, ‘different’.</p>
<p>The consonantal form ‭ינש‬ is used 205 times throughout the Hebrew Bible, of which 25 are vocalized as ‭ינש‬, ‘scarlet’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0309089212466470">52</xref></sup> Out of these, eight occur in passages where the word ‭םיםאוח‬ is used as well. In the remaining passages without twins in the book of Exodus and in Num. 4.8, one describes the curtains of the Tabernacle as was the case in Exodus 26 and 36. The example in 2 Samuel occurs in the lament of David after Jonathan's death. Although they are not twins, they are a famous pair willing to be joined like the beams of the Ark and the breasts of the beloved but destined to be separated by conflict like the twin brothers in Genesis. The last occurrence of ‭ינש‬ fits the marital metaphor that spans the first chapters of Jeremiah. The adulterous wife and her beauty are spurned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0309089212466470">53</xref></sup> The passage shares thematic concerns with the discussed units of the Song of Songs. While the latter praises the love of two people, the former forms the negative counterpart depicting a failing marriage. Again, the idea of twoness is present in the story.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0309089212466470">
<title>Do ‘Twins’ Matter?</title>
<p>Summing up, all occurrences of the word ‭םיםאוח‬ come along with play on the number ‘two’. The most obvious way to do so is through use of the number itself. In addition, differences and similarities in the verse and between the verse and its counterpart in the same book highlight the twoness by their occurrence in pairs. Moreover, in all verses or their close proximity geminate forms (except for the Exodus example), alliterations and (numerical) paronomasia occur. In the case of numerical paronomasia, the words ‭ינש‬, ‘two’, and ‭ינש‬, ‘scarlet’, are used in all passages, as such combining the rare word ‭םיםאוח‬, its near synonym ‭ינש‬, ‘two’, and the latter's homophone ‭ינש‬, ‘scarlet’. Thus, an affirmative answer can be given to the question of whether the language matters in the biblical sections using the word ‭םיםאוח‬, since it reveals a deliberate formal accentuation of the semantics of the twin concept.</p>

None of the Dead Sea Scroll fragments includes this passage so that it is not clear which reading should be preferred. However, two elements are in favor of the form with double ‭י‬. First, there is the general acknowledgment that the Masoretic text of Genesis preserves an old tradition predating any of the other Hebrew and non-Hebrew textual witnesses, including the Septuagint and Samaritan Pentateuch (Gordon Wenham, <italic>Genesis 1–15</italic> [WBC, 1; Nashville, TN: Thomas Nelson, 1987], pp. xxiv-xxv; James VanderKam and Peter Flint, <italic>The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls: Their Significance for Understanding the Bible, Judaism, Jesus and Christianity</italic> [San Francisco: Harper San Francisco, 2002], pp. 104–105). Second, later commentators such as Rashi base their interpretation on the ‭כיחכ‬ form of the word. Rashi vocalizes the word differently reading ‭םייג‬ also ‭םיאג‬, which would refer to Antoninus and Judah ha-Nasi, ‘lofty ones’. While the interpretation itself is not of much help with regards to the birth of Jacob and Esau, the fact that Rashi starts from a form with double ‭י‬ is (Rashi on Gen. 25.23).</p></fn>

However, in Gen. 25 the intended order firstborn (Esau)-second born (Jacob) remains after birth, at least for a while, whereas in Gen. 38 the intended order first (Zerah)-second (Perez) is reversed into second born (Perez)-firstborn (Zerah).</p></fn>

Similar sounds also create a connection, for example, sibilants or voiced versus voiceless. Noegel and Rendsburg add the criterion of phonology, which eliminates Casanowicz' alliteration of ‭צ‬ and ‭א‬ (Casanowicz, ‘Paronomasia in the Old Testament’, pp. 105–69, and <italic>Paronomasia in the Old Testament</italic> [Boston: Nowood, 1894]; Noegel and Rendsburg, <italic>Solomon's Vineyard</italic>, pp. 66–67).</p></fn>

He concludes that ‘the tautology reinforces the duality of breasts, of twins; ‘two” as an underlying motif in the sentence. By an odd regress, it is reflected in the structure: a twofold repetition of two: “Your <italic>two</italic> breasts like <italic>two</italic> fawns…” (Francis Landy, <italic>Paradoxes of Paradise: Identity and Difference in the Song of Songs</italic> [Bible and Literature, 7; Sheffield: Almond Press, 1983], pp. 92–93).</p></fn>

While his argument is built on structural correspondence between words in the verses, the current article defends a correlation beyond or perhaps despite structure. Each of the above-mentioned words emphasizes the idea of twinning through paronomasia and regardless of their correlation with the word ‭ינש‬, ‘two’ (Landy, <italic>Paradoxes of Paradise</italic>, pp. 94–95).</p></fn>

In light of the reversal of order it also makes sense that the lilies now precede the breasts (Murphy, <italic>Song of Songs</italic>, p. 182; Assis, <italic>Flashes of Fire</italic>, p. 209).</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn51-0309089212466470"><label>51.</label><p>Such an implied paronomasia comes close to Hunt's subtle or concealed paronomasia in which a third word not mentioned connects two other words. This word is a homophone of one of the words in the text and a synonym of another. In this particular example the feature is built on three homophones: the expressed ‭ןש‬, ‘ivory’, and ‭ינש‬, ‘two’, and the suppressed ‭ינש‬, ‘scarlet’. Moreover, the ivory tower of Song 7 and the teeth of Song 4 are metonymically linked through their color. It is exactly this aspect that evokes the unmentioned color (the ‘synonymic' part in the construction) and the homophone of the number ‘two’ (Patrick Hunt, <italic>Poetry in the Song of Songs: A Literary Analysis</italic> [Studies in Biblical Literature, 96; New York: Peter Lang, 2008], pp. 53–54).</p></fn>
