<abstract>
<p><italic>Background</italic>: Traditionally, energy requirements have been calculated using predictive equations. These methods have failed to calculate energy expenditure accurately. Routine indirect calorimetry has been suggested, but this method is technically demanding and costly. This study aimed to develop a new predictive equation to estimate energy requirements for critically ill children. <italic>Methods</italic>: This prospective, observational study on ventilated children included patients with an endotracheal tube leak of &lt;10% and fractional inspired oxygen of &lt;60%. An indirect calorimetry energy expenditure measurement was performed and polynomial regression analysis was used to develop new predictive equations. The new formulas were then compared with existing prediction equations. <italic>Results</italic>: Data from 369 measurements were included in the formula design. Only weight and diagnosis influenced energy expenditure significantly. Three formulas (A, B, C) with an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.8 were developed. When we compared the new formulas with commonly used equations (Schofield, Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization/United Nations University, and White equation), all formulas performed very similar, but the Schofield equation seemed to have the lowest SD. <italic>Conclusions</italic>: All 3 new pediatric intensive care unit equations have <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values of &gt;0.8; however, the Schofield equation still performed better than other predictive methods in predicting energy expenditure in these patients. Still, none of the predictive equations, including the new equations, predicted energy expenditure within a clinically accepted range, and further research is required, particularly for patients outside the technical scope of indirect calorimetry.</p>

<p>Protein energy malnutrition (PEM) is common in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612448479">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612448479"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612448479">3</xref></sup> Even at the time of hospital admission, a significant proportion (24%) of critically ill children have acute or chronic PEM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612448479">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612448479">4</xref></sup> The effects include increased morbidity and length of hospital stay due to impaired muscle strength,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612448479">5</xref></sup> reduced wound healing as a result of altered immunity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612448479">2</xref></sup> and augmented rates of sepsis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612448479">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612448479">7</xref></sup> Although undernutrition is more common in ventilated critically ill children, the risk of overfeeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612448479">8</xref></sup> has also been well documented. Providing excess nutrients, especially carbohydrates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612448479">9</xref></sup> may lead to increased carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) production, which may result in difficulties weaning from mechanical ventilation. In addition, increased lipogenesis related to overfeeding may alter body composition, and diarrhea from nutrient excess may be associated with electrolyte imbalances.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612448479">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612448479">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612448479">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Traditionally, energy requirements are calculated using predictive equations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612448479">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612448479">13</xref></sup> However, these methods fail to calculate energy expenditure within acceptable accuracy, leading to the over- or underprediction of energy requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612448479">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612448479">15</xref></sup> Consequently, a measurement of energy expenditure remains the most accurate method of calculating resting energy expenditure. Indirect calorimetry is often used for this purpose in pediatrics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612448479">16</xref></sup> However, this method is technically demanding, time-consuming, and costly, and the interpretation of measurement output can be difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612448479">17</xref></sup> A recent survey showed that only 17% of PICUs in Europe had access to indirect calorimeter equipment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612448479">18</xref></sup> and hence its routine use is not feasible for most units.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612448479">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533612448479"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533612448479">20</xref></sup> The problems with the current predictive equations and the lack of availability of indirect calorimetry are likely to result in continued under- or overfeeding in many critically ill children, with the associated morbidity. We therefore set out to develop a new predictive equation to estimate energy requirements for ventilated critically ill children and compare its accuracy with previously published equations.</p>
<sec id="section1-0884533612448479" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A prospective, observational study was performed from May 2005 to August 2008 on critically ill children admitted to the PICUs at Imperial College Healthcare National Health Service (NHS) Trust and Royal Brompton Hospital NHS Trust. These units specialize in children with cardiac disorders, infectious diseases, respiratory failure, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Because these 2 PICUs do not admit patients with liver disease, additional energy expenditure data were obtained from collaborators at Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust London who had also prospectively collected energy expenditure data using the same methodology, instrument and the same variable data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533612448479">21</xref></sup> The second stage of this study was to compare the new formula with commonly used predictive equations in a cohort of patients admitted to the PICUs at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and the Royal Brompton Hospital. Local ethics approval has been obtained for this study.</p>
<p>The same inclusion and exclusion criteria were used for measurements performed in all 3 PICUs: all ventilated critically ill children (full-term delivery to 16 years) were eligible for inclusion, except for children on bolus enteral feeds (increases thermic effect of food), on renal replacement therapy, with an endotracheal tube leak (ETT-leak) of more than 10% [(inspired tidal volume – expired tidal volume/inspired tidal volume) × 100], with a fractional inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) level above 0.6, and ventilated with heliox, nitric oxide, or high-frequency oscillatory ventilation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533612448479">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533612448479"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0884533612448479">24</xref></sup> In addition, those children who were eligible for inclusion but did not achieve steady state and/or had incomplete data sets were also excluded from the final data analysis.</p>
<p>Information that was included in this study and data analysis were chosen from variables included in several previously published pediatric and adult energy expenditure equations for intensive care, including the Ireton-Jones equation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533612448479">25</xref></sup> and formulas by White et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533612448479">26</xref></sup> and Pierro et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0884533612448479">27</xref></sup> In addition, factors in which previous data on their impact on energy expenditure had been ambiguous were also included. Patient information on age, gender, and admission weight was collected and weight-for-age <italic>z</italic> scores calculated. If it was not possible to obtain an accurate admission weight, the last weight in the patients’ growth charts, which are compulsory for all children in the NHS in the United Kingdom, was used. Supine length/height was not included as a variable in this study because of the difficulty in measuring this accurately on an intensive care unit. For the purpose of data analysis, age was categorized into the same 3 categories as the Schofield equation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0884533612448479">28</xref></sup>): &lt;3 years (category 1), 3–10 years (category 2), and 11–18 years (category 3). The day of admission was documented and patients’ primary diagnosis was recorded and then categorized into multiorgan system failure (MOSF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0884533612448479">29</xref></sup> using the criteria from Goldstein et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0884533612448479">29</xref></sup> or single-organ failure, which included respiratory, cardiac, central nervous system (CNS), gastrointestinal, surgical, and liver failure. The single-organ failure categories were generated from the Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network in the United Kingdom, and patients were categorized according to the predominant diagnostic reason for being admitted onto the PICU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0884533612448479">30</xref></sup> The Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) score was used as a marker of severity of illness and was calculated for the day of measurement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0884533612448479">31</xref></sup> Axillary temperature was measured during the energy expenditure measurement and categorized into 3 categories: temp 1, ≤37.3°C; temp 2, 37.4°C–38.4°C; and temp 3, ≥38.4°C. In addition the presence of medication related to sedation, neuromuscular blockade, and inotropic support was also documented.</p>
<p>Measurements were performed using the Deltatrac II NMN-200 (Datex Ohmeda, Helsinki, Finland) indirect calorimeter, which has previously been validated in critically ill children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0884533612448479">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533612448479">33</xref></sup> The Deltatrac II was calibrated at the start of the study, using the quantitative alcohol-burning process, and repeated 6 monthly. Prior to each measurement, the Deltatrac II was warmed up for 30 minutes, and gas sensor calibration was performed using the recommended gas mixture from Datex Ohmeda (5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% O<sub>2</sub>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0884533612448479">34</xref></sup> Energy expenditure data were recorded only after steady state had been achieved, which was defined by 5 consecutive 1-minute measurements with ≤10% variation in volume of inspired oxygen (VO<sub>2</sub>) and volume of expired carbon dioxide (VCO<sub>2</sub>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0884533612448479">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0884533612448479"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0884533612448479">37</xref></sup> Thirty minutes of energy expenditure measurements were then carried for each patient, once in steady state. During the collection of energy expenditure data, no invasive procedures or ventilator setting changes took place unless clinically indicated. If procedures had to be performed during a measurement, the energy expenditure data were discarded.</p>
<p>Statistical software SPSS 17.0 (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, IL) and Epi Info Version 3.3.2 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA) were used to analyze the data for the study. Polynomial regression analysis was used to establish the impact of individual variables on energy expenditure and to develop the new predictive equation. Variables were included or excluded from the final model based on whether the variable on its own or in combination with another variable had a significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) impact on energy expenditure. Type III sum-of-squares method was used because this statistical method corresponds to the variation attributable to an effect after correcting for any other effects in the model. Although the data from the 3 centers were analyzed together, we also assessed whether the regression analysis was biased, with the inclusion of the data from the third center (Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust London), by comparing the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value from the 2 centers with the 3 centers. This center also contributed the majority of repeated measurements, and we used the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value to assess whether the repeated measurements had an impact on the prediction model. We aimed to develop a formula that would predict energy expenditure accurately in 80% of cases (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.8). The <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value (coefficient of determination) of the new formula was compared with the values from the Schofield, World Health Organization (WHO), and White equations. Statistical significance, where quoted, is at a 5% level (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05), and other results are presented in means, confidence intervals (CIs), and standard deviations (SD). To determine the limits of agreement between the new predictive formulas, existing equations, and measured energy expenditure (MEE), the method described by Bland and Altman was used; in addition, percentiles of relative differences between the predictive formulas and MEE were also calculated.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Data for 175 patients with 369 energy expenditure measurements were included in the design of the formulas. From the 175 patients, 56 had repeated measurements and originated mainly from the data from Kings College Hospital NHS Trust. The above number of recruited patients excludes the 23 children who were enrolled in the study but for whom steady state was not achieved, and 7 children did not have a complete data set, which was mainly due to unavailable blood results and Glasgow Coma Scale required for the PELOD score. In total, 175 patients were included in the final analysis: 100 from Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, 21 from the Brompton Hospital, and 54 from the Kings College Hospital database. Patient characteristics are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612448479">Table 1</xref>. The majority of patients had a respiratory or central nervous system diagnosis. Because of the small number of patients with an admission diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease (n = 3), this group was excluded from data analysis as this number was insufficient to yield significant information on the impact of gastrointestinal disease as a diagnosis on energy expenditure. The majority of measurements (n = 166, 45%) were performed in patients younger than 3 years, 88 measurements (23.8%) were performed in children aged 3–10 years, and 115 (31.2%) were performed in 11- to 18-year-olds. In 28% (n = 49) of children, an accurate admission weight was not obtained, and their last weight from their growth records was recorded. However, this did not significantly affect the results of the study as the exclusion of children without an accurate admission weight yielded a lower <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value (0.814).</p>

<p>Regression analysis indicated that inotropes (<italic>P</italic> = .77), neuromuscular blockade (<italic>P</italic> = .923), temperature (<italic>P</italic> = .133), severity of disease measured by PELOD score (<italic>P</italic> = .794), C-reactive protein (<italic>P</italic> = .604), and the day of measurement (<italic>P</italic> = .976) did not have a significant impact on energy expenditure, and those variables were therefore excluded from further analysis. Three formulas were developed from our data with an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.8 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0884533612448479">Table 2</xref>): formula A (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.833) was developed from the data generated from the PICUs at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and Royal Brompton Hospital NHS Trust.

<p>Energy expenditure measurements were on average performed on day 3 of the PICU admission, and the mean energy expenditure was 41.66 kcal/kg/d.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The objective of this study was to develop a new predictive equation specifically designed for energy expenditure in critically ill children and to compare its accuracy with previously published formulas. Our aim was to achieve a formula with an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value above 0.8, using variables that are routinely used on the PICU. Three equations were developed, including the variables of age and weight, with or without diagnostic categories, and <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values of 0.833 (equation A), 0.839 (equation B), and 0.829 (equation C). At present, only one other predictive equation has been published specifically for ventilated critically ill children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533612448479">26</xref></sup> The formula developed by White et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533612448479">26</xref></sup> was derived from a data set of 100 patients and had an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value of 0.898. In our patient group, the White formula performed less well (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.806). We also compared values for <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> for the Schofield (0.815) and WHO formulas (0.763) with our values for <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of our new predictive equations, which had a better statistical predictive value. Contrary to the limited number of predictive equations developed for ventilated critically ill children, many such equations have been published for ventilated adults. These include the Ireton-Jones, Frankenfield, Swinamer, and Penn-State equations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533612448479">25</xref></sup> The original Ireton-Jones equation, commonly used for ventilated critically ill adults, has a much lower value <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value of 0.43, as do the Swinamer and Frankenfield equations (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.765<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533612448479">38</xref></sup> and <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.77,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0884533612448479">39</xref></sup> respectively). We therefore conclude that our PICU equations have acceptable statistical predictive values when compared with other published formulas.</p>
<p>Predictive models for energy expenditure in critically ill patients have been developed using various independent variables, of which weight and age are the most commonly used. Other independent variables include body surface area, temperature, diagnosis, gender, spontaneous or nonspontaneous breathing, respiratory rate, tidal volume, or heart rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533612448479">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0884533612448479">27</xref></sup> Although inclusion of variables in any predictive equation is mainly driven by statistical analyses, variables often have been excluded from previous predictive formulas due to ambiguity or impracticality. For example, the formula with the highest correlation in the study by White et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533612448479">26</xref></sup> included weight, weight-for-age <italic>z</italic> score, temperature, days on PICU, and diagnostic category. The authors of that study eliminated weight-for-age <italic>z</italic> score because it was not practical to calculate this at the bedside, and their simplified formulas performed just as well without day of admission. Diagnosis was also not included in that formula because of possible ambiguity in defining diagnostic category.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533612448479">26</xref></sup> In our present study, equations A and B, the formulas with the highest <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values, included actual weight and age as variables, in addition to diagnostic category, because our study suggested this as an important contributor to energy expenditure. The only other formulas that include diagnosis as a variable are the Ireton-Jones and Frankenfield equations for ventilated adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0884533612448479">40</xref></sup> These contain a factor for trauma, burns, and sepsis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533612448479">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0884533612448479">40</xref></sup> We also found that severity of disease (<italic>P</italic> = .794) did not affect energy expenditure. This concurs with several previously published studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612448479">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0884533612448479">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0884533612448479">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interestingly, our study did not show an association between the patients’ temperature and the MEE, in contrast to other predictive formulas that have included temperature as an independent variable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533612448479">26</xref></sup> A possible explanation may be the individual maximum level of O<sub>2</sub> consumption, discussed by Turi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612448479">9</xref></sup> and Verhoeven et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0884533612448479">43</xref></sup> normally found in critically ill children; as temperature rises, there is not an equivalent increase in VO<sub>2</sub> and therefore no elevated energy expenditure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0884533612448479">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0884533612448479">45</xref></sup> Recently, McHoney et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0884533612448479">46</xref></sup> found altered intraoperative thermoregulation in children undergoing laparoscopic surgery, which affected resting energy expenditure (REE) 4 hours after the procedure, but no difference was found at 24 hours. Our study included only 8 postsurgical patients, who had both laparoscopic and open procedures and were not measured within 4 hours of the procedure; we would therefore not see this impact on REE. From a practical perspective, the omission of temperature from a predictive formula makes it easier to use since temperature varies during the day, which implies the predictive equation would need to be recalculated as temperature changes.</p>
<p>Our new equations were also compared with the REE predicted by the Schofield, WHO, and White equations in 30 patients. All 3 formulas performed very similar, with both standard deviation and the 95% CI within a comparable range, but the Schofield formula yielded the best results, with a standard deviation of 136.8 kcal/d (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0884533612448479">Table 4</xref>). It is an interesting finding that, according to the Bland-Altman plots, the limits of agreement are better below 1000 kcal, thus implying that the prediction accuracy for the new predictive equation in particular is better for younger children. This is probably related to the majority of our data being generated from children &lt;3 years of age. The equation by White et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533612448479">26</xref></sup> performed the worst and differed by up to 82% from the MEE. Only 25% of patients had a predicted energy expenditure within &lt;10% variation using the different formulas (excluding the White equation), which concurs with a recent systematic review of predictive equations for ventilated adults, which indicated that only 28% of patients had their energy expenditure predicted within 10% of measured requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533612448479">25</xref></sup> None of the equations, including the new equations, predict energy expenditure within acceptable limits of agreement in all patients.</p>
<p>The main limitation of our study is related to the number of patients we recruited in the different age categories to develop our prediction equations. The majority of patient data included came from children younger than 3 years. Although this very much reflects admissions in PICUs in Europe, our formulas have been designed to cover ages 0–18 years. The large number of patients in age category 1 (&lt;3 years) may have biased our formulas toward this age category. Further energy expenditure data are therefore required to be collected in age groups 3–10 and 11–18 years from children with a variety of diagnoses to improve the accuracy of the formulas.</p>
<p>Another limitation is the number and case mix of patients included in our study, comparing the new formulas with existing formulas. Although a larger patient cohort would have allowed us to establish the accuracy of the new formula with greater power, it is noteworthy that other studies have validated similar formulas with a small number of patients (25 patients in White et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533612448479">26</xref></sup> and 13 additional studies on 9 patients in Pierro et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0884533612448479">27</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>The comparison cohort also did not include patients within the liver disease diagnostic category, which may have biased our results in favor of formula A. Further comparison of the performance of the new formulas (especially formulas B and C) should also take place within this group of patients.</p>
<p>Another limitation is related to the technical constraints of indirect calorimetry itself. Patients on renal replacement therapy, those requiring high-frequency oscillation or nitric oxide, and patients with an FiO<sub>2</sub> level above 0.6 were excluded from the study due its impact on indirect calorimeter measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0884533612448479">47</xref></sup> Hemofiltration or high-frequency oscillatory ventilation is often required in children at the more extreme level of disease severity, and patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome frequently have an FiO<sub>2</sub> above 0.6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533612448479">23</xref></sup> Consequently, some children with the worst disease severity were often not enrolled in the study. Arguably, those patients are the most vulnerable and at risk of acute PEM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0884533612448479">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0884533612448479">49</xref></sup> There is very limited research on energy expenditure in patients who are beyond the technical capabilities of indirect calorimetry. Jaksic et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0884533612448479">50</xref></sup> and Keshen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0884533612448479">51</xref></sup> used stable isotopes in critically ill neonates receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and found these patients to be mildly hypermetabolic. Until further studies have taken place, it is important to recognize that our predictive formulas as well as existing equations may not be suitable for patients at the extreme level of disease severity and neither is the commonly recommended method of indirect calorimetry, as these children commonly have ventilatory settings and treatment modalities that render this method as inaccurate. Further research in these vulnerable patients is urgently required.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>All 3 new PICU equations have <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values of &gt;0.8; however, equation A performed better than other predictive methods in predicting energy expenditure in these patients. Still, none of the predictive equations, including the new equations, predicted energy expenditure within a clinically accepted range, and clinicians may choose to use a simpler equation with fewer variables but with similar accuracy. Although this does not change current practice, it does indicate that even when a predictive equation has been generated from a sufficiently powered cohort, this still does not yield a formula with acceptable accuracy, and other methods should be sought, particularly for critically ill children outside the technical remits of indirect calorimetry.</p>
