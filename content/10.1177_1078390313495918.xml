<body>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>As a PhD student, I am always looking for ways to advance my clinical and professional expertise through involvement with professional organizations, including the American Psychiatric Nurses Association (APNA). During my first 2 years as a member, I have been welcomed into the organization and am involved in various work groups to serve APNA and the field of psychiatric nursing. However, I believe APNA should consider adding student members to the <italic>Journal of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association</italic> (<italic>JAPNA</italic>) Editorial Board.</p>
<p>After reviewing more than 44 nursing and health care journals, I found that 40 did not have student editors specifically identified as serving on the journal editorial board. The remaining four journals had research fellows or PhD candidates serving on the editorial boards, but as managing editors instead of article reviewers. Currently, other nursing journals do not have identified student editors, and APNA is positioned to be a leader, not just in the field of psychiatric nursing but as a leader in the initiative to truly grow the nursing profession by continuing to support the future generation of nurse researchers, scholars, and leaders.</p>
<p>Involving nursing students in editing for a journal such as <italic>JAPNA</italic> can also help advance the mission and vision of APNA through inclusivity, collegiality, and innovation. Students who serve on the editorial board will gain valuable hands-on experience in the academic field through involvement in the peer-review process. This experience is particularly valuable for students in doctorate programs because after obtaining their degree, these students will be spending their careers serving on peer-review committees. To ensure that the quality review process is continued in the future, experience working with current expert peer reviewers will be necessary to learn how the process works, develop and improve review and critique skills, and bring a unique perspective to the current review process.</p>
<p>Our colleagues in the field of psychology have included students as editors of academic journals, such as the <italic>Journal of Trauma and Dissociation, Journal of Child Abuse and Neglect, School Psychology, Journal of Interpersonal Violence</italic>, and <italic>Psychological Trauma</italic>. These students get the opportunity to serve their professional organizations while gaining valuable experience working with leadership in their field through learning how best to review submissions for approval in academic journals.</p>
<p>APNA student members, including myself, are very interested in serving our psychiatric nursing community and this would be another opportunity for our organization to be a leader in offering these unique and valuable learning experiences.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
