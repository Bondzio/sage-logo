<sec id="sec1-0265691411428783at"><title>Alexander Statiev, <italic>The Soviet Counterinsurgency in the Western Borderlands</italic>, Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2010; 368 pp., 4 figs, 30 tables; 9780521768337, £55.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>When, in 1944, the Soviets returned to the region acquired in 1939–40 – the Baltic countries as well as formerly Polish and Romanian territories which were incorporated into the USSR – they encountered armed opposition. It took until the 1950s to subdue this challenge.</p>
<p>Soviet counterinsurgency in the Western borderlands was complex and sophisticated, argues this impressive study. Its central pillar was agrarian revolution, flanked by deportation of real or assumed enemies, intelligence gathering, misinformation, covert operations, arrest of sympathizers and search-and-destroy missions to root out resistance cells. Local militias were recruited in an attempt to transform the insurgency into a civil war; amnesties allowed doubters to leave the ranks of the enemy; and the church was drafted into state service as well. Overall, the policy was a success, despite extreme levels of unauthorized violence and the often criminal conduct of security troops.</p>
<p>Not all went smoothly, of course. The Soviets were often their own worst enemies. While the initial agrarian reforms, confiscating land from ‘the rich’ and giving it to ‘the poor’, were meant to bring over ‘class allies’ to the side of the Bolsheviks, the known threat of collectivization fuelled resistance, as it was universally resented by peasants. The blanket repression of rich peasants (or those construed as such) on the assumption that they would be sworn enemies of the Soviet regime, became a self-fulfilling prophecy as it left those targeted little choice but to resist. The unwillingness and inability to bring the security troops’ excesses under control ensured the guerrillas a constant flow of recruits, even from those the Soviets considered ‘class allies’.</p>
<p>It was to the benefit of the occupiers that their main opponents were a match in terms of brutality and ruthlessness. Rather than valiantly opposing the new rulers, most resistance movements focused on ‘soft targets’ (128): ‘The primary activity of the resistance was terror against local residents marked as collaborators’ (123–4). Such behaviour created a situation where the majority of the population was forced to take sides, and many chose the obviously stronger party: the state. Similarly, the vicious search for suspected police agents made Soviet amnesties all the more appealing to rank and file fighters in danger of being killed by their own side.</p>
<p>Statiev’s book is an impressive achievement in the transnational history of Eastern Europe in the prolonged period of violence starting with the First World War and ending only with the pacification after the end of the Second. It demonstrates that the study of this region has reached maturity. His detailed, subtle and complex analysis was possible because he could not only read central Soviet archives located in Moscow but also peruse voluminous source collections assembled since the 1990s. In some sense, this even includes one of his archives – the Peter Potichnyi Collection on Insurgency and Counterinsurgency in Ukraine, held at Toronto. Containing copies from three Ukrainian archives, it allowed him to forgo additional time-consuming research trips.</p>
<p>Statiev made excellent use of this source base to examine the entire Western borderlands in the longer sweep from 1914 to the early 1950s. Rather than the widespread interpretive scheme where ‘the Soviets’ fight ‘the people’, we encounter different groups fighting or collaborating with each other as well as the changing state authorities, while the majority of the population tried to survive. Chapters two to four, which recount the history of the region from 1914 onwards, are an important contribution to a history of violence in Eastern Europe where the Nazis and the Stalinists are not the only actors. Moreover, Statiev also transcends the existing literature which often makes sweeping statements about the entire region based on one case study. Instead, he stresses differences between the countries and sub-regions of this far from uniform part of the world.</p>
<p>Not everybody will like this book. To Baltic, Ukrainian or Polish nationalists, it will be too soft on the Soviets and too unsympathetic to the guerrillas; romantics will find the view of the insurgents galling and the chosen problematic too far on the side of law and order; surviving cold warriors will accuse the author of apologetics for Stalinism while Russian nationalists will find his documentation of Soviet war crimes unbearable. His claim that torture was not always counter-productive but also ‘gave the police an enormous amount of intelligence’ (249) is guaranteed to cause controversy and many will find the constant citing of Kalyvas’s <italic>Logic of Violence in Civil War</italic> too reminiscent of the evocation of other holy scriptures. But such irritations are unavoidable given the political passions surrounding both counterinsurgency in general and the history of Eastern Europe in particular. Nobody working on either topic can afford to miss this stimulating and well-crafted study.</p>
