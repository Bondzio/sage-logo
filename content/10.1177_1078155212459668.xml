<abstract>
<p>Proteinuria is common adverse effect that occurs after the use of bevacizumab, but it occurs rarely during administration of cetuximab. We report the first case of nephrotic syndrome induced by cetuximab after completing mFOLFOX6 with bevacizumab followed by sLV5FU2 with bevacizumab for metastatic rectal cancer. Prior to the administration of cetuximab, the patient had never presented proteinuria. After the completion of the loading (400 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and two subsequent maintenance (250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) infusions of cetuximab, edema of the lower extremities occurred concomitantly with facial acneiform rash. Based on the laboratory data, diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome was made and secondary diseases of nephrotic syndrome were excluded. Oral administration of prednisolone (0.6 mg/kg/day) was initiated, resulting in no response. The trigger of nephrotic syndrome other than cetuximab was not suggested and attention on occurrence of proteinuria must be devoted to this medicine.</p>

<p>Cetuximab, a chimeric monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has been incorporated in treating metastatic colorectal cancer. Its use has caused hypersensitivity reactions and acneiform rash, but it seldom elicits renal toxicities such as <italic>de novo</italic> proteinuria and acute kidney injuries, as demonstrated in many clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212459668">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212459668"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155212459668">3</xref></sup> No reports in the relevant literature describe cetuximab–associated nephrotic syndrome. We report the first case of a patient who developed nephrotic syndrome after administration of cetuximab.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1078155212459668" sec-type="cases"><title>Case report</title>
<p>A 74-year-old man was referred to our hospital in August 2008 for his microcytic anemia (hemoglobin 10.0 g/dL, MCV 73 fL), which was screened by group medical examination. At the first medical examination, he also complained his weight loss by 6.0% during 1 year. Urinalysis revealed no proteinuria and no hematuria. The patient’s prior medical history was remarkable for chronic sinusitis following surgery and benign prostate hypertrophy, which had not been treated with any medication because of absence of symptoms. He did not take any herbal or non-prescribed medications.</p>
<p>He was diagnosed as advanced tumor by colonoscopy and pathologically as invasive moderately well-differentiated rectal adenocarcinoma. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) detected the multiple hepatic metastases. To avoid stricture of rectum, low anterior resection was conducted in September 2008. At this point, his laboratory data including liver and renal function other than hypoalbuminemia (3.7 g/dL) were normal.</p>
<p>Chemotherapy of mFOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenous, leucovorin 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenous on day 1, followed by 5-FU 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> bolus intravenous, 46-h continuous infusion 5-FU 2400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 2 weeks, body surface area: 1.5 m<sup>2</sup>) was initiated. Because a CT scan performed after six cycles of mFOLFOX6 showed no change in the metastatic hepatic tumor size, an additional six cycles of mFOLFOX with 5 mg/kg bevacizumab were administered from January 2009, but this treatment also yielded no response in terms of the tumor size evaluated by CT scan. He continued complaining of hypercryesthesia and hypogeusia, which were caused by oxaliplatin. The regimen of sLV5FU2 (leucovorin 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenous on day 1, followed by 5-FU bolus 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, 46-h continuous infusion 5-FU 2400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 2 weeks) with 5 mg/kg bevacizumab (body weight: 50 kg) was followed from April 2009, which resulted in partial response after completion of 12 cycles. Until January 2011, total of 40 cycles of sLV5FU2 with bevacizumab were given. Serum concentration of carcinogenic embryonic antigen (CEA) and CA19–9 in September 2009 were 4.8 ng/mL and 6.5 U/mL, respectively. Urinalyses conducted in September 2009 and September 2010 showed neither proteinuria nor hematuria. The levels of CEA and CA19–9 increased gradually from September 2009 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078155212459668">Figure 1</xref>). Findings of abdominal CT showed that the metastasis of liver progressed. Additionally, chest CT revealed nodular lesion in left S10 which was metastasis.

<p>No K–<italic>ras</italic> point mutation was found at codon 12 or 13 of the resected sample of his carcinoma. In February 2011, premedication with intravenous 16.5 mg dexamethasone to prevent infusion reaction and 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cetuximab were administered, followed by premedication with intravenous 16.5 mg and dexamethasone 250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cetuximab every week (body surface area: 1.5 m<sup>2</sup>). Before the initiation of cetuximab administration, the serum albumin was 3.9 g/dL and the creatinine level was 0.9 mg/dL. After three doses of cetuximab (total of 900 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), the patient presented with grade 1 facial acneiform rash and edema of the lower extremities. Total administrated dosage of cetuximab was 1150 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. Orally administrated furosemide 20 mg/day and minocycline 100 mg/day were given. His blood pressure was 134/78 mmHg and pulse rate was 65 bpm. His body temperature was 36.8℃. Qualitative proteinuria became 3+, the protein (urine) / creatinine (urine) ratio was 8.92, and serum albumin was 1.3 g/dL, collectively suggesting proteinuria grade 3. His performance status had been kept within grade 1 until cetuximab administration but deteriorated to grade 2 after the symptoms appeared. On admission, complete blood counts and the differential count of leukocyte showed a normal panel: serum albumin 1.0 g/dL, total cholesterol 424 mg/dL, low density cholesterol 322 mg/dL, aspartate amino transferase 54 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 34 U/L, lactic dehydrogenase 300 U/L, total bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL, and creatinine 1.0 mg/dL. Furthermore, results showed serum sodium 138 mEq/L, potassium 5.7 mEq/L, albumin–corrected calcium 10.7 mg/dL, and inorganic phosphate 5.7 mg/dL. Serum complements, C3 189 mg/dL and C4 83 mg/dL, were high. Serum IgG was 523 mg/dL, but IgA and IgM were normal. Hepatitis B antigen and anti–hepatitis C antibody were negative. Serum anti-nuclear antibody and M-protein were negative and glycated hemoglobin A1c was 5.4%. Urinary sediment revealed RBC 1–4/high–power field, hyaline cast 1–9/low–power field, granular cast 20–29/whole field, and epithelial cast 10–19/whole field. Evaluation using ultrasonography showed no renal vein thrombosis. The renal CT did not reveal apparent findings of tumor invasion into renal parenchyma. According to the laboratory data, secondary diseases which can cause nephrotic syndrome such as diabetes mellitus, amyloidosis, and lupus nephritis were quite unlikely. The primary diseases of nephrotic syndrome (including drug-induced) were mostly suspected. The patient did not take the known medicines (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) that can cause nephrotic syndrome. Because of the poor general condition (performance status grade 4), and multiple renal simple cysts in bilateral kidneys, kidney biopsy could not be performed. Urine collection during 24 h revealed protein excretion of 5.44 g/day: a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome was made.</p>
<p>Oral administration of furosemide (80 mg/day) and spironolactone (12.5 mg/day) from mid-March to early May 2011, with infusion of albumin (20 g/day, three successive days) held in mid-March, had no effect on his edema and hypoalbuminemia. The IgG selectivity index (SI) was 0.082 and glomerular diseases with highly selective proteinuria such as minimal change nephropathy and early stage focal segmental glomerulosclerosis were assumed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155212459668">4</xref></sup> Oral administration of 30 mg/day prednisolone for 2 weeks was initiated from the end of March 2011 to expect the remission of nephrotic syndrome. However, the prednisolone dosage was tapered and subsequently discontinued in early May because no response was obtained. Tumor growth progressed as the levels of CEA and CA19-9 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078155212459668">Figure 1</xref>. His nephrotic syndrome continued even after cetuximab cessation. The patient died of cancerous cachexia in late May. Autopsy was not allowed by the family of the deceased.</p>

<p>Nephrotoxicity is an adverse effect of certain anticancer drugs and may result in a variety of functional consequences that include any combination of glomerular or tubular dysfunction, hypertension and disturbance of the renal endocrine function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212459668">5</xref></sup> Some studies suggested that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may be an important regulator of glomerular endothelial cell structure and function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212459668">6</xref></sup> VEGF is expressed in podocytes in the glomerulus, and VEGF receptors are present on endothelial, mesangial, and peritubular capillary cells. It is now clearly established that agents targeting the VEGF pathway induce hypertension and are sometimes related to thrombotic microangiopathy and/or various glomerulopathies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212459668">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212459668">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>EGFR protein, known to be localized in the mesangium of the glomerulus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155212459668">9</xref></sup> has also been found along the glomerular capillary walls, in peritubular capillaries, and within the epithelial cells of distal tubules and collecting ducts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155212459668">10</xref></sup> Recently, acute renal failure and nephrotic syndrome after administration of gefitinib or electrolyte disorders such as hypomagnesemia due to cetuximab or panitumumab were reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078155212459668">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078155212459668"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078155212459668">13</xref></sup> Considering these, it is postulated that EGFR inhibition might affect glomerular filtration of uremic toxins and tubular mineral reabsorptive function and might not disrupt glomerular basement membrane permeability directly.</p>
<p>Of particular interest is that in Japanese phase I (EMR62202–026/CA225–024) clinical trials, proteinuria was noted in 5 cases out of 30.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078155212459668">14</xref></sup> Furthermore, a phase II clinical trial (EMR62202–049/CA225–259) conducted in unresectable progressive or recurrent colorectal cancer revealed grade I/II proteinuria in 14 of 39 cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078155212459668">15</xref></sup> As described previously, proteinuria was not noted in other reported North American or European clinical trials. Some genetic background might be involved in this adverse effect.</p>
<p>Nephrotic syndrome is one of presentations of kidney disease. The term describes the association of proteinuria with peripheral edema, hypoalbuminaemia, and hypercholesterolaemia. Increased glomerular permeability to large molecules is the essential pathological process in nephrotic syndrome of any etiology. Proteinuria causes a fall in serum albumin, and if the liver fails fully to compensate for urinary protein losses by increased albumin synthesis, plasma albumin concentrations decline, leading to edema formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155212459668">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The proteinuria SI may be used to describe changes of glomerular permeability for macromolecules in glomerular diseases. Based on a comparison of the clearance of high-molecular-weight proteins to that of transferrin, the pattern of glomerular proteinuria may be described as either selective or non-selective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078155212459668">17</xref></sup> The protein usually used as the high-weight marker is IgG. Patients with an IgG SI of 0.2 or higher are considered to have a non-selective proteinuria whereas patients with a ratio below 0.2 are considered to have a selective proteinuria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078155212459668">18</xref></sup> In this case, renal diseases whose proteinuria was selective such as minimal change nephrotic syndrome were suspected. However, the possibility of other primary diseases of nephrotic syndrome cannot be completely denied.</p>
<p>In the terminal stage of malignancy diseases, paraneoplastic nephropathy can occur.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078155212459668">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078155212459668">20</xref></sup> The most common association of solid tumors is nephrotic syndrome due to membranous nephropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078155212459668">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078155212459668">22</xref></sup> Tumor-associated antigen, re-expressed fetal antigen, and viral antigen are involved in the pathogenesis of paraneoplastic nephropathy. This case does not correspond to paraneoplastic nephropathy in that no clinical sign of nephropathy was missing before cetuximab administration although tumor expansion had been drastic, as indicated by soaring production of CEA and CA19–9 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078155212459668">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<p>It is reasonable to infer that cetuximab was the trigger for nephropathy. Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale was five points and the relation between cetuximab administration and nephrotic syndrome was probable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078155212459668">23</xref></sup> Regarding that the nephrotic syndrome continued after discontinuation of cetuximab, the pharmacological action of cetuximab might not be the primary factor of nephrotic syndrome. Too long a period occurred after the initiation of bevacizumab to explore the possibility of the delayed adverse effect of bevacizumab.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we experienced a case of nephrotic syndrome subsequent to cetuximab administration. Further accumulation of cases and histological diagnosis of kidney biopsy must be undertaken to elucidate the mechanisms and detailed relation between cetuximab and nephropathy.</p>
