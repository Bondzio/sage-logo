<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The rise of globalization throughout the 1990s called into question the role of nation-states in rapidly internationalizing terrains of culture, economics, and politics. With the economic ascendancy of BRIC – the acronym for the combined influence of Brazil, Russia, India, and China – historically unprecedented numbers of workers were exposed to a global labor market where capital was hungry for relatively untapped sites of investment and exploitation. Beyond the manufacturing landscapes, knowledge and information-intensive industries help define the new global division of work, with services accounting for a majority of foreign direct investment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920512445398">UNCTAD, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the material conditions that prefigure globalization, social institutions like religion, ethnicity, and nationalism are subject to the vicissitudes of governance structures in turmoil. The emergence of the European Union (EU) in 1993 produced questions on whether such large, supranational political institutions could effectively represent, or even manage, a diverse citizenry and mitigate potentially conflicting social, cultural, and economic interests. The current euro crisis underscores the continuity of such debates. Amidst these political challenges, there is a daunting and as yet unresolved crisis that extends beyond all national frontiers, and that is the crisis of ecological destruction.</p>
<p>The three volumes addressed in this review articulate such critical issues – Roland Erne’s <italic>European Unions: Labor’s Quest for a Transnational Democracy</italic> (LQTD); Craig Calhoun and Georgi Derluguian’s edited collection, <italic>The Deepening Crisis: Governance Challenges After Neoliberalism</italic> (DC); and finally, Andrew Ross’s <italic>Nice Work if You Can Get It: Life and Labor in Precarious Times</italic> (LLPT). Together, these distinct yet complementary works unpack political economic and sociological concerns related to labor, employment, politics, war, and the environment in the 21st century, that now take place in the shadow of a worsening economic crisis.</p>
<p>The thread that ties these texts together is the concept of governance – models of regulation, democracy building, civil society formation, industrial relations, and proprietary regimes. Neoliberalism is a constant theme throughout the contributions, considering that many of the authors point to a socioeconomic and political project that stresses the primacy of open markets and business interests as the ideological determinants of social and economic policy. Further to the point, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920512445398">Harvey (2006</xref>: 28) writes, ‘neoliberalism has not made the state or particular institutions of the state (such as the courts) irrelevant’. Instead, there has been a ‘radical reconfiguration of state institutions and practices’.</p>

<title>Life and Labor</title>
<p>Guiding <italic>Nice Work if You Can Get It: Life and Labor in Precarious Times</italic> is Andrew Ross’s attentiveness to the emergence of cultural capitalism in the USA, the UK, the EU, and China. The theme of cultural capitalism functions as an introduction and conclusion to a book that addresses the origins of the New Economy. Cultural work, Ross insists, is presented as the ‘new face of neoliberal entrepreneurship’ (p. 16), full of skill-intensive labor unleashing intellectual property (IP) production as a platform for economic development. An enthusiasm for information technology, organizational change, and endless branding fuels the creative industries (CIs) that makeup creative capitalism (p. 19). In the UK, Tony Blair’s New Labor embraced these ideals under the banner of the Department of Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS), an overarching policy umbrella under which the CIs are nurtured.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a longstanding history to critical readings of cultural production. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920512445398">Daniel Bell (1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920512445398">1999</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920512445398">Raymond Williams (1991)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920512445398">Herbert Schiller (1973)</xref>, and others wrote about the commodification of culture and positioned this tendency in the larger framework of advanced capitalist development throughout the 1960s and 1970s. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920512445398">Bell (1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920512445398">1999</xref>) famously observed, the economic transition to a post-industrial capitalism in the USA was partially defined by such cultural transformations. Bell and his contemporaries showed that equally momentous changes were taking place within the political structures of society. The question of governance was, indeed, a leading concern for Bell and other post-industrial scholars.</p>
<p>Whereas Bell drew his prognosis from the socioeconomic milieu of the 1960s, Ross’s contemporary reflection observes many of the same challenges Bell anticipated decades earlier. The difference is that Ross looks beyond the USA at China’s post-industrializing economy, where culture and creative capitalism play an important role in that country’s evolving industrial policies. Indeed, economic and cultural developments have engendered political challenges for China’s central planners, not least of which is the concern over access to information via internet and social media channels. Here Ross raises a timely question: when will ‘Made in China’ become ‘Created in China’ (p. 54)? American, European, and Japanese companies still retain control over China’s export-oriented production, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920512445398">Pepe Escobar (2011)</xref> notes, meaning that a shift towards knowledge creation from manufacturing could introduce a prospect of national economic ownership over these creative sectors.</p>
<p>Another of Ross’s achievements is his concentration on the historical gravity of China’s Cultural Revolution. While he addresses the social impact of this momentous event in China’s history, Ross takes aim at the lasting effects Maoism had on radicals in the industrialized West. In particular, Ross references the questionable adoption of Maoist principles by western academics. There is a deeper point being made in this chapter, but one cannot help but read into Ross’s words a critical, and somewhat cathartic, introspection to what is painted as a foolish embrace of Third World leftism by relatively privileged academics. Nevertheless, the debate that Ross provokes raises questions about the consequences this period had on the politicization of culture. ‘Cultural revolutions’ have been unfolding in the corporate world, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920512445398">Naomi Klein (2000)</xref> famously describes, just as much as they helped propel neoliberalism under Thatcher in the UK and Reagan in the USA (pp. 37, 75).</p>
<p>For creative industries, the main catalyst for their growth has been the intertwined influence of FIRE (finance, insurance, real estate) and ICE (information, culture, education) (p. 83) – two pivotal combinations of financial, cultural, and political forces that constitute the foundation of post-industrial capitalism. An important dimension to this has been the astronomical growth of financial industries and their decades-long gamble with real estate. As Marxist scholars have long catalogued, this unregulated and speculative frenzy fueled the subprime mortgage industry and, consequently, the malingering global economic crisis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920512445398">Foster and Magdoff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920512445398">Calnitsky, 2011</xref>). But the growth of FIRE and ICE as monikers for economic development, Ross insists, has also shaped the proprietary relations demarcating creative capitalism.</p>
<p>Intellectual property is described as <italic>the</italic> sought-after renewable resource of the New Economy. Promises of wealth flowing from the commodification of ideas, knowledge, information, and creativity, help to prop up the political platforms that leverage IP as the source of wealth generation in post-industrial (and de-industrialized) economies. Ross traces the origins of the debates over IP to the Lockean basis for copyright reward, namely that individuals have a right to own whatever they produce through labor (p. 182). More recently, the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dot.com">dot.com</ext-link> boom propelled both the technical capacity to reproduce content and ushered in movements claiming that information has the right to be free. All of these developments unfold as major corporations continue to battle the issue of ownership in the courts and the pro-business legislative arena.</p>
<p>Behind the stirring promises that shape cultural capitalism there is a literally intoxicating reality of labor and production. In Chapter Four, Ross negotiates with the intersection of work, resistance, culture, and myth. Scandal erupted in 2007 when media reports of tainted toys emerging from Chinese factories and destined for western markets cast a shadow over the quality of low-cost consumer products. Less was said, Ross reminds us, of the countless teenagers who toil for 12 hours a day inhaling noxious fumes in the firetrap factories that define China’s economic boom. Companies deploy the corporate social responsibility machine as a response to anti-corporate opponents by re-branding, rather than transforming, corporate labor and environmental practices. Driving the chapter is the argument that the leading site of struggle needs to be at the point of production, and not at the ‘wasteful end of the consumption cycle’ (p. 129). Campaigns like Killer Coke come close, but many such organizations are unwilling to cross a divide that calls into question the legitimacy of existing relations of production.</p>
<p>Finally, LLPT’s chief concern is that of <italic>labor</italic> in precarious times, as Ross builds on his characteristic style of writing about work through an ethnographic lens. In the process, he maintains a critical riposte to euphemistic accounts of creative and knowledge capitalism established by the likes of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920512445398">Richard Florida (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920512445398">Peter Drucker (1959)</xref>, who are interrogated in the book. While Ross takes to task the realities of work in the New Economy, or what he has earlier humorously described as ‘geeksploitation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920512445398">Ross, 2003</xref>), he refrains from lamenting the bygone regimes of work that characterized Keynesian-era capitalism. The quest for ‘jobs for life’ was never seen as a recipe for liberation, nor should it be (p. 5). Yet, <italic>Nice Work if You Can Get It</italic> does not go astray by bringing praise to current conditions that, as the title suggests, are defined as precarious.</p>
<p>What is compelling about Ross’s analysis of precarity is recognition that the ‘movement’ of these part-time workers is loaded with a host of internal contradictions. The concept of precarity has been deployed by academics and organized labor to described the ‘condition of social and economic insecurity associated with post-Fordist employment and neoliberal governance’ (p. 34). Indeed, LLPT’s engagement with precarity is one that questions the usefulness of such a term rather than accepting it as a universal definition of work in post-industrial capitalism. As Ross asks: ‘Even if this concept is theoretically plausible, does it make sense to imagine cross-class coalitions of the precarious capable of developing a unity of consciousness and action on an international scale?’ (p. 6). Indeed, this remains a pertinent question considering the debates emerging as a result of the international Occupy phenomenon.</p>
<p>Ross concludes LLPT with a substantive chapter on the rise of the global university and a critical, and necessary, introspection of academia. Within the halls of post-secondary institutions, Ross draws our attention to the critical juncture of labor, IP, and pedagogy in the knowledge economy. The university is featured as a locus of creative production, subordinate to a larger political economy of post-industrial capitalism. Ross pulls no punches deriding the conditions of work that characterize the academic division of labor within America’s university sector. But, Ross’s most cutting assault is saved for the most privileged professional of contemporary capitalism – the tenured professor. He writes,
<disp-quote>
<p>The apathy of tenured faculty, tethered, as they are, to the individualized reward system, is not only a formidable obstacle, but it is also a shameful reflection on a profession that holds the privilege of academic freedom but will not use it to protect those who are excluded on a daily basis. (p. 213)</p>

<title>Governance after Neoliberalism</title>
<p>Calhoun and Derluguian’s edited collection is the second volume of a two-part series that interrogates how the financial crisis exacerbated problems in regimes of global governance. Chief among the editors’ considerations is how the crisis threatens to ‘derail action on environmental concerns’ (p. 7). Leading the inquiry is the question: will states work to create international regulatory systems as a framework for a new world order, or will they be locked into new patterns of global conflict? Contributors to <italic>The Deepening Crisis: Governance Challenges After Neoliberalism</italic> fashion responses by taking to task the nature of governance in the context of ecological politics, religion, ethnicity, offshoring, the European Union, and media piracy.</p>
<p>For David Held and Kevin Young, the global financial crisis is a symptom of problems embedded in the contemporary world order. Systems of security and environmental governance, the authors suggest, cannot be divorced from the deficiencies of financial regulation that precipitated the stock market collapse of 2007–8. A collapse, they add, that is traceable to the workings of the US financial regulatory system, which allowed the contagion to become international. And here is the importance for a treatise on <italic>global</italic> governance: while the so-called housing bubble in the USA might have been leveraged by monetary policies concocted by Ayn Rand acolytes like Alan Greenspan in the Federal Reserve (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920512445398">Lanman and Matthews, 2008</xref>), financial industry leaders from New York to London to Berlin followed the promises of now-nefarious financial instruments (e.g. hedge funds, collateral debt obligations, derivative markets, etc.) regardless of ideological commitments.</p>
<p>Mary Kaldor’s contribution offers a convincing account of the intersection of war and economic crises. Kaldor charts interrelated tendencies associated with neo-Schumpeterian cycles that are tethered to technological innovations and investment. War, she argues, functions as both a reflection of transitory periods within the cycles and as a catalyst for shifts from one phase to another. Kaldor’s argument is evidenced by the Vietnam War, when the ‘first post-World War II financial crisis took place’ (p. 109). It was during this period that the USA experienced its first external trade deficit and abandoned the gold standard, ending the Bretton Woods experiment. Like Vietnam, the current financial crisis erupted in the shadow of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which have also been financed through deficit spending, i.e. foreign borrowing.</p>
<p>In Schumpeterian fashion, the economic cycle that Kaldor outlines commences with the introduction of new technologies to industry and the economy, followed by a frenzy of investment into these innovations, inflating an economic bubble. The result is a ‘Golden Age’ where the so-called techno-economic paradigm ‘diffuses throughout the economy and society’ (p. 112). As technological progress slows and markets are saturated with investment and innovations, the final stage of the cycle is characterized by protest, resistance, and ultimately an economic bust. Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq surfaced not only as larger imperial conflicts, but as symptoms of and catalysts for protracted crises within the economic system. In other words, the regime of financial regulation, the mortgage crisis, and the boom and bust cycle of high-tech innovation over the past two decades are part of a broader cycle Kaldor attributes to Schumpeter’s classic understanding of creative destruction.</p>
<p>One of the book’s main strengths is inclusion of ecological politics in debates on governance. William Barnes's and Nils Gilman’s chapter brings together scientific perspectives about environmental catastrophes and political questions that the authors insist need to be put forward for public debate. Their conclusion is straightforward and painfully anathema to the logic of capitalism: ‘with regard to all forms of material production and consumption, serious emissions reduction boils down to just one word: LESS’ (p. 51). The solution, Barnes and Gilman argue, is a ‘green social democracy’, which is fielded to mean a return to labor-intensive agricultural production and an environmentally sound ‘social economy’ predicated on small-business capitalism.</p>
<p>The composition of ecology as political holds strong, but the chapter suffers from sweeping statements that invoke notions of a uniform world civilization inexorably bound to unsustainable technologies. To speak of the problem through the discourse of ‘civilization’ masks the complexity of power relations between and within nation-states. Ironically, in a book on governance the authors pay scant attention to the relations of power that have orchestrated the very ecological crisis they insist demands radical change. For instance, Barnes and Gilman draw attention to a ‘public’ that can never be brought to accept a condition of life that is predicated on cuts to production and consumption through existing political systems. ‘What elected politician’, they ask, ‘can hope to sell diminishment to a population that for generations has been taught to consider a rising standard of living … ?' (p. 53) Strangely, the authors fail to engage with the idea that political and economic interests might in fact be aligned with ecological devastation!</p>
<p>Michael Watts builds on the ecological governance question by connecting colonialism and science in the context of European imperialism in Africa. His piece is an historical exploration of ‘colonial biopolitics’ describing Africa generally as a knowledge laboratory – a terrain on which social and natural scientific calculations were put to the test in what is commonly understood as development. Watts’s concern is less that of ecological politics, and more the deployment of particular knowledges <italic>and</italic> ‘calculative rationalities derived from the ecological sciences’ as political machinery (p. 70). Drawing from the UN Conference on the Human Environment held in 1972, and the Club of Rome report, <italic>Limits to Growth</italic>, the pressing concern, for Watts, is not that of the environment but of population management expressed as neo-Malthusian environmentalism. What distinguishes neo-Malthusian models from the managed environmentalism of the 1970s, Watts suggests, is the turn to socio-ecological management through market governance – in other words, neoliberalism (p. 86).</p>
<p>The merging of economic governance with that of ethnicity and religion also plays out in <italic>The Deepening Crisis</italic>. Rogers Brubaker’s chapter cultivates the argument that economic crises redefine understandings of ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’, rather than causing a politicization of ethnicity. Such tensions unfold in a concert of nation-states increasingly connected through economic and political linkages. Brubaker establishes general claims by drawing from cases in the USA and the UK, where those on the margins of economic and social life are further vilified during periods of economic turmoil and decline. The call for ‘British jobs for British workers’ by wildcat strikers at British refineries in 2009, and the racialized narratives concocted by conservatives in the USA blaming the financial crisis on government attempts to increase homeownership among minorities, are held as examples. Ultimately the chapter is successful at provoking an understanding of how ethnicity and race are inscribed through crises.</p>
<p>Considering the growth of Islamophobia throughout much of the Western world, the topics of secularism and religion are indeed political subjects in need of examination. Adrian Pabst offers a meaningful discussion of how secularism relates to the political terrain, but unfortunately the chapter succumbs to an overly metaphysical engagement with religion. By the end, the chapter takes off as a sermon against ‘militant atheists’, notably Richard Dawkins (pp. 177–178). Up until this point, Pabst credibly argues for the compatibility of faith with modernization and asserts that the world is undergoing a period of ‘desecularization’. His claims are evidenced by figures suggesting the world is growing more religious because the developing countries are producing more religious people ‘than those lost to secularism elsewhere’ (p. 171). Unfortunately Pabst offers no scrutiny of these facts and he fails to question whether or not the political aspirations of the supposed religious majority are driven by faith or material concerns, or both.</p>
<p>For Ravi Sundaram, global governance is a technical and cultural concern. American media industries in particular advanced the interest of US power abroad through a command of cultural production. But, as Sundaram concludes, US power was historically premised on an analog media empire. The digital age has reshaped the contours of how the media is deployed as a political tool and, more importantly, as a mechanism through which economic and cultural hegemony is established and maintained. Media piracy is used, suggests the author, as a ‘heuristic device to understand the transformations of global media governance throughout the twentieth century’. Subaltern populations are thereby empowered to construct creative responses to property regimes (p. 185). This need not be a form of resistance, Sundaram insists, but part of broader attempts to develop political discourses and forms of expression that diverge from dominant cultural industries, especially those situated in the global North.</p>
<p>Vadim Volkov’s contribution also takes to task the mechanisms of global (economic) governance for tending toward ‘ex-territorial capitalism’ vis-a-vis offshoring. By establishing low-cost offshore legal entities, global commercial enterprises have established highly secretive instruments for ‘dissociating finance from territorial issues’ (p. 204). From Switzerland to the Bahamas, Volkov’s historical account traces the origins of offshore havens from the late 19th century to the New Deal period, when American firms resistant to Roosevelt’s income sharing reforms looked south. At the end of the 20th century, the Caribbean segment of the offshore economy held almost US$5t of offshore finances. The sheer scope of these financial accounts, evidenced in Volkov’s chapter, provides insights to the architecture of global financial capitalism and the hidden wealth that continues to starve public treasuries in the USA and the UK.</p>
<p>Finally, Vincent della Sala offers insights into the structural fissures that are emerging within the eurozone and the European Union itself. Della Sala recognizes that the global economic crisis challenges the nature of European integration, but concludes that the talk of its demise is often exaggerated. One wonders if Della Sala would recant such skepticism in light of recent developments in Greece, where default and a return to the drachma are spoken of as real possibilities. Of course, through the lens of governance addressed in DC, the sustainability of an economic and political framework should be tested according to its ability to weather a crisis. Yet, as Della Sala proposes, the nature of European integration as a political project remains under scrutiny. The EU’s capacity to act as a counter-balance to American financial power has indeed faltered, but Della Sala does not concede the project has ended, only that the union of 27 countries now faces a less certain future. As one of the author’s scenarios indicates, a more intergovernmental and less supranational EU means that the Union itself will be even harder to coordinate.</p>

<sec id="section4-0896920512445398">
<title>Organized Labor and Democratic Governance</title>
<p>Roland Erne’s <italic>European Unions: Labor’s Quest for a Transnational Democracy</italic> surveys the prospects for trade unions to function as agents of democratization within the European Union. Although Erne explicitly avoids the task of drafting an alternative EU blueprint, the author makes clear that the possibility of a democratic European Union is hindered by the technocratic mode of governance currently in force. This, Erne adds, is a greater obstacle than the persistence of national differences. Though <italic>European Unions</italic> is several years old, the book’s discussion and analytic considerations relating to citizenry, democracy, collective action and bargaining, and governance remain topical. Indeed, the book’s central claims are worth revisiting considering trade union and labor resistance to austerity measures being implemented throughout Europe today.</p>
<p>Trade unions in Europe had many reasons to be cautious about the implications stemming from a united monetary and political union. This is pertinent when considering the mobility of labor within the EU, particularly from recent entrants like Poland, as well as the concentration of administrative and political power beyond the reach of national organizations, like unions. Erne argues that unions recognized the influence neoliberal ideology had on economic policy within the EU, and they feared that the integration process was simply an acceleration of an already powerful capitalist project (p. 3). For the most part this turned out to be the case. The trade union responses were subsequently mixed, but the tendencies gravitated towards a renationalization of politics, namely a type that followed the path of a national strategy where social democratic labor relations frameworks existed. To characterize the central features of the European integration process, Erne develops four typologies which are discussed throughout the book: Euro-democratization, Euro-technocratization, democratic renationalization, and technocratic renationalization (p. 4).</p>
<p>For Erne, a <italic>democratic</italic> Europeanization of organized labor can only develop if it emerges throughout EU-level structures as well as within national, local, and firm-level union organizations. The challenge of establishing Euro-democratization for organized labor is not unlike that facing the citizenry at large. Here the author claims that there has yet to develop a coherent European public sphere, and a set of democratically accountable institutions at the supranational level. Drawing from the work of social theorist, Jürgen Habermas, and Italian Marxist, Antonio Gramsci, Erne concludes that a European public sphere is indeed possible. In his engagement with these competing theoretical positions, Erne ultimately sides with Gramsci, who acknowledges the interdependence of civil society with the economy and the state, thus seeing ‘civil society as an area not only of deliberation but also of economic, political, and ideological struggle’ (p. 22).</p>
<p>There is no doubting that the transnationalization of capital has radically impacted the capacity of unions to negotiate with employers. It was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920512445398">Andre Gorz (1967)</xref> who, in the late 1960s, outlined what such a regime could look like in a united Europe. Even though Gorz recognized the need for a coordination of demands by workers, his fear was that organized labor would enter into a Faustian compromise with industry and large employers, alienating the union leadership from the rank-and-file members and the working classes as a whole. Political participation would make sense, he argued, <italic>if</italic> what was then the European Economic Community was a democratic, representative body, and not an organization governed by a technocratic elite (p. 82). After presenting his findings on the problems existing within the EU’s technocratic structure – namely as it relates to the European Social Dialogue mechanisms and European Works Council system – Erne concludes that Gorz’s conjecture remains salient. At best, the contemporary coordination rules aim to prevent downward competition, rather than set off an upward contest for better conditions (p. 87).</p>
<p>Erne proceeds to show how unions pursued a national strategy to enhance the competitive position of their own countries, despite commitments to honor agreed-on wage bargaining targets. This strategy contributed to the wage concessions made by trade unions throughout the 1990s, which were agreed upon largely for pragmatic reasons. Yet, as Erne points out, wage moderation did not define the position of British, Danish, Swedish, Portuguese, or Greek unions during this period. However, the renationalized approach has reached an impasse, partly due to the end of what he describes as the Euro-Keynesian model of bargaining in some states. In countries like Italy, the political shift to the right under Silvio Berlusconi further eroded traditional compromises between the state and organized labor, when unions were nudged out of their historical role as contributors to social and economic policy making. One surprising development is in the UK, where a deregulated industrial relations system did not lead to wage moderation, despite vicious assaults on trade unions under the Tories. In fact, real wages in the UK closely followed productivity gains throughout the 1980s and 1990s – a far cry from recent developments, in which average pay and earnings for UK households fell by 3.5 percent in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920512445398">Ball, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Even though LQTD pays closest attention to the feasibility of enhancing institutional bargaining structures, Erne speaks to sources of union power as part of a democratization process. The European Workers Council directive facilitated the reemergence of transnational labor relations in the 1990s, but such institutional forms of representation are, for Erne, only part of the debate. One source of union resources, he insists, is linked to the ‘capacity for political mobilization’ (p. 30). A manifestation of political power is, of course, the strike. Citing the case of ABB Alstom Power, formed after the merger of Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) and the French firm, Alstom, Erne addresses how the company’s threat of shedding a fifth of its workforce provoked responses from organized labor. In France, there was tremendous popular, and subsequently political support for the workers at French ABB sites, which gave an advantage to unions and their efforts at negotiating with the company. Mass mobilization by workers and union allies helped build public support, showing that governments can be persuaded to side with labor when opportunities arise. Indeed, unions created conditions that made it politically popular for state funds to be directed at a company to prevent bankruptcy and thus mitigate the need for downsizing (pp. 144, 155).</p>
<p>Erne’s second case includes the added challenge of transatlantic cooperation between trade unions. When the Swiss Algroup merged with Canadian Alcan to form APA, the new global enterprise hoped to expand its profit margin by reducing labor costs through workforce reductions. Regulatory oversights that favored business interests made possible the formation of APA and, subsequently, its capacity to rationalize costs. Absent from the APA case was political mobilization by organized labor, showing that labor ‘is only likely to affect EU competition policy if it succeeds in politicizing the competition policy in the European public sphere’ (p. 185). The union representing APA employees in North America, the USWA (United Steelworkers of America), hinders efforts at transnational solidarity by maintaining nationalistic rhetoric on trade issues, according to Erne. Still, the lesson that Erne promotes is that there is significance in making labor issues political issues, following a Gramscian notion of civil society and political mobilization.</p>
<p>Together, the contributions by Ross, Erne, and the edited collection of Calhoun and Derluguian provide worthy appraisals of fault lines in certain dimensions of social and political life. From organized labor, to conditions of work, to governance structures related to economic conditions and ecological sustainability, these books seek to uncover the worsening symptoms of ongoing financial crises. Andrew Ross is forceful with his claim that in light of transformations in the world of work, now is not a time for nostalgic reminiscing about past epochs. The authors in <italic>The Deepening Crisis</italic> certainly do not seek to recall previous modes of regulation or governance, particularly in the realm of ecological management. Erne is similarly insistent that Euro-democratization is an unfulfilled project, one that does not demand a return to renationalized strategies, but nonetheless faces serious challenges. On this issue Jürgen Habermas insists that the European project <italic>must</italic> be protected on rational and moral grounds, and that democracy in Europe depends on it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920512445398">Diez, 2011</xref>). At the same time it is safe to say that neoliberalism has not secured a hegemonic lead in the governance of world affairs, despite the fact that the financial crisis has yet to entirely displace the free-market fundamentalism that was nurtured through the 1990s. What has changed is that the neoliberal consensus has faltered. The ultimate outcome of this development, however, remains unclear.</p>
