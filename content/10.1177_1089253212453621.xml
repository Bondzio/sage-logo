She has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III heart failure, and moderate mitral regurgitation. She has recently undergone implantation of a biventricular (BiV) pacemaker (PM) with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).</p><p>Her medications include lisinopril 20 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg twice daily, valsartan 160 mg twice daily, hydralazine 75 mg twice daily, and spironolactone 50 mg daily. Her EKG revealed paced ventricular rhythm at 70 beats per minute with a right bundle branch pattern, and her echocardiogram shows dilated ventricles with a left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25% with moderate MR (mitral regurgitation).</p><p><italic>1. What is dilated cardiomyopathy?</italic></p><p><bold>Dr Krumerman:</bold> DCM is characterized by enlargement of the chambers of the heart accompanied by systolic dysfunction. DCM leads to progressive heart failure and may be due to a number of etiologies, including exposure to viruses resulting in myocarditis, exposure to toxins such as chemotherapeutic agents, or excessive ethanol consumption and pregnancy. By definition, patients with DCM have a depressed LVEF (&lt;40%) and suffer from systolic heart failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1089253212453621">1</xref></sup> Treatment for DCM is designed to improve ventricular function and reduce episodic congestive heart failure. Medical therapy includes β-blockers, diuretics, and afterload-reducing agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253212453621">2</xref></sup></p><p>Patients with cardiomyopathy and depressed LVEFs (&lt;35%) are candidates for prophylatic ICD therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212453621">3</xref></sup> Within this population, approximately one third of patients have prolongation of the QRS complex on ECG and LV dyssynchrony. Left-bundle branch block (LBBB) is associated with LV dyssynchrony or delayed electromechanical activation of the septal and lateral walls on echocardiogram. LV dyssynchrony results in reduced systolic function, LV dilation, functional mitral regurgitation, and worsening heart failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253212453621">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1089253212453621">5</xref></sup></p><p><italic>2. What is cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)?</italic></p><p><bold>Dr Krumerman:</bold> BiV pacing or CRT can modify electromechanical activation of the LV by simultaneously pacing the LV septum and lateral walls. Initial studies demonstrated acute hemodynamic improvement with CRT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1089253212453621">6</xref></sup> These were followed by several large randomized trials that demonstrated an increase in exercise capacity, improved quality of life, and a reduction in heart failure hospitalization and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1089253212453621">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1089253212453621"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1089253212453621">9</xref></sup></p><p><italic>3. When is CRT indicated and who would benefit from it?</italic></p><p><bold>Dr Krumerman:</bold> Current indications for implantation of CRT defibrillators (CRT-Ds) include patients with systolic congestive heart failure, LVEF &lt;35%, and a QRS duration &gt;120 ms. This includes patients with congestive heart failure who are PM dependent secondary to complete heart block. Such patients typically have LBBB on ECG secondary to chronic right ventricular (RV) pacing. Despite the remarkable response to CRT therapy, most trials reveal a 30% nonresponder rate. Subgroup analyses from large randomized trials have demonstrated that patients most likely to respond to CRT are those with a QRS duration greater than 150 ms and LBBB morphology on ECG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1089253212453621">10</xref></sup> Although most patients who qualify for CRT therapy receive CRT-Ds, elderly patients may opt for a CRT-P (CRT PM) that does not have the capability to treat tachyarrhythmia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212453621">3</xref></sup></p><p><italic>4. What are the EKG findings in a patient with a BiV PM?</italic></p><p><bold>Dr Aleong:</bold> To understand the EKG produced by BiV pacing, it is important to appreciate where these leads are placed; the subsequent paced QRS is produced by activation away from the lead in various locations. Leads in the right ventricle are most often placed in the RV apex and less often at the RV outflow tract. RV apical pacing is characterized by a negatively paced QRS complex in the inferior leads consistent with activation that starts inferiorly and moves superiorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1089253212453621">Figure 1</xref>). When the RV lead is placed at the RV outflow tract, it produces a paced QRS that is positive in the inferior leads consistent with superior to inferior activation. The coronary sinus lead is often placed at the lateral aspect of the left ventricle, and thus, activation proceeds away from the lateral LV wall producing a left to rightward axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1089253212453621">Figure 2</xref>). There is often a qR or Qr complex in lead I in the majority of patients with BiV pacing. Loss of the q or Q in lead I indicates loss of LV pacing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1089253212453621">11</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig1-1089253212453621" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Right ventricular (RV) apical pacing: pacing from the RV apex demonstrates a superior leftward axis with negative-paced QRS in leads II, III, and AvF and a positive-paced QRS in lead I</p></caption><graphic alt-version="no" position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_1089253212453621-fig1.tif" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><fig id="fig2-1089253212453621" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Left ventricular pacing from the coronary sinus shows activation of the lateral left ventricle with activation from left to right subsequent QS morphology in lead I; note underlying atrial flutter and complete heart block</p></caption><graphic alt-version="no" position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_1089253212453621-fig2.tif" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>Once one understands the different pacing morphologies of RV pacing versus BiV pacing, it is possible to understand the different pacing patterns that may occur in BiV pacing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253212453621">12</xref></sup> These patterns include (1) loss of RV and LV pacing resulting in the native QRS; (2) isolated RV pacing; (3) isolated LV pacing; (4) BiV pacing, which looks like a fusion between LV and RV pacing; (5) BiV pacing with fusion between the native QRS and pacing capture; (6) BiV pacing with anodal capture, which results in RV capture due to high outputs from the LV lead.</p><p><italic>5. What are the risks and complications of CRT?</italic></p><p><bold>Dr Krumerman:</bold> CRT-D implantation has similar risks as standard ICD implantation. In general, there is a less than 1% risk of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, death, tamponade, bleeding, and infection. Venography of the coronary venous tree is performed prior to placing the LV lead. Contrast use is associated with a small risk of renal insufficiency or allergic reaction. Following CRT implantation, one may observe frequent left-sided diaphragmatic contraction due to phrenic nerve stimulation. Special testing is performed at implantation in order to avoid phrenic nerve stimulation during LV pacing. Despite this, changes in patient position or lead displacement may result in diaphragmatic stimulation requiring lead revision.</p><p><italic>6. What methods are available to monitor the success following institution of CRT therapy?</italic></p><p><bold>Dr Aleong:</bold> Before discussing response to CRT, it is worth reviewing which patients are candidates for these devices. Based on the current 2008 ACC/AHA/HRS Guidelines, patients with a LVEF &lt;35%, a QRS duration of at least 120 ms and NYHA class III or ambulatory IV have the greatest potential benefit from CRT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212453621">3</xref></sup> In general, patients with a LBBB morphology QRS have a greater benefit compared with patients with other intraventricular conduction delays. There is also evidence that patients with NYHA class I or II benefit from CRT in terms of reducing heart failure hospitalizations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253212453621">12</xref></sup> All the studies were performed on patients who were on optimal medical management for their heart failure.</p><p>The randomized trials investigating CRT have used mortality, improvement in NYHA class, improvement in LVEF, 6-minute walk, and quality-of-life assessments to judge response to CRT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1089253212453621">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1089253212453621">14</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1089253212453621">Figure 3</xref> shows data from the CARE-HF trial demonstrating the heart failure patients randomized to CRT had a significant benefit, with a reduction in death or hospitalization compared to medical management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253212453621">4</xref></sup> For the individual patient, assessment for improved NYHA class, quality of life, and potentially, improvement in LVEF are the most practical parameters to monitor for response to CRT. For patients who are deemed nonresponders to CRT, additional measures that may improve response include optimizing the timing of AV and/or RV/LV pacing delays as well as looking for other heart rhythms that may be preventing BiV pacing, such as atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and frequent premature ventricular contractions or ventricular tachycardia. It should be noted that in each of the major CRT trials, the nonresponder rate was 20% to 30%.</p><fig id="fig3-1089253212453621" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Data from the Companion Trial demonstrating that patients with advanced heart failure and prolonged QRS duration had a significant benefit from both biventricular pacing with or without an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator<sup>a</sup></p><p><sup>a</sup>From Cleland et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1089253212453621">7</xref></sup> with permission.</p></caption><graphic alt-version="no" position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_1089253212453621-fig3.tif" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p><italic>7. Discuss the class I indications of ICD placement</italic></p><p><bold>Dr Aleong:</bold> The indications for ICDs are divided into those for primary and secondary prevention. For secondary prevention or for patients who have had a previous cardiac arrest, defibrillators have consistently been associated with a survival benefit and a decrease in arrhythmic death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1089253212453621">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1089253212453621"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1089253212453621">17</xref></sup> In patients with a potentially reversible cause, such as MI or those with severe electrolyte disturbances, ICDs should be considered on an individual basis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212453621">3</xref></sup> If the primary disturbance cannot be completely reversed, then consideration for ICD placement should be made. Several important points regarding cardiac arrest in the setting of coronary artery disease should be emphasized. If there is evidence that a VF (Ventricular Fibrillatory) arrest is directly related to a MI or ischemia, then the primary treatment is coronary revascularization. If complete revascularization is not possible, then an ICD should be considered. In addition, patients who have a VT/VF (Ventricular Fibrillation/Ventricular Tachycardia) arrest more than 48 hours after a MI are at high risk of recurrent cardiac arrest. For patients with genetic arrhythmia syndromes who have a cardiac arrest, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and long QT syndrome, an ICD should be placed due to the significant risk of future events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212453621">3</xref></sup></p><p>Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death refers to placement of an ICD in patients who have not previously had a cardiac arrest or a sustained ventricular arrhythmia. A full discussion of the primary prevention indications for ICD placement is beyond the scope of this manuscript, and we will therefore focus on those indications for patients with ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy.</p><p>In patients with either ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy who have a LVEF &lt;35%, an ICD should be considered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212453621">3</xref></sup> This recommendation is for patients on optimal medical management who are at least 40 days post MI. For patients with a LVEF &lt;40% with nonsustained VT who have inducible ventricular arrhythmia at electrophysiology study, an ICD should be considered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1089253212453621">18</xref></sup></p><p><bold>Dr McKillop:</bold> The recommended indications for implantation of an ICD are fairly extensive and are listed below excerpted from the ACC/AHA/HRS 2008 Guidelines for Device-Based Therapy of Cardiac Rhythm Abnormalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253212453621">3</xref></sup>:</p><p>Class I indications are conditions for which there is evidence and/or general agreement that a given procedure or treatment is beneficial, useful, and effective.</p><list id="list1-1089253212453621" list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>ICD therapy is indicated in patients who are survivors of cardiac arrest due to VF or hemodynamically unstable sustained VT after evaluation to define the cause of the event and to exclude any completely reversible causes (level of evidence: A).</p></list-item><list-item><p>ICD therapy is indicated in patients with structural heart disease and spontaneous sustained VT, whether hemodynamically stable or unstable (level of evidence: B).</p></list-item><list-item><p>ICD therapy is indicated in patients with syncope of undetermined origin with clinically relevant hemodynamically significant sustained VT or VF induced at electrophysiological study (level of evidence: B).</p></list-item><list-item><p>ICD therapy is indicated in patients with LVEF less than or equal to 35% due to prior MI who are at least 40 days post MI and are in NYHA functional class II or III (level of evidence: A).</p></list-item><list-item><p>ICD therapy is indicated in patients with nonischemic DCM who have an LVEF less than or equal to 35% and who are in NYHA functional class II or III (level of evidence: B).</p></list-item><list-item><p>ICD therapy is indicated in patients with LV dysfunction due to a prior MI who are at least 40 days post MI, have an LVEF less than or equal to 30%, and are NYHA functional class I (level of evidence: A).</p></list-item><list-item><p>ICD therapy is indicated in patients with nonsustained VT due to prior MI, LVEF less than or equal to 40%, and inducible VF or sustained VT at electrophysiological study (level of evidence: B).</p></list-item></list><p><italic>8. Describe the PM nomenclature for BiV pacing</italic></p><p><bold>Dr Aleong:</bold> First a description of the general PM codes is appropriate. The North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (now the Heart Rhythm Society [HRS]) and the British Pacing and Electrophysiology Group have defined the most commonly used nomenclature as shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1089253212453621">Figure 4</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1089253212453621">19</xref></sup> Position I refers to the location where antibradycardia pacing is present (none, atrium, ventricle, or both). Position II refers to the chamber where spontaneous events are sensed (none, atrium, ventricle, or both). Position III indicates whether pacing inhibits pacing or triggers a pacing output or both. Position IV indicates whether adaptive rate pacing or rate modulation in response to patient activity is present or not. Position V refers to the presence of multisite pacing either in the atria or ventricle. It is really at position V where BiV pacing is indicated. However, general use of position V is not universal, and therefore, communication with the patient’s cardiologist and electrophysiologist is important.</p><fig id="fig4-1089253212453621" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Revised NBG codes describing pacemaker modes</p><p>Abbreviations: NASPE, North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology; BPEG, British Pacing and Electrophysiology Group.</p></caption><graphic alt-version="no" position="float" xlink:href="10.1177_1089253212453621-fig4.tif" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p><bold>Dr Mckillop:</bold> The PM nomenclature for BiV pacing is the same as the nomenclature used for conventional dual- or single-chamber PMs. The standard NBG code system is used to describe the programming mode. The use of position V in the code indicates the presence and to some extent the location of multisite pacing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1089253212453621">19</xref></sup> For example, VOOOO indicates asynchronous ventricular pacing with no sensing, rate modulation, or multisite pacing. DDDOV indicates dual-chamber pacing without rate modulation but with multisite pacing (ie, BiV pacing, more than 1 pacing site in 1 ventricle, or both features). DDDRD indicates dual-chamber pacing with rate modulation and multisite pacing both in the atrium (ie, biatrial pacing, pacing in more than 1 site in 1 atrium, or both features) and the ventricle (ie, BiV pacing, pacing in more than 1 site in 1 ventricle, or both features).</p><p><italic>9. What are the key perioperative issues in a patient with cardiac implantable electrical devices (CIEDs; either BiV PM or ICD), and what preoperative information should be obtained from the patient/history prior to surgery?</italic></p><p><bold>Dr Janelle:</bold> Basic understanding about modern CIEDs and a review of current guidelines for management can dispel much of the discomfort that may accompany caring for these patients. Until the recent past, management advisories from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), from the HRS, and American Heart Association (AHA) have been somewhat incongruent. In 2011, however, an expert consensus statement jointly sponsored by the above groups and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons was published,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1089253212453621">20</xref></sup> along with a practice advisory from the ASA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1089253212453621">20</xref></sup> Familiarity with these documents is imperative. Preoperative assessment of patients with CIEDs involves a thorough history pertinent to the device in addition to routine perioperative concerns. When encountering a patient with a CIED, a proposed checklist encompassing the essential elements of the preoperative CIED evaluation includes the following:</p><list id="list2-1089253212453621" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>date of last device interrogation (should be within 6 months for AICD, 12 months for PM);</p></list-item><list-item><p>type of device;</p></list-item><list-item><p>manufacturer and model;</p></list-item><list-item><p>indication for device;</p></list-item><list-item><p>battery longevity (should be &gt;3 months);</p></list-item><list-item><p>age of leads (should be &gt;3 months);</p></list-item><list-item><p>what is the basic programming mode?</p></list-item><list-item><p>is there ICD therapy?</p></list-item><list-item><p>is the patient PM dependent?</p></list-item><list-item><p>what is the underlying rhythm (if determinable)?</p></list-item><list-item><p>what is the response to magnet placement</p></list-item><list-item><p>did any alerts exist during last interrogation?</p></list-item><list-item><p>are the last pacing thresholds known?</p></list-item></list><p>Much of the above information can be obtained from the patient’s PM wallet card, if available. If not, then it may be readily obtainable by calling the implanting physician’s office or by calling the device manufacturer directly. If the device has been interrogated within the accepted windows and the patient’s cardiac status has remained stable, there is likely not a need per se for reinterrogation preoperatively. If the patient cannot identify the device (ICD vs PM) and the device has not been interrogated within the recommended window, then preoperative interrogation is indicated.</p><p>PM dependence is defined by the presence of a predominant atrial and/or ventricular pacing spike identified on preoperative 12-lead ECG or telemetry. Evaluation by telemetry may require the monitor to be placed in a mode that enables detection, and even then, identification of atrial pacing spikes may prove difficult. If so, PM interrogation may be necessary. The ECG obtained during interrogation is derived directly from the leads, and the interrogation device clearly indicates native complexes and paced beats. The PM can also be temporarily paused during interrogation to allow for determination of the patient’s underlying rhythm, which is particularly important information if the planned surgical procedure is likely to cause significant electromagnetic interference (EMI).</p><p><italic>10. How is your management different for a patient with a BiV pacer compared to single-chamber ventricular pacing?</italic></p><p><bold>Dr Janelle:</bold> Patients with BiV PMs, by design, are typically “PM dependent” as CRT in these patients is done in order to optimize cardiac performance. These patients may still have a stable underlying cardiac rhythm (albeit with a bundle-branch block) that may make temporary inhibition of PM function safe and potentially a better choice than placing the PM into a fixed rate, asynchronous mode.</p><p><italic>11. How does the magnet work when placed over the pacer?</italic></p><p><bold>Dr Berger:</bold> The purpose of placing a magnet on a PM is to change the programming to an asynchronous mode. The vast majority of cardiac devices contain a reed switch, which consists of 2 magnetic metal strips located within a glass capsule. The application of a magnet causes the 2 metal strips to come into contact with one and other, closing the switch. The sudden voltage change causes the PM to change to an asynchronous pacing mode.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1089253212453621">21</xref></sup> In 2006, St Jude Medical introduced the EPIC II and Atlas II models, which contain a giant magnetosensitive resistor. The application of an external magnetic source causes the magnetic layers to line up in the same direction, which in turn lowers resistance. The change or reduction in resistance causes the PM to switch pacing modes.</p><p><bold>Dr Janelle:</bold> With ICDs manufactured by St Jude’s Medical, Boston Scientific, Medtronic, and Biotronik, the magnetic switch will disable antitachycardia functions (shock therapies) without altering underlying PM programming, a key difference in determining whether or not a magnet should be used during procedures where EMI is anticipated close to the generator’s location. ELA/Sorin PM/AICDs will both disable the antitachydysrhythmia functions and revert the PM to a fixed rate, asynchronous mode at a rate determined by the percentage remaining battery life.</p><p><italic>12. Can patients with BiV PMs have MRI studies?</italic></p><p><bold>Dr Berger:</bold> Medtronic now produces an MRI-compatible PM, which contains a Hall effect sensor switch. The principle of the Hall effect is based upon the generation of electrical voltage across an electrical conductor, when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the direction of the current flow in the conductor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1089253212453621">22</xref></sup> These new MRI-compatible devices can be programmed to lock out when undergoing a MRI scan.</p><p><bold>Dr Aleong:</bold> There is a growing need for patients with PMs and ICDs to have MRI scans given the aging of the population with these devices and the superior soft-tissue imaging capabilities of MRI. The current guidelines strongly discourage MRI in patients with PMs and ICDs unless in the case of an emergency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1089253212453621">23</xref></sup> There are several possible interactions that may occur between an implantable cardiac device and a magnetic field that includes mechanical forces on the ferromagnetic components, RF-induced heating of the leads, unintended cardiac stimulation, interference with the PM function, and electrical resetting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1089253212453621">24</xref></sup> Despite these concerns, there are several studies in a limited number of patients demonstrating that MRI can be performed when needed in patients with implantable cardiac devices, and there are published safety protocols for scanning patients with cardiac devices from single centers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1089253212453621">25</xref></sup></p><p>There are several dual PMs now available or soon to be available, which are termed <italic>MRI conditionally safe</italic>. Some of the design features of newer PMs include decreasing the ferromagnetic content in order to limit the interaction with the device, replace the reed switch which avoids unpredictable changes in device programming, and redesign the leads to allow for less transfer of electromagnetic energy at the lead tip. An initial multicenter trial of the MRI conditionally safe Medtronic Revo EnRhythm device showed no complications in patients who had a MRI between 9 and 12 weeks postdevice implant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1089253212453621">26</xref></sup> For now, there are no BiV PMs or ICDs that are considered MRI safe.</p><p><italic>13. What are some disadvantages of transitioning the patient to a fixed pacing mode?</italic></p><p><bold>Dr Janelle:</bold> Asynchronous pacing is rarely necessary for procedures below the level of the umbilicus and on the lower extremities as EMI is unlikely to result in PM inhibition unless the current pathway crosses the PM generator. Placing a PM into an asynchronous mode risks the uncommon but potentially catastrophic complication of an R-on-T phenomenon, where a PM impulse occurring during a native ventricular repolarization may precipitate ventricular fibrillation. Conversely, if the magnet mode is triggered on ICDs (unless the magnet switch has specifically been deactivated), then the underlying PM programming is unaffected, but the defibrillation therapies will be deactivated.</p><p><italic>14. Discuss the concern with monopolar cautery use intraoperatively?</italic></p><p><bold>Dr Berger:</bold> The antitachycardia function of ICDs should be turned off during surgical procedures where it may accidentally be triggered by EMI. One source of EMI is monopolar electrocautery, which can be sensed by the ICD, causing an inappropriate triggering of the pulse generator. Multiple other sources of EMI exist in the operating room, such as radio frequency ablation and lithotripsy.</p><p><bold>Dr Janelle:</bold> Knowledge of planned procedural details is imperative when formulating a management plan for patients with CIEDs, and EMI is the most likely cause of PM failure. Additionally, EMI may result in PM oversensing or inhibition as well as ICD or antitachycardia pacing inhibition or false arrhythmia detection, possibly resulting in an unnecessary shock. For this reason, it is appropriate to disable ICD therapies for procedures with EMI risk, such as an exploratory laparotomy for the patient in question. With EMI, devices that use impedance-based technology for rate modulation may respond by pacing at the upper rate. Electroconvulsive therapy, TENS units, and GI electrocautery can produce EMI, and radiofrequency used for ablative procedures produces similar EMI to electrosurgery. Routine monopolar electrosurgery is unlikely to cause generator damage or damage to the lead-tissue interface unless applied directly to the hardware. In contrast, external cardioversion/defibrillation and therapeutic radiation can both cause device reset. Whenever possible, bipolar electrosurgery is preferable. If bipolar cautery cannot be used, monopolar electrosurgery bursts should be limited to &lt;5 s.</p><p><italic>15. Assume the ICD is disabled for surgery; please discuss recommendations for managing potential lethal arrhythmia development intraoperatively?</italic></p><p><bold>Dr Berger:</bold> If defibrillation or cardioversion becomes necessary intraoperatively, all sources of EMI should be removed. The antitachycardia therapy of the ICD should be reenabled and the patient observed for appropriate therapy. If unable to restore antitachycardia function, then external defibrillation or cardioversion should be performed. Overriding the above discussion, if a life-threatening arrhythmia occurs ACLS protocols should be initiated. An attempt should be made to limit the current flow through the pulse generator and cardiac leads. This is accomplished by placing the cardioversion/defibrillator pads perpendicular to the major axis of the pulse generator and leads in an anterior posterior location.</p><p><bold>Dr Janelle:</bold> Should a patient have significant bradyarrhythmias during electrosurgery, then the electrosurgery should be discontinued immediately to allow for the PM to pace the patient until an alternative pacing device is utilized or the patient’s PM can be reprogrammed to an asynchronous mode. It is imperative that resuscitative devices and means of external defibrillation are available until the device is reprogrammed after surgery concludes. Additional basic perioperative monitoring for these patients includes:</p><list id="list3-1089253212453621" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>ECG (off filter);</p></list-item><list-item><p>pulse waveform displayed;</p></list-item><list-item><p>consideration for increased oxygen demand, as asynchronous mode typically results in HRs in 90s;</p></list-item><list-item><p>consider invasive monitoring for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or BiV PM patients;</p></list-item><list-item><p>appropriate equipment must be on hand to provide backup pacing and/or defibrillation;</p></list-item><list-item><p>external pads.</p></list-item></list><p><italic>16. Assuming you did place a magnet on the patient for surgery, describe the key postoperative issues that need to be addressed prior to discharging the patient?</italic></p><p><bold>Dr Berger:</bold> Following the completion of a surgical procedure in which a cardiac device had been disabled with a magnet, the patient’s cardiac rate and rhythm should be monitored in the immediate postoperative period according to the latest anesthesia guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1089253212453621">27</xref></sup> In addition, backup pacing and cardioversion equipment must be immediately available. Prior to discharge from the postanesthesia care unit, the cardiac device needs to be interrogated to assess postoperative function. If settings are inappropriate, the device needs to be reprogrammed, and antitachycardia function of an ICD should be restored. A consultation with a cardiologist or PM-ICD service may be necessary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1089253212453621">27</xref></sup></p><p><bold>Dr Janelle:</bold> If a magnet has been used to temporarily suspend ICD therapies or to place a PM into an asynchronous pacing mode, immediate reprogramming is not always necessary. Interrogation in person or by remote monitoring is recommended within 1 month. If patient conditions preclude timely reinterrogation within a month, then the device should be reinterrogated prior to hospital discharge. If any of the following conditions occurs, however, then the device should be reinterrogated and/or reprogrammed before the patient is removed from telemetry in the perioperative period:</p><list
