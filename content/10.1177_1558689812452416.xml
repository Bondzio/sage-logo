<body>
<p>Three months into my term as coeditor of the <italic>Journal of Mixed Methods Research</italic> (<italic>JMMR</italic>), and with the 2012 Mixed Methods Research Conference imminent, it seems fitting to return to the themes alluded to in my inaugural editorial: Managing Movement, Leading Change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1558689812452416">Freshwater, 2012</xref>). In this I argued that the business of research needs to move with, and adapt to, the changing environment. Movement and change are critical and inextricably linked concepts and as such may be deemed to have a symbiotic relationship. Change needs movement to occur, and movement is kept mobile by change. In February’s editorial, I highlighted the importance of challenging philosophical and epistemological stances and, more specifically, the role that journals and journal editors have in encouraging this in the not insignificant responsibility that accompanies the role. In this editorial, I would like to take one step further and contend that it is a necessity to challenge and question epistemological stances and to keep academic debate and scholarship mobile. Hence, the title of the editorial being posed as a question: Why Write? As editors, we have a moral and ethical responsibility to afford the authors the space in which to write, to contest apparently solid ground, and to contribute to our knowledge economy through academic debate. And part of how we construct that space involves diligent and ethical editorial practice, which in turn incorporates mindful and deliberative use of our editorial influence, as we manage, among other things, the peer review process.</p>
<p>As an exemplar for this editorial, we raise the thorny issue of what it is that constitutes a paradigm, why it is so relevant for the mixed methods community, and how the <italic>JMMR</italic> can foster academic scholarship and debate in the area. We are mindful that the concept of paradigms has suffered from a series of slippery and imprecise definitions leading to uncritical, perhaps mindless, overuse (and abuse) of the term (see, e.g., Holloway’s critique in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689812452416">Holloway, 2011</xref>). To arrive at a more informed assessment of the role and purpose of paradigms, we first consider some of the competing definitions of paradigms within the mixed methods community.</p>
<p>There is some divergence in people’s understanding, and indeed the view of the wider academic community, about what constitutes a paradigm. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1558689812452416">Thomas Kuhn (1996)</xref> conceptualized a paradigm as a set of practices that define a scientific discipline at any particular period in time. This definition allows considerable room for maneuver. One school of thought exemplified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1558689812452416">Mertens (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689812452416">2010</xref>) conceptualizes paradigms as sets of philosophical assumptions relating to the nature of methodology, epistemology, ontology, and axiology. According to this model, methodological assumptions can lead to a choice of methods, whether they be quantitative, qualitative, or mixed within several paradigms—most notably the pragmatic and transformative paradigms. Within this model, the conceptualization of a paradigm concerns a construct that “sires” or “begets” choices in methods.</p>
<p>There is another school of thought that allows for paradigms to be methodological in their foundation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1558689812452416">Denscombe (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1558689812452416">Johnson and Onwuegbuzie (2004)</xref> conceptualized the mixed methods approach as a third paradigm for social research in the combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies. We should point out that when writing about mixed methods research, we are not simply referring to choices of methods or sets of methodological procedures. Rather, we are referring to the “mixed methods approach,” which is an epistemological standpoint with specific impacts on the positioning and understanding of both qualitative and quantitative research. It is common for these two understandings (i.e., higher order philosophical paradigms that beget choices in methods and paradigms that can be methodological in their foundation) to be used interchangeably and even conflated leading to a degree of conceptual confusion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689812452416">Holloway (2011)</xref>, for example, observed that the use of the term <italic>paradigm</italic> has become problematic when freely used but not examined for meaning, and we acknowledge this issue in our own inquiry.</p>
<p>We propose that a methodological approach can form the foundation of a paradigm that leads not only to choices in methods but also responses to and experiences of epistemology and ontology. We contend that the mixed methods approach, and also quantitative and qualitative approaches, can indeed be conceptualized as paradigms that have their own epistemology, ontology, and axiology. We would like to make it clear that we are not suggesting that sets of methods—whether quantitative, qualitative, or mixed—are paradigms. We suggest that there is scope for a number of conceptualizations of paradigms. These range from higher order philosophical paradigms that beget choices in methods to paradigms that can be methodological in their foundation. Rather we highlight that in the latter definition, we conceptualize methodologies themselves as not only choices of methods but as epistemological standpoints with their own conceptual and philosophical underpinnings.</p>
<p>Why then is this important to the mixed methods community? More questions! As I stated in my opening editorial:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>All research methods are developed within a paradigm and as such have epistemological, ontological, axiological, and philosophical foundations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>So whether we conceptualize mixed methods as a specific methodological paradigm or as a set of methods associated with different paradigmatic stances, the bigger picture perhaps relates to the epistemology of mixed methods research, how mixed methods continues to influence and be influenced by knowledge production, and ways of producing knowledge (writing for publication being one such way of producing knowledge). We have devised a conceptual map of discourse development that we have not the space to present in its entirety here. However, our headline message would be that discourse development is inherently relational, and our conceptual framework allows active participation in the development of discourses. This is especially important as it relates to not only the lived experience of agency and power but also ensures that academic discourse is truly interactive and responsive.</p>
<p>As editors, reviewers, and consumers, we cannot be shy about our own personal responsibility and ethics in discourse development. We should not forget that the <italic>JMMR</italic> is a powerful journal that gives voice to a powerful discourse that is constructed and perpetuated through publication in a striated space, the parameters of which are set primarily, but not solely, by editorial practice. Put another way, the extent to which editors and reviewers allow “room for maneuver” as epistemological challenges are raised, while at the same time ensuring academic rigor and quality is maintained. So when engaging in the acutely sensitive relational and political act of publishing, that is the creation of texts, we need to be mindful of how space, movement, and change sculpt academic debate and in doing so shape contexts, particularly academic debate concerning the nature of epistemology and its relevance to mixed methods research.</p>
