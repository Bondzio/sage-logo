<p>62.5106 ÁGH, Attila — <bold>The European futures and cohesive Europe: <italic>EU2020</italic> strategy and cohesion policy with flexible integration.</bold> <italic>Journal of Comparative Politics</italic> 4(2), July 2011: 49–66.</p>
<p>The EU is at a crossroads in 2011, [which] necessitates a new mission statement about the future the EU is heading for. It has to formulate also the EU's role in the global world in order to redesign the EU's future in this “risky”, quickly globalizing world. This paper analyzes the emerging organic link between the <italic>EU2020 Strategy</italic> and cohesion policy on one side, and the increasing tension between the core and the periphery in the efforts to achieve stronger economic governance on the other.

<p>European construction has its fundamentals in the Christian Democratic ideology, promoted by the European “founding fathers”, namely Jean Monnet, Robert Schuman, Konrad Adenauer, Alcide De Gasperi. After reiterating the eclectic assumptions that sustain the ideal of the United States of Europe, the author investigates the Christian Democracy roots of European construction.

<p>62.5108 ALLEE, Todd L.; SCALERA, Jamie E. — <bold>The divergent effects of joining international organizations: trade gains and the rigors of WTO accession.</bold> <italic>International Organization</italic> 66(2), Apr. 2012: 243–276.</p>
<p>Governments have joined the WTO in vastly different ways: some have taken mere days to join without undertaking any trade liberalization, while others have taken more than a decade and been forced to undergo significant liberalization. We argue that the more rigorous a state's accession to an international organization, and thus the greater policy change required to join, the greater the benefits it will receive from membership in the organization. We develop a three-part classification of WTO members based on type of accession—early, automatic, and rigorous—and then compile detailed original data on the accession experiences of each relevant state, including length of time, number of veto-players, rounds of questions, and tariff and nontariff commitments.

<p>The risks posed by the severe water shortages afflicting the Middle East, North, and East Africa are exacerbated by desultory policies. This paper proposes a holistic treatment of transboundary rivers as a sustainable solution to the problem. This entails the pursuit of comprehensive basin-wide agreements which provide for the equitable allocation of waters between states and set forth mechanisms for the construction of hydroelectric plants and irrigations schemes where they most benefit basins as a whole. The paper analyzes the impediments to reaching such treaties and the deficiencies permeating existing international agreements. It also discusses the risks—ranging from resource depletion and economic decline to outright conflict—associated with the lack of basin-wide agreements. [R]</p>

[Résumé en français]</p>
<p>Somewhat neglected in recent research is the role that particular international agencies play in shaping the norms and forms that pertain to emergent regimes of border control: what we call the international government of borders. The IOM illustrates how the control of borders has become constituted as an object of technical expertise and intervention within programs and schemes of international authority. In different ways, one can observe in very material terms how the project of making borders into a problem of “management” conflicts with a perception of borders as a site of social struggle and politics.

<p>62.5111 ANING, Kwesi; ATUOBI, Samuel — <bold>The neglected economic dimensions of ECOWAS's negotiated peace accords in West Africa.</bold> <italic>Africa Spectrum</italic> 46(3), 2011: 27–44.</p>
<p>Since its first intervention in Liberia in December 1989, ECOWAS has, in conjunction with the African Union (AU) and the UN, managed to resolve intrastate violence in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Côte d'Ivoire through its political and military interventions. One aspect of ECOWAS's work that has received little scholarly attention are the economic dimensions of the peace accords it has negotiated. The same is true of other peace initiatives, e.g., in Côte d'Ivoire, led by other actors. This paper evaluates the economic dimensions of peace agreements in these three countries, and examines how these agreements address the distribution and management of economic resources. Because these conflicts were partially underpinned by the mismanagement of economic resources, the search for peace should necessarily include addressing economic issues at the negotiating table.

<p>62.5112 ARGOMANIZ, Javier — <bold>A rhetorical spillover? Exploring the link between the European Union Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) and the external dimension in EU counterterrorism.</bold> <italic>European Foreign Affairs Review</italic> 17, Special Issue, Apr. 2012: 35–52.</p>
<p>The EU counterterrorism policies have often been viewed through the prism of the EU's Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ). Yet although macro-strategic decision-making is mainly located within the Council's Secretariat and Council of Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Ministers, its external dimension reserves a role for the EU's CSDP. This rhetorical “spill-over” of an internal security concern onto the CSDP is an interesting yet under-researched development. This is partially due to the fact that CSDP is far from being one of the most developed aspects of the European counterterror response. Yet this occurs in a context where the need for an active use of CSDP as a counterterrorist tool is emphasized in high-level political proclamations. This article explains this disparity between EU discourse and reality. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.5137]</p>

<p>This article, which investigates the impact of Kosovo's secession from Serbia in 2008 on international law and on the groups demanding secession from their states, verifies that in the light of the principle of territorial integrity, the approach of refusal of the right of secession even for exceptional circumstances is principal. This article throws light on consideration the right of secession in international law as normative impression dimension, as in the Kosovo case in which an ethnic group declared the unilateral independence from their motherland.

<p>62.5114 AYBET, Gülnur — <bold>The evolution of NATO's three phases and Turkey's transatlantic relationship.</bold> <italic>Perceptions</italic> 17(1), Spring 2012: 19–36.</p>
<p>This article explores the evolution of NATO as a security community in three phases. During the Cold War and immediate post-Cold War era, the Alliance had a focused grand strategy. In the third phase which starts after 11 September [2001], the Alliance's grand strategy is in flux, while it is engaged in various missions that are a mixture of borderless collective defense, humanitarian intervention, and the safeguarding of trade routes and resources. The place of Turkey as a predominantly “functional” ally in the first two phases and then as a “strategic partner” in the last phase is examined and followed by the likely points of continuing cooperation with NATO and likely divergence of interests in the long term.

<p>62.5115 BARROS, Xiana — <bold>EU counterterrorism and aviation security: supranational rules but intergovernmental politics?</bold> <italic>European Foreign Affairs Review</italic> 17, Special Issue, Apr. 2012: 53–69.</p>
<p>Even though it is far from institutionalized, the field of international aviation security is dominated by growing global trends such as the proliferation of the ban on liquids in hand luggage and of the installation of body scanners in airports. The initiators of these two trends are the US in coalition with specific European states. In these cases, the EU varies from being an early adopter to a belated one, depending on its internal politics. By employing its veto powers in full, the EP has achieved a relevant influence over the policy content. In turn, despite the supranational character of decision-making rules in the EU aviation security area, the European Commission has played a weak role as an agenda-setter in the substantive choices and has concentrated on performing as a coordinator.

<p>62.5116 BEARDSLEY, Kyle — <bold>UN intervention and the duration of international crises.</bold> <italic>Journal of Peace Research</italic> 49(2), March 2012: 335–349.</p>
<p>This article examines the effect of UN actions on the duration of international crises. Four different types of action—assurance, diplomatic engagement, military involvement, and intimidation—and three different outcomes—compromise, victory, and stalemate—are considered. After building on the existing literature to develop expectations of how a third party like the UN shapes crisis trajectories, hypotheses are tested using the International Crisis Behavior (ICB) data and a new events dataset on UN activity. Results from competing-risks models reveal that UN military involvement does well to decrease the risk of one side achieving victory, and diplomatic engagement increases the ability of the belligerents to reach a compromise in the long run. Moreover, diplomatic engagement accompanied by military involvement substantially hastens the pace of stalemate outcomes. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.5117 BELL, Stephen; HINDMOOR, Andrew — <bold>Governance without government? The case of the Forest Stewardship Council.</bold> <italic>Public Administration</italic> 90(1), March 2012: 144–159.</p>
<p>Two influential but very different accounts of governance have emerged: a society-centered account which talks of governance without government and a state-centric perspective which maintains that governance largely occurs by and through governments. These have framed the debate around governance by engendering a zero-sum understanding of the relationship between state and non-state actors which obscures the way in which the presence of non-state actors can enhance the policy capacities of state actors and vice versa. The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) has been lauded as an exemplar of governance without government and has indeed, on occasions, had to overcome the indifference or even outright hostility of governments. But the society-centered account does not do justice to the range of very different and sometimes mutually beneficial relationships between the FSC and state actors. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.5118 BELLANOVA, Rocco; DUEZ, Denis — <bold>A different view on the “making” of European security: the EU Passenger Name Record System as a socio-technical assemblage.</bold> <italic>European Foreign Affairs Review</italic> 17, Special Issue, Apr. 2012: 109–124.</p>
<p>Most of the academic research on the developments of EU Justice and Home Affairs tends to overlook the role played by technologies in their relations with classical “human” and institutional actors. This is particularly problematic because in official discourses, technologies are requested, designed, and built as cornerstones of European security and its external dimension. Still, apart from “technicalities”, their use and design are generally assumed as politics-free. On the contrary, this contribution brings technologies to the forefront of the research and reframes them in terms of socio-technical assemblages. From this perspective, it analyzes the role of the 2011 EU Passenger Name Record project in the making of European security and its external dimension. The lesson learned is that human institutions are neither the only players nor the passive victims of technological determinisms. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.5137]</p>

<p>By crossing the line between moderation and extreme violence, terrorist groups retain one valuable capability: they are much less easily deterred and have few inhibitions. This article considers the three nuclear options open to terrorists: produce a radiological contaminant bomb; build a nuclear bomb; or steal or get given a nuclear device. It examines the possibilities and probabilities of each option and considers how the implementation of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) provisions might impose some constraints on terrorists' nuclear ambitions. By examining the doubtful nuclear security practices of different states and providing statistical evidence of an increase in levels of international terrorist violence, this article points to determined terrorists in time acquiring the means to acquire one or other variants of a nuclear weapon.

<p>The debates surrounding the EU energy dependency on Russia should take into account the issue of non-acceptance of governance norms, defined hereafter by logic of appropriateness. The logic of appropriateness demonstrates the importance of values and norms in the setting of energy governance. The EU is the world's largest gas-importer, which has not been able to influence effective governance in gas trade with the former Soviet Union (FSU), despite its initial strategic interest in the region. Three dimensions of EU-driven policies have failed to pass a test of the logic of appropriateness: international norms-promotion; regional and bilateral relations; and the export of its domestic market model. Each of the three components demonstrates that the EU has, until now, missed achievement of its earlier stated objectives. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.5122 BERNSTEIN, Steven; CASHORE, Benjamin — <bold>Complex global governance and domestic [environmental] policies: four pathways of influence.</bold> <italic>International Affairs</italic> 88(3), May 2012: 585–604.</p>
<p>Standard works on international environmental governance assume single-issue regimes with binding obligations designed to govern the behavior of states. Yet many of the most pressing global environmental problems, including climate change, forest degradation and biodiversity loss, are governed by an array of mechanisms—legal, non-legal, governmental and non-governmental—in complex arrangements. Examining the combined effects of these international and transnational efforts on domestic or firm policies and practices—the usual targets of such efforts—requires expanding a focus on regime “compliance” and “effectiveness” to “influence” factors from beyond state borders. To facilitate such a move, the authors develop a framework that distinguishes four distinct pathways through which actors and institutions influence domestic policies: international rules; international norms and discourse; creation of, or interventions in, markets; and direct access to domestic policy processes.

<p>The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has increasingly deferred to states' margin of appreciation when considering interferences with the right to manifest religion under Art. 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). In contrast, the Advisory Committee (AC) on the Framework Convention on National Minorities (FCNM), originally feared to be a highly politicized body, has allowed states very little room for maneuver when considering the implementation of Convention rights. In order to explore these seemingly contradictory positions, this article examines the approaches of the ECtHR and the AC towards two controversial manifestations of religion: the right to construct places of worship and the right to wear religious clothing.

<p>The Western Balkans is slipping down the list of immediate priorities of the international community. If left unattended, the Western Balkans, with its “unfinished peace”, might become a security problem again. While the economies in the region are struggling to survive the current economic crisis, the EU enlargement momentum is a key prerequisite to stability there. It is indispensable to enhance and consolidate regional cooperation. The South East Europe Cooperation Process (SEECP) is being uplifted to a level of full responsibility. With an enhanced role of the SEECP, the Regional Cooperation Council (RCC), as a leading platform and guiding operational forum in South East Europe, will certainly benefit from this process.

<p>Three dimensions must be considered in any CSDP-strategy: priorities and objectives, the types of operations that can potentially be undertaken to meet those, and the capabilities to be committed to that end. We argue that the building-blocks are already available—it remains for the EU to construct the edifice. [R]</p>
<p>62.5126 BOCK, Matthew J. — <bold>Leveraging internationalism: Indonesian perceptions of the G20.</bold> <italic>Indonesian Quarterly</italic> 39(4), 2011: 349–367.</p>
<p>The world has seen a profound shift in global governance as nation-states have sought dialogue and diplomacy in response to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, not isolation or condemnation. The G20 has been called upon by the international community to display collective leadership guiding countries through crises, and to refine the financial system making it responsive to the priorities of emerging economies. J. Kirton maintains that the G20 is a forum for “G7ization”: transmitting core G7 interests and norms to a wider set of countries crossing geographical, political, economic, and religious divides; however, these ideals remain in question. Indonesians are distrustful towards globalization partially due to the legacy of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. This study uses Indonesia as a case study to build a G20 narrative from 2008–2011 to examine sources of skepticism. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.5127 BOGDANDY, Armin von; VENZKE, Ingo — <bold>In whose name? An investigation of International Courts' public authority and its democratic justification.</bold> <italic>European Journal of International Law</italic> 23(1), 2012: 7–41.</p>
<p>Our contribution develops an understanding of international adjudication as an exercise of public authority. It emphasizes the asymmetry between international adjudication and parliamentary politics, unfolds legitimacy problems in the practice of international courts, and sketches how to interpret and develop international law in response. Procedural adjustments and politicization could react to power vested in decisions, elections might respond to the exercise of public authority, and systemic interpretation as well as a dialogue between courts may perhaps ease problems of fragmentation. We ultimately suggest that domestic constitutional organs will retain a critical role in relieving the international level from shouldering the whole legitimacy burden, contesting and accommodating authority in a normative pluriverse. We contend that the idea of transnational and possibly cosmopolitan citizenship should further guide the democratic justification of international courts' public authority. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.5128 BOSSE, Giselle — <bold>A partnership with dictatorship: explaining the paradigm shift in European Union policy towards Belarus.</bold> <italic>Journal of Common Market Studies</italic> 50(3), May 2012: 367–384.</p>
<p>The EU's policies towards autocratic regimes have come under renewed scrutiny following the popular uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in the spring of 2011, and the pressure on the EU to revise its approach towards the region has been growing. Over decades, the EU had pursued a policy of pragmatic engagement with autocratic regimes for stability in the region, to the detriment of democracy-promotion. This article examines the EU's policy towards Belarus, the “last dictatorship” in Europe, and demonstrates that the EU has not just pursued pragmatic politics in the MENA—it has also gradually moved from democracy-promotion towards interest-based functional cooperation in its relations with the most “reluctant democratizer” in eastern Europe.

<p>The EP, like any parliament, needs information for scrutinizing executive decision-making. But how does it process this information in practice? This article focuses on the EP's increasing grip on “comitology” decision-making: committees composed of national civil servants, producing executive measures that are adopted by the European Commission. Two types of changes are addressed: organizational changes and changes in working methods of EP staff. The analysis shows that the EP has effectively built up a system of decentralized police-patrol oversight, but not following more information rights as such but rather as a result of its increasing political powers. The article concludes that information affects the behavior of the EP only in combination with very specific as opposed to quite general or diffuse political rights.

<p>This contribution investigates the factors behind political group membership in the EP. In June 2009, more than 150 national parties, from the 27 member countries, joined one of the seven transnational groupings. Two main explanations for group membership are advanced. A first, traditional argument is based on the ideological or policy compatibility of the member parties. National parties will join the political group that best matches their programmatic position. A second argument focuses, instead, on the structure of incentives in the Parliament, positing that the pragmatic goals of national parties are better advanced by joining the largest and most influential groups. These arguments are tested by fitting a multinomial logit model for political group “choice” based on the 2009 Euromanifestos data. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>I analyze the EU approach towards Bosnia and Herzegovina in terms of all-embracing Europeanization process of BiH from the perspective of the EU's capabilities to influence domestic policy-making process in the country. Although it is very difficult to find the most appropriate and feasible model in a multi-ethnic Bosnia, the EU should have a more harmonized and clear policy approach towards this country. We conclude that the EU is deeply divided, incoherent, and weak in terms of its Europeanizing policies in BiH thus further deepening political impasse in the country. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The dialectic of the European constitutional revolutions has caught up with the EU, which today finds itself in the midst of its greatest crisis. The crisis is due not only to one of the greatest breakdowns in the history of the global economy, but also to the fascinating internal evolution of the European constitution since its beginning, shortly after World War II. Parallel to the growth of constitutional law, latent legitimation problems began to arise and grow cumulatively. However, once the big global banks, corporations and hedge-funds began a concerted attack on the European periphery and the euro itself, the legitimization crisis manifested itself in full. [A]</p>

<p>EU biotechnology policy is locked into a sub-optimal path, with a fractured regulatory system and limited release of new crops onto the market. An historical institutionalist analysis of this policy area reveals insights into how this state of affairs came to pass and allows predictions about the sector's future development. The case study also provides insights into how and why policies become locked into certain paths, thereby contributing to further understanding of how history can matter. In this instance, a relatively small decision early on in the policy's development was more important than a subsequent exogenous shock. [R]</p>

<p>European agencies have become an established part of the EU's architectural set-up and are the most proliferating institutional entities at the EU level. However, as their relevance and prevalence in the EU institutional landscape has increased, so have concerns about the possibility for such bodies to escape scrutiny. This article investigates a central element of agency accountability: their accountability vis-à-vis the management boards. The main and most direct confines on the grant of authority to agencies and their directors are represented by the management boards. Given the formal powers exercised by European agencies, it is important to observe to what extent boards are successful in exercising their scrutinizing roles. [R abr.]</p>

<p>The article introduces a research framework for analyzing the external dimension of EU Justice and Home Affairs after the Lisbon Treaty. The dynamics of expansion and diversification are at the center of the article and constitute a common reference point for the Special Issue. These dynamics have been triggered through deliberate decisions of involved policy-makers as well as through unintended spillover effects from other policy areas and/or decisions. The article also engages with the theoretically informed literature on the subject, which struggles with the definition of what this dimension actually constitutes, as well as how best to capture the practices of this field. We take stock of the scholarly debates by comparing the diverse approaches and discussing how much they complement each other and/or present different dimensions of a single “policy universe”.

<p>Under European Union (EU) law, Monitoring Committees (MCs) are charged with overseeing the implementation of Operational Programs. Despite their potential to influence the process of fund disbursement, relatively little is known about the Committees' operation and their impact in the new member states. This article is an empirical study of how three MCs actually work in Hungary and Slovakia. We find that whilst these bodies have relatively limited oversight capacities and are characterised by a primary concern with procedural compliance with EU requirements, nevertheless, they have an important role in providing significant opportunities for learning, information exchange, expert input and networking.

<p>The various debates to emerge on the interpretation and applicability of the norms and principles of Islamic international law, which reveal a tension between textualist and contextualist readings is also reflected in debates within Public International Law and specific to this topic, most evident in the debates on anticipatory self-defense, which framed the US position on the war in Iraq. Against this backdrop, this article evaluates Islamic law doctrines on the rightfulness of waging war, on who can declare war, and on the manner in which it is to be waged as these relate to contemporary norms and debates within international law.

<p>This paper first examines what is meant by the term “lobbying regulation” and, from a comparative international perspective, it analyzes the European Commission's attempts to increase transparency through the establishment of its June 2008 voluntary register. The second section considers the register's evolution, offering a novel, yet simple, analysis of the register's statistics between June 2008 and October 2010, focusing on registrations by consultancies, law firms, in-house corporate lobbies, NGOs and others. It also considers registration dynamics in one of the most significant and globalized sectors in the economy, namely that of automobiles. The third section closes with lessons to be learned from a comparative perspective and ponders future structural changes that may be considered by the Commission.

<p>How should we conceive of regulation in the European context? This paper develops multilevel regulation as a theoretical concept. It explores the difference and convergence between regulation and governance and develops multilevel governance and multilevel regulation as two individual heuristic concepts. We undertake an exploratory investigation of multilevelness of the regulatory space of marketing authorization of medical devices. This allows us to help focus on certain aspects of the regulatory process by acknowledging that it is no longer located in the hand of a single (governmental) actor and highlighting the necessity of considering interventions beyond the state in addressing regulatory effectiveness problems that may crop up in this context.

<p>The emergence of South-South Cooperation is a direct response by emerging and developing countries to offer an alternative to the dominance of Western countries in the realm of international development assistance. Specifically, South-South Cooperation is a rejoinder to the conditionality, in the guise of free market reforms, which Western lending institutions such as the European Union impose on emerging and developing country seeking development or temporary financing assistance. In this regard, the extent to which the Cariforum-EC Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) initialed in 2007, between the European Commission and Caribbean member states, is merely a continuation of Western free market dogma being imposed on the Caribbean states and impeding the region's South-South Cooperation initiatives must be questioned.

<p>The Treaty of Lisbon's early warning mechanism (EWM) empowers national parliaments to intervene directly at the EU level; they may now raise objections to—and even play a role in blocking—EU legislation. The EWM represents a new model of parliamentary involvement in international relations: national parliaments now constitute a virtual third chamber for the EU. Though they do not meet together in the same physical space, national parliaments collectively form a body that can, at least to some degree, perform three key parliamentary functions: legislation, representation, and deliberation. The EWM gives national parliaments the power to influence legislative outcomes at the EU level, provides a new channel of representation linking the citizen with the EU, [and] creates a new forum for debating the substantive merits of proposed EU legislation.

<p>This article reassesses the development and consolidation of minority rights in Europe with reference to W.

It revisits the development of new minority rights norms within the security-focused agenda of the early 1990s. It then considers the role of the first OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities in promoting a more justice-oriented approach before considering the significance of the coming into force of the Council of Europe's Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the development of the work of its Advisory Committee. There is evidence that a more justice-oriented approach to the realization of European minority rights standards is emerging, particularly under the Framework Convention. [R]</p>

<p>While the identity of the EU may have normative and/or other characteristics, it is fundamentally a large single market with significant institutional features and competing interest groups. Given these central characteristics, the EU may be best understood as a “market-power Europe” that exercises its power through the externalization of economic and social market-related policies and regulatory measures. Such an exercise of power, which may occur as intentional or unintentional behavior, suggests the EU is fully capable of using both persuasive and coercive means and tools to influence international affairs. By scrutinizing the EU's identity, official documents and initial evidence, the article provides an analytical framework for understanding what kind of power the EU is, what the EU says as a power and what the EU does as a power.

<p>Explanations for ASEAN's inability to more successfully influence Myanmar over the last decade have shifted from accusations that the organization does nothing to live up to its on-paper commitments to the belief that what it does is wholly ineffective. The reasons for this ineffectiveness are found in the normative and institutional architecture of ASEAN, specifically its lack of punitive sanction-based compliance mechanisms. Through focusing on ASEAN's use of public pronouncements to express interests and desires, this article takes issue with such assertions. ASEAN has been engaged in a strategy of rhetorical action to promote compliance with regional standards, [but] has been unsuccessful not because of a lack of courts and commissions, but because it has been incoherent in its political strategy.

<p>Why and how has NATO been successful? Is it due to its robust assets and capabilities? Or due to its firm commitment to its most fundamental mission: collective defense? Could it be its resolve not to compromise the unwavering principles of indivisibility of security, allied solidarity and cohesion which cement the Allies together? Is it its consensual decision-making that ensures unity for a robust and credible Alliance? Or is it NATO's role as the embodiment of the transatlantic link that binds Europe and North America? Or does NATO owe its success to its readiness, willingness and ability to adapt itself to both the slowly evolving international environment and the rapid outbreak of conflicts? The next relevant question, then, is “How can NATO maintain its relevance and success?” [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.5228]</p>

<p>[In] a monetary union, financial markets can force member-country sovereigns into default. In this sense member countries of a monetary union are downgraded to the status of emerging economies. This makes the monetary union fragile and vulnerable to changing market sentiments. It also makes it possible that self-fulfilling multiple equilibria rise. I analyze the implications of this fragility for governance of the Eurozone. I conclude that the new governance structure (ESM) does not sufficiently recognize this fragility. Some of the features of the new financial assistance are likely to increase this fragility. I suggest a different approach to deal with these problems. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This contribution asks how the WTO affects EU regulatory politics. While WTO rules have no direct effect, authors who take a rational-choice institutionalist perspective argue that these rules are enforced domestically through the mobilization of exporters triggered by the WTO dispute settlement system. This contribution challenges the plausibility of this argument and offers an alternative perspective rooted in historical and discursive institutionalism. It contends that WTO rules act as both a frame of reference influencing actors' perceptions of the scope of legitimate policy outcomes and as a rhetorical device that may be used by actors in domestic political battles over regulatory policy decisions.

<p>Evaluating EU performance in a hard case—the most recent Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT RevCon) in May 2010—this article argues that the EU not only challenged the low expectations traditionally afforded it in such a high-politics negotiation but did so by both standing together and doing the splits. By maintaining a unified and visible EU presence coupled with the utilization of Member States' own diplomatic relationships within other negotiation groupings, the EU was able to spread its voice, act as an information “conveyor belt” and ultimately enhance its role, in fact performing creditably—at least as well as the other major players. The EU can perform well and make an impact not by always speaking with one voice but with many. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article examines the role of the EU's Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) with the Africa-Caribbean-Pacific (ACP) group of states. Bringing together 105 countries from four different continents and characterized by a more than forty-five-year-long continuity and a high degree of institutionalization, the JPA is a unique institution in the EU's network of inter-parliamentary diplomacy. Despite its increased importance in the past decade, the role of the JPA remains understudied in academic literature. The analytical framework for examining this role consists of two parts. While the first part is based on a document analysis and expert interviews, the second part investigates the JPA members' own role conceptions by means of semi-structured interviews with delegates from the EP and national ACP parliaments.

<p>Recent years have seen intense intergovernmental deliberations concerning governance in the field of environment. Their aim has been to address the role of the institutions that provide platforms for international environmental cooperation. There are two main lines of enquiry: the role of regime-specific institutions that cater to sectoral regulatory frameworks (popularly known as multilateral environmental agreements, or MEAs); and the role of institutions established to follow up on global environmental conferences or a specific environmental task. Most of these institutions reflect intergovernmental consensual process. The need to bring order to environmental governance has assumed great importance and urgency if environmental cooperation is to be achieved. This paper explores, in particular, the role of the UN Environment Program and its potential for conversion to a specialized agency of the UN. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.5232]</p>

<p>For 20 years, a conflict over the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia has been smoldering in Georgia. After the open civil war from 1990 to 1995, the UN and the OSCE sought to mediate between the parties to the conflict. The US wanted to strengthen Georgia vis-à-vis its powerful neighbor Russia. The August 2008 war between Georgia and Russia has changed the situation considerably. The OSCE and the UN had to withdraw their missions; the US curtailed its engagement. This is the EU's hour. As the only international broker on site, it has an obligation to prevent renewed escalation.

<p>Accession of Turkey to the EU has brought a focus on issues of corruption and public ethics. Given that such issues have been concerning the EU both before and after the accession of other countries, the current Turkish context is assessed in terms of laws, institutions and strategies. The article argues that Turkey is well-served in terms of laws, institutions and strategies, but that there are issues relating to the continuing state tradition and socio-political and administrative culture, to implementation of laws and the effectiveness of institutions, as well as the connectedness of the overall anti-corruption and public ethics approaches. In particular, the question of changing current tradition and culture are central to Turkey's progress in meeting European concerns and expectations.

<p>This paper posits three phases in EU financial market regulation. (1) For the 1990s, established scholarship suggests leadership by public actors in the context of development of the single market and relations with the US. We characterize [this] as “public-private” regulation. (2) In the new millennium, regulation shifted towards “private-public”, with regulators paying more attention to the demands of large financial firms; I focus upon the Committee of European Securities Regulators and rating credit agencies. (3) As from 2010, EU policy-makers react to the spillover of the financial crisis from markets to member states, some limits to private-public governance have been underlined. The paper discusses positions taken by the EP, moderating claims made for “technical” rule-making and opening up the possibility of wider intellectual and policy debate. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>We examine whether and [in] what circumstances World Bank and IMF programs affect the likelihood of major government crises. We find that crises are, on average, more likely as a consequence of World Bank programs. We also find that governments face an increasing risk of entering a crisis when they remain under an IMF or World Bank arrangement once the economy's performance improves. The international financial institution's (IFI) scapegoat function thus seems to lose its value when the need for financial support is less urgent. While the probability of a crisis increases when a government turns to the IFIs, programs inherited by preceding governments do not affect the probability of a crisis. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In the EU, the coherent delivery of foreign and security policy is hampered by the fragmentation of authority, budgets and capacities. The EU has tried to repair this, with as guidance the development of a “culture of coordination” in its concept of Civil-Military Coordination (CMCO). The first decade of ESDP/CSDP learns that within the Council, civilian and military crisis-management are still separated, despite the creation of the CMPD and the EEAS. The evolution of the comprehensive approach turns out to be one of slow adaptation and learning from mistakes from EU missions and overall foreign policy effectiveness. The areas of comprehensive planning and conduct of operations, effective financing of CSDP and strategic guidance and leadership needs work. Improvement will hinge on a cultural change within the EU structures. [A]</p>

<p>The definition of EU-NATO relations is an ongoing and sensitive issue. Does the Lisbon Treaty promote partnership between the two organizations or does it merely highlight existing incongruence? Three specific treaty-based aspects are of core importance to the future of mutual relations. The first is the extent to which the treaty contributes to the formation of a compelling strategic direction for the EU and the type of partner (or competitor) the EU may become. The second concerns collective defense, mutual aid and assistance and the solidarity clause. The third is the perennial resource issue, which features heavily in the treaty's CSDP provisions. Two related aspects are of special relevance: the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the role of the European Defense Agency (EDA).</p>

This article illustrates the EU's multifaceted effort to engage with the Somali crisis, which has been labeled a “comprehensive approach”.

<p>In the field of EU migration policies, a large number of legal, administrative, and institutional tightening measures have been established in the name of domestic security since the early 1990s. These measures have been criticized because they allegedly lower the democratic quality of EU migration governance. Yet, the EU seeks to export its rules and regulations beyond its borders to neighboring third states through its association policies. This article explores whether the rules of EU migration can constitute a step toward democratization of migration governance in neighboring countries, where provisions of transparent, participatory, or accountable decision-making cannot be taken for granted. Taking the example of the Moroccan 2003 law on migration, the paper demonstrates that the EU was fairly successful in inducing the adoption of legislation in line with provisions of democratic governance.

<p>The EU increasingly aspires to be a global peace and security actor. Using the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as a test case to analyze such ambitions, this article reveals that the EU's attempts to build peace and security are severely compromised by its bureaucratic and organizational complexity as well as by its ineffective policies. In fact, the EU's state-centered approach in the DRC has resulted in the EU's inability to deal with (1) the realities of governance in the DRC and (2) the strong transborder dimensions of the conflict. As a result, the EU continues to lack a coherent strategy for the DRC, despite a large budget.

<p>International criminal courts have in recent years been criticized for being “undemocratic” in their dealings with populations affected by the crimes they are concerned with.

Then, [drawing] from classical and recent theories in legal sociology and legal anthropology, [it] assesses whether there is a theoretical basis for the demand for democracy. There is no viable argument that would support requiring a direct democratic basis for international criminal courts, but there are clear points of departure for insisting that they should pursue wider social aims, for identifying these aims, and for identifying principles that can guide the conduct of relationships with affected populations.

<p>Starting from the case of the fight against smoking, this article shows that the EU is a major explanatory variable in body management (<italic>gouvernement des corps</italic>) in European countries. The article in fact reveals two mechanisms by means of which the EU exerts its influence in this area in European countries. On the one hand, there is the normative European mechanism, through which the EU forces body management by law. On the other hand, this article presents a mechanism of information: the EU influences body management by persuasion and coercion. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4825b]</p>

<p>This contribution considers mechanisms for rule-based fiscal policy coordination to replace the failed Stability and Growth Pact in the euro area. It argues in favor of soft debt targets as a means of addressing problems caused by excessive debt. It is shown how such targets can be safely operated, supported by an effective excess debt protocol. A division of labor between fiscal and monetary policy is proposed, whereby fiscal policy is used for long-term targets and monetary policy for short-term stabilization. We then design a monitoring agency, in the form of a fiscal policy commission for Europe, to make the excess debt protocol operational. The contribution also addresses the issue of moral hazard, by proposing that governments be abandoned to financial markets at the upper debt limit, a commitment to be spelled out in advance.

<p>The UN's concept of peace has undergone a profound change over the decades. In light of these conceptual developments, aspects of institutional change have also become manifest. The paper summarizes a survey of 65 years of UN practice aimed at tracking the conceptual-institutional change and assessing its quality. A comparison of the organizational concept as coined by the UN founders with the concept as framed by subsequent organizational practice has brought to the fore various shifts in fundamental world views and beliefs as to what “peace” is, and for whom and by what means it is to be established. These developments become evident in several institutional dimensions of the UN: changing rhetoric, peace policy, and institutional structures. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In this analysis of the recent debate on defense policy in Germany, the authors highlight a growing re-evaluation of the German and European strategic environment, and a seeming willingness on the part of German policy-makers to identify a common European solution to the current defense-capabilities gap. After analyzing why German politicians no longer seem to dismiss the idea of a common European army as the unrealizable dream of idealists, the authors present the difficult questions that German policy-makers, and their European allies, will need to confront should they wish to turn their ideas into concrete policy, and suggest ways in which such a project could be realized in the long term.

<p>In view of the decreasing levels of public support for successive EU enlargements, this article examines how political elites attempt to bridge this growing gap. Drawing insights from discursive institutionalism, the article undertakes a systematic analysis of an aspect widely neglected in the existing literature on enlargement: the relation between the discursive interaction among policy-makers at the EU level (co-ordinative discourse) and direct political communication at the national level (communicative discourse). Focusing on the case of Germany, the article argues that debates on enlargement at the EU and national levels have been growing apart since the 1970s, and discusses the implications of this discursive gap for the public legitimization of past and future enlargements.

<p>The introduction of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) concept is an example of a very successful case of norm-entrepreneurship in international law. Seemingly against all odds, a vague political slogan has gained, within a decade, nearly a worldwide support. After the success of NATO-led Libya intervention “Unified Protector”, the bulk of the critics with regard to this concept appear to have been muted. This article examines the ingredients for success for such a norm-creation initiative. As was the case with regard to the crafting of the self-determination norm, political rhetoric can solidify to legal principle. With regard to R2P, at the beginning of the 21st c., time was very propitious for such a development as there was a widespread conviction that international law had to be “humanized”. [R]</p>

<p>This article focuses on the negotiation of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) which form the central focus of the commitments made in the Cotonou Agreement, signed in 2000 by the EU and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states. EPAs are part of a much wider trend witnessed since the creation of the WTO, characterized by the proliferation of bilateral free trade agreements. The article argues that both the material and ideational interests of the EU need to be considered alongside the historical context of EU-ACP relations. The EU is making a concerted effort to “lock in” neoliberalism across the seven different sub-regions of the ACP group by negotiating EPAs that include both reciprocal trade liberalization and various “trade-related” issues.

<p>Japan's approach to human security has commonly been regarded as progressive, imbued with liberal internationalist commitment. I offer an alternative and critical perspective on Japanese human security, arguing that the mainstream understanding neglects some important features of the phenomenon. I pay attention to the tight links between Japanese discourses and practices of international development and humanitarian assistance, refugee policy, counter-terrorism, and NGO regulation. So far, these issue areas have only been examined separately in the literature, thereby obscuring the strong affinities of human security to national security and non-liberal bureaucratic control. I argue that once the international and the domestic sides of Japanese human security are studied together, the approach can no longer be understood as resting on a combination of liberal values and “Asian” values.

<p>The global environmental governance architecture is set to undergo major reforms, with the main decisions on reform to be taken at the June 2012 Rio+20 UN Conference on Sustainable Development. Discussions on reform have focused on whether the UN Environment Program (UNEP) should retain its institutional status as a subsidiary body of the UN General Assembly, or be transformed into a specialized agency—a World Environment Organization—of the UN. The choice of institutional form, however, cannot be made without reference to both the needs of global environmental governance, and the factors impeding the effectiveness of the current governance architecture. This article takes a historical perspective, highlighting the similarity between the current debate on institutional form, function and financing; and the choices that the original designers of the governance architecture made 40 years ago.

<p>The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has been playing a significant role to enhance economic development of the member states of the organization. Afghanistan's inclusion offered an opportunity to begin a process of regional integration in order to facilitate peace, political stability, and economic development. Likewise, Afghanistan's entry provides the organization a gateway to Central Asia and beyond. This paper explores the potential role of SAARC to promote economic development of Afghanistan. There is a range of economic potential that can be tapped from SAARC, which includes greater trade and investment, regional connectivity to remove isolation, alleviating poverty, attaining food security, and better utilization of energy resources.

<p>The role of environmental provisions in US trade agreements has evolved dramatically over the past twenty-five years. The new approach strengthens the environmental provisions in US FTAs by requiring actionable agendas for improved environmental management with the possibility for non-compliance to result in financial or trade sanctions. This is a triumph for the international environmental movement and creates a provocative precedent for future FTAs. However, the US-Peru TPA also illustrates how applying trade pressure to achieve environmental ends can result in unanticipated negative impacts in practice if regime design is not carefully considered. We first describe how the environmental provisions in US FTAs have evolved over time, [and then] analyze how recent progress demonstrates deeper policy shifts in the US approach to trade and environment linkages.

<p>A central goalpost characterizing the EU has consisted of escaping Europe's notorious past, and this aspiration has then also profoundly impacted the Union's approach to the construction of political space. Sovereignty has for the EU subsequently been off limits. However, the more recent claim of the Union having succeeded in reaching its initial goal of leaving the past behind radically alters the situation. It does not merely set the EU free but also compels it to reconsider the underlying generative grammar. Does this then also mean that the EU is bound to return to more sovereignty-geared approaches premised on clear distinctions between self and other or does it still aspire to stay with the previous script by refraining from adopting the rather strict organizing principles characteristic of modern states?

<p>The Arab Spring shed glaring light on years of a failed EU-Mediterranean policy. In sharp contrast to its heavy rhetoric on democracy-promotion, the EU had followed since 9/11 [2001] a policy approach that was informed by security interests and that resulted in the factual backing of Arab autocracies. The contribution analyzes reactions to the Arab Spring of diverse actors within the EU. To what extent is the EU willing and able to learn? Theoretically the contribution draws on a new concept on the Logics of Action within a Euro-Mediterranean political space, determined by changing structures. The Arab Spring has changed the EU's logic of action to a far lesser extent than expected. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.5438]</p>

<p>After a brief period of positive relations between Russia and NATO in the early 1990s, a whole series of crises in relations have led to a general deterioration of the relationship. These crises have resulted from two very different conceptions of self-identity and of the future of security in Europe. Although the divisions became evident already in before the turn of the millennium, the policies of Presidents V. Putin and D. Medvedev aimed at rebuilding Russia's role as a great power contributed further to the divisions. Three areas of NATO policy have been central to Russia's growing opposition to NATO: expansion eastward, the development of a missile shield, and the globalization of NATO's involvement. Prospects for a real reconciliation between Russia and NATO are not positive. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.5228]</p>

Still, great divergences were apparent in the intensity of discussion between the forums. The article creates an understanding of these divergences.

<p>This article examines the rationale and implications of NATO's missile defense program which was an appropriate, but problematic, response to collective defense requirements. By designing a theater-based missile defense in southeastern Europe, the US has returned the question of credible collective defense back to NATO. The discussion provides a survey of the missile defense debates in NATO and the evolution of the concept under President B. Obama. It then examines the challenge of constructively engaging Russia in the dynamics of NATO's missile defense decisions and deployments.

Potential risks for Paris and London are limited, given their dominance of existing EU foreign policy institutions and their privileged position in supplying the EEAS with high-caliber staff.

Yet, contrary to their official rhetoric, African countries continue to find low priority in aid policies. Development cooperation policy in the V4 is largely focused on the close neighborhood and current political and business stakes triumph over the “needs and merits” logic of aid-allocation. The V4 policy also runs counter to the various international obligations for which the countries have signed up.

The core explanation is that as the EU has evolved toward an increasingly “state-like” entity scholarship focused on the EU has evolved as well. The evolution has led the field of EU Studies to resemble much more closely other state focused fields such as American or French politics, suggesting a normalization of the EU and EU Studies.

<p>In 2005, the EP rejected the directive “on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions”, which had been drafted and supported by the European Commission, the Council and well-organized industrial interests, with an overwhelming majority. In this unusual case, a coalition of opponents of software patents prevailed over a strong industry-led coalition. This article develops an explanation based on political discourse showing that two stable and distinct discourse coalitions can be identified and measured over time. The apparently weak coalition of software patent opponents shows typical properties of a hegemonic discourse coalition. This configuration of the discourse gave leeway for an alternative course of political action by the European Parliament. The notion of discourse coalitions and related structural features of the discourse are operationalized by drawing on social network analysis. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Why and how do international courts justify decisions with citations to their own case law? We argue that, like domestic review courts, international courts use precedent at least in part to convince “lower” (domestic) courts of the legitimacy of judgments. Several empirical observations are consistent with this view, which are examined through a network analysis of European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) citations. (1) The Court cites precedent based on the legal issues in the case, not the country of origin.

<p>Sanctions taken by the UN Security Council with the support of the international community against individuals are an important element of the international effort against terrorism as a global phenomenon.

<p>EU-US relations in internal security demonstrated a tendency to be turbulent. As a result, EU-US cooperation has not evolved into a partnership but into an asymmetrical relationship within which the EU has become a “norm-taker”—a recipient of US security norms. With this perspective in mind, it is time to take stock of the changes in the institutional configuration of the EU brought about by the Lisbon Treaty. In particular, the EP, often a vocal critic of the transfer of US security norms to the EU in the past, has been empowered to consent to international agreements. We therefore examine whether the EU remains a recipient of US security norms after Lisbon through the first case of its kind: the EU-US Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) Agreement.

<p>Ideas about pursuing a more equal balance between men and women in decision-making bodies and “parity democracy” have been promoted by both the Council of Europe and the institutions of the EU for nearly 20 years. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, several member states implemented policy to encourage more balanced participation for men and women in national and sub-national decision-making bodies. However, despite its own policy statements to the contrary, the EU decision-making bodies themselves remain male-dominated. This article asks how the EU on the one hand provided an impetus for some of the member states to take action to increase gender balance in decision-making while, on the other hand, its own institutions have remained largely unchanged.

<p>The EU claims to be a free association of twenty-seven democratic states, and as such dedicated to promoting “good governance”. However, the failure to respond to the rejection of the European Constitution/Lisbon Treaty by three separate national referenda set the tone for what was to follow. The EU's anti-democratic response to successive crises in the Eurozone demonstrates that it has evolved into a device for creating permanent economic and political structures which deprive electorates of choice and replace democracy with technocracy in pursuit of a neoliberal agenda. Nowhere is S. Gill's concept of “New Constitutionalism”—under which political and legal mechanisms, often imposed from outside the country in question, are employed to restrict democratic influence in the political economy—more applicable than in the case of the EU.

<p>Recognizing the limitations of existing conceptualizations of path dependence, this article advances a “path-interdependent” approach to account for endogenous policy change by incorporating a more central role for agency through learning and problem-solving mechanisms. Additionally, it argues that monolithic conceptualizations of institutions should be unpacked to reveal their configurative elements. In doing so, attention is drawn to the way in which intra-policy dynamics may generate pressures for change and to the possibility for the mutual existence and co-evolution of continuity and change. These arguments are illustrated empirically through two cases of radical reform in EU cohesion policy. [R]</p>

In the aftermath of the dismemberment of the Soviet Union, a palpable structural transformation was witnessed in international and regional affairs. Old power centers disappeared and new power equations emerged, such as the Sino-Russian axis, the South Asian and the US-India strategic co-operation.

<p>NATO's 2010 Strategic Concept identifies cooperative security as one of “three essential core tasks” to be achieved in part “through a wide network of partner relationships with countries and organizations around the globe”. To facilitate the construction of this broader network of partners, the Alliance adopted a new partnership policy in April 2011, designed to facilitate “more efficient and flexible” partnership arrangements. The policy offers a number of new tools to foster the cooperative security efforts deemed so critical under the new strategic concept and permits potential and existing partners an opportunity to shape their own relationships with NATO. However, it moves the Alliance toward less differentiation between partners and fails to clarify the role of like-minded partners in preserving and extending the liberal security order.

<p>This article shows that the dynamics of expansion and diversification of the external dimension of Justice and Home Affairs (ED-JHA) identified in the editorial of this special issue can be altered by three processes: further institutionalization, politicization and operationalization. Those three dimensions participate in the creation of different patterns for the ED-JHA that can be summarized under the metaphor of a kaleidoscope. The dynamics of expansion and diversification can therefore take different forms, following which kaleidoscopic view prevails and leading to different ways of participation and influencing policy-making. Institutionalization is identifiable by routinization, structuration of decision-making, diffusion of values as well as competition for power and resources across the actors. The roles endorsed by the EP and JHA agencies are symptomatic of a politicization trend, which widens the circle of actors in this area. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.5137]</p>

<p>Several measures are being initiated by the international community to secure sensitive materials. Al Qaeda's open interest in acquiring nuclear weapons and the rise of terrorist activity in nuclear-armed Pakistan have triggered a global interest in the need to secure nuclear weapons and materials. In April 2010, [US] President B. Obama invited some key countries and international organizations in Washington to frame a new regime for nuclear security. The emerging regime includes some older initiatives as well as some new mechanisms, and it must address a number of issues. These range from defining nuclear security threats to finding the right kind of institution promoting nuclear security. The enthusiasm for the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit will depend on how the participating countries and the international community deal with these challenges. [R]</p>

<p>New technologies for border control and surveillance are increasingly being applied in the field of Justice and Home Affairs.

This article investigates why, despite a clear divergence between the EU's declarations and practice in balancing fundamental freedoms and security, the EU has faced little external criticism regarding its extraterritorial instruments. This article argues that inconsistency and contradiction between the EU's various policy approaches has contributed to the unintentional development of an external governance model that maximizes the EU's position internationally.

<p>UN Security Council Resolution 1973 raises important questions of the legality and legitimacy of the military intervention in Libya. A closer examination of Resolution 1973 shows the considerably broad scope of the authorization which can—with certain restrictions—also be regarded as a legal basis for regime change in Libya. Against the background of the rather weak legal restraints on the Security Council and in light of the generally accepted post-Cold War practice of the Security Council, Resolution 1973 does not transgress the Security Council's competences under the UN Charter. However, the authorization is problematic from a policy perspective and with regard to its legitimacy. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.5438]</p>

<p>This article analyzes how the concept of “representativeness/representativity” has been used by the EU institutions to structure interest intermediation. It examines how the concept emerged and has been defined, and identifies its scope of application. “Representativeness” is mostly used to refer to organizational features of the interest groups, but is occasionally used in relation to representative aspects of the overall system of interest representation. The focus is primarily on aspects of “descriptive representativeness”—in particular, territorial and thematic representativeness—rather than on “procedural representativeness” that guarantees authorization and accountability. Originally applied to the social partners only, the White Paper on European Governance proposed to extend representativeness to the wider category of civil society organizations. The application of this concept proves more problematic than it does to the social partners. [R, abr.]</p>

Spanish governments from 1989 to 2004 dropped the initial intention to control the timing and gradually increased support for the process as the result of not only side-payments and trade-offs, but also the development of norms and rules defining appropriate action in the successive steps of the process and the existence of social mechanisms that elicited pro-norm behavior.

This institutional balance suffers a constant threat. The federal or the intergovernmental dynamic of the system will in the end, give it a consistent and durable shape. The Treaty of Lisbon does not modify the existing frame of government, but it does go into the topic in depth; that is the reason for the contradictions and deficiencies to subsist. There has nevertheless been a more complete rationalization of the institutional competences and a more visible interaction of the various institutions. They are now better adapted to the new and wider geographic dimensions of the EU. But the EU is still far from reaching the goal that expresses the ambition to shape a federal organization fully based on European democratic willpower. [R]</p>

<p>The objective of a “people-oriented” ASEAN has not readily translated into easy relations between the Association and regional civil society. Discourse inspired by global civil society has found plenty to focus on in the gap between aspiration and practice. However, not enough attention has been directed to the bridges that are gradually forming across that gap, and suggests that an “English School”-derived account can give a fuller picture of what is under way in this area. From this perspective, a process of institutionalization is observable among the different actors. By tackling—consciously or unconsciously—core problems such as recognition, location of common ground, confidence-building, and burden-sharing, this process is potentially transforming the relations of a state-imposed hierarchy into something more societal.

<p>This article traces the evolution of international environmental law and dialogue from Stockholm, 1972, to Rio+20, 2012, with a focus on the changing dynamics of the discourse between developed and developing countries, and the corresponding interpretational shifts in the application of differential treatment in international environmental law—climate-change law in particular. From 1972 to 2002, the international community witnessed an exponential growth in the number and range of multilateral environmental agreements, an array of tools, techniques and practices, and a rapid expansion of differential treatment in favor of developing countries. Differential treatment in central obligations, albeit disputed from its inception, found pride of place in the Kyoto Protocol negotiated in 1997. The decade that followed, 2002 to 2012, witnessed heightened popular and political mobilization around the climate-change issue. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.5341]</p>

And it would be another three years before the Warsaw Pact was formed.

And Turkey would prove itself as a key ally—benefiting from the security provided by NATO, but also making major political and military contributions to the Alliance's effectiveness.

Still, the OSCE is a useful multilateral forum for all its participating states. An objective assessment of the Summit in Astana, essential to evaluate the added value of the OSCE for the future security of its Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian space, requires a look at the Summit's genesis and driving forces, the determining of its positive and negative aspects, as well as an analysis of its results.</p>

Paradoxically, even when faced with an existential crisis, EMU continues to evolve through gradual change. Empirical evidence points to the existence of a dual process of change—layering and redirection. [R]</p>

In terms of the values reflected in the CSFP, the emergence of European military space autonomy can be interpreted as an encouraging development in which the ominous pursuit of space domination by the US is balanced by the activities of an ally rather than en enemy, and where the less militaristic and more inclusive values of Europe significantly influence future developments in space. Currently the EU is moving slowly and haltingly towards a position not dissimilar to the US one, though vastly less resourced. [R]</p>

<p>The Evolutionary Model for Multilateral Negotiations (EMMN) is utilized to identify the most likely outcome of the Caspian Sea negotiations. Since 1993, the five littoral states have been negotiating over the legal status of the Caspian Sea but have not reached any agreement, causing a Tragedy of the Commons to unfold. EMMN is a methodology that focuses on asymmetric multilateral negotiations, like those over the Caspian Sea, in which each negotiator seeks the most preferable outcome for which he or she can gain enough support from other negotiators. An advantage of the EMMN approach is that it considers the power of the negotiators as a determining factor in the final resolution. The results are compared with those of other studies on Caspian Sea conflict where the powers of decision-makers are not taken into account. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Despite an increased level of legalization of (JHA), academic literature has paid little attention to the role of law in this field. By drawing on two different strands of the literature, namely “politics of law” and the “autopoietic theory of law”, this paper addresses the question on how legalization has affected the practice of extra-territorial border control by the EU and its Member States. Empirically, the article focuses on border control performed by Frontex joint operations and by individual Member States. We observe that legalization affects the approach of “remote control” in two different and competing ways: it enhances the autonomy of national and supranational executives, whereas legalization, in all its hybrid manifestations, stimulates a transnational legal discourse that policy-makers can neither oppress nor ignore.

We demonstrate that this special protection is not adequately justified and betrays an incoherence in the Court's underlying view of democracy. Building on an alternative, concentric model of democracy, we argue—against the Court—that their closeness to the center of actual political decision-making implies that restrictions on political parties can be more readily justified than those on other associations or individuals.

<p>The global governance of climate change represents one of the more profound and, to date, intractable sets of problems confronting humanity. Legitimacy, accountability, fairness, and representation matter as well as effectiveness. In the absence of effective centralized authority, these democratic norms need to be sought in a polycentric context. An approach to democratization is advanced that de-emphasizes authoritative formal institutions, and instead operates in the more informal realm of the engagement and contestation of discourses in global public spheres. Democracy here is conceptualized not in terms of elections and constitutions, but in aspirations for inclusive, competent, and dispersed reflexive capacity.

<p>In parallel or tacit agreement with the European cultural model, [European] union political projects have evolved over time from imperial ambitions in the global democratic principles. The current project of European integration, initiated by the Pan Europe manifesto as a philosophical-political alternative centered on the ideas of individual, personality and freedom, has a striking normative component. Both its theoretical and ideological initiatives are animated by the moral imperative, i.e. peaceful salvation. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4264]</p>

<p>Although scholars and practitioners have long argued that greater political coherence will make the EU a more effective international actor, the relationship between coherence and effectiveness has not been well defined or tested. This article defines the two concepts, proposes three hypotheses regarding the relationship between them, and examines the extent and consequences of EU coherence on an issue that the EU has highlighted as essential to its foreign policy mission: the good functioning of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The EU exhibited considerable coherence in its response to the US's campaign for ICC “non-surrender agreements”, yet failed in its effort to shape the behavior of other states. Coherence is not sufficient in a multi-centric world order where many others do not share the EU's collective policy preferences. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The geographic proximity, the strategic significance and traditional contacts, the carbon and mineral raw materials in the Mediterranean, coutnries as well as Europe's need for cheap labor have all contributed to the dynamic development of the links between the two regions. This has strongly depended on the integration process in Europe. European-Mediterranean relations have become a model of interregional relations in both political and economic terms. One particularity of the system of relations between the EU and the Mediterranean has been the gradual transition to the Free Trade Zones in addition to common transportation and energy networks.</p>

<p>The modern national state with its liberal democracy is challenged both at the national and at the international level. The development of a federal EU-model implies centralization of decisions and also revisions in parts of democratic ideology; a model of social group representation, consociationalism, is expanding. At the national level, immigration is one factor that stimulates ideas of multiculturalism. In both these challenging views, nationalism and the national state are seen as solutions to be abandoned or revised. There are also arguments for a liberal nationalism criticizing the political, economic and philosophical accusations against nationalism. The article analyzes such ideas, pro or con, that are suggesting revisions of the traditional democratic order to create a post-national state or a multicultural state. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article analyzes the extent of welfare state tendencies towards individualization of social citizenship rights from the perspective of a Cosmopolitan Europe. Empirical study of legislated reforms to national insurance benefit schemes in three European countries since 1980 suggests that individualization processes transform modern West European societies through the construction of self-sufficiency, the individualization of responsibility, and the personalization of social services. Although European welfare states vary with respect to the extent of individualization of social categories, late modernization processes appear to transform national solidarities into a cosmopolitan solidarity and hence affect all modern institutions of welfare states, including bureaucratic categories, legal rights, and meaning of work.

<p>The EU's strategic aim of being surrounded by a ring of secure, democratic, and prosperous friends has not yet materialized. This article locates the root of the problem within the EU's institutional set-up. Starting from interviews and documentary analysis, it uses Armenia as a case study to demonstrate how competition within and between the EP, the Council, and the Commission has led to internal, horizontal, and vertical inconsistencies that have seriously hampered the EU's capacity to promote reforms. If recent institutional reforms have been designed to address precisely these problems, sociological rational choice and historical institutionalism suggest that it remains to be seen to what extent these recent reforms and initiatives [can] bring about a change substantial enough to make the EU more successful in its neighborhood.

<p>The EU has been Australia's largest economic partner for more than twenty-five years. Yet, the EU remains the only major trading and investment partner with which Australia does not have an Economic Integration Agreement, either in force or under negotiation. This article analyzes the legal and policy issues that affect their trade and investment relations. Despite the existence of an EU-Australia Partnership Framework, a declaration in the process of revision into an agreement, the article considers that attention diversion from larger trading and investment partners, for the EU, and opposition to the distortive effects of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), for Australia, are the two main reasons for the low priority that each party attaches to bilateral trade and investment liberalization with the other.

<p>This article argues that the role of the non-permanent (elected) members of the Security Council vis-à-vis the permanent members has gradually changed over the last twenty years. The widened scope of Security Council's activities since the early 1990s meant that the permanent members require support from the elected members in order to guarantee the effective implementation of resolutions. Powerful emerging economies like Brazil, India, and South Africa, as elected members in 2011–2012, claim more participation and influence. And the small and middle-sized states develop their international profile by presenting political initiatives in the arena of the Security Council. As a result the elected members are directly and more substantially involved in the decision-making process—thus increasing the Council's legitimization. [R]</p>

<p>The WTO's Doha Round is in trouble; but so is the way we talk about the institution and the negotiations.

<p>62.5249 WILLIAMS, Shirley — <bold>Multilateral nuclear disarmament.</bold> <italic>Political Quarterly</italic> 83(2), Apr.–June 2012: 334–342.</p>
<p>Although the political salience of nuclear disarmament has fallen dramatically since the end of the Cold War, the threat posed by nuclear weapons today remains at least as great as it was before 1989. The growing number of states either armed with or actively developing nuclear weapons programmes has placed existing control and monitoring frameworks under strain. In this article, Baroness Williams, a long time campaigner for multilateral nuclear disarmament, discusses the nature of today's nuclear threat and particularly the political challenge presented by states whose behaviour is not predictable. If further proliferation is to be prevented, the international community must renew its efforts at implementing a robust regime of control. The IAEA must be given the authority and the resources necessary to conduct inspections anywhere in the world without prior warning. At the same time, the world's nuclear states powers must begin genuine efforts at disarmament. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4295]</p>

<p>The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), an unprecedented set of global commitments to reduce various forms of human deprivation and promote human development, are set to expire in 2015. Despite their promise, the MDGs are flawed in a variety of ways. The development community is already discussing what improved development framework should replace the MDGs. I argue that global justice advocates should focus first on the procedure for developing the post-2015 development framework. Specifically, they should create spaces for citizens, especially the most marginalized and oppressed, to actively deliberate about the form and content of a future global development framework, and ensure that this deliberation receives political uptake in formal intergovernmental processes for deciding the post-2015 framework.

<p>The paper revisits neofunctionalism, the theory that was once popular for explicating the experiences of European integration. As it fell out of favor in the late 20th c., few efforts have been made to re-appreciate the value of this theoretical account in shedding light on the integration processes both in Europe and elsewhere. This paper re-examines neofunctionalism through its core concept, namely “spillover”, from which to draw comparative references on the East Asian integration. A refinement of the theory will be essential for us to re-evaluate the theoretical implications of neofunctionalism for today's world. [R]</p>

<p>The OSCE is in a severe crisis. After the enlargement of the EU and NATO, the OSCE suspended work in East Central Europe. In Southeastern Europe, the most important area of OSCE activity in the 1990s, the organization is increasingly being replaced by the EU. The OSCE has failed to increase its activities significantly in the post-Soviet realm. Many Western states may wish for such an expansion of activity, but the overwhelmingly authoritarian regimes of the post-Soviet realm see this as unwanted interference. Thus, the OSCE has to wait for a new great moment, a second wave of democratic upheavals, before it can again champion the values of democracy and rule of law as declared in the Charter of Paris for a New Europe.

<p>Italy and Turkey have built over the decades a partnership based on economic cooperation, shared international concerns, and a common vision of Turkey's future as a member of the EU. Italian perceptions of Turkey, however, are negatively affected by anti-Muslim sentiments among the Italian public. Negative views about Turkey's post-Kemalist establishment have become more widespread also among Italian elites in the context of the debate on Turkey's “drift from the West”. The “Arab Spring” of 2011, which has forced Ankara to appreciate the common challenges it faces in the MENA region together with the rest of the West, has partly assuaged concerns of a “de-alignment”, confirming that Turkey has specific ambitions but also broadly shares Western strategic assessments.

<p>Both Turkey's and Italy's strategic centers lie outside the Mediterranean, in particular the North Atlantic and Europe, where their major alliances, namely NATO and EU, are located. Their gravitation towards these centers has involved the two countries in policy frameworks in the Mediterranean initiated by those alliances, such as the NATO Mediterranean Dialogue, the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and the Union for the Mediterranean. This situation has been altered by the end of the Cold War and the weakening of the alliances' rationales and, even more so, by the post-September 11 American decision to intervene militarily in the Middle East. This intervention has shifted Turkey's and Italy's focus in their southern approaches from the Mediterranean to the Middle East. While Italy's shift is peripheral with respect to its foreign policy strategy and is mostly an opportunistic move, Turkey's shift may have a more structural significance and bring about changes in its strategic posture. Cooperation between Turkey and Italy in the Mediterranean and the Middle East involves less strategic-intense areas, such as developing structured economic cooperation in the area, support for small and medium sized firms, transport and energy security. In this sense, the Union for the Mediterranean, if duly reformed, could offer opportunities for expanding cooperation.

<p>Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania initiated development cooperation as part of their EU accession process.

Of the three countries, Estonia appears to have progressed furthest in fostering development cooperation, whereas Latvian efforts have suffered due to deep cuts in its state budget.

<p>This article examines Turkish foreign policy towards the Caucasus, the region Turkey regards as a land of opportunity and influence. It first looks into the transformation of Turkish foreign policy in the last decade and its subsequent impact on its policy towards Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia. Turkey's international stance has been repositioned from being the “buffer-zone” of the Cold War, to the “model country” of the post-Soviet era and finally to the “central country” of the new international order, which influenced its policy towards the Caucasus. Finally, the article posits that Turkey is an energy corridor which connects the region to Europe and effective use of energy resources and healthy integration of the region to the world economy would bring peace and stability to the Caucasus.

The reasons for such a sudden shift in strategic orientation need to be identified in order to propose ways of coming out of the deadend situation and to renew gradual action in the direction of armament control, an indispensable condition for the strengthening of non-distribution regimes.</p>

A Janus-faced view of China is initially revealed: a growing power perceived as an auspicious trade partner on the one hand; a troubling new actor in the international context on the other. Further analysis shows shades of grey that reveal a multifaceted, continuously evolving image of China that tells us much about both countries. The depiction of China's rising power, whose direction and purpose suggest a paradigm of “modernity without enlightenment”, brings light to Colombia's unsettled accounts with democracy and development.

<p>In the highly intricate conditions of current global security, the determination and assessment of where the international community is standing at the end of the NPT Review Conference related to the Middle East's nuclear realities gains importance. For this reason, this paper focuses on two important questions. The first is related to the highly debated issue of whether there is any chance of a nuclear cascade becoming a reality in the Middle East assuming that the Iranian nuclear crisis is not been solved and remains in stalemate. The second question tries asks whether some members of the P-5's new counter-proliferation attempts that are introduced to the Middle East region have any chance of working at all. [R]</p>

<p>Contrary to ideological explanations, the US initially sought to cooperate with the Soviet Union, did not initially pressure communist groups outside the Soviet orbit, and later sought to engage communist groups that promised to undermine Soviet power. The US decision to confront the Soviets stemmed instead from the distribution of power. US policy shifted toward a confrontational approach as the balance of power in Eurasia tilted in favor of the Soviet Union. In addition, US leaders tended to think and act in a manner consistent with balance-of-power logic. The primacy of power over ideology in US policy-making—given the strong liberal tradition in the US and the large differences between US and Soviet ideology—suggests that relative power concerns are the most important factors in generating and shaping confrontational foreign policies.

<p>How was it possible that a state such as Turkey, which had until then pursued a low-profile policy in the Middle East, was able to forge a bold strategic alliance with Israel in the 1990s? Conversely, why was the unparalleled and positive nature of relations in the 1990s replaced by a hostile and toxic nature in the first decade of the 2000s? How can this difference in the relations between the 1990s and 2000s be explained? To answer such questions, this article uses the Copenhagen School's theory of securitization.

To implement a “Pivot but Hedge” strategy, the US government should do three things: (1) it should exercise caution when cutting the defense budget; (2) it should give the military services greater leadership roles in specific regions: naval and air forces should lead in the Asia-Pacific, while ground forces should lead in the greater Middle East; (3) it should maintain expansible, capable, and well-trained ground forces as a hedge against global uncertainty.

<p>The article argues that India does not have a well-defined neighborhood policy. It makes a historical survey of the approaches of different Indian leaders to the neighborhood and examines the reasons for the prevailing negative perceptions about India in the region. These negative perceptions have come about because India has largely adopted an ad hoc and bilateral approach vis-à-vis its neighbors and has allowed its policy to be guided by an overarching concern for security. In recent years, India's approach has changed considerably. However, it needs clearer articulation. The article suggests that India must effectively communicate its vision of regional integration to its neighbors. [R, abr.]</p>

These determinants have been analyzed with respect to India, Nepal and China, three countries that have been of critical interest to Bhutan's foreign policy.

<p>The collapse of the Soviet Union created a number of confusions in the relations between India and Russia. In fact, a pro-Atlantic shift in the post-Soviet Moscow's foreign policy sidelined the strategic character of its ties with India. Besides, India's position in international politics suffered a major setback by the loss of a time-tested strategic partner. But, Russia intends to strengthen its traditional friendship with India, including their role in the international affairs, and overcome security concerns persisting in South Asia thereby strengthening stability in the region. Therefore, New Delhi and Moscow renewed the Indo-Soviet Treaty of 1971 in 1991. The paper focuses on the nature and geo-strategic compulsions of Indo-Russian relations in the contemporary world.

<p>Russia's 2009 energy strategy, which runs through 2030 to construct an unassailable dominance over the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and to a lesser degree Eastern Europe, makes Russia use energy exports as a multi-purpose security instrument. Russia has used, still uses, and will continue to use its energy weapons to achieve its political goals, in ways such as manipulation of gas supplies to potentially recalcitrant governments. Moscow aims to achieve three general foreign policy objectives: political and economic dominance of the CIS' energy economy; substantial influence throughout Eastern Europe; weakening of the EU by using energy rents, the monopolization of supplies to key countries, and the capabilities of regional organizations such as the new Eurasian Customs Union (Eurasec).

<p>62.5273 BLANK, Stephen — <bold>The Chinese and Asian impact on Russian nuclear policy.</bold> <italic>Defense and Security Analysis</italic> 28(1), March 2012: 36–54.</p>
<p>Asia, where nuclear powers already interact (including North Korea), exerts a growing influence on the thinking and policy underlying Russia's current and future nuclear (and overall defense) posture. China's rise is forcing Russia into a greater reliance on strategic offensive weapons and tactical nuclear weapons. These in turn will reinforce its opposition to US missile defenses, not only in Europe but also in Asia. Russia must now entertain the possibility of nuclear use in regional conflicts that would otherwise remain purely conventional. It cannot be postulated blindly that nuclear weapons serve no discernible purpose other than to deter nuclear attacks by other nuclear powers. The strategic equation in Asia and in the Russian Far East convincingly demonstrates the falsity of this approach. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The B. Obama administration [2009– touts the reset policy with Russia as one of its signal achievements in foreign policy. One of the key elements of its argument is Russia's help with Iran. Upon closer inspection it appears, however, that this support is tenuous and limited. Indeed, we may have reached the end of the line in terms of Russian support for the US regarding Iranian proliferation of nuclear weapons. Though Russia clearly opposes Iranian nuclearization, it does not regard this as nearly as great a threat as does the US, and the evidence is quite compelling that Russia sees Iran as a partner against the US and that the US concessions made to Russia to elicit support against Iran appear to have been excessive.

In Slovenia, the Presidency of the Council of the EU increased the level of the government's cooperation with the non-governmental development organizations (NGDOs) significantly.

<p>China's double-digit average growth in the last twenty years has built up manufacturing and industrial behemoths that helped move the country from an agrarian society into a major economic player in the global economy. This prosperous growth coupled with construction of urban infrastructures and the rapid adoption of profligate lifestyles has created dependency on energy sources, raw materials and natural resources that need to be secured to maintain commercial, economic, and social wheels turning. In failing to sustain growth and security, both of which are national priorities, the Chinese Communist Party faces ideological and political risks. As a result, China's global resources quest is taking it to faraway lands and its presence as well as its motives and mechanisms raises geopolitical issues around the globe. [R]</p>

<p>The predominant narrative of globalization is that it has led to a decline in the power of the nation-state and an increase in the power of markets. Others note that the power of the state has increased along some dimensions, even as it has lost economic power. Both of these literatures, however, tend to be too reductive by focusing on the national scale. In contrast, this paper argues that globalization may reconfigure, respatialize, and potentially increase the economic and political power of certain states. This hypothesis is tested empirically through reference to Chinese engagement in the Southern African country of Zambia using data obtained from in-depth interviews conducted with government officials, Chinese business owners, employees and other key informants.

Drawing upon existing literature and unclassified material gleaned from the National Security Archive (NSA) and the CIA Archive, we argue that for a number of historically specific reasons, and because of the different balances of interest and asymmetric power relations, “ping pong” diplomacy was able to help broker rapprochement between the US and China, whereas “baseball diplomacy” could do little or nothing to stimulate diplomatic relations between Washington and Havana.

<p>Over the last few years, technological advances have vastly increased the ability of the US to produce petroleum on its own territory. This startling turnaround in US petroleum prospects has caused some to believe that the US can become energy-“independent”. After examining the production data and the concepts of “independence” and “energy security”, I conclude that while US petroleum security is dramatically improving, energy-“independence”, as conventionally understood, is not realistic. The ultimate degree to which US petroleum security improves is highly dependent on (1) the outcome of numerous political disputes within the US between petroleum and environmental interest groups and (2) the future investment policies of the international oil companies and Saudi Arabia.

<p>China's policy in Darfur offers a significant case-study of how Beijing reconciles the pursuit of short-term gains with the need to secure its long-term interests by responding to the expectations of the international community. Oil is no longer the sole strategic factor in China's foreign policy calculus. China's prosperity and strength and the respect it commands in the international community are now the most important sources of its regime's legitimacy. China's traditional claim of noninterference in the domestic affairs of other states is giving way to a broader definition of national interests and a greater willingness to embrace global institutions and international norms. China's engagement in Darfur should therefore be perceived as part of its wider foreign policy adjustment process involving a changing attitude toward “rogue states”, multilateral diplomacy, and human rights issues.

<p>This article offers an analytical introduction to some important Cuba-related discussions in China in the last two-and-a-half decades. No Latin American nation has been treated like the Castros' (Fidel and Raúl) Cuba in China's ideological development. Cuba's revolutionary experience in the past and the regime's defiance of major global trends—from retreat of socialism to advancement of neo-liberalism—correspond to a wide range of opinions in China and are exploited by them to address their own concerns. To borrow Orientalist analysis, just like the “Other” helps define “Self”, as a “socialist Other” Cuba in Chinese perception often reflects China's own confusions and contradictions.

<p>Despite many predictions to the contrary, Korea (ROK) is currently one of the countries with most pro-American attitudes. We investigate what is behind the extraordinary resilience in US popular standing in an allegedly least likely setting. Using survey data from 2002 and 2007 and a novel methodology, Classification and Regression Tree models, we test whether US standing is: (1) a matter of interests, i.e., a reward that the US receives because it either provides security or international public goods; or (2) whether it is a matter of image, i.e., the recognition that the US is a role-model to emulate. We find that across a large number of predictors, the Korean public liked the US mostly because they liked American ways of doing business, which gives support to the image hypothesis. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Minimum deterrence is a compromise, or halfway house, between nuclear abolition or nearly zero and assured destruction, the dominant paradigm for strategic nuclear arms control during and after the Cold War. Minimum deterrence as applied to the current relationship between the US and Russia would require downsizing the numbers of operationally deployed long-range nuclear weapons to 1000, or fewer, on each side. More drastic bilateral Russian-American reductions would require the cooperation of other nuclear weapons states in making proportional reductions in their own arsenals. In addition, US plans for European-based and global missile defenses cause considerable angst in Russia and threaten to derail the Obama “reset” in Russian-American relations, despite the uncertainties about current and plausible future performances of missile defense technologies.

<p>Relations between Poland and Russia suffer from the pronounced asymmetry between the two countries. After 15 years of verbal confrontations, they have been trying to make a new start since 2009.

<p>The decision by the B.

Featuring the interplay between economic, political, and technical considerations, the outcome of this issue may depend on the political justifications and implications of the arguments proposed. This article uses IR theory to analyze the assumptions behind the argument that the US's placement of weapons in space would inevitably lead to an arms race in space. By examining the structural realist concept of stability and considering what such an arms race in space would entail, it concludes that this outcome is, at best, only probable, and that its continued use weakens the overall argument of anti-space weapons proponents.

<p>After China's entry into “the world structure”, the legal philosophy of China in its redefinition of “China” and its survey of “China's issues”, must construct a “relational perspective”. From this relational perspective, “the world structure” in an age of globalization presents a dualistic character, and closely related to this is the fact that “the world structure” forces double constraints upon the development of China. Under these double constraints, China's issues become “synchronic”. This “world structure”, with its double constraints, turns out to be the historic condition of the fundamental tasks of the legal philosophy of China and it calls for a redefinition of China by the legal philosophy of China via the construction of the “relational perspective” and the “synchronic perspective”.

<p>According to “democratic peace” theory, India, as the largest democracy in the world and as South Asia's predominant regional power, should be expected to promote democracy in neighboring countries.

The article analyzes the substantial role India plays in the peace and democratization process in Nepal in the years 2005–2008, asking whether this constitutes a departure from New Delhi's traditional policy of non-interference in its neighbors' internal affairs and a move towards a more assertive approach to democracy-promotion. India's involvement in Nepal was the product of short-term stability concerns rather than being an indicator of a long-term change in strategy. [R, abr.]</p>

Turkey's domestic transformation, consolidation of democracy and economic growth have been major factors in the formulation of this new foreign policy and in the emergence of Turkey as a trading power, stabilizing force and peace-promoter in the region.

On the one hand, Washington has said that it takes no position on the sovereignty of the islands; on the other, it is bound by the terms of the US-Japan security treaty to defend the islands. In a larger context, the incident highlighted a geopolitical dilemma for Japan: how to position itself between a rising China and a US that seems to be in a state of decline. China, on the rise, seems to be testing its role with regard to the other two powers. The US, which also sees itself in decline, is asking similar questions.

<p>62.5309 ELLNER, Andrea — <bold>Iran—challenge or opportunity for regional security?</bold> <italic>Perceptions</italic> 16(2), Summer 2011: 3–26.</p>
<p>This paper argues that the framing of Iran's policies as “the problem” for regional security and the attempts of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany (P5+1), especially the “Western” allies, to coerce Iran in negotiations over its nuclear program, perpetuate not only pre-established tensions, but also the current diplomatic stalemate. The paper proposes an alternative, regionally-led approach to Iran and its nuclear program: this could become an opportunity for regional security-building, if Iran is treated as an equal to its negotiating partners. It critically examines some core underlying causes of regional tensions and threat-perceptions, identifies opportunities for cooperation, and proposes treating Iran as a potential founding member of a regional framework managing and regulating the running, operational safety and proliferation safeguards of its and other emerging regional nuclear energy programs.

<p>Who in the EU drives the process of pursuing bilateral trade negotiations? In contrast to societal explanations, this article develops a novel argument as to how the European Commission manages the process and uses its position in strategic ways to pursue its interests. Rooted in principal-agent theory, the article discusses agent preferences and theorizes the conditions under which the agent sets specific focal points and interacts strategically with principals and third parties. The argument is discussed with case-study evidence drawn from the first trade agreement concluded and ratified since the EU Commission announced its new strategy in 2006: the EU-South Korea trade agreement.

<p>On 3 May 2010, the Israeli navy launched an assault on the “Freedom Flotilla” that had sailed from the Turkish coast to break the blockade of the Gaza Strip. Nine Turkish citizens lost their lives in this raid. Since then, Ankara has demanded excuses, but the Israeli government has refused. According to certain observers, this incident marked a turning point in the relationship between the two old allies. But in fact, the cooling off dates back at least a decade, with several concomitant events contributing: the second Intifada (late 2000), which irritated the Turks, who support the Palestinians: the Islamist party AKP, hostile to Israel, taking power in Ankara (late 2001); the Iraq war (2003), which sparked tensions in the region; and of course Turkey's strategic shift from the West to Muslim countries.

<p>62.5312 ETZIONI, Amitai — <bold>Toward a nonviolent, pluralistic Middle East.</bold> <italic>Middle East Quarterly</italic> 18(4), Fall 2011: 27–38.</p>
<p>Which political groups in the Muslim world can be considered reliable partners in building a peaceful world order? The article argues that for both principled and prudential reasons it suffices if a group renounces violence (i.e., is moderate), even if it does not support the democratic form of government and the Western list of human rights (i.e., is illiberal). The West should partner with illiberal moderates because (1) protecting life is the most fundamental right and (2) data show that the majority of Muslims are illiberal moderates. Hence, if the West allies itself only with liberal moderates, it will often find itself working with the weakest groups. At the same time, the West is free to continue to promote the form of government it views as the best. [A, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.5427]</p>

<p>To pursue its core national interests, and meet the newer challenges of security and trade, the US has changed its policy towards South Asia in post-9/11 [2001] period. It has reshaped its policy to achieve its goals and is reappraising its political, economic, military and strategic partnership with India. The linkage and pattern of newly emerged relationship since 9/11 between US and India are to some extent different from the traditional Cold War mindset. The US is using different strategic means, methods, techniques, ways, tools and linkages to advance its policy goals in South Asia and its strategic agreements with India—the June 2005 10-Year Defense Pact and the July 2005 Nuclear Agreement—are the most recent and the best examples of Indo-US strategic partnership since 9/11.

<p>The Asia Pacific area has played a new role for Russia since 1991 due to several objective processes: Russia's geopolitical center has shifted towards Asia, where two-thirds of its territory lie; the financial and economic centers of gravity have likewise moved from the Atlantic towards the Pacific, where the most rapidly developing economies can be found; finally, a third factor is the focusing of US interests on the Pacific. Russia thus faces several problems: how to maintain effective control over its eastern territory and to develop relations with the Pacific area, the most dynamically developing region in the modern world?

<p>This article examines Chinese and Russian foreign policy and military strategy from the theoretical standpoint of soft balancing. Analysis of their thinking indicates that both seek to offset US military superiority without engaging American power directly. To that end, Chinese and Russian strategists have adopted “soft” or “normative” power assets as strategic capabilities in their military and foreign policy. Alternative norms, such as the concept of “sovereign democracy”, allow China and Russia to deliberately ignore human rights issues in order to achieve diplomatic advantage with respect to the US. The two powers have institutionalized these norms within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which they use to counterbalance US interests in Central Asia. [R]</p>

<p>The nuclear fuel swap proposed by the US in October 2009, accepted by Iran, then rejected, and finally accepted again under conditions rejected by the West, was never a solution to the nuclear crisis. Tangential to the main issues, the deal offered only a temporary respite from the threat posed by Iran's sensitive nuclear programs. Intended as a confidence-building measure, the deal has only sown more suspicion, and the attempt in May 2010 by Brazil and Turkey to renew the agreement served to widen the circle of distrust. Yet the precedent of sending Iranian enriched uranium out of the country and thereby reducing its stockpile still holds promise. The question is whether or not Iran is determined to have a nuclear-weapons capability. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Why did Israel's military operation against Hamas in Gaza (2008–2009) lead to thousands of noncombatant civilian casualties and considerable suffering? This article evaluates three arguments—the accidental, incidental, and instrumental—purporting to explain the suffering produced by Operation Cast Lead. The evidence points, however ambiguously, to a political decision to permit civilian suffering for instrumental purposes. Israel's democratic character did not preclude it from harming the civilian population, and the legalism in its security policy may have worsened the damage by constructing a rationale for the casualties. Hamas, for its part, was willing to inflict suffering on Israeli civilians and sacrifice Palestinian lives for political gain. Responsibility for civilian suffering lies with decision-makers on both sides, with asymmetrical results that reflect differences in capabilities more than normative, institutional, or international constraints.

<p>“Soft power” challenged the coercion aspects of foreign policy, and professed attraction instead. In the last three years, the US seems to have unconditionally accepted this as the centerpiece of its foreign policy. As a result, its inability to make tough choices implies fear of “Market-Leninists”, Islamist theocrats, and authoritarian despots. China, on the other hand, effectively uses soft power as a means to an end—and only when it works. What America must realize is that soft power is one of the tools of exerting foreign policy, and the B. Obama administration should be open to employing other tools depending on their effectiveness to resolve the situation at hand. [R]</p>

<p>What defense budget the US should have and what defense budget it can afford are separate questions. The debate raging in Washington about Pentagon spending ignores the distinction. This article argues that US military policy is likely to remain extravagant because it is sustainable. We adopted our current strategy—which amounts to trying to run the world with the American military—because we could, not because it was wisest. Wealth and safety make the consequences of bad defense policy abstract for most US taxpayers. So we buy defense like rich people shop, ignoring the balance of costs and benefits. We conflate ideological ambition with what is required for our safety. Unfortunately, the current political demand for austerity and fewer wars will only temporarily restrain our military spending and the ambitions it underwrites.

<p>Conventional wisdom seems to hold that under B. Obama, the US ballistic missile defense program has been pushed aside to allow for a refreshed domestic and international agenda. Proponents point to Obama's campaign thinking and rhetoric, the ballistic missile defense (BMD) budget cuts, the decision to end the Third Site in Europe, and the reset relations with Russia through the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) as evidence that the program has undergone a significant period of change, retraction and rationalization. This article argues instead that BMD has not fallen from prominence and that there is a change in focus rather than retraction of its strategic goal. Consequently, BMD continues to grow in importance as a component of US national security strategy. [R]</p>

<p>China's foreign policy has been characterized in the last decade by a heightened interest in reaching out to Latin America, particularly to countries rich in natural resources and with potential markets for Chinese exports, and Chile is one of these countries. Although the Chilean economy has benefitted from the signing of the FTA, it also faces potential risks. To continue to benefit, Chile needs to boost exports in other potential export sectors (value-added products or services) and should attempt to attract more Chinese FDI to Chile's export industry. The roles of the Chilean state and the private sector in attracting Chinese investment and enhancing diversification of exports of value-added products are crucial for the future of the economy of Chile and its relationship with China.

<p>Analyses of Chinese FDI sometimes question the investment criteria of Chinese firms, suggesting that market rules are not fundamental but secondary to political and geostrategic concerns. Questioning the apolitical nature of markets, the article uses the internationalization of China's mining industry as a case study to ascertain the criteria that guide Chinese FDI. It first examines quantitative data from 2000 to 2010 which suggest that Chinese mining investment in Latin America and worldwide gravitates towards liberal economies. Second, by focusing on the projects of Chinese mining firms in Peru, the article illustrates how China's overseas mineral quest is best explained by probing into the integrated strategies of individual mining firms which seek to capitalize their comparative advantage in accessing Chinese markets and the political momentum of the “Going Out” strategy.

<p>The re-election of R.

This context enabled Turkey and Israel, with US mediation, to make progress towards drafting an agreement between them, intended to enable the two countries to restore normal working relations following the 2010 flotilla incident. However, the draft agreement was eventually rejected by the Israeli government in August 2011, leading to a new cycle of escalating tensions between the two countries.

<p>In 2009, the B.

The success of this strategy is predicated on the rapid development and fielding of successive increments of defensive capability in a manner adapted to the specific requirements for missile defenses in different regions of the world. The administration is committed to building a European regional missile defense system, the European PAA or EPAA between now and 2020.

<p>There are intrinsic difficulties to the objective study of the present.

How to explain current events, for whose novelty and exceptionality we have a presentiment? How to face the complexity of local situations and what is at stake internationally? Such questions demand care in order not to be misled into an overly optimistic or an alarmist view.

<p>The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) has suffered serious setbacks since it was introduced in 1970. Pakistan, India and Israel have refused to sign it; North Korea has paid no apparent price for withdrawing, leading experts to assume that Iran might well behave in the same manner. The Turkish concern is that, should the Iranian regime decide to acquire nuclear capabilities, it would be almost impossible to reverse proliferation in the Middle East. Other states would aspire to such capabilities, the international nuclear nonproliferation regime would come to an end, and regional politics would be destabilized. This runs counter to Turkish diplomacy, which has encouraged stability and order. However, Tehran's insistence on the peaceful nature of its nuclear program has militated against Turkish diplomacy.

<p>In terms of the question, “how to create an effective peace-making process in the Israeli-Palestinian case”, this article argues that the answer is a multidimensional approach to peace-making diplomacy that contains two main settings: political-elite diplomacy and public diplomacy. Political-elite diplomacy suggests various modes of peace-making interactions between political elites. Public diplomacy provides instruments to involve the people in the peace-making struggle, prepares them for a change, and presses the leadership to reach agreements. The analysis suggests establishing an institution for the operation of public diplomacy—a major Israeli-Palestinian public negotiating congress. [R, abr.]</p>

Critics claim that across Latin America and the Caribbean, Chinese aid and trade are characterized by excessive state intervention. This article argues that, for two reasons, the rationale for these misgivings is dissipating: (1) since the onset of the global financial crisis, China has gained influence in multilateral institutions, prompting them toward greater acceptance of public spending in developing countries; (2) recent developments in Cuba show that China is actively encouraging the Western hemisphere's only communist country to liberalize its economy. China sits at the crossroads of these local and global developments, prompting Cuba toward rapprochement with international norms even as it works to reform them. [R]</p>

<p>This article is an anthropological study of South Korea's “Sunshine Policy” towards North Korea, analyzing the much debated issue of reciprocity between the divided yet one nation. The Sunshine Policy was first instigated in 1998 by South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, to soften the belligerent attitude of North Korea towards the South by promoting interaction through the prosperous South's economic aid to the nearly bankrupt North. The policy initially seemed to work, leading to some communications between the two Koreas, and President Kim Dae Jung was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000. However, as the North “jettisoned” the principle of reciprocity, and the financial aid aimed to help the starving North Korean masses was used to develop weaponry including nuclear bombs and long-range missiles, the South Korean public began to question its validity.

First, it scrutinizes the inherent contradictions and limitations of the transfer of the “transition experience” through development cooperation, and then it assesses the extent and impact of transition inspired development projects run by the CEE governments, NGOs and companies.

<p>To this day, the East Central European members of NATO see in Russia a potential threat. This perception influenced their attitude towards NATO's new Strategic Concept. They wanted to see the guarantee of military assistance strengthened and tried to maintain the US military presence in Europe. After the shock of US President B. Obama's retreat from his predecessor's missile-shield plans, only Poland could secure participation in the new missile defense system and a US military presence on its soil. The countries of East Central Europe are participating in Afghanistan not least of all in the hope of convincing NATO and the US to champion the security concerns of East Central Europeans.

<p>Bangladesh foreign policy has undergone several transitions and phases in the last 40 years. The first phase could be considered as the diplomacy of recognition, as the country had to struggle to build relations with those countries which were against Bangladesh's Liberation War with Pakistan. The first phase, however, ended in 1974, especially after Pakistan's recognition [of] Bangladesh and this paved the way for a new phase: economic diplomacy. During this period, cementing the relationship with the West to ensure aid and assistance was the cornerstone of Bangladesh foreign policy. Although the thrust for economic diplomacy gained further momentum and brought newer dynamics, globalization, open market economy as well as struggling to catch the international market have made the situation susceptible for Bangladesh.

<p>Austria, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein attach great importance to their membership in the UN, using it as a major instrument in their foreign policy tool-kit. However, as small an medium-sized states, they have only limited influence in UN decision-making. Thus, their motto is to set priorities and stick to them. While Austria has continuously sent troops to UN peacekeeping missions since the 1960s, Liechtenstein and Switzerland focus on financing development cooperation and on the reform of the Security Council. All three countries put great emphasis on the promotion and protection of human rights and on a strong, legally-binding climate regime. Despite these areas of common interest, however, they do not maintain a strong and institutionalized cooperation as [do] a number of other small countries. [R]</p>

<p>Terrorism is but one of many threats, elevating it into an all-consuming fear that can only make relations with Muslim countries more difficult. A military response is not the best solution to every threat to national security and should be used only when necessary. The African Command should be abolished. If the US government wants to see fewer failed states, more assistance to democratic institutions should be provided. Military education must prepare members of the armed forces to deal with all the challenges they will face. This is unlikely to happen, and therefore the US will always be preparing to fight the last war instead of the next one.</p>

<p>South Africa was recently included as a member of the BRICS grouping. South Africa's formal association with the powerful original members suggests that it possesses some international clout. Although South Africa pursues an active foreign policy, for example, as a region organizer, notably through New Partnership for Africa's Development, and as an issue-leader championing development-related concerns, the normative direction of South Africa's international involvement has been unclear and often contradictory. This article illustrates how South Africa adheres to and departs from liberal principles when involved in the global politics of development. Middlepowership and domestic politics are identified as two sources of pressure on the liberal aspects of South African foreign policy. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.5350]</p>

<p>The new Turkish public diplomacy is building on Turkey's expanding soft power in the Balkans, the Middle East and the Caucasus. As Turkey engages new regions and emerging actors as well as continues relations with its old allies, it develops new capacities for the various elements of soft power and strategic communication in regional and global contexts. The new Turkey that is emerging is also creating a new Turkish narrative with multiple dimensions and faces. The task of the new Turkish public diplomacy is to tell the story of the new Turkey to a wide ranging audience across the globe. As Turkey overcomes its old fears and builds a new identity for itself, the process of change transforming the country will have a deep impact on Turkish domestic and foreign policy. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>South Korea has been a rising economic power for some decades. It aims to be an issue-leader in the field of development, although it seeks to secure the foundations for further sustained economic growth. We investigate Korea's global strategy since the 1990s, aiming to translate its economic clout into global political influence. The focus is placed on a critical evaluation of the approach under the current Lee Myung-bak administration since 2008. This article examines the domestic factors that have led Korea to pursue its strategies of securing influence, including most notably the legacy of the mercantilist developmental state. The article raises cautionary concerns about the capacity of Korea to adopt a foreign policy that moves beyond economic self-interest and plays an active role in the creation of global public goods.

<p>In 2010, the discord between the US and Turkey on major policy issues, including Iran and relations with Israel, once again strained bilateral relations. With the Arab Spring, the pendulum swung once again. Since the eruption of the people's movement in different parts of the Middle East, Turkey and the US have acted in coordination, and taken similar positions in debates in international forums. The B. Obama administration announced a new Asia-Pacific strategy, which will entail the concentration of its diplomatic, military, and economic resources to build partnerships and curb emerging threats in this region. This new doctrine may have a major impact on US relations with Turkey by opening up new opportunities for cooperation and new necessities to deepen the partnership. [R]</p>

<p>This article studies developments in Turkish-American relations over the last decade. It analyzes the three parameters of the bilateral relationship that took shape at the height of the Cold War: Turkey's geo-strategic and geo-political importance; cooperation in return for external assistance; and pursuit of a pro-US political-ideological role at the regional level. While the alliance underwent transformations in following years, the learned behavioral habits from this era continued to impact Turkey's foreign policy practices. Turkey's policies over the last decade can be viewed as attempts to break those established behavioral patterns. [The article] analyzes how the drive for autonomous action became a defining feature of Turkish foreign policy throughout the 2000s, as a result of which relations with the US entered a new era, characterized by a growing number of frictions.

<p>Both Washington and New Delhi share blame for the loss of momentum in bilateral relations. Unlike its predecessor, the B. Obama administration has not displayed much interest in high-profile cooperation, while the paralysis of the current Indian government has constrained its own capacity for engagement. Nonetheless, more progress has been made in the relationship in recent years than is generally appreciated. With the presidential election cycle beginning in the US and India conducting an important round of state-level elections in early 2012, the best use of diplomatic resources in the short term is to focus on consolidating these promising trends. [Then,] leaders should give priority galvanizing initiatives that bolster the non-governmental links that are key in securing the growth of broad-based, resilient relations over the long term.

<p>The paper surveys current EU-Iran relations, analyzing both EU statecraft towards Iran and the geo-strategic and economic determinants informing diplomacy. Since 1992, the EU's relations with Iran have been based on the framework of “constructive engagement” in order to address areas of mutual concern through direct contact and dialogue. Since 2004, the EU has largely abandoned constructive engagement. Rather, the EU-3 have aligned themselves with US policy and shifted focus to Iran's alleged nuclear weaponization and supported Washington's strategy of deterrence and containment. This shift in EU strategy has resulted in Iran moving closer to Turkey as a new third-party mediator and strategic ally and has so far prevented an EU-brokered initiative to break the stalemate.

<p>The US has arguably pursued de facto containment of Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but a review of US policies over the past thirty years suggests that the understanding of containment has varied significantly—so much that proponents of the strategy occasionally call for completely contradictory policies, from preventing an Iranian nuclear capability to living with one. The strategy of containment shows promise in addressing the Iranian challenge if better understood and applied. Yet, the challenges to successfully implementing it are significantly greater than was the case with the Soviet Union. This is largely because of more hostile regional attitudes toward the US and ambivalent attitudes and postures toward Iran among US allies. [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.5437]</p>

<p>The recognition of Israel as a state for the Jewish people and its Palestinian-Arab minority is highly desirable, as part of a joint declaration of principles guiding the negotiations and certainly as part of the final agreement.

Mutual recognition of the concept of the two states for two peoples should ideally become part of a new and transcendent narrative of reconciliation.</p>

A review of the great changes in polities, combined with an analysis of the dynamism of US facilitation, allows going deeper into the processes and dynamic reasons for decisions to support democratic and autocratic tendencies. The US has punished democratization more than rewarded it, and rewarded and facilitated autocratic development more than opposed it. The US historical record offers no justification for exceeding the UNSC mandate or for undermining Muslim countries' sovereignty in the Middle East and North Africa.

<p>It is sometimes argued that Turkish foreign policy under the [Justice and Development party] (AKP) government reflects its ideology, and Turkish foreign policy towards the Middle East is often used as an illustration of this influence. However, the government has followed a mainly realist foreign policy approach in the Middle East and used the idealism for the maximization of Turkish national interests. In contrast to the power resources at the disposal of other regional powers, including the support of external powers, sectarian identities, or ethnic-linguistic ties, Turkish foreign policy's key asset is its successful combination of democracy and Islam. Turkey has emerged as the most outspoken supporter of democratic transformations, aiming to create a liberal-democratic regional order. This, however, brings Turkey ultimately into conflict with other aspiring hegemonic powers, including both Israel and Iran. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Recent literature on soft balancing predicts an increased occurrence of soft balancing against Washington at times when the US acts unilaterally in foreign policy.

In contrast to these views, this article demonstrates that interest violation and unilateralism, both individually and together, are weak predictors of soft balancing. Instead, based on the cases analyzed, I argue that soft balancing is most likely to occur when interest violations go hand in hand with perceptions of predatory intentions. [R]</p>

<p>This article argues that, instead of criticizing Beijing for security free-riding and noncooperation in liberal peace projects in Africa, we should engage with Beijing's perspective on African security and its rationale for noninterference in Africa's domestic affairs. Beijing views the liberal peace project as the neocolonial hegemonic imposition of the West and, furthermore, believes it contributes to African insecurity. This view comes from China's communication with African elites, Beijing's own historical experiences with colonialism, and a mix of realist, Marxist, and postcolonial analysis. China's assessment of African security is state-centric and elite focused. This study discusses how and why Beijing's understanding of and policy for African security has evolved and the direction it is likely to take in the future. [R]</p>

<p>How do [US] domestic political conditions shape when leaders get punished for backing down in international crises? We explore how three factors—the president's partisanship, the reaction of other elites, and whether the president justifies his decision on the basis of new information—influence the size of domestic audience costs. While standard theories in American politics suggest that partisanship should exert a large effect over voter behavior, we offer an alternative theory explaining why the president's unique informational advantage following a crisis will mute partisanship's effect on audience costs. We argue that the president's justification for why he backed down, however, will have a large effect on audience costs. Using a series of original survey experiments, we find strong support for our theoretical argument. [R, abr.]</p>

From a US perspective, Iran's massive diplomatic presence in the Western Hemisphere presents a particularly acute problem. In response to Iran's abuse of the diplomatic system, the international community should collectively press our friends and allies in Latin America to severely restrict the size of Iran's diplomatic missions to the minimum needed to conduct official business.

Yet, Moscow surprised everyone by announcing that the Mistrals will be used in the Far East—formally for the Kuril Islands dispute with Japan, yet in fact to remind symbolically all interested countries that Russia remains an Asian power and that it does not intend to leave this extremely important region.

<p>Assessments of how international actors are responding to China's rise typically focus on rival great powers or on China's Asian neighbors.

Japan's policy in Middle East/North Africa reflects its general move toward a more militarily enhanced version of mercantile realism. [R]</p>

<p>Former points of lack of balance between Russia and China have been reversed: China is now the second largest economic power in the world and clearly aims to become that in all domains. Beijing has been a member of WTO since 2001, whereas Russia still strives to enter it. On the international stage, China is presented as the savior of the world economy. Western media emphasize all the democratic deficits of Putin-Medvedev's Russia, yet [remain] fascinated with the Chinese regime, despite its soft power's great limitations.

<p>For thirty-five years following the end of the Vietnam War, US security planners treated Southeast Asia as a region of little concern. However, the rapid growth of Chinese power and strategic ambition beginning in the 1980s has had a southern, not northern, focus. China has seen Southeast Asia as attractive and vulnerable for a host of reasons and has pursued a skilled diplomatic campaign presenting itself to Southeast Asia as an economic partner and benign neighbor. But a modern iteration of a traditional Middle Kingdom vision potentially pits China's ambitions against key interests of Southeast states as well as an established US security presence. [R]</p>

<p>Turkey and Russia are working to transform their century-long geopolitical disputes into a geo-economic partnership. [Since] 2000, there have been rapid improvements in the political-diplomatic relations between the two countries, thanks to the constructive and peaceful approaches embraced by Ankara and Moscow. For many years both sides have expressed their desire for bilateral relations not to remain merely economic, also encompassing regional and global interests, and being based on shared trust and respect. Relations between Turkey and Russia are often described as “strategic”. Nonetheless, the existence of some problems between the two countries cannot be denied, even though they are not explicitly voiced. The general structure of Turkish-Russian relations implies that in the coming years, cooperation and competition will remain determining factors. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article [asks] why there remain discrepancies with respect to harmonizing efforts to manage irregular migration in Europe. It analyzes the case of Turkey's irregular migration policy during its accession process to the EU. Turkey since the 1990s, has come to constitute a major transit and receiving country for nationals of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan as well as many African countries. At the same time, Turkey has prospects of becoming the “new” external border of the EU. As Turkey's role as a transit and receiving country grows, issues of international migration in general, and irregular migration in particular, have become vital topics in defining the trajectory of Turkey's accession process to the EU.

<p>Despite its Ottoman past in the continent, Turkey did not show a serious interest in African affairs until recently. However, since 1998 there has been a revival in Turkey's involvement in developing relations with Africa. This was a passive attempt initially, but after 2005, it became an offensive one that culminated in the first Turkey-Africa Summit in 2008 and booming economic relations. Despite much rhetoric on humanitarian issues, Turkey's opening to Africa is driven by two factors: Turkey's need to diversify its economic relations in a new global political economy and its re-orientation in global politics. In the current situation, Turkey-Africa relations are still fragile and the future of the relations depends much on Turkey's domestic political developments and interest from the African side.

<p>Since 2002, Turkish foreign policy has gone through a tremendous change both in its content and scope toward Africa and Asia. African opening represents a perfect convergence of civil society and state cooperation and bears fruit in political, economic and social terms. It aims to conceptualize a “new” Africa in Turkey by overcoming the image of two separate Africas: Sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa. Ankara's Asia policy has been shaped with an intention of placing the existing relations “in a certain systematic” with the Turkic republics in Central Asia; to reach “a policy of normalization” with countries like China and India; and to follow certain political and economic policies to translate relations “from normal to deep cooperation” with countries like South Korea and Japan.

<p>The territorial dispute about the South Kurile Islands, which so far has made impossible a peace treaty between Tokyo and Moscow, has not demonstrated any progress. On the contrary, it is at the heart of renewed tensions in recent years, caused by the recrudescence of Russian political and military activities in the region. Japan seems to be pursuing a pragmatic approach to its relations with Russia, taking advantage of a dynamic energy cooperation which contributes to the security of its supplies. The deepening of the two countries' relation allows them to vary their diplomatic partners. The two countries' divergent strategic priorities do not however indicate a quick political reconciliation.

<p>Though scholars widely claim that issue linkage—the simultaneous negotiation of multiple issues for joint settlement—can help states conclude international agreements, there exist some notable skeptics. I address the lack of direct and systematic evidence by combing original data on failed alliance negotiations with data from the Alliance Treaty Obligations and Provisions (ATOP) database. Using matching techniques, I find that, for alliance negotiations between 1860 to 1945, offers of trade linkage did substantially increase the probability of agreement. The article's evidence explains the high rate of alliance compliance identified by previous scholars and highlights a need to rethink the alliance-formation process. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>As a result of the wars undertaken in Iraq and Afghanistan by the G.W.

This responsibility has been carried out through provincial reconstruction teams that operate at the local level to rebuild the societies shattered by war. In conceptual terms, the responsibility increasingly reflects the new emphasis on reconstruction and stabilization operations laid out in the State Department's 2011 <italic>Quadrennial Defense and Development Review</italic>, which sets the groundwork for future interventions both to prevent states from failing and to rebuild states devastated by war or natural disaster. The ambitious nature of this strategy suggests a new age of American imperialism under which the “responsibility to protect” of the 1990s may become the “responsibility to fix” of the 21st c.

<p>India's foreign policy interactions with Israel are marked by a political discreetness which is in contrast to its prominent political engagement with the Palestinians and countries of the Arab world. India plays down its robust defense engagement with Israel, censures Israeli policies regarding the Palestinians, supports Palestinian-related resolutions at multi-lateral forums like the UN, differs strongly from Israeli policy on issues such as Iran's nuclear program while being opposed to the possibility of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons capability. This policy has expanded the space for India to pursue its foreign policy and national interest goals, as attested to by the robust political and economic interaction with the Palestinians and the Arab countries, and rising defense and economic engagement with Israel despite certain domestic constituencies opposed to such a partnership.

<p>Modern Azerbaijan is a typical Middle-Eastern petrostate, where political (and economic) power is concentrated and inherited. Azerbaijan's military compact with Turkey, signed in 2010, suggests that Baku is preparing for war to return Nagorno-Karabakh. While Azerbaijan completely depends on oil revenue in its standoff against Armenia, the second Baku oil boom of 2005–2013 is doomed to end in a few years without any significant economic achievement, as all the petrodollar revenue is being squandered in a construction frenzy. In these circumstances, due to its impending economic and strategic insignificance to the West after the peak of oil production in 2010, Azerbaijan needs to become more realistic in its claim to Nagorno-Karabakh as its ability to persuade the great powers is set to dwindle synchronously with the depletion of oil reserves in 2011–2019.

<p>Italy's foreign and security policy since the end of the Cold War is best accounted for by a structural realist framework rather than by liberal and constructivist accounts. More specifically, since unification and also in the post-Cold War period, the main feature of Italy's international collocation has been a dialectical interaction between a structural tendency to “bandwagon” with the hegemonic Power, which can guarantee the protection of Italian interests and forestall the risk of exclusion, and the search for regional autonomy. Italy's structural, dialectical interaction between “bandwagoning” and the search for autonomy is a response to opposite systemic incentives: Italy “bandwagons” every time the international status quo unravels or when a new order is being imposed; it endeavors to assert a more independent role in periods of international stability.

In addition to the rationalization, a supportive regional context helped them expand their relations.

<p>Russia has sharply objected to US plans for ballistic missile defense. The Russian official explanation is that the real purpose of the US missile defense plan is to make it impossible for Russia to retaliate against a US nuclear (or massive conventional) attack, thus making Russia subject to military blackmail by the US. The Russian response has been the result of a sum total of various factors, mostly political and cultural, while the technical capabilities of the proposed system have played a secondary role.

<p>This article analyzes the Slavic component in the foreign policy of the four Central European Slavic (CES) countries. [It argues] that the Slavic component is not (an important) part of those countries' foreign policy; however, it is relevant within cultural affairs. The CES countries instrumentalist their foreign policy to accomplish their interests within the geographically and culturally close nations. This presumption is verified by the comparative foreign-policy methodology, being applied to the structure of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Diplomatic Missions of CES countries. The analysis confirms that Slavism is relevant within cultural affairs only, while the foreign policy of all countries is determined by other variables. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>As energy-dependency increases in Europe, Turkey and Italy found it necessary to cooperate on pipeline projects to secure Europe's energy supply and to increase their role as transit countries in the Mediterranean and southeast Europe. At the end of the 1990s, Italian and Turkish energy companies started to collaborate on such projects as Blue Stream, Samsun-Ceyhan, and Interconnector Turkey-Greece-Italy (ITGI). In these pipeline projects, Russia has been a major player since it is one of the main energy-producing countries in the region and has a significant role in the energy policies of other energy-producing countries in the Caspian and the Caucasus. However, the competition among the regional countries in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean has decreased the effectiveness of the collaborative projects of Italy and Turkey.

<p>62.5417 VAN NIEUWKERK, Anthoni — <bold>South Africa and peacekeeping in Africa.</bold> <italic>African Security</italic> 5(1), Jan.–March 2012: 44–62.</p>
<p>This paper traces the development of the South African government's post-apartheid approach to African peace and stability, including the evolution of its policy on peacekeeping. It then explores the challenges and opportunities facing South Africa as a member of the UN Security Council and African Union Peace and Security Council. It offers an analysis of the sustainability of South Africa's current and future peacemaking, peacekeeping, and peacebuilding efforts on the continent and concludes that it needs to further develop, implement, and manage an integrated and long-term foreign and security policy to the benefit of the country and the continent.

<p>The declining influence of the US has not led to a common European defense, nor created a serious challenge to the US political agenda. But the fact that EU countries are sovereign in their decisions to deploy troops abroad does not mean that no progress in the creation of a centralized EU defense is being made. The institutions are in place and there is a long tradition of military cooperation, including the most recent wars. Such a centralized structure would be inimical to a world where conflicts are solved by diplomacy. European socialists should work to confront this development.

<p>Two critical, interrelated factors shape the internal deliberations and power struggles within the Khartoum regime: Northern Sudan's economic future after secession and the role of the US and the international community after the end of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. A decision by Washington to fully re-engage with Sudan and lead bilateral and multilateral debt-relief efforts would undoubtedly have a positive impact on Khartoum's economic fortunes and help to stabilize a difficult transition. It might also further entrench Bashir and Taha in power and result in the prolongation of authoritarian rule and associated conflicts, at a time when populations across Northern Africa are demanding greater freedom and justice from their own rulers, as well as dramatic changes in Western policy toward the region as a whole.</p>

<p>Our aim is to compare the discourse of the two presidents that governed Brazil in the last 16 years (Fernando Henrique [Cardozo] and Lula). We use content analysis to investigate more than a thousand addresses delivered by the two presidents in diplomatic events in Brazil and abroad. We find important similarities and differences in the subject matters and in the alliances they managed to make in the international arena. Both presidents privileged the issues related to the economy, to international institutions and to the relationship with South America. Fernando Henrique seems to have given more attention to issues related to democracy and to have been closer to the European countries. Lula extended his concern to issues inequality of the international context and was dedicated to a more open dialogue with Asia, the Middle East and, most of al, with Africa. [R]</p>

<p>Britain decided to join the European Community because its postwar, postimperial policies had failed and successive Governments saw no viable alternative. After ten years of being denied entry by De Gaulle, Britain joined on disadvantageous terms and with the British political parties, and the British people, deeply divided. Accession did not resolve the underlying issues and Britain's first year of membership saw an unprecedented oil crisis, bad relations between Britain and the US and the demise of the British government led by Edward Heath. The underlying issues which had not been resolved in the accession negotiations were reopened by Harold Wilson and later by Margaret Thatcher. Some of them remain unresolved in British politics to this day. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4295]</p>

<p>The South Asian region is in the midst of an acute fresh-water crisis. It is surfacing in myriad ways in the major countries of the region, and has the cumulative effect of recasting the region's interstate relations in terms of water-resource rivalry. This rivalry threatens to both widen the region's existing geopolitical cleavages and stall its already slow progress towards greater regional cooperation. A discussion of eight diverse and equally important, oft-cited trends in South Asia's emerging fresh-water crisis shows that, taken collectively, these trends warrant designation as drivers of a fundamental transformation in the region's interstate relations, a transformation that inescapably carries substantial risk, in light of the region's recent past, of deepened—even violent—interstate conflict.

<p>We construct and analyze an original database of overseas Chinese equity oil investments (EOI) in order to assess the relative importance of economic and geopolitical factors in determining the type of countries that are most likely to receive those investments. We find that China's national oil companies (NOCs) choose to make considerable investments in certain oil rich countries while ignoring others. We develop and examine “economic opportunity” and “geopolitical relevance” explanations of Chinese EOI. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper explores the opportunities for and challenges to forging a partnership between China and the US in the 21st c. It explains why China has become more adamant in protecting its core national interests and argues that China's core concerns over Taiwan, Tibet and Xinjiang should be accommodated, as this affects Beijing's trust with Washington. Meanwhile, the two countries should expand their cooperation in areas of common interests, such as promoting peace, stability and denuclearization on the Korean peninsula; securing strong, sustainable and balanced global economic growth; and creating a new global environmental protection regime. The paper also highlights some of the major challenges to partnership-building between the two countries. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.5430]</p>

<p>Since the 1990s, Japan and Korea have chosen dissimilar policy options with respect to the US-led missile defense (MD) systems in East Asia. What explains the two countries' dissimilar MD strategies? Inspired by neoclassical realism, this study introduces a framework of domestic hurdles that combines R. Schweller's cohesion model and J. Taliaferro's resource-extraction model. It sheds light on the degree of elite cohesion and social and economic impediments as key causal determinants that impede balancing against external threats. Although the influence of systemic variables that suppose optimal policy options, such as balancing, domestic hurdles impede or delay such options. This study contributes to IR by offering comparative and theoretical analyses on different paths that Tokyo and Seoul have chosen for their MD policies. [R]</p>

<p>Prior to 9/11 [2001], the US budget was in surplus and national debt was declining. Ever since then, the debt has been climbing unceasingly while the budget has once again plunged into ever-increasing deficits that have undermined the government's ability to provide for the country's impending needs. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have led the US to expand its network of informal alliances while seeking ongoing support from long-standing allies and partners, thus restructuring its relations with India, Pakistan, Turkey, and Iran. Although the years since 9/11 have witnessed considerable changes in US national security strategy, government structure and relations with other states, one of the attacks' more pronounced national security effects has been on the military, which has been engaged in nonstop combat.

<p>Since around 2005, efforts have been made within the US military to highlight the significance of culture or the “human terrain” for counterinsurgency operations. The US Army responded to the asserted “cultural knowledge gap” by establishing an experimental program called the Human Terrain System (HTS), which involves deploying social scientists alongside combat forces. While HTS was received favorably in the US mainstream media, it has been fiercely criticized by anthropologists in particular, who argue not least that participation in the program would constitute a violation of their professional ethics, which require them to protect their research subjects. This article explores the anthropologists' critique and its limitations, arguing that it fails to tackle the problem of ethics deployed as a supposedly extra-political standard that can serve to (de)legitimize political projects.

<p>The question of China's grand strategy is of great importance for understanding the international impact of China's rise. Both Western and Chinese scholars dispute whether China has developed a coherent grand strategy in the reform era. The main reason for the controversy seems to lie as much in theoretical and methodological assumptions about defining and analyzing grand strategy as in empirical validity. This article adopts a novel theoretical approach to analyzing grand strategy by seeing it as the conjunction of national interests and strategic ideas. It examines China's evolving national interests and strategic ideas in the reform period in order to clarify the exploratory, evolutionary and adaptive nature of policy-change. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Starting with an almost single-minded emphasis on shared interests to engage China, the B. Obama administration made a policy adjustment about one year later to shore up US leadership in the Asia-Pacific even if it meant challenging China's core interests. This paper argues that this adjustment was to bring hedge back to shape the regional context of China's rise. While the precipitating cause for the shift was China's newly founded assertiveness during the global financial downturn, the deep cause was the US anxiety about China's great power aspiration in the 21st c. The policy adjustment, however, was not to contain China's rise because a full-out confrontation against China would be self-defeating. It was a return to a centralist approach to engage China from a position of strength rather than weakness. [R] [First of three articles on “Transformation of US-China relations in the 21st c. I”.
