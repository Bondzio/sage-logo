<p>Carolyn Ellis, Tony Adams and Arthur Bochner (2011) in their useful article, <italic>Autoethnography: An Overview,</italic> provide the simple phrasing I used in the title of this reflection, to tease out the sweet spot of a method that students and others new to qualitative research might dismiss as interesting, but not suitable for them as rigorous scholarship. In teaching qualitative research classes, it has been my experience that students seem to view autoethnography as a method on the margin. When presented with this new construction they often don method blinders that I wish they had left at home. Although in their defense, they are new to all things qualitative, so the nuances of the critical mix of art, science and expression escape them, and they worry most of the time about research rigor. Yet when I have used the beautifully written autoethnography on obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325013486574">Brooks, 2011</xref>) in my advanced mental health practice class, the students unanimously praise the writing for bringing them a truth about OCD they had not known. They are reading for content in this case and not for method, but they <italic>get it</italic>, they see how it works, and some are even aware of the elegance of the method of autoethnography and praise its utility.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325013486574">Ellis et al. (2011)</xref> seek to describe the interplay of the autobiography and ethnography as well as the many approaches that researchers have used in their work. They meet head-on the various critiques and dismissals that are launched against this form and have been discussed in the literature. In a final synopsis, they acknowledge the tension of social science researchers considering autoethnography, because they are striving to touch the readers with the richly articulated experience of their subject and ‘continue the (academic) conversation’ on their topic. Not an easy task by any means and courageous for those who try to layer science and art.</p>
<p>The two books in this set of reviews were not originally ones that I thought would link well together, but they have been well-served by their reviewers and the intersectionality of the texts have been revealed with each reading. The first book is about the autoethnographic method and titled, <italic>Body, Paper, Stage: Writing and Performing Autoethnography</italic> (2011) by Dr Tami Spry. This book was reviewed by Dr Kennedy Saldanha who was moved by encountering a performance by Dr Spry at the International Qualitative Congress in Illinois and wanted to understand the process of her performance in a deeper way, so he sought out this account of her method. The second book is an edited text by Dr Stanley Witkin of the University of Vermont, and titled<italic>, Social Construction and Social Practice: Interpretations and Innovations</italic> (2012). Dr Allan Irving as the reviewer of this book brings us a joyful accounting of what he refers to as ‘a contribution both to postmodern theory, social construction and individual fields of social work practice tapped into through the individual essays’. Both reviews seem to serve as compelling invitations to explore the understanding of philosophy, paradigms, research methods, practice and personal truths of the book authors, chapter essayists, and the reviewers for the uninitiated and hesitant research community. What more could one want post-holiday but to unwrap these treasures!</p>
<p>As I put together these reviews I am at the very beginnings of my sabbatical and so am in touch with the notion of unwrapping treasures and embracing something new. It is with an eye to discovery and pragmatism that I begin my journey. Living with these reviews and looking at the online information for the authors, I noticed not only that Dr Witkin has a chapter in his text on autoethnography, but that he is also working on autoethnography as his next book topic. It occurred to me that perhaps I can best learn this method through writing about and analyzing my sabbatical experience in the context of gender, institutional practices, and my topic area of veterans recently returning from war. The modern sabbatical process is focused on producing an approved product and is not granted for the quality of respite and regeneration that is embedded in the consciousness of most non-academics. ‘Where are you going?’ is the questions I am greeted with when I let people know what I am up to. It occurred to me that autoethnography might be a fine proxy for gazing at a stone in a river and traveling new pathways … and my hope is that I will be able to examine the ripples of my process and product, my doing and writing, my own regeneration and personal growth, all within the social interaction with others.</p>
