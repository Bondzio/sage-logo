<abstract>
<p>Present patterns of residential segregation have been proven to have antecedents in the so-called white flight of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Close scrutiny of this social phenomenon has yielded results that indicate complicated impetuses and call into question sweeping assumptions about white flight. A case study of seven congregations from a denomination called the Christian Reformed Church in North America (CRC) who left the Englewood and Roseland neighborhoods of Chicago during the juncture in question further reveals the dubious role of religious practices and arrangements in the out-migration of white evangelical Christians. By utilizing church histories, council minutes, and field interviews, it became readily apparent that the departure of the members of these congregations found sanction within the hierarchical apparatus (or lack thereof) of the church. The response of these CRC congregations exemplified how the political structures (congregational polity) and social networks of a particular denomination could allow for an almost seamless process of white flight.</p>

<body>
<p>The phenomenon of “white flight” beset United States’ cities throughout the twentieth century. The pattern of African American movement into certain neighborhoods and subsequent white emigration from the same locus has been well documented.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144211420637">1</xref></sup> Both historians and sociologists have studied these incidents and have come to varying conclusions. The consensus of scholars, however, seems to be that such patterns of residential disbursements based on race have led to and indeed have been factors in the origins of the continuing American urban crisis.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most radical cases of white flight occurred in the Chicago neighborhoods of Englewood and Roseland beginning in the late 1950s and concluding in the early 1970s. Seven entire congregations from one denomination left the city during this period. These congregations ranged in size from five hundred to well over one thousand members. This particular case involved Christian Reformed Church (CRC) congregations, an ethnically Dutch denomination that had roots in the United States that traced back to the 1850s. Over that one hundred year period, the denomination had slowly adopted a uniquely American mode of church political structure: congregationalism. The way that these seven congregations responded to the arrival of African Americans delineates a narrative that has much to reveal about the confluence of race and religious polity in the United States.</p>
<p>The role of polity is seen in stark relief when comparing these seven CRC congregations to the six Reformed Church of America (RCA) congregations that resided in the same two Chicago South Side neighborhoods. From an outsider’s perspective, these two denominations would be largely indistinguishable: both have Dutch roots, worship with similar liturgy, and espouse the same Reformed/Calvinist doctrine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144211420637">2</xref></sup> However, a closer inspection reveals a difference in church polity. While both denominations claim a Presbyterian polity, the CRC would be more accurately described as congregational. That is, the bulk of power rested at the local level—any hierarchical apparatuses really wielded little or no influence on the decisions that these congregations made when their neighborhoods changed with the arrival of African Americans during the Great Migration. In contrast, the RCA congregations answered to authorities within the denomination regarding the selling of church edifices. In the end, this subtle contrast in church polity predisposed the CRC congregations for higher levels of mobility and suburbanization as the neighborhoods changed racially. The fact that differences in church government affected the departure dates of these congregations also further shades current understandings of white flight.</p>
<p>Though the story of the expansion of the African American community in Chicago after World War II remains familiar, the situation in the Englewood and Roseland neighborhoods of Chicago stands as a significant case among all rust belt cities that experienced a white migration to the suburbs. The rapidity of the transition and complicity of local churches combined to create a case study of white relocation and suburbanization that reveals much about urban residential patterns and the role of evangelical Christianity in influencing those patterns. That relationship remains important to understand because the United States continues to be a nation of church-goers. Recent studies have indicated the existence of more than 300,000 congregations. Moreover, two out of every three American adults claim to be a member of a congregation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144211420637">3</xref></sup> Beyond that, fully one third of Americans are evangelicals by affiliation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144211420637">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Inherent in the discussion of the role of the CRC congregations in the wholesale population movement to outlying areas are a number of issues. This would include the implications of congregational-style church polity for surrounding communities. In essence, the study of these congregations lends new insights into the roles of religious practice and how such an entity would have the ability to affect modern social change. This case study will offer an analysis that explicitly examines the roles of religious practice and how they influenced mobility. In the end, the congregational polity of the CRC denomination made it easier for members of the churches and the churches themselves to leave the city neighborhoods as African Americans moved in. This finding is significant in that almost all forms of white evangelicalism lean toward a congregational polity. That is, most decisions are local—there exists no hierarchy to mediate congregational choices and verdicts. In the end, a careful consideration of congregational polity lends nuance to understanding how white departure occurred so rapidly in some instances.</p>
<p>In addition, the story of these CRC congregations on the South Side of Chicago further complicates the notion of “white flight.” While in this instance it remains true that the white Dutch ethnic population by and large left for the suburbs, it should also be noted those congregations of the RCA persuasion left much later (in some cases more than a decade and half later) than those from the CRC. A close examination reveals that even within an ethnic (Dutch) and religious (Reformed) subculture, the term <italic>white flight</italic> fails to capture the nuances and differences in white departure.</p>
<p>Moreover, the case of Dutch relocation from Chicago and its antecedents help to bolster and offer nuances to the case presented by Michael Emerson and Christian Smith in <italic>Divided by Faith: Evangelical Religion and the Problem of Race in America</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144211420637">5</xref></sup> These two scholars posited that the very nature of evangelical Christianity has prohibited it from being an effective agent in racial reconciliation. Indeed, they asserted that in fact the very opposite remained true: evangelical Christianity actually contributed to construction and maintenance of a racialized society. Though not necessarily intentional, the nature of white evangelical religion—with its inability to address fundamental and structural stratifications—has functioned to perpetuate racial barriers.</p>
<p>In essence, white evangelicals have been opposed to individual racial prejudice while failing to understand the structural/institutional character of American racism. Emerson and Smith argued that the social reality of many evangelicals prohibited them from understanding and assessing the lack of equal opportunity in America based on race. Moreover, by denying the existence of a racialized system, the white evangelicals have actually fostered and perpetuated it. The inhibitive factor seems to be the white evangelical understanding of spirituality: each person is responsible for his or her salvation through Christ and maintenance of that relationship. Such a vision hinders a more communal view of Christianity.</p>
<p>Numerous historians and sociologists have asserted that that individualistic religiosity has direct translation in the congregational nature—that is, with authority resting at the local church level—of evangelical denominations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144211420637">6</xref></sup> Such a polity allows the congregations to own their own worship buildings. The congregational ownership contributes to an increased mobility of church bodies. In the CRC polity the congregations did indeed own their buildings. Thus, the very nature of the organizational structure of the denomination precluded any major impediment to mobilization and subsequent suburbanization.</p>
<sec id="section1-0096144211420637">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>This work is situated in a literature that includes both historical and sociological studies. The broader literature would include works that explore the way city neighborhoods changed in response to the Great Migration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144211420637">7</xref></sup> Much of this has examined the strategies of individuals, families, the real estate industry, and various levels of governments’ responses to the influx of African Americans to previously white neighborhoods. However, recent scholarship has also begun to intensely analyze the role of faith structures and religion in the departure of white families from rust belt cities in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Numerous authors have compellingly articulated that the political structures of various religious denominations deeply affected the manners in which white families belonging to churches within these denominations reacted to African Americans moving into their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>In essence, the range of church polity—from the extremely hierarchical and parish-based Roman Catholic model to the more congregational and highly mobile Orthodox Jewish model—manifested radically different strategies in the face of changing neighborhood demographics. In <italic>Urban Exodus: Why the Jews Left Boston and the Catholics Stayed</italic>, Gerald Gamm posited that local institutions (churches) played key roles in the demographic and residential changes. More precisely, he insisted that the institutional infrastructure of religion had a determinative role in allowing Jews to move to the surrounding suburbs and keeping Catholics bound to Boston proper.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144211420637">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Gamm also used the nexus of religious polity and residential change to problematize the term <italic>white flight</italic>. Gamm contended that the term “presumed to solve the riddle of the urban exodus” but failed to fully account for the white middle-class departure from cities. He went on to note that his research indicated that whites had fled mostly white neighborhoods. Only after those neighborhoods had largely emptied did property values and rents decrease to the point that African Americans could move in. Gamm concluded that to fully appreciate the complexities of urban change, it remained imperative to consider the role of local institutions—including churches and synagogues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144211420637">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since then, Amanda Seligman has also found the term <italic>white flight</italic> problematic due to its un-nuanced connotations. Seligman asserted that the term fails to express the variegated nature of white departure from cities, particularly from the evidence she explored concerning the West Side of Chicago. She contended that the term incorrectly implies that whites left the instant that African Americans appeared in their neighborhoods and that the whites played no role in attempting to buttress local infrastructure. In addition, <italic>white flight</italic> fails to convey the fact that not all departing whites left for the suburbs—some, in fact, moved to other neighborhoods in the city proper.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144211420637">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Alternatively, Kevin Kruse broadened the definition of white flight in his volume chronicling the social and spatial movements within Atlanta during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s: <italic>White Flight: Atlanta and the Making of Modern Conservatism</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144211420637">11</xref></sup> Kruse documented the initial fight of whites against racial integration and subsequent fleeing of desegregated places. However, Kruse also complicated understandings of white flight by insisting that the term should connote more than the geographic movement of whites from cities to suburbs. Instead, accounts of white flight should also consider the political transformation involved. Kruse contended that white flight included the crafting of a new type of conservatism that left behind racist demagoguery and focused on the language of “rights, freedoms, and individualism.” In that way, Kruse argued, white flight should be seen as both a physical relocation as well as a political revolution.</p>
<p>More recently, Jordan Stanger-Ross addressed the issue of white flight in a case study of two North Philadelphia Synagogues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144211420637">12</xref></sup> Stanger-Ross contended that these religious institutions did not engage in white flight, but rather practiced a flexibility that allowed them to preserve their religious institutions within the city center. However, it should be noted that in both cases, the actions of both synagogues could still plausibly be best described as modifications of white flight. First, the actions of the synagogues did nothing to discourage attendees’ movement away from African American influx. Second, though the two synagogues remained in Philadelphia proper, their actions also allowed attendees to worship in areas unaffected by the recent arrival of African Americans. The first synagogue moved to the historic center of the city and became part of a museum of Jewish history. The second synagogue did maintain the original building but also opened suburban branches to serve members no longer in the city. Neither synagogue followed a more traditional route of simple wholesale removal to the suburbs. Subsequently, this case underscores the necessity of carefully parsing discussions about white flight.</p>
<p>In a vein similar to that offered by Gamm, John T. McGreevy in <italic>Parish Boundaries: The Catholic Encounter with Race in the Twentieth Century Urban North</italic> noted that because of the parish structure in which the Roman Catholic church divided each diocese into distinct geographic areas with discernible boundaries, urban Catholics in the north had a distinctly different social experience from that of Protestants and Jews. The church structure demanded that Catholic parishioners have a much stronger connection to the local community or neighborhood. In large part, the parish did not simply constitute the local church and school. Instead, it also included the neighborhood. In fact, because of the pervasive nature of parish life, the neighborhood itself took on a sacred quality for the parishioners. Thus, Catholics tended to stay longer in urban neighborhoods than either their Protestant or Jewish counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144211420637">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Much as Emerson and Smith explored how evangelicalism affected America’s racialized cities, in <italic>Congregation and Community</italic>, Nancy Tatom Ammerman and a host of researchers examined how congregations reacted to significant community change.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144211420637">14</xref></sup> Ammerman stated that she wanted to know how the congregations fare, “what processes they adapt (when they do), and even what the process of decline and death looks like.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144211420637">15</xref></sup> Ammerman and her team focused on understanding how congregations respond to fundamental social change such as suburbanization, local factory closings, and the influx of ethnic immigrants. Included under the rubric of “community changes” was racial integration.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Ammerman found that congregations in changing neighborhoods that refuse to modify their identity will either die or will be forced move (e.g., Englewood and Roseland CRCs). Only congregations that have the vision to transform their identity will survive. In the end, Ammerman’s sociological study of congregations as organizations suggested that in light of the particularities of the population and its homogeneous nature, it should not be surprising—in fact, it should be expected—that congregations relocate in the face of neighborhood change. Congregations remain “collectively oriented.” In other words, “they direct the participants’ attention toward a group larger than themselves and their immediate kin in a way that avowedly asserts this groups’ difference from every other.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144211420637">16</xref></sup> In that sense, congregations operate as vehicles for helping to define the “other,” and scholars should not be surprised when these institutions fail to adequately adapt to a changing community.</p>
<p>In the end, this case study of CRC congregations in Chicago offers a vivid representation of churches that sought to mobilize rather than transform their vision. The significance of the influence of these local institutions on members and attendees during the era of social and geographic transition deserves an extended analysis in that it demonstrates the significance of religious structures and, subsequently, complicates notions of white flight.</p>

<sec id="section2-0096144211420637">
<title>Church Polity and Its Significance</title>
<p>To fully understand the CRC context, it is important to comprehend the structure and polity of the denomination. Only by those means can one obtain a full explication of the activities of the congregations in Roseland and Englewood. In fact, the very nature of the CRC polity lent considerable autonomy to these particular churches and allowed no denominational deliberation or influence on their relocation.</p>
<p>The CRC Order designated the existence of three assemblies: the councils, the classes, and the general synod. The local council operates as the basic unit of government. Each council then sent representatives to classis: a meeting of local or regional congregations for general supervision (designed to only deal with matters that could not be concluded in councils or those that the congregations have in common). Finally, classes send representatives to synod, an annual meeting of the denomination. Council authority reserves the responsibility for matters such as disciplining ministers. The only mitigating factors concern the advice of the classis in question and synodical consent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0096144211420637">17</xref></sup> In the end, the evolution of the Church Order of the CRC within the context of the American religious scene led the denomination toward congregationalism—that is, an ordering that allows tremendous local autonomy over property, ministerial, and budgetary matters. Perhaps most importantly for this examination of white flight in Chicago neighborhoods: local congregations own their local church properties and buildings.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the CRC’s European heritage actually did include a parish conception of the local church—it is a denomination descended from a territorial polity in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, territorial congregations—even Reformed congregations—functioned as the norm. As such, the church authority demarked an area and assigned the members to specific congregations: “individual believers do not choose their congregation, but become, so to say, incorporated in the church.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0096144211420637">18</xref></sup> However, that rigid geographically based system of church hierarchy slowly eroded for the CRC in the United States. In fact, one CRC minister noted the differences in the late 1990s: “In the Netherlands a church is a church in a given geographical area regardless of how many buildings it has. So if that heritage, that European, Reformed heritage had prevailed here, there would have been one church in Roseland with four worship centers and maybe six or eight pastors, but there would be one congregation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0096144211420637">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the United States, the CRC drifted from its territorial heritage. Thus, it could be argued that the congregational nature of the CRC that allowed congregations to easily leave Chicago neighborhoods was actually a mutation of the original polity. The aforementioned minister has noted that the polity of the CRC fails to be “faithful to its own heritage” and that it had been “modified to fit the American scene, which is very independent.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0096144211420637">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because of the CRC’s polity, individual congregations had absolutely no obstacles to fleeing the city. John McGreevy detailed the violence that sometimes erupted in defense of the Catholic parish, but he also noted that “for all their faults, the Catholic parish worlds” effectively “strengthened family, faith, and community.” While they sometimes blurred the distinctions between “community and fortress,” the parish system ultimately “sustained faith while structuring a genuine community life.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0096144211420637">21</xref></sup> Similarly, Gerald Gamm noted that though Boston parishes experienced white departure, some of those same areas eventually became “stable, racially integrated neighborhoods.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0096144211420637">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The congregational polity of the CRC functions polar opposite to the territorial parish system practiced by the Catholic church. Though the CRC took an atypical route to congregationalism, they ultimately found themselves a fully American style of church polity. Congregationalism as a model of church polity emphasizes “voluntary membership rather than ascription or geography, lay involvement in decision making, a professional clergy, [and] the declining significance of denominationalism.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0096144211420637">23</xref></sup> In America the “religious experience has been predominantly a congregational one in which leaders and members share authority in a varied and complicated fashion.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0096144211420637">24</xref></sup> To overlook the congregational character of American religion is thus to overlook the very nature of much of the American religious experience. In the case of the CRC bodies in Englewood and Roseland, a study of the nature of the congregationalism of those churches illuminates how they so easily joined the larger social movement to the suburbs.</p>
<p>In practice, the CRC’s congregationalism was not unique. The trend in American religion has been toward more localized and autonomous religious units. In 1989 historian Nathan Hatch identified the “rise of democratic Christianity” as the most dynamic element in the American religious situation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0096144211420637">25</xref></sup> A natural outgrowth of that democratization has been the dispersal of power to the local congregations. As such, the “primary extrafamilial form of community for much of the American population has been the religious congregation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0096144211420637">26</xref></sup> In addition, “clergy and clericalized laymen may be more interested at times in the wider organizational patterns. But for most lay Christians the form of the Church that means anything to them personally is their own local congregation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0096144211420637">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Especially in Protestant Christianity, the importance of the denomination has declined for church members. As denominations have waned, congregations have waxed. The declining hierarchical authority has been evidenced by the fact that increasingly congregations within the same denomination “vary wildly in theology, liturgy, and social values.” In addition, Protestant denominations have responded to the “clamor over centralized bureaucracy” by reducing staff and overhead. Such cutbacks have limited the denominations’ abilities to oversee and intervene in congregational-level affairs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0096144211420637">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Though Hatch described the tendency toward decentralization in American religion beginning since the inception of the nation, others have articulated that the trend has increased in intensity since World War II (coinciding with some of the mass movement of white families out of many American central cities). A major national study that was published in 1972 surveyed the members of fifteen denominations. The findings stated:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Out of the inherited citizenry-versus-the-colossus mentality has grown a kind of schizoid image of the church, split between the intimate local congregation on the one side and the more remote impersonal denomination on the other. Sometimes, the implication almost has seemed that they are pitted against each other. There was a tendency to concentrate resources on the community level and downgrade the denomination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0096144211420637">29</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In light of the decreased hierarchical power and subsequent growth in local religious autonomy, sociologist R. Stephen Warner has coined the term <italic>de facto congregationalism</italic>. The implication in American religions has been that “congregations can chart their own religious course despite their denominational ties.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0096144211420637">30</xref></sup> For instance, the prevalence of implementing popular hymns instead of those sanctioned in the denominational hymnbook and calling pastors from independent seminaries instead of those with denominational affiliations has left labels such as “Presbyterian,” “Lutheran,” or “Methodist” unable to convey a much information to first-time visitors to local congregations. Uniformity and central control of congregations has decreased markedly in the United States since World War II. Peter L. Berger accurately summarized the situation when he noted that “for most lay Christians the form of the Church that means anything to them personally is their own local congregation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0096144211420637">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>The increase in congregational autonomy has in turn led to less sense of territorial responsibility:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>De facto congregationalism also means that the local church is effectively constituted by its members, not by geography. In a city like Chicago, the mobility of congregations and stability of edifices are often evident in building cornerstones and carved inscriptions. A former synagogue in Greek revival style is now owned by a Puerto Rican Pentecostal church. Another synagogue is now a Greek Orthodox church. A German Lutheran church built at the turn of the century is now owned by Hispanic Seventh-day Adventists. What was built as an Anglo-Saxon Presbyterian church and was later sold to a Korean congregation now houses an Orthodox church for Arab Christians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0096144211420637">32</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It follows, therefore, that a careful explication of white movement out of the American city should include an assessment of church polity. In other words, the more congregational a church’s hierarchical structure, the easier for the local institutions to mobilize.</p>
<p>In a study on parish autonomy and the differences by denomination, Randolph Cantrell, James Krile, and George Donohue ranked a number of American denominations based on the independence that local churches maintained.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0096144211420637">33</xref></sup> Based on their findings, Roman Catholic congregations had the least autonomy while their counterparts in the United Church of Christ (UCC) had the most—these two denominations represented the poles on the continuum of denominational structure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0096144211420637">34</xref></sup> The authors found that Methodists, Presbyterians, and Lutherans fell somewhere in between Roman Catholics and the UCC on the spectrum. The three variables the researchers utilized were legal status (the degree to which control of the local church property rested in the hands of the congregation), deployment of clergy (the degree to which the local pastor is considered an officer of the congregation or an officer of the denomination), and budgetary procedures (degree to which the local congregation has the power to allocate funds).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0096144211420637">35</xref></sup> Based on their findings, Cantrell et al. categorize church polities as Episcopal, Presbyterian, and Congregational.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0096144211420637">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Based on the typologies established by Cantrell et al., the CRC clearly falls into the Congregational camp. Local church property is solely under the control of the congregation. Within the CRC, pastors are called and dismissed by congregations; they are not appointed and reassigned by the denomination. Finally, CRC congregations do have denominational quotas to fulfill, but the majority of fiscal decisions reside with the local churches.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0096144211420637">37</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Context: The Roseland Neighborhood of Chicago</title>
<p>The departures of the CRC congregations from Englewood and Roseland are separated by time (roughly ten years apart) and space (roughly forty city blocks). Three entire CRC congregations left Englewood from 1962 to 1964 while the four in Roseland departed by 1971. In contrast, the RCA’s congregations in these very same neighborhoods remained in their locations longer. The two RCA congregations in Englewood remained until 1973 and 1978, while the four in Roseland left in 1971, 1974, 1977, and 1989. The congregational polity of the CRC allowed for greater mobility for those congregations than did the Presbyterian polity that governed the RCA congregations.</p>
<p>In many ways the departures of the seven CRC congregations followed very similar templates. For that reason, I will offer a detailed discussion of Second CRC of Roseland and its surrounding neighborhood as an exemplar of how a church operating within a congregational framework self-sanctioned a departure from the city. After seventy-nine years of existence in Chicago proper, Second Roseland left for the outlying suburb of Orland Park in 1972.</p>
<p>The Dutch immigrant predecessors to the CRC congregations in Roseland arrived in the area in 1848. At that time the area was best described as a swamp with remote patches of dry prairie. However, the locale did offer easy access to the markets of Chicago because of a high ridge (at that time called Thornton Road and today known as Michigan Avenue) that allowed for consistently dry traversing. The Dutch settlers situated themselves near the ridge and set about establishing small produce farms. The economic viability of the area soon increased when the Illinois Central and Rock Island laid two railroads through the area in 1852.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0096144211420637">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the 1880s Roseland was transformed from pastoral village to a burgeoning industrial community. A real estate agent at the time commented: “111th Street might well . . . be called ‘Dinner Pail Avenue,’ for morning and night it is traversed by thousands of shop men going to and returning from work, for most of the shop men live and own homes in Roseland.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0096144211420637">39</xref></sup> Crews laid seven more railroad tracks and the Pullman factory village was established just to the east. Irish, Swedish, German, and English workers and their families began moving into Roseland. After World War I, the influx of workers also included immigrants from Italy and Poland. Moreover, a “handful” of African Americans moved into the northern fringes of the area as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0096144211420637">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some even began describing Roseland as a “city in itself.” Evidence for such a statement included the fact that its size rivaled “such cities as Bloomington, Danville, or Decatur, with its miles of paved and lighted streets, its three large school buildings, its twenty churches, its three newspapers, several wholesale groceries, a number of factories, and its two enclosed ballparks.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0096144211420637">41</xref></sup> A building boom during the 1920s brought brick bungalows, two-story single-family residences, and small apartment buildings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0096144211420637">42</xref></sup> Such structures were necessary as the population of the community increased 53 percent during the decade. One resident described construction: “The abandoned farmland south of 104th Street was split into sizeable lots commensurate with the upper-class residences that would soon be a-building; new asphalt streets and smooth sidewalks . . . provided literally miles of uninterrupted area for roller-skating, scootering, and bike riding.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0096144211420637">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>Growth of Roseland slowed a bit with the economic depression and World War II raging in Europe during the 1930s. However, during the 1940s the population would increase by 29 percent. In the northern sections of Roseland, these increases were largely attributable to African American influx. During the 1940s white residents in Roseland began to mobilize to protest the Chicago Housing Authority’s plan to construct a public housing project that would undoubtedly bring more African American residents to the community. As byproducts of central business district redevelopment, the residents of Roseland viewed the housing projects as threats to the stability of their neighborhood. Much like Englewood, these protests in Roseland sometimes became violent. At an assembly to protest the Fernwood Park Homes project, author Arnold Hirsch reported that the police arrested numerous persons with Dutch last names for racial rioting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0096144211420637">44</xref></sup> Despite these efforts by white residents of Roseland, African Americans continued to settle in the community. By 1950 the overall population of Roseland was a little over fifty thousand and African Americans accounted for 18 percent of that figure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0096144211420637">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hirsch also asserted that Cornelius Teninga (a conspicuously Dutch last name), a realtor from Roseland, offered the “most articulate” argument to the Housing Committee of the Chicago City Council. Teninga noted the people of Roseland detected a “‘disastrous financial burden’ in the forced rehousing of thousands of displaced persons but also the ‘kindling of alarming racial tensions which will result from the wholly unnecessary dispersal of the colored inhabitants at the center of our City . . . into the outlying areas.’”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0096144211420637">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>Teninga’s efforts notwithstanding, in 1954 the Chicago Housing Authority completed the construction of the Governor Frank O. Lowden Homes in the Roseland area. The 128-unit housing project was largely inhabited by African Americans. In 1960, African Americans accounted for 23 percent of the total population of Roseland.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0096144211420637">47</xref></sup> One resident in 1964 noted that the “Hollanders who made up the greater portion of Roseland . . . are now moving to the suburbs to avoid the next population change in the community.” He also related that “the local community improvement association has the avowed purpose of ‘keeping the negro out’” and that in his “judgment they will be unsuccessful.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0096144211420637">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the demographic changes, Roseland continued to be the dominant retail complex for the Far South Side<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0096144211420637">49</xref></sup> of Chicago into the 1960s. A real estate assessment conducted in 1963 found the shopping center to have a vacancy rate of 15 percent and the buildings to be in “fair” to “good” condition. The stores there included Robert Hall, Sears, Roebuck, and Gately’s Peoples.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0096144211420637">50</xref></sup> The business district had lost some sales volume to outlying areas. However, at the same time business leaders expressed hopefulness about the customers that would be brought to the area with the southwest extension of the Dan Ryan Expressway and that same road’s junction with the Calumet expressway—both were being planned near the Roseland area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0096144211420637">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>The reality, though, was that the 1960s represented the seminal moment in the decline of Roseland’s business district. The South Side of Chicago began to experience erosion within its industrial base. The effect trickled down to the retail stores. Eventually, Robert Hall, Sears, Roebuck, and Gately’s Peoples—the four major anchors—would all close their doors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0096144211420637">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>The demographic transformation and accompanying economic decline during the 1960s devastated Roseland. During the mid-1960s the in-migration of African Americans gathered such momentum that in 1970 they constituted 55 percent of Roseland’s population. The growth in percentage found aid in the fact that many white families departed. Between 1970 and 1980 the white population of Roseland dropped by almost 96 percent while the African American population grew by 82 percent. By 1980, African Americans accounted for 97 percent of a total population of over 64,000.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0096144211420637">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>Such a rapid racial turnover had devastating consequences for the community. Business and industry followed the whites to the suburbs. Residents of Roseland found themselves dealing with myriad problems: “unemployment, inflation, mortgage defaults, business failures, and gang-related problems.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0096144211420637">54</xref></sup> In the 1970s alone, the community experienced over nine hundred mortgage foreclosures. Quality of life declined as the infant mortality rate rose to 26 per 1,000—one of the worst in the city. In 1960, the community had been served by fifty-eight physicians; that number dropped to thirty-one in 1970 and eleven in 1980 (all while the total population grew by over five thousand).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0096144211420637">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>The social transitions that affected Chicago proper had particular consequences in local neighborhoods like Englewood and Roseland. The massive influx of African Americans and the struggle for housing had devastating consequences for communities. The erosion of the quality of life in both Englewood and Roseland was attributable to radical residential isolation based on race. In both communities, the local CRC congregations were conspirators in the aforementioned racial transition that left a legacy of deeply entrenched segregation. As the neighborhoods became increasingly African American, the CRC families followed the trend to find an ostensible comfort and security in the surrounding suburbs. By 1972, a total of four CRC congregations had left Roseland and, subsequently, Chicago proper as well.</p>

<title>Case Study: Second CRC of Roseland</title>
<p>As with all CRC congregations, Second Roseland exercised complete control over their location and buildings. Because of African American in-migration, 1964 seems to have been the year that the future of Roseland became a grave concern for the congregation of Second Roseland. During the first half of the year, the council of the 845-member congregation debated the feasibility of modernizing the parsonage. Such an investment displayed an intention to remain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0096144211420637">56</xref></sup> However, only a few months later the council reversed course and instead began to consider purchasing a parsonage in “a better neighborhood.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0096144211420637">57</xref></sup> It seems that the leadership of the church started to feel overwhelmed by the numerous African American arrivals to the community.

<p>The concern over the neighborhood continued to dominate the agenda of council meetings. In January 1965 the Worship Committee reported to the council their recommendation that all doors of the church be locked five minutes after the beginning of worship services to “safeguard the property of members.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0096144211420637">58</xref></sup> At the same time, the elders engaged in discussions about the future of the CRC in general in the Roseland area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0096144211420637">59</xref></sup> These conversations included overtures to the Classis Chicago South and the denomination’s Home Missions Board (a denominational office dedicated to domestic evangelism) about bringing in a missionary to work in the Roseland’s “changing community.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0096144211420637">60</xref></sup> Rumors of the congregation’s relocation, however, seeped out into the larger community.</p>
<p>Because of what had previously occurred in Englewood and what seemed to be on the horizon in Roseland, the denomination’s Synod held an Inner-cities Ministries Conference. In December 1968 the minister of Second Roseland, Charles Terpstra, brought before the council a request from the conference participants that had been forwarded to him: the conference participants requested that the CRC Synod “declare that any church congregation considering relocation of its ministry shall inform the Classis of which it is a member, and shall determine upon a site for a new location with the advice of Classis.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0096144211420637">61</xref></sup> However, such a change in polity would have undoubtedly caused a firestorm at Synod and never received formal adoption at any governmental level within the CRC.</p>
<p>Back in Roseland in January 1969 the congregation formally began the relocation process when the council appointed a committee to “consider the future” of the church. The committee reported back to the council that the church would soon face serious financial problems due to a loss of members (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0096144211420637">Figure 1</xref>) and that an immediate possibility to alleviate that pressure would be a merger with Fourth Roseland. At the same time, all four of the CRC congregations in Roseland established a “Committee of 12” (three representatives from each church) to discuss the future of the denomination in the community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0096144211420637">62</xref></sup> The Committee of 12 represented the apex of a corporate approach to addressing the demographic changes in Roseland for the four CRC congregations. Over its brief lifetime (about two years), the Committee of 12 concerned itself with discussions of merger and consolidation. The committee expended little or no effort in addressing the possibility of maintaining the current population base of the CRC or in strategically attempting to integrate the congregations. Eventually the Committee of 12 proved itself quite impotent as each of the four churches made separate decisions with little regard for the other three congregations or the larger community.</p>
<p>By April 1969 the council of Second Roseland began to seriously consider relocation. They listed some reasons for being preemptive and exploring the matter: (1) If planned early the move could be very orderly and result in a better coordinated ministry in both the old and new neighborhood. (2) Early strategic planning would allow for developing and maintaining a relevant ministry in both the “new suburban and older city communities.” (3) The planning would allow for improved stewardship in using the church’s resources. (4) The Church Order allowed it, thus the congregation had the freedom to explore relocation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0096144211420637">63</xref></sup> While the council discussed the move, attendance numbers at Sunday worship services continued to dwindle.</p>
<p>At the same time, a noticeable rift between the aforementioned Pastor Terpstra and the council had begun to develop. As a minister called to the congregation in 1965, Terpstra demonstrated a commitment to Roseland largely absent in many of the lifelong CRC residents. In 1968, the congregation celebrated their seventy-fifth anniversary. As part of the festivities, the church published a history booklet. The author of the history referred to “changes and crises” that Second Roseland presently faced in the community. In the introduction, Pastor Terpstra challenged the congregation as a whole. He noted that he had only been in the church for two and a half years, but that that did not preclude him from saying something “about the church’s continuing service.” Terpstra alluded to the struggles of the congregation when he asserted that he was convinced “that God had sent [him] here ‘for such a time as this.’” Moreover, the minister boldly argued that Second Roseland should remain: “HERE—NOW” (emphasis Terpstra’s).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0096144211420637">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>The tension between the dichotomous positions of Terpstra and the council apparently made its way into the Sunday sermons of the minister. At one point, the minutes of the council reveal an explicit request from the elders that Terpstra please “withhold critical comment from the pulpit regarding the work” of the council.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0096144211420637">65</xref></sup> The pastor and the council continued to be at odds. Ultimately, the council would be victorious. In the end, the Reformed polity assured such an outcome because the elders operated as the definitive unit of government. The minister brought business before the council that involved “anticipating the future” in the Roseland area. The council, on the other hand, established a Church Extension Committee to oversee a potential relocation to the “Illiana” (a nickname for the Illinois/Indiana border region just south of Chicago) area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0096144211420637">66</xref></sup> By 1970, the council was sending elders to the suburban Lansing, IL, area to administer a separate worship service for congregants who already moved to the vicinity. At the same juncture, Terpstra spent a week at the Urban Center for Training and Christian Missions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0096144211420637">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>The oppositional actions of the council and the minister continued through the summer of 1970. The council continued to study the advisability of disposing of the Roseland properties and potential sites for relocation. Terpstra successfully lobbied for the council to approve a motion that allowed him to “field test a race relations primer in the Roseland area.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0096144211420637">68</xref></sup> Because of the nature of the CRC’s local authority, the leadership was effectively divided. It became a battle to discern whose vision would succeed. In the end, the momentum of suburbanization left Terpstra with little chance for success.</p>
<p>In early 1971, Terpstra accepted a call from another church within the denomination. Later that year, Second Roseland passed a motion to sell the church property and seek a merger by a vote of fifty-six to twenty-six. With that result in hand, the council appointed a Sale Committee and a Merger Committee.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0096144211420637">69</xref></sup> The Sale Committee almost immediately fielded requests from both denominational and classical Home Missions boards to sell their facilities at a reduced rate to the denomination to allow for a continued “reformed witness in the Roseland area.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0096144211420637">70</xref></sup> In the waning months of 1971 the Home Missions Board and Classis Chicago South twice formally requested that Second Roseland remain in the neighborhood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0096144211420637">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition, the last few Synods had made racial injustice a significant aspect of the agenda at the meetings. In fact, the issue of race relations first received Synodical attention already in 1957 in connection with the issue of segregation. From that point on, race relations appeared on the Synod docket in 1959, 1964, 1966, and 1968 through 1974. They established new committees to study and assess how the denomination could be more just and integrated. The formation of new committees required funding from local congregations. Demonstrating a palpable belligerence to the efforts of Synod, the council of Second passed a motion to accept an overture from First Roseland to “make no financial appropriation for the denominational race expenditures.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0096144211420637">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>In early 1972 the Sale Committee had an acceptable offer from Tate Tabernacle Church of God in Christ (an African American church) and the Merger Committee had distilled the list of potential churches for merging to Orland Park CRC (formally Fourth CRC of Roseland). In June the congregation passed motions to accept Tate Tabernacle’s offer of $100,000 and to merge with Orland Park CRC.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0096144211420637">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a lot of ways, the exodus of Second Roseland, along with First, Third, and Fourth, represented a major defeat for the denomination. The Synod of the CRC had recently found itself faced with having to make some definitive statements about the church and race. When Synod first addressed the issue of race relations in 1957 the delegates agreed that “the problem of race segregation is not confined to a single congregation or classis, but it is an issue on which many congregations in many places have need of guidance.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0096144211420637">74</xref></sup> Later in the week, the Synod declared that the</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Deprivation of equal rights and opportunities in society on the basis of race or color is contrary to the will of God . . . . Negroes have been deprived of rights and opportunities equal to those given whites, have been relegated to a position inferior to that of whites in social respectability. Racial prejudice leading to such social injustice is a tragic blot on our society. It is the duty of the members of the church of Christ to be active in removing this stain. The church is called upon to heal that which is broken and raise up that which is fallen. Therefore, it is called to give special help and nurture to those against whom a social injustice has been committed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0096144211420637">75</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>By 1958, the CRC Synod adopted the Reformed Ecumenical Synod’s (a loose affiliation of Reformed churches in North America, Great Britain, South Africa, and the Netherlands) twelve-point declaration on race relations. Point Nine in the declaration seemed especially applicable to the churches in Roseland:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>The practical implication for the ministry of the Church is that in common congregational meetings and in admitting members of another race to our own gatherings, we should guard against any impression of discrimination that would imply the inferiority of another race the members of which should be made to feel that are being regarded as fellow-members in the body of Christ, bound to us by the closest of ties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0096144211420637">76</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The Synod grounded the adoption on the basis that “racial tensions and the flagrant violation of the Scriptural principle of equality” had been occurring in both society and in the church.</p>
<p>In 1964 Synod reaffirmed its stance on race relations when it recommended that CRC congregations particularly note Reformed Ecumenical Synod’s statement when persons of different ethnicities or races live in proximity, that all individuals and groups should be afforded “God-given rights.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0096144211420637">77</xref></sup> Four years later, Synod made perhaps its boldest statement on race relations and the integration of CRC and CRC-affiliated institutions:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Fear of persecution or of disadvantage to self or our institutions arising out of obedience to Christ does not warrant denial to anyone, for reasons of race or color, of full Christian fellowship and privilege in the church or related organizations, such as Christian colleges and schools, institutions of mercy and recreational associations; and that if members of the Christian Reformed Church advocate such denial, by whatever means, they must be reckoned as disobedient to Christ and dealt with according to the provisions of the Church Order regarding Admonition and Discipline.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0096144211420637">78</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A Cicero, IL, congregation (Warren Park CRC) that was struggling with its own race-related issues responded to the statement by noting that it was inadvisable for Synod to “adjudicate on a local matter concerning which the church at large has only a limited knowledge of the situation and the circumstances involved.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0096144211420637">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>Undeterred by the snub from Warren Park CRC, the 1969 Synod strongly urged all CRC congregations to examine themselves for instances of racism and to hold regional conferences for discussing and combating the subject. Moreover, the Synod urged all member-churches to reject every form of racism and the subtle forms of racial discrimination found in housing, employment, education, and law enforcement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0096144211420637">80</xref></sup> In order to more effectively combat insidious racism within the denomination, the Synod directed the Home Missions Board to create a Race Commission. Home Missions responded by creating a subcommittee of its Urban Fields Committee. The 1970 Synod charged the Race Commission with creating a “concerted denominational effort . . . to welcome black Christians in our churches, that they be given a voice, and that qualified black men are encouraged to enter the ministry of our denomination.” Beyond that, the Synod also expressed a desire for all denominational periodicals to emphasize “brotherhood between all races.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0096144211420637">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>The issue of racial injustice remained preeminent within the denomination at large. At Synod 1971 the Race Commission reported its recommendation that Synod create an entirely separate committee—directly answerable to and directly funded by Synod. The Commission argued that they had been hampered by the bureaucracy of being a “subcommittee of a subcommittee” and that a new committee with a higher degree of autonomy would be more effective. Synod adopted the recommendation from the Race Commission and created the Synodical Committee on Race Relations (SCORR). Synod charged SCORR with the mandate “to design, organize, and implement programs through which the denomination, individual churches, and members, can effectively use all available resources to eliminate racism, both causes and effects, within the body of believers, and throughout the world in which we live.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0096144211420637">82</xref></sup> More explicitly, SCORR had responsibilities to produce materials regarding race relations, alert the denomination to existing racial problems, engage in research, serve as agents of reconciliation, provide scholarships to minority groups, and assist in providing legal aid where specific racial problems require.</p>
<p>Even with the creation of SCORR, the Home Missions Board of the CRC remained highly active in the area of race relations. At Synod 1971 the board recommended that the denomination become a participant in Project Equality. Interestingly enough, Classis Chicago South—which included the Englewood, Roseland, and descendent churches, thereof—quickly registered an overture that Synod not become a participant in Project Equality. With Classis Chicago South’s recommendation on the table, the Home Missions board presented a report titled “The Christian Reformed Church’s Participation in Project Equality.” The report delineated the activities of Project Equality and offered a rationale for CRC involvement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0096144211420637">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>Originally conceived by the National Catholic Conference for Interracial Justice as an equal opportunity employment program, Project Equality had grown since its inception in 1969 into an inter-religious program. By 1971, Project Equality operated in twenty-three states, included seventeen local chapters, and had an annual budget of over $1 million. Twenty-seven religious denominations supported Project Equality and the report to Synod described it as “probably (receiving) more financial support on a broad inter-religious base than any other program ever launched in the United States.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0096144211420637">84</xref></sup> The report described Project Equality as a coherent system that allowed religious institutions to leverage their purchasing power to promote equal opportunity employment practices by their suppliers.</p>
<p>The Home Missions Board articulated that the CRC ought to participate in Project Equality because it constructively combined “economic muscle” with a “moral persuasion” that resonated with the Christian principles of the CRC. Moreover, membership in Project Equality would assist the denomination in fostering racial justice. In the end, membership in the program would lend integrity to much of the race reconciliation rhetoric that the CRC espoused. The Home Missions Board concluded their remarks with an “enthusiastic recommendation” to participate in Project Equality: “By membership we are adding our voice to the voices of many other religious institutions saying that we intend to make our buying practices as consistent with our beliefs and preaching as possible. . . . We are joining a project that will help us become aware of some of the underlying causes of economic injustice and poverty to which we are frequently insensitive.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0096144211420637">85</xref></sup> The congregational delegates at Synod took the recommendation under advisement but declined to immediately participate. Synod justified tabling the issue by noting that although they “endorsed employment policies that affirmatively promote equality of opportunity for all people,” that Project Equality needed “more elucidation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0096144211420637">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>By 1972, SCORR had increased college scholarships for minority students and conducted research on institutionalized racism. At that year’s Synod, SCORR reiterated the assertion that joining Project Equality would indicate a “meaningful action” on the part of the CRC. Perhaps most radically, SCORR also proposed that Synod create a committee on Central City Parish Problems “to give strong and necessary support to local churches in their attempts to facilitate better housing conditions and programs attuned to other major parish problems such as public safety and consumerism.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0096144211420637">87</xref></sup> SCORR offered three points of rationale. First, the inner-city locations of many CRC congregations maintained a strategic importance in economic and social value to their inhabitants. Subsequently, those areas functioned as “‘home’ and should be prevented from becoming completely unlivable.” Second, SCORR asserted that the “local church . . . has a responsibility to its parish, to stabilize it and to facilitate its spiritual and physical development.” Finally, the immensity of the task demanded more resources than those typically available to the local church.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0096144211420637">88</xref></sup> Synod 1972 accepted the recommendation as information but made no formal attempt to immediately implement. However, the activities and overtures of SCORR would continue to dominate the Synodical meetings throughout the 1970s.</p>
<p>Thus, beginning in the 1950s and continuing through the 1970s, the CRC operated as a denomination full of contradictions. While the leaders at the Synodical level clearly understood the damage that racial injustice wreaked on the urban United States, those at the congregational level steadfastly either failed to see or acknowledge the same phenomenon. The crux of the matter, however, remained the fact that the Synods had virtually no established means for coercing or even cajoling individual congregations to adhere to the denominational statements on racism and institutional racial injustice. In fact, in some instances the congregations the Synod attempted to censure reacted with more disdain than contrition to its rulings.</p>
<p>The impotency of the Synod resided in the design of the CRC polity. With such limited hierarchical authority, neither classis nor Synod had a basis to interfere with the relocation of a congregation. The only parameters that would have predicated classical involvement would have been the appeal from congregants who objected to a council decision or if the congregation specifically solicited advice from the classis. In all other circumstances, the relocation of a church remains solely the prerogative of majority approval at a congregational meeting. The local congregation reserves total autonomy for financing and administering the physical properties to which it holds the title. In the end, “a congregation may do what it wills with its physical resources, move when and where it decides to, and simply inform the Classical Stated Clerk of its change of address.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0096144211420637">89</xref></sup></p>
<p>Subsequently, Synodical- and Classical-level minutes during the late 1960s and early 1970s frequently referred to the overarching question of race. Beyond that, it seems vividly clear that within the denominational leadership there were palpable concerns about white flight. However, both the Synod and Classis Chicago South remained without recourse: “Neither Classis nor Synod ever addressed the question of white flight and how all those churches were picking up and going west and southwest. But they all did.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0096144211420637">90</xref></sup></p>
<p>In fact, the deliberations of Second Roseland revealed a conspicuous absence: absolutely no dialogue with Synod or Classis Chicago South. Moreover, they sought no professional advice from existing bodies such as the Church Federation of Greater Chicago (CFGC). They seemed to possess little vision for the future of the community. Some have argued that CFGC “could have told them that their community was residentially mature and, from their particular point of view, had reached its peak. If they had been patient the pressure on the capacity of those two churches would have been eased in no time. But they didn’t look beyond their own walls.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0096144211420637">91</xref></sup> In a similar circumstance, when Third Roseland discerned in 1964 the block by block advance of African American families, they purchased land and built a new sanctuary less than one mile west of their previous location. The congregation worshipped at the new site little more than seven years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0096144211420637">92</xref></sup> In both cases, the congregations demonstrated quite illustratively the outcomes for a church that does all planning based solely on internal information. With no input from denominational or interdenominational bodies, the congregations made decisions with negative implications. Third Roseland’s decision was especially shortsighted. One local CRC minister who witnessed the quick movements of Third Roseland ascribed the relocations to extreme “congregational thinking. If they had consulted the Church Federation of Greater Chicago they could’ve been told what was happening. Their only viewpoint was ‘congregationally.’ They couldn’t even think ‘classically.’”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0096144211420637">93</xref></sup></p>
<p>The inability to ally effectively with congregations from the same denomination plagued the churches of Roseland. Terpstra specifically created the Committee of 12 in an effort to honestly discuss the intentions of all the congregations concerned. Terpstra later discussed the proceedings:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>And we promised each other at those meetings that we would all keep each other exactly informed of what was happening. But it did happen that someone rented Chicago Christian High School in suburban Palos Heights for worship services and didn’t tell the rest of us. . . . It didn’t take long at those committee meetings that it was understood that everyone was going to leave.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0096144211420637">94</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The conspirator that had undermined the Committee of 12 by sanctioning worship services in the suburbs turned out to be Fourth Roseland, the first congregation to depart from the neighborhood.</p>

<title>CRC and RCA Congregations on the South Side of Chicago: A Comparison</title>
<p>Congregationalism has been routinely described as an American manifestation of religion. Oddly enough, the CRC—a denomination known for its Dutch ethnicity—has evolved into a denomination that practices a virile form of American congregationalism. In contrast, the RCA (a denomination that had a much longer history in the United States) practiced a more centralized polity. Whereas the purchasing and selling of property in the CRC resided solely under the control of the local congregation, in the RCA that authority fell under the auspices of the appropriate classis: “The consistory [of the local congregation] shall not sell, transfer, lease, mortgage or otherwise alienate or encumber any real property of the church on which there stands a building designed for worship or religious instruction, or as a residence for the minister, unless the approval of the classis of which that church is a member has been secured.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0096144211420637">95</xref></sup> Such a statement within the Church Order allowed the classis in question the opportunity to deliberate upon and even prohibit the relocation of congregations. Such a bylaw assured more deliberation and study before local churches moved. In essence, the classis in the RCA had the jurisdiction to assess the effect of movement on the classis as a whole and the community within which the congregation currently existed.</p>
<p>Conversely, the CRC Church Order provided no avenues for classical restrictions on congregational mobility. The limited allusion within the Church Order regarding the matter stated: “Each assembly shall provide for the safeguarding of its property through incorporation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0096144211420637">96</xref></sup> A commentary on the Church Order elucidated that such an article should be interpreted to allow congregations “the right to buy and build; to serve God unmolested; to retain their properties; etc.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0096144211420637">97</xref></sup> Moreover, this statement on property was designed “to assure the churches against the unfair infringement upon their property rights, both on the part of individuals and groups—the latter especially.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0096144211420637">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>The divergent language in the church orders of the CRC and RCA indicated a significant difference in polity theory for the two denominations. Whereas the RCA maintained a more hierarchical and Presbyterian form of authority, the CRC evolved into a more Congregational-style denomination. The variant forms of polity had discernible influence in the reaction of congregations in Englewood and Roseland to the presence of African Americans in their communities. In Englewood, First CRC left in 1961 and Second CRC in 1962. In contrast, with mobility limited by classis, Hope RCA remained until 1973 and First RCA until 1978. Similar to the sequence of events in Englewood, in Roseland the RCA congregations remained for years after the CRC churches had left the neighborhood. All four CRC congregations in Roseland left for the suburbs between 1971 and 1972. Conversely, Gano RCA and Emmanuel RCA remained until 1977 and 1989, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0096144211420637">99</xref></sup></p>
<p>The major polity disparity between these denominations was the hierarchical control over property matters. The congregational nature of the CRC allowed for a hasty exit from the city while the RCA remained, at times, for decades longer. In the end, this crucial polity difference permitted the CRC congregations to depart more easily and, subsequently, more quickly. The structures and processes of their respective religious affiliations had definite and discernible effect on white families in American cities as they responded to African American in-migration in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0096144211420637">
<title>CRC Polity and Lutheran Polity: A Comparison</title>
<p>Gerald Gamm and John McGreevy have clearly demonstrated that the Roman Catholic parish-style polity tied families to the local church and thus to the local community. Such an organizational structure gave great pause to parishioners as African Americans began arriving in their neighborhood. Gamm especially delineated how the Roman Catholics responded differently from the more congregational Jews.</p>
<p>However, it would also be useful to compare the activities of the CRC to fellow Protestant denominations as well. The differences between the CRC and RCA have already been documented. However, the scale produced by Cantrell et al. places Lutheran churches firmly between the extremes of Roman Catholicism and United Church of Christ (most similar to CRC) in regard to congregational autonomy. Though they did experience a loss of inner-city congregations during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, the Lutheran denominations as a whole demonstrated a much more concerted effort to avoid closures and relocations due to white exodus. In other words, the Lutheran denominations’ central authorities employed strategies of cooperation that were available to them because of their hierarchical structure. In stark contrast to the CRC, whose Synod made obvious but unsuccessful efforts to combat racial inequality and injustice, the Lutheran denominations exercised their authority to ensure that congregations participated in these efforts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0096144211420637">100</xref></sup></p>
<p>The most notable of Lutheran efforts to remain involved in changing communities was the National Lutheran Council (NLC). The NLC was an example of inter-Lutheran planning that sought to foster cooperation in urban ministry. The NLC conducted in-depth studies of urban areas in an effort to make churches aware of the need for greater cooperation. Moreover, specific attempts were “made to get urban and suburban congregations to cooperate.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0096144211420637">101</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition, Lutheran churches formed citywide cooperative ministries. The judicatories and denominational offices not only approved such endeavors, they also offered financial support. In fact, “the general principle for organizing the cooperative ministry was either, ‘We will do together what none of us can do alone,’ or ‘As Lutherans we need to build strength upon strength to have a voice in a changing society.’”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0096144211420637">102</xref></sup> That sentiment clearly indicated a proclivity toward inter-congregational efforts that did not exist in the CRC.</p>
<p>In Chicago in 1954, Lutheran churches met to discuss their “special responsibility and challenge in their relations to minority groups.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0096144211420637">103</xref></sup> The twenty-one churches of the Southern Chicago District of Augustana Churches adopted a statement where they announced that “no local church has any more right to decide to be racially or culturally exclusive than it has to modify or abandon any articles of faith” and that it was wrong for churches to “abandon fields simply because the racial or cultural composition has changed.” Most forcefully, the twenty-one churches of the Southern Chicago District asserted that it was “spiritually dangerous and inconsistent with the Christian faith and the decision of our Church” to be “unwilling to pay the spiritual price of adjusting to a situation where minority races are involved.” Moreover, the District encouraged “any member who wishes to disassociate himself from a congregation where minority groups are likely to be received” to “rethink his motivation.” The statement concluded with the acknowledgement that “a true church of Jesus Christ does not make racial differences a disqualification for membership.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0096144211420637">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>Beyond congregations collaborating in Chicago to inhibit members from leaving the city, Lutheran churches also allied themselves with other denominations in creating entities such as the Joint Action and Strategy Committee—an effort to coordinate resources nationally and regionally. These efforts raised the consciousness of the church “regarding urban issues.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0096144211420637">105</xref></sup> Moreover, some of the cooperative ministries formed during the 1960s and 1970s still existed well into the 1990s.</p>
<p>These assorted actions on the denominational level functioned as the impetus for individual urban congregations that made concerted efforts to root themselves in their neighborhoods during the 1960s. The churches became more integrated: “The racial, economic, and social makeup of the neighborhood was increasingly reflected in the membership, worship, and leadership of the congregation. The church became a part of the neighborhood. . . . The pastor and the congregation became the Lutheran church for that place.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-0096144211420637">106</xref></sup> The process of rooting within the neighborhood became especially structured in Philadelphia with the formation of the Center City Lutheran Parish in 1964. The coalition sought to support Lutheran congregations as they “rerooted themselves in their neighborhoods.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-0096144211420637">107</xref></sup></p>
<p>The broader efforts of the less congregational Lutheran denominations manifested themselves in Englewood. In October 1963 (more than a year after the three CRC congregations had left for the suburbs), Bethel Lutheran Church not only remained at their location in Englewood, but they also hosted a conference of local clergy. The meeting had the stated purpose of addressing the “current problems in Englewood” and discussing “what responsibility the clergy have and what role they might take in developing a strong community organization.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-0096144211420637">108</xref></sup> The meeting also demonstrated the Lutherans’ ability to develop interfaith partnerships as the conference included the local Catholic churches.</p>
<p>In the end, the fact that the Lutheran denominations employed a less congregational polity seems to have produced effective concerted efforts to keep Lutheran congregations within cities and within diverse communities. The congregational nature of the CRC precluded any similar measures within that denomination. Evidence demonstrated that there existed elements within the CRC who desired to confront the mass relocation of the urban congregations in Chicago. However, they had no options at their disposal within the confines of the church polity that inhibited a denominational-level approach (such as those implemented by the Lutherans or RCA) to consider a strategy for the changes in Englewood and Roseland.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A careful study of the CRC (a thoroughly congregational denomination) in contrast to Catholics, Lutherans, and the RCA (all less congregational in polity) reveals religious polity had a role in changing urban and suburban residential patterns and helps to complicate notions of white flight.</p>
<p>Under the Americanized polity of the CRC, the congregations in Englewood and Roseland stood in stark contrast to the Catholic parishes. There existed no authority structure to ensure that the congregations remained responsible for and involved in their local communities. The CRC polity allowed congregations to act only in terms of self-preservation. The survival impulse seemed to permeate every decision of the churches. Moreover, while the denominational leaders of the CRC demonstrated an understanding of the insidious nature of institutionalized racism, the congregations in question remained nonplussed. The Synod consistently addressed racism within the denomination, created an organization solely to deal with racial injustice, and even thoughtfully examined joining an inter-religious organization, Project Equality—a radical step for a denomination wary of formal associations with Roman Catholics and mainline Protestant denominations. At the same time, the Roseland congregations of the same CRC denomination undermined much of what the Synod attempted. Within the CRC polity, however, the congregations effectively answered to no other authority in these instances.</p>
<p>The congregational polity of the denomination allowed the CRC congregations an autonomy that granted them unfettered freedom and mobility. Feeling no obligations to the community or larger assemblies, the CRC congregations of Englewood and Roseland exercised a sovereignty solely concerned with institutional self-preservation. As largely independent institutions, they had no predilection or resources for integration. Thus, departure represented the only viable means of survival, in their limited view. In contrast, the polities of neighboring RCA and Lutheran congregations forced those churches to at least deliberate and seek some hierarchical sanction to leave the city. In the end, the style of congregational polity allowed the churches in Englewood and Roseland a high level of mobility compared to fellow Protestants. Such finely shaded distinctions ultimately demonstrate the role of religious polity in the variegated nature of white departure from the city.</p>

<p>The work of Emerson and Smith, <italic>Divided by Faith</italic>, has significance for this case study as well because the Christian Reformed Church in North America (CRC) fits within the rubric of “evangelical.” Considering their Calvinist heritage and attachment to the doctrine of predestination (that the salvation of the “elect” has been foreordained by God), it would not be intuitive to label the CRC “evangelical.” However, Emerson and Smith clearly delineate the doctrinal hallmarks of evangelicals and the CRC does fit the profile: (1) claim themselves as evangelical, (2) claim that Jesus Christ remains the sole avenue to salvation, (3) accept the Bible as true in all ways, and (4) actively engage in evangelism or give money for such purposes. The CRC would actively claim all four hallmarks. In addition, the denomination does hold membership in the National Association of Evangelicals. As such, this case study offers some compelling insights into the relationship of evangelicals and urban residential patterns.</p>

<p>The scale offered by Cantrell et al., “Parish Autonomy,” has been replicated, most notably by Mike McMullen, “Religious Polities as Institutions,” <italic>Social Forces</italic> 73 (1994): 709-28. On p. 710 McMullen noted that the Roman Catholic Church and the United Church of Christ “have very different institutional structures, called ‘polities,’ in the sociology of religion literature, where a polity refers to denomination’s form of government. The Catholic church is an episcopal polity that has a hierarchical structure invested with formal authority; the UCC is a congregational polity with a decentralized structure, where all formal authority is situated in the local church.”</p>

<label>35.</label>
<p>McMullen, “Religious Polities,” made similar definitions of episcopal and congregational polity. He noted that a congregational polity included a “decentralized structure” that gave the “autonomous local congregation the authority to hire or fire ministers, discipline its members, control its finances,” 712.</p>
