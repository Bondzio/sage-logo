<p><italic>Memoria Histórica e Identidad en Cine y Televisión</italic>, an edited collection of seven chapters written in Spanish, explores media representations of history in Spain and Italy. The book offers a review of various cinema and television genres in order to analyse the impact of these representations on the shaping of a country’s historical memory and identity. Although the chapters focus primarily on the first decade of the twenty-first century, we also find some analysis of representations of historical memory in the last century.</p>
<p>The book is divided into three sections based on three clearly defined main areas. After an introduction by Ibáñez, the first section includes two chapters, one by Anania and a second one by Manuel Palacio and Carmen Ciller. Anania’s contribution provides a review of theoretical concepts and insights in the study of historical memory in the media. Palacio and Ciller’s chapter, on the other hand, reviews some of the most significant television programmes that have recently dealt with historical memory in Spain. Although the review is not exhaustive (partly because the book was published in 2010 and, since then, we have seen the emergence of even more programmes depicting different parts of Spain’s history), the authors mention some significant examples, such as <italic>Els Nens Perduts del Franquism, La Señora</italic> and <italic>La Chica de Ayer</italic>. More importantly, the chapter offers a classification of programmes according to the ways in which they engage with historical memory, encompassing the general, ‘universal’, rather linear representations of Spanish history (<italic>Memoria de España</italic>), the use of imagery to represent history (<italic>La Transición, Dies de Transició</italic>), soap operas depicting social and more or less political relations in the past, particularly during Franco’s dictatorship (<italic>Temps de Silenci, Amar en Tiempos Revueltos</italic>), and historical adaptations based on books such as Jorge M Reverte’s (2003) <italic>La Batalla del Ebro</italic>, which was later adapted into two episodes of <italic>El Laberinto Español</italic>.</p>
<p>The second section of the book generally deals with the representations of the Italian and Spanish civil wars. It comprises three chapters: two of these contributions review representations of the Spanish Civil War in Spanish cinema (José Luis Castro de Paz focuses on the period between 1939 and 1965, and Ibáñez examines the first decade of the twenty-first century), while the third one, written by Riccardo Gualdo, explores the representations of the Italian Civil War on Italian television. Finally, the third section comprises two chapters providing an overview of the historical mediation of terrorism in Italy (by Stefano Telve) and in Spain (by Concepción Cascajosa Virino). Telve’s chapter is concerned with the historical evolution of representations of the kidnapping and murder of Aldo Moro in 1978. The author provides an insightful review of the way the kidnapping was narrated as it happened (over a time period of nearly two months) and the ways in which it was subsequently mediated in various programmes from the 1980s to the first decade of the twenty-first century. Always relating the changes in these representations to broader political and commercial aspects, Telve argues that recent programmes on Moro’s death have turned his experience into a personal drama for the audience’s entertainment, losing the historical and political significance of the event.</p>
<p>Cascajosa Virino’s chapter, on the other hand, reviews representations of terrorism on Spanish cinema and television series, including fictional and non-fictional events. The author argues that some of these representations, including those of events perpetrated by ETA and the Madrid train bombings on 11 March 2004, have avoided the ideological nature of terrorism and have focused on it as a common criminal activity. The chapter pays attention to some specific episodes of <italic>Cuéntame Cómo Pasó</italic>, which dealt with terrorist events in Franco’s times, including the death of Franco’s right-hand man Luis Carrero Blanco by ETA, and it also makes references to the 48-hour kidnapping and eventual murder of Miguel Ángel Blanco in 1997. Cascajosa Virino highlights how Spain is divided into two ‘clearly defined and irreconcilable’ halves, not only with reference to the Civil War and ETA’s terrorism, but also in relation to the Madrid train bombings. In addition, the chapter offers some interesting insights into the use of humour to represent terrorism on Spanish television, with special references to programmes such as <italic>Vaya Semanita</italic> and <italic>Homo Zapping News</italic>.</p>
<p>In the introductory chapter Ibáñez points out that the authors were interested in comparing representations of historical memory in Italy and Spain, bearing in mind the cultural similarities between both countries and the role of the media in the recent rearticulation of discourses about the nation and national cultures in both countries. Although this is an objective worth pursuing, it would have been fruitful to explore the insights that can be drawn from this comparison, perhaps in a concluding chapter that indicates the significance of carrying out this cross-country study and what we can learn from it.</p>
<p>From the perspective of a Spanish reader who is already familiar with the contextualization of the chapters dedicated to Spanish memory, but no so acquainted with the Italian case studies, it is fair to say that the book does not assume any previous knowledge in memory studies or the specific historical and sociopolitical contexts of the case studies. Therefore, readers will find historical references easy to understand and engage with. Overall, this is a useful contribution to the field of memory studies in the Spanish and Italian contexts, and to the study of media representations of historical memory more generally. This source is particularly relevant for anyone, including students and academics, initializing themselves in the study of memory in the media. This is also a valuable source for those seeking to learn about a range of specific case studies and the representations of particular events or topics in relation to memory, particularly the Civil War, the dictatorship and terrorism.</p>
