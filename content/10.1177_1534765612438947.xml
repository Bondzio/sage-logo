<abstract>
<p>This study compared the Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) scores of traumatized youth with or without PTSD to the scores of a nonclinical comparison group. Child diagnostic interviews identified children with PTSD (28), traumatized children without PTSD (63), and a nonclinical comparison group (41). In the absence of major comorbid disorders, children with PTSD had significantly higher RCMAS total scores and significantly higher scores on the RCMAS Physiological Anxiety, Worry/Oversensitivity, and Social Concern/Concentration subscales. Nonsignificant differences were observed between groups on the RCMAS Lie subscale. The RCMAS scores of the traumatized PTSD negatives and controls did not significantly differ. Implications for research and practice are considered.</p>

<title>An Analysis of the Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale Ratings of Traumatized Urban Youth With and Without PTSD</title>
<p>According to the American Psychiatric Association’s (APA) <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765612438947"><italic>DSM-IV</italic>, 1994</xref>), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is indicated by exposure to exceptional stress and trauma-related thoughts and nightmares, avoidance, increased arousal, irritability, social estrangement, and functional impairments. With reference to the prevalence of PTSD among youth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765612438947">Kilpatrick et al. (2000)</xref> determined that 8%, 17%, and 39% of a large American community sample aged 12 to 17 years respectively reported that they had been sexually assaulted, physically assaulted, or had witnessed someone being shot, stabbed, sexually and or physically assaulted. This study also determined that 8.1% of the sample had PTSD at some time during their life. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534765612438947">Perkonigg, Kessler, Storz, and Wittchen (2000)</xref> assessed the prevalence of traumatic exposure among a representative community sample of German youth (age range 14-24 years). These authors reported that 21.4% of the respondents experienced one or more traumatic incidents and 7.8% met diagnostic criteria for a current PTSD diagnosis.</p>
<p>Given the need to increase our understanding of how traumatic experiences may influence children and the clinical need to identify measures that are sensitive to the expression of PTSD in children, several studies investigated the Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534765612438947">Reynolds &amp; Richmond, 1978</xref>) ratings of traumatized children and adolescents. Within this context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534765612438947">Saigh (1989)</xref> administered the RCMAS to a sample of Lebanese children who met criteria for PTSD or simple phobia and a nontraumatized control group without phobia. Data analysis determined that the RCMAS total scores of the PTSD group were significantly greater than the scores of the phobia and control groups. Saigh also reported that the RCMAS scores of the phobia group significantly exceeded the scores of the controls. In a related study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765612438947">Saigh (1991)</xref> compared the RCMAS total scores of Lebanese youth who developed PTSD following four different categories of traumatic events and a nontrauma exposed control group. The trauma categories included, (a) direct personal exposure to events that constituted threats to their own lives or their personal well-being (e.g., abduction or rape), (b) observing others who were exposed to life-threatening events or events that posed a threat to the well-being of others (e.g., witnessing an execution or torture), (c) being told about an incident that constituted a threat to the lives or well-being of others (e.g., being told in detail about the death of a relative whose body was mutilated), and (d) combinations involving direct exposure, observation, and or verbal mediation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765612438947">Saigh (1991)</xref> observed that while the RCMAS total scores of the four trauma groups with PTSD did not significantly vary, the scores of the PTSD groups significantly exceeded the scores of the nontraumatized controls. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612438947">Dalgleish et al. (2000)</xref> reported that the RCMAS total scores of British children who developed PTSD following road traffic accidents significantly exceeded the scores of nontraumatized controls.</p>
<p>While these investigations indicate that the RCMAS is sensitive to the expression of PTSD following a variety of traumatic experiences, a number of methodological and conceptual concerns are apparent. First, the studies that were reviewed did not control for the potentially confounding effects of comorbid disorders. This omission is problematic as children with PTSD frequently evidence attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder (CD), substance abuse or dependence, or major depressive disorder (MDD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612438947">Merry &amp; Andrews, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534765612438947">Sack et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534765612438947">Saigh, Sack, Yasik, &amp; Koplewicz, 1999</xref>). As these disorders have been associated with elevated RCMAS scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612438947">Bernstein, Carroll, Thuras, Cosgrave, &amp; Roth, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765612438947">Ollindick, Seligman, Butcher, &amp; Div, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534765612438947">Perrin &amp; Last, 1992</xref>), it is not clear if the reported variations in RCMAS scores may be attributed to PTSD, major comorbid disorders, or a combination of PTSD and comorbid disorders. Second, it is not clear if PTSD was associated with higher RCMAS scores or if trauma exposure in the absence of PTSD was associated with increased anxiety as none of the investigations that were reviewed compared youth with PTSD to traumatized children without PTSD. This omission is clinically significant as trauma exposure frequently does not lead to PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765612438947">Copeland, Keeler, Angold, &amp; Costello, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765612438947">Kulka et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765612438947">McNally, Bryant, &amp; Ehlers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534765612438947">Sack et al., 1993</xref>). This omission is also clinically significant given the need to know if traumatized youth who do not develop PTSD have elevated levels of anxiety relative to nontraumatized youth. Finally, it is important to note that the RCMAS is a multicomponent test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534765612438947">Reynolds &amp; Richmond, 1978</xref>) and the studies that were reviewed did not offer information regarding RCMAS subscale variations. This omission is significant as information about the RCMAS subscale scores of traumatized children could offer significant insights about the specific distress of traumatized youth and as such information could be used to evaluate treatment efficacy.</p>
<p>Given these concerns, this study compared the RCMAS total and subscale scores of traumatized youth with and without PTSD to the scores of nontraumatized controls. In the absence of major comorbid disorders, it was hypothesized that children with PTSD would evidence significantly higher levels of anxiety. Support for this expectation was drawn from an investigation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534765612438947">Saigh, Yasik, Oberfield, Halamandaris, and McHugh (2002)</xref>. This study excluded major comorbid disorders and observed that the parent-completed Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534765612438947">Achenbach, 1991</xref>) Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn, and Somatic Complaints scores of youth with PTSD were significantly greater than the scores of traumatized PTSD negatives and controls. Further support for this hypothesis was drawn from treatment studies that reported significant reductions in RCMAS scores after youth with PTSD had completed trauma-focused cognitive behavioral regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612438947">Farrell, Hains, &amp; Davies, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534765612438947">Saigh, 1987a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534765612438947">1987b</xref>). It was also expected that the RCMAS scores of the traumatized children without PTSD would not significantly differ from the scores of the nontraumatized controls as the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534765612438947">Saigh et al. (2002)</xref> study reported nonsignificant differences between traumatized PTSD negatives and controls on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534765612438947">Achenbach, 1991</xref>) Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn, and Somatic Complaints scales.</p>

<title>Recruitment process</title>
<p>Practitioners from Bellevue Hospital pediatric clinics referred youth who experienced, witnessed, or were confronted by a traumatic event as defined by the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> PTSD criterion A1. Nontraumatized participants were recruited from families with appointments in clinics that provide routine medical examinations to children. A multifaceted evaluation procedure was used to identify youth with PTSD, traumatized youth without PTSD, and nontraumatized controls. Multiple examiners and assessment methods were used to formulate PTSD diagnoses as this approach reduces information variance that is associated with the formulation of psychiatric diagnoses (Nelson &amp; Israel, 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534765612438947">Spitzer, Endicott, &amp; Robins, 1978</xref>). As such, all of the participants received two independent <italic>DSM-IV</italic>-based clinical interviews for PTSD and two independent administrations of the <italic>Children’s PTSD Inventory</italic> (2003).</p>

<title>Traumatized PTSD Negative Inclusion Criteria</title>
<p>To have been included in this group, participants must have been exposed to traumatic events that reflected the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> PTSD Criteria A1 definition and not met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. In making this determination, two independent psychiatrists and psychologists clinically interviewed cases using the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> PTSD A1 definition of trauma exposure. The psychiatrists and psychologists also relied on the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> PTSD diagnostic criteria I determining that these participants did not meet the minimum threshold for a PTSD diagnosis. In addition, participants must have reported exposure to one or more traumatic event that is consistent with the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> A1 definition of trauma exposure and not met diagnostic criteria for PTSD as denoted by two independent administrations of the <italic>Children’s PTSD Inventory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765612438947">Saigh, 2003</xref>).</p>

<p>To have been assigned to this group, participants must have reported that they had not had a traumatic experience as denoted by the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> Criteria A1 definition during two independent clinical interviews that were performed by psychiatrists and psychologists. In addition, they must have reported that they had not had a traumatic experience as denoted by the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> Criteria A1 trauma exposure items on <italic>the Children’s PTSD Inventory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765612438947">Saigh, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Exclusionary criteria</title>
<p>Inasmuch as youth with a history of abuse or neglect may experience ongoing distress through court proceedings and or foster care placements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534765612438947">McLeer, Callaghan, Henry, &amp; Wallen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612438947">Merry &amp; Andrews, 1994</xref>), participants with a history of abuse or neglect as defined by the New York State Family Court Act, Article 10, Section 1012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534765612438947">1970</xref>) were excluded from the study. On the other hand, youth who had been sexually or physically assaulted by someone other than a parent or guardian were included. Participants with WISC-III Full Scale IQs in the deficient range (69 or less) were excluded as earlier research with the <italic>Children’s PTSD Inventory</italic> determined that cases within this IQ range experienced difficulty in understanding test questions and verbalized inconsistent responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765612438947">Saigh, 2003</xref>). In addition, youth who were not able to speak or understand English were excluded from the study. Youth with MDD, ADHD, CD, substance dependence, or psychotic disorders as determined by <italic>Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents–Revised</italic> (DICA-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534765612438947">Reich, Leacock, &amp; Shanfeld, 1995</xref>) administrations were also excluded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1534765612438947">
<title>Participant sample</title>
<p>With respect to the traumatized cases, 228 youth were referred to the investigators. Parental or guardian consent to participate and child assent was obtained for 157 (69%) of these cases. Of this number, 50 (32%) were excluded for the following reasons: head injury (<italic>n</italic> = 24), limited English proficiency (<italic>n</italic> = 8), positive history of child abuse or neglect (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and WISC-III Full Scale IQs in the deficient range (<italic>n</italic> = 16). One youth did not complete the entire research protocol and did not complete the RCMAS. Of the remaining 106 cases, 37 (35%) met criteria for PTSD and 69 (65%) did not. Eight children who were diagnosed with PTSD also met DICA-R criteria for MDD and one met criteria for substance dependence. These cases were excluded. Among the traumatized PTSD negative group, two met criteria for MDD, two had CD, and one had ADHD. These cases were also excluded.</p>
<p>With reference to the control group, the parents or guardians of 280 potentially nontraumatized youth were invited to enroll their children in the study. Parent or guardian consent to participate and child assent was provided by 78 (28%) of the cases. Five cases reported that they experienced traumatic incidents indicative of the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> PTSD Criterion A1 and were assigned to the traumatized participant pool. Thirty-two (41%) were excluded for the following reasons: head injury (<italic>n</italic> = 2), limited English proficiency (<italic>n</italic> = 15), current psychopharmacological treatment (<italic>n</italic> = 8), and WISC-III Full Scale IQs in the deficient range (<italic>n</italic> = 7). None of the nontraumatized youth received a DICA-R diagnosis of MDD, CD, ADHD, substance dependence, or psychotic symptoms. None of these cases had a life-threatening illness.</p>
<p>The process led to the identification of 29 PTSD positives, 64 traumatized PTSD negatives, and 41 nontraumatized controls. All of the participants completed the RCMAS. An exploratory analysis of the test scores identified two outliers (1 traumatized PTSD negative and 1 PTSD positive) who had extreme scores on two or more of the RCMAS scales and these cases were excluded from the data analysis. Accordingly, the final sample consisted of 28 PTSD positives, 63 traumatized PTSD negatives, and 41 controls. The age range for participants was 7.08 to 18.42 years (<italic>M</italic> = 13.19, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.82). Overall, 74 males and 58 females participated.

<p>The Children’s PTSD Inventory is a child–adolescent structured clinical interview that reflects the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria for PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765612438947">Saigh, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765612438947">Saigh (2003)</xref> reported an internal consistency alpha of .95 at the diagnostic level. With reference to interrater reliability, 98.0% agreement was evident at the diagnostic level. An interrater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of .98 and an interrater reliability kappa of .96 were observed at the diagnostic level. In terms of test-retest reliability, 97.6% agreement was evident at the diagnostic level. A test-retest kappa of .91 and an ICC of .90 were evident at the diagnostic level. In terms of validity, the Children’s PTSD Inventory diagnoses were compared to clinician-derived diagnoses and diagnoses obtained through administrations of the <italic>Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV</italic> (SCID; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765612438947">First, Gibbon, Williams, &amp; Spitzer, 1996</xref>) and the <italic>Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents–Revised</italic> (DICA-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534765612438947">Reich et al., 1995</xref>) PTSD modules.

<p>The DICA-R is a semistructured interview that reflects the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria for a variety of disorders. All participants received administrations of the MDD, ADHD, conduct disorder, substance dependence (i.e., alcohol, tobacco, glue sniffing, marijuana, and street drugs), and psychotic symptoms modules by a trained examiner.

<title>Clinical interviews</title>
<p>Participants received two independent clinical interviews by one of two board-certified child psychiatrists and/or a licensed psychologist. The psychiatrists had 21 and 9 years of postresidency experience and the psychologist had 23 years of postdoctoral experience. The examiners interviewed the participants and independently decided if they had been exposed to traumatic incidents that were commensurate with the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> PTSD Criterion A1 definition and if their reported symptoms met criteria for PTSD. The examiners used the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> PTSD criteria to guide their decision process.</p>

<p>This 6-point Likert-type index is intended to be employed in the formulation of stressor severity ratings. The scale provides specific examples to facilitate the rating process. Taken in this context, the “death of both parents” is described as a catastrophic stressor and accorded a rating of 6 and “breaking up with a boyfriend or girlfriend” is described as a mild stressor and accorded a rating of 2. The absence of a significant stressor is rated as 1 for “None.” A board-certified child psychiatrist with 21 years of postresidency experience and a psychologist with 23 years of postdoctoral experience independently read all of the recorded responses to the <italic>Children’s PTSD Inventory</italic> stress exposure items and rated the statements according to the SPSS-CA criteria. A Pearson product moment correlation of .98 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) was observed between the independently derived stressor severity ratings.

<title>Multivariate and Univariate Analyses</title>
<p>To test for group differences with regard to the standardized RCMAS Total scores, a separate ANCOVA procedure was conducted controlling for group differences related to SES. As the RCMAS standard scores utilize in the analysis are standardized based on age and gender, these variables were not included as covariates. Bonferonni post hoc comparisons were conducted to identify significant group comparisons. Analogously, a separate MANCOVA controlling for SES was conducted to examine for group differences across the five RCMAS subscale scores. Given a significant MANCOVA, univariate <italic>F</italic> tests and Bonferroni post hoc comparisons were conducted to identify significant group differences.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In a significant departure from previous studies that explored the relation between PTSD and the RCMAS performance scores of youth, this investigation systematically controlled for the potentially confounding effects of major comorbid disorders. Also in contrast to earlier studies, this investigation controlled for SES and used a three-group case-control design wherein the multidimensional anxiety estimates of traumatized youth with or without PTSD were compared to the anxiety scores of nontraumatized controls. As hypothesized, the RCMAS scores of children and adolescents with PTSD significantly exceeded the RCMAS scores of traumatized PTSD negatives and nontraumatized controls. Also as hypothesized, the RCMAS scores of the traumatized PTSD negatives and controls were not significantly different. In effect, PTSD was consistently associated with increased anxiety across the scales of the RCMAS and trauma exposure without PTSD was not.</p>
<p>These outcomes indicate that the RCMAS was sensitive to the expression of PTSD in children and adolescents. Theoretically, these findings are consistent with the placement of PTSD within the context of anxiety disorders in the <italic>DSM IV</italic> as youth with PTSD evidenced elevated scores on all of the RCMAS relative to traumatized PTSD negatives and controls. It is of interest to observe that although most of the RCMAS items measures dimensions of anxiety that do not directly reflect the diagnostic symptoms of PTSD, children with PTSD evidenced significantly higher scores on measures of general anxiety, somatic complaints, and social anxiety. These findings are consistent with earlier reports indicating that individuals with PTSD evidenced increased trait anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765612438947">Hensley &amp; Verela, 2008</xref>), somatic problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534765612438947">Solomon &amp; Mikulincer, 1987</xref>), and social anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612438947">Hoffman, Litz, &amp; Weathers, 2002</xref>). Taken collectively, these findings imply that clinicians need to carefully assess anxiety-related thoughts and somatic problems among children with PTSD by going beyond the standard trauma specific diagnostic symptom clusters. Child PTSD investigators should also note that these findings provide a scientific basis to support the use of the RCMAS total and subscale indices as treatment outcome measures.</p>
<p>The results involving the traumatized PTSD negatives speak well for the resilience of children and adolescents to cope with adversity as 71.1% of the traumatized sample did not have PTSD and as their scores on all of the RCMAS parameters did not significantly differ from the scores of the controls. These findings are consistent with studies indicating that the majority of traumatized youth do not meet criteria for PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765612438947">Giaconia et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765612438947">Kilpatrick et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534765612438947">Saigh et al., 1999</xref>). The outcomes are also concordant with research indicating that traumatized youth without PTSD and nontraumatized controls did not differ on standardized measures of anxiety and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534765612438947">Saigh et al., 2002</xref>), anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534765612438947">Saigh, Yasik, Oberfield, &amp; Halamandaris, 2007</xref>), academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534765612438947">Saigh, Mroueh, &amp; Bremner, 1997</xref>), self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534765612438947">Saigh, Yasik, Oberfield, &amp; Halamandaris, 2008</xref>) and cognitive ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534765612438947">Saigh, Yasik, Oberfield, Halamandaris, &amp; Bremner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534765612438947">Yasik, Saigh, Oberfield, &amp; Halamandaris, 2007</xref>). Indeed, the cumulative evidence suggests that trauma exposure in the absence of PTSD may not constitute a risk factor for childhood psychopathology.</p>
<p>These observations should be tempered with the understanding that additional comorbid disorders were not excluded and the external validity of the study should be viewed accordingly. As a cross-sectional design was employed, it is not clear if PTSD induced higher levels of anxiety or if the observed anxiety existed before trauma exposure. It should also be noted that the RCMAS was recently revised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534765612438947">Reynolds &amp; Richmond, 2008</xref>) and these outcomes may not apply to the revised index. Moreover, the current sample was too small to permit comparison by different developmental levels and future research should strive to identify larger samples with sufficient power to identify potentially significant RCMAS variations by developmental levels. It should also be realized that anxiety has been described as having three separate response systems (i.e., subjective reports of apprehension, psychophysiological arousal, and behavioral avoidance; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765612438947">Rachman, 1990</xref>). Accordingly, future investigations may wish to examine the psychophysiological and behavioral expression of anxiety among traumatized children with or without PTSD and nontraumatized controls.</p>
