<p>This book contains more than a cursory look at performative autoethnography. It is a critical performance of the author's own history and work, but simultaneously engages the reader in a multi-voiced text wherein one learns about personal stories, the broader context in which they are experienced and then retold, and specifics about the method of autoethnography. I came to know Tami Spry for the first time when I attended a presentation at the Seventh International Congress of Qualitative Inquiry in 2011. The following year, at the Eighth International Congress, once again I attended one of her sessions/performances in a Plenary on ‘Cowboys and Indians,’ and another session where five presenters honored, extended and embodied her work. Even though I was spellbound by the presentations, somehow I still continued to feel personally troubled in the context of some autoethnography sessions in conferences that did not navigate as well the dividing line between the rigors of research and a generation sometimes finding yet another method or technique to be transfixed on its own personal/emotional self. Yet, wanting to learn more, I came upon this recent publication by Left Coast Press. I set out reading it to discover if it was a good place to begin, whether it would describe the elements of autoethnography from multiple standpoints but in a scholarly and critical way, and whether social work professors, researchers and practitioners who do a lot of work around narratives would be able to relate to autoethnography as expounded in this book and thus benefit from this method.</p>
<p>Recently there has been a great interest and extensive use of autoethnography in the fields of humanities and sciences in varied disciplines such as education, medicine, performance studies, social work, sociology, and communication. However, the conceptualization of autoethnography in this book is grounded firmly in the disciplinary convergence of performative studies and ethnography. Hence in this book the <italic>performative-I</italic> becomes the focus that guides the thinking and doing of autoethnography.</p>
<p>The purpose of the book is to present a method of how to learn from and in performative autoethnography. The title, ‘Body, Paper, Stage’ captures the most important elements: Body refers to the material and corporeal; Paper refers to the writing as in composition; and Stage refers to the aesthetic, creative performance. As the author says, this book is about ‘putting the body on the page, lifting it on to the stage, and then understanding that body, paper and stage <italic>are</italic> one another, that there is no purity of text or hierarchy of embodiment’ (p. 26). The title is not just a summary but, Body, Paper and Stage organize the book. They constantly regenerate one another in a Deleuzian cycle of becoming, none existing as fixed or static, and none positioned as authority. Chapter one focuses on the Body, the next two on Paper, and chapters four and five are about Stage. The sixth and final chapter ties them all together.</p>
<p>In the first chapter, the body is used to conceptualize performative autoethnography. In the process of performing autobiography, the performer concentrates on the body as the site from which the story is generated. This location is a space of intense personal and cultural risk, but is also, simultaneously, a space of profound comfort. In response to the question ‘Why do performative autoethnography?’ the chapter begins with an example, ‘Skins: A Daughter's (Re)construction of Cancer,’ a performance given by the author in 1994 at a Convention in New Orleans, seven years after her mother died of ovarian cancer. The author states that this was the first time she was able to offer herself and others some clarity and insight into these interwoven complex experiences of cancer, a daughter's identity and the death of a mother. The performing body is a sort of ancient scroll upon which are written the stories of one's movement through the world. With regard to this performance, which came to be a number of years after her mother's death, and furthermore after decades of Tami being brought up to read her body according to her mother's authorship, the performing of this autoethnography (then called autobiography), became the central tool in a reconstitution of her own identity. But the author does not focus only on her own experiences and performances in the book. In this chapter itself there is a second story of a student in one of her classes developing a piece on sexual assault, narrating it to her peers, and even a description of the processing that took place in the silence of that powerful rendition is included. These two examples along with others are further developed and unpacked in successive chapters giving social work professionals many connections from the way these examples are set out and analyzed to teaching, research and practice using autoethnography.</p>
<p>The first chapter also talks of some of the important elements of conceptualizing performative autoethnography, for example, connection. Connection exists between selves, others, sociocultural contexts, and the very language employed to represent those connections; connections also exist between personal experiences and larger social issues. Another element is agency. We ourselves get to construct our narrative (not media, social worker, friend, boyfriend, parent); but the agent is also accountable for how self, others and culture are represented. Along with these, some other elements are analyzed in this section from the perspective of the story of the student's performance on sexual assault mentioned earlier, but also building on the work of writers such as Della Pollock, Soyini Madison, Dwight Conquergood, Ronald Pelias, Craig Gingrich-Philbrook and others who are included in this chapter and throughout the book.</p>
<p>It is the telling body through which performative autoethnography is constructed. The body is the site, the toolbox, the breath of the performative autoethnographer. While performance unleashes creativity, it also calls forth critical thinking. While autoethnography is performative/pedagogical/embodied/accountable, it is also continually deconstructing what it is putting together. The author analyzes this from multiple standpoints. While one of these is the personal backdrop, there are also references to grief, death, 9/11, Katrina, war, and the financial collapse of this decade. Each one of these events can form the backdrop to elicit (recall, reflect, write and perform) stories that call for transformation. Yet another bit that makes this book a multivoiced text is the author's inclusion of additional writing exercises inviting the reader to reflect and integrate their own voice to some of these concepts in ways that may have played out in their own or their family's experience. There are also questions for further consideration included at the end of each chapter, a useful tool for educators.</p>
<p>The second chapter ‘Paper: Writing the Body’ begins with a piece from the author's work that is a postscript that emerged two years after repeated performances of ‘Skins’ that began the previous chapter and was highlighted in this review. It is an example of the process and product of connections, an important element of performative autoethnography, as these connections occur through critical self-reflection and emerge as a product of successive writing/performing drafts. This chapter is about putting the body on paper, about what to consider in writing the textualizing body. Specifically, this chapter discusses writing the performative body as embodied, co-performed, evocative, and consequential; offers an ethic of aesthetics to guide autoethnographic writing; and, furthers the development of the textualizing body. In a good example of autoethnographic writing, we should <italic>feel</italic> the body of the author on paper (something clearly evident in the opening example). Through writing we critically reflect on our relationship with words and then try and tell a different story than the taken-for-granted social assumptions.</p>
<p>There is an ethics of aesthetics in that performative writing is not just technique, but it is accountable to how it represents the complex negotiations of meaning between selves and others in power laden social structures. While there is no linear path, experience and text affect and are affected by one another in a textualizing body. The book describes the dialogical links between body and paper well when it says, ‘the material body cannot be erased in composing autoethnography, rather the corporeal body is made fully present in performance and represented through language that critically reflects upon the body's social constructions’ (p. 110). Writing is critical to setting the stage prior to performing: ‘Performative autoethnographic writing is about the continual questioning, the naming and renaming and unnaming of experience through craft, through heart, through the textualizing body’ (p. 113).</p>
<p>The third chapter brings forth five elements that address the composing of performative writing. These are: i) sociocultural context; ii) critical self-reflection; iii) self-other interaction; iv) the body; and, v) ethics. These elements are not discrete but interdependent, not linear, but rather circular, back-and-forth, fragmented. For each of these elements, questions that serve as prompts for critical reflection are also included. In addition, mention is made of form, how the text should appear on the page. Here the author stresses the need for thick description, selection of a suitable metaphor, sequencing of scenes, the use of persona, attention to space and time, and the need to research the larger sociocultural issues and structures at play in the experience.</p>
<p>In highlighting the elements for composing performative autoethnography in chapter three, the text gets deeper into the self without forgetting that the self will need to appear in front of an audience. Autoethnographers begin with a focus on experience. Only they can decide which experiences are ready to be engaged through this method. While there is vulnerability in self-disclosing, ‘self-disclosure is not, in itself, scholarship’ (p. 124). Autoethnographic scholarship is an opening into the complex negotiations of meaning-making with self and others for the purpose of adding alternatives to the single story. The audience is also an element to be borne in mind. While we generate meaning personally and politically, the performative autoethnography is also a catalyst for the audience to reflect on its own life, others, contexts and meanings. This chapter concludes with warm-ups for writing performative autoethnography.</p>
<p>Chapters four and five focus on the stage. The author constantly emphasizes that performance does not operate as an interesting feature or entertaining option that one might choose after ‘finishing’ the autoethnography. ‘Like composing performative autoethnography, <italic>performing</italic> performative autoethnography is a method of inquiry and analysis that engages the body as the methodological nexus upon which the text turns, moves, lives’ (p. 159). In chapter four we are provided with the necessary theoretical groundwork for performing autoethnography and in chapter five the elements of an embodied performance are engaged.</p>
<p>There are two complex constructions of self occurring in performing performative autoethnography. There is the performer, the you, the self. Then there is the performative-I persona which is the person, the subject, the ‘you,’ created in the autoethnographic text. It is not to be taken lightly. It weighs substantially when it represents, for example, racial violence or abortion. Because it is vulnerable on many fronts, students and novice researchers/teachers must be made aware of the risk involved and vulnerability required to compose and to perform critical autoethnography. The performative-I persona is twice removed – once through writing and again through performance. The performer does not leave herself behind in order to embody the persona; rather the performer is in a constant process of interpreting the text in her effort to embody the persona. The performer in interpreting the persona will continue to work through it in ways available only through writing and performance. The text also emphasizes that one must not make the mistake of thinking that because this is one's story, it does not need intense rehearsal for the stage. Ultimately the audience should see the persona that exists in the autoethnography, rather than the person who they might know who exists in daily life.</p>
<p>Underscoring the intense labor that goes into analysis and rehearsal, in chapter five, the author focuses on the elements of embodied performance: dialogical performance, internal/external dichotomy, and performance choices. Dialogical performance is the interpretation of the complex interaction between performer, text and sociocultural context; it is that which engages the audience in the performance. The internal elements (thoughts, feelings, attitudes, emotions) and external elements (voice, body, and space) come together interactively to illustrate or extend the meaning of the text. It is in the coming together of the internal and external elements that performance choices are made. Here the text is yet again at its best as it lays out considerations on how to use voice, body, audience, space, props, costume, time and other salient elements that embody performative autoethnography.</p>
<p>The sixth and final chapter, ‘Body, Paper, Stage, and Back Again’ is short, but not a summary. It invites us to begin the journey in our personal and professional lives, especially with our scholarship. This is where links to the focus on narratives in social work are even more explicit. There are many stories housed in those with whom we relate. While we may not connect with all of them, we learn not to be uncomfortable with the inchoate. Using performative autoethnography we can further understand how culture is (re)written on ourselves and others. We can see the boundaries between cultural differences that are constructed by larger systems of power that divide and conquer people, and quell the energizing curiosity of difference with numbing fear and ignorance. That we can raise ourselves, our clients and research participants from their experiences through body, paper and stage is made clear through what the book accomplishes by highlighting performative autoethnography through the experiences of the author, her students and the work of other scholars.</p>
<p>This book is useful to both the novice and scholar of autoethnography. The very sequence of body, paper and stage summarizes well the framework of performative autoethnography even though the text constantly reminds us these are not linear. One will find multiple standpoints used to inform the reader in the text through description of the elements of this method, but also through examples from the author and her students, and then the work of other academics that the author includes and builds on, useful, no matter whatever stage one is at. Whether a novice or seasoned professional, one will be able to find something to relate to in this book. The emphasis on critical reflection and hard work that go into autoethnography leave no doubt that this method is scholarly, generates knowledge, and is not casual self-disclosure. Although there are exercises and questions, and in general the body, paper, stage framework to guide the reader, one will not find this book to be a step-by-step guide to doing or teaching performative autoethnography. What I found absent is a consideration of what happens if clients, students or research participants may not be ready for one of these elements, as for example, to write or perform. How then does one lead them on? It might also have been advantageous to include some discussion on whether someone's autoethnography once composed can ever be performed by someone else, something critical to consider given social work professionals are often called not just to help others elicit their personal narratives, but to give voice to the experiences of vulnerable and oppressed persons and advocate for them, or to use their narratives to suggest policy changes. But if social work professionals are looking for ways to transform client/self-narratives into autoethnographies, then this book will help them understand how the process can be structured using performative autoethnography. It is to this extent that for me the book acknowledged what it set out to do and fulfilled its purpose.</p>
<p>Spry's perspectives on performative autoethnography have significantly impacted my research and teaching in various ways. For example, when developing an article highlighting the methods used to gather narratives of homeless youth in special education, I was able to critically evaluate how the methods used in my research gave/took away power and ownership of narratives. The book also helped me pedagogically as I used sections of it directly in my classes to help students understand and frame their own experiences related to race, class, gender and sexual orientation. Not only were students mesmerized by the examples from the book but they were also able to analyze their own experiences using the ‘body, paper and stage’ framework. Further, I created a performative autoethnographic piece that I now share with students early in the semester. This presentation highlights issues of diversity from a personal and broader societal standpoint. It underscores the fact that students need to give themselves permission and not shy away from critically reflecting on these issues in their own lives and in society, and be open to alternative viewpoints from others. While all these occasions serve as catalysts to encourage exploration of the personal impact of race, class, gender and sexual orientation for themselves and others, I emphasize, ‘self-disclosure is not, in itself, scholarship’ (Spry, 2011, p. 124). Thus this book provided me with more than a cursory understanding of performative autoethnography and I recommend it as a useful methodological resource to social work professionals.</p>
