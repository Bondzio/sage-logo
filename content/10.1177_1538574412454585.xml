<p>Cerebral vasospasm (CV) accounts significant morbimortality after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical outcome of patients with CV treated by 2 endovascular procedures: intra-arterial nimodipine angioplasty (IANA) and balloon angioplasty (BA). Between 2008 and June 2011, we performed 22 IANA and 8 BA in 30 patients. The mean age was 44 years and 60% was female. In 17 patients, the treatment was clipping, whereas 13 underwent coil treatment. The CV was severe in 63%, moderate in 30%, and mild in 7%. Good outcome between 2 groups was similar (<italic>P</italic> = .36). The clinical outcome according to the subgroups of CV severity and modality treatment was equivalent (<italic>P</italic> = .22). Mortality at 3 months was 16% and 20% at 1 year. We did not find differences in the clinical outcome despite the fact that both techniques produce adequate angiographic resolution of CV.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The rupture of an intracranial aneurysm is a neurological emergency due to acute physiological abnormalities can be devastating. After the aneurysms are secured, the patient enters a new phase punctuated by cerebral vasospasm (CV) and decreased cerebral perfusion. Cerebral vasospasm is the most common cause of acute cerebral ischemia after an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Vasospasm is defined as the delayed, reversible narrowing of the cerebral vessels. This condition most commonly involves the proximal arteries that make up the circle of Willis, and it typically occurs 4 to 14 days after aSAH, although earlier vasospasm can occur and might be associated with poor outcome.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412454585">1</xref>
</sup> More than 60% of patients with aSAH develop CV during the hospital course, but only about 30% will become symptomatic. Cerebral vasospasm tends to be more severe in younger patients with poor neurological grade, thick subarachnoid clot, intraventricular hemorrhage, and history of smoking.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412454585">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412454585">3</xref>
</sup> Approximately, one-third of these patients with aSAH die from the vasospasm, and another one-third are left disabled, and so vasospasm is a dreaded complication following aSAH.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412454585">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Intravenous or oral application of nimodipine is currently recommended as the first-line medication to prevent vasospasm. For symptomatic vasospasm that is refractory to triple-H therapy, endovascular therapies such as transluminal balloon angioplasty (BA) and super-selective intra-arterial infusion of vasodilators are recommended.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412454585">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412454585">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Balloon angioplasty is highly effective in relieving focal vasospasm that involves the proximal segments of the major intracranial vessels at the level of the circle of Willis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412454585">6</xref>
</sup> The effects of angioplasty are durable and the procedure is relatively safe when done by experienced neurointerventionalist, although arterial wall rupture, dissection, local thrombosis, and reperfusion injury are possible.</p>
<p>Intra-arterial vasodilators can ameliorate distal and diffuse vasospasm but their effects are transient. Papaverine was the first drug used for this indication, the half-life is approximately 2 hours. However, Hoh and Ogilvy reported that although papaverine produced clinical improvement in 43% of treated patients, this was a transient effect and thus required multiple treatments that lead to a variable but increased the complication profile.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574412454585">7</xref>
</sup> This drug is neurotoxic and can increase intracranial pressure and also provoke seizures, transient cortical blindness, and irreversible brain injury.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574412454585">8</xref>
</sup> Other intra-arterial calcium antagonists have been used in the treatment of CV in an off-label use, because the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the use of these agents: nimodipine, nicardipine, and verapamil have since emerged as safer alternatives.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574412454585">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574412454585">10</xref>
</sup> Nimodipine is a dihydropyridine agent that inhibits voltage-gated calcium channels in the arterial wall smooth muscle cells and results in vasodilation with a slightly longer half-life of 9 hours. Other noncalcium channel antagonists such as magnesium sulfate, 3-hydroxy-3-methilglutarl-CoA reductase inhibitors, nitric oxide donors, and endothelin-1 antagonists have been used, but their application has not been widespread.</p>
<p>Despite the potential benefit from endovascular therapy, clear guidelines directing the use of these treatments for vasospasm after SAH are not available. The decision of when to intervene endovascularly is not clear and certain across all patients. Eskridge et al have suggested the following criteria to determine the need for endovascular therapy for CV: (1) new neurological deficit not explained by other causes; (2) no computerized tomography (CT) evidence of cerebral infarction; (3) failure of maximal medical therapy (triple-H therapy); and (4) angiographic evidence of vasospasm in the same distribution as the neurological deficit.<sup>

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1538574412454585">
<title>Patient Population</title>
<p>Between 2008 and June 2011, 8 patients who underwent BA treatment for vasospasm secondary to aSAH were identified. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical charts and the procedural reports of these patients, and according to their demographic and clinical characteristics, we identified 22 patients who underwent intra-arterial nimodipine angioplasty (IANA) in order to compare both modalities of endovascular treatment for AV secondary to aSAH.</p>
<p>All patients had undergone surgery or coiling for sufficient obliteration of the aneurysm that was causing the SAH. Of all, 17 patients was underwent a neurosurgical procedure and 13 patients underwent an endovascular procedure.</p>
<p>Subarachnoid hemorrhage was confirmed by CT at admission; the Hunt-Hess (HH) and Fisher Scale were registered. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) was done before and after the procedure. Angiographic vasospasm was classified as none/mild (0%-33% decrease in arterial diameter), moderate (35%-66%), or severe (<underline>&gt;</underline>67%).</p>
<p>In the neurosurgical intensive care unit, standard medical management included preventive, well-monitored hypertensive, hypervolemic, and hemodilution (triple-H) therapy maximized to the point of elevating systolic arterial pressure to 150 to 170 mm Hg. Triple-H therapy was implemented just after surgical or endovascular treatment of the aneurysm. All patients received oral nimodipine (Nimotop, Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany) with a dose of 240 mg of nimodipine per day beginning when the diagnosis of aneurysmal SAH was established. This treatment was continued until the 21st day.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of intra-arterial nimodipine and transluminal BA on clinical improvement of patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1538574412454585">
<title>Criteria for Intervention</title>
<p>Despite the lack of selection criteria for endovascular treatment of vasospasm, we chose the Eskridge criteria and the TCD velocity criteria were not included.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1538574412454585">
<title>Endovascular Treatment</title>
<p>An initial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed to confirm the presence of angiographic CV and determine its distribution. The supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA), M1 middle cerebral artery (MCA), A1 anterior cerebral artery (ACA), intracranial vertebral artery, basilar artery, and P1 posterior cerebral artery were considered the proximal vessels. Those beyond the above classification were considered distal vessels in the sense that catheterization of these smaller vessels would have a higher than acceptable risk of vessel rupture, given their small size at baseline. All patients had angiographic vasospasm associated with neurological worsening.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1538574412454585">
<title>Intra-arterial Nimodipine Group</title>
<p>Positioning the diagnostic catheter 5F, in the proximal cervical ICA or the cervical vertebral artery, performed intra-arterial nimodipine infusion. Nimodipine was diluted in normal saline to a final concentration of 0.200 mg, rate each 10 minutes until 1200 mg. Angiographic vasospasm before endovascular treatment and immediate vessel caliber modifications were assessed with repeat DSA every 10 minutes for 1 hour.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1538574412454585">
<title>Balloon Angioplasty Group</title>
<p>Balloon angioplasty was performed as described previously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574412454585">12</xref>
</sup> Patients undergoing BA were systemically undergoing general anesthesia by an experienced neurointerventionist through the transfemoral approach. A guiding catheter was placed in either the cervical ICA or cervical vertebral artery. Then, the balloon was navigated over a microwire to the most distal of the vessel segment to be treated; the balloon was carefully inflated until the narrowed vessel segment almost reached its normal diameter on the initial angiogram obtained after aSAH. The inflation–deflation was done on cycle for less than 30 seconds and less than 5 times. The balloon was immediately deflated as soon as the target diameter was reached. Repeat DSA was performed to assess treatment response and complications in all patients immediately following BA. The patients were not routinely anticoagulated during and following the procedure.</p>
<p>In all patients, one of the 4 × 15 or 4 × 20 mm-sized compliant balloon (HyperGlide, MicroTherapeutics, Irvine, California/Copernic, Balt, California) or 4 × 7 mm-sized super-compliant balloon (HyperForm, MicroTherapeutics/Copernic) for intracranial arteries was placed in the narrowed vessel segment. The balloon was tested and prepared with a 50% diluted contrast solution prior to placement to ensure rapid balloon deflation was achieved. Balloon angioplasty was attempted in all stenotic vessel segments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1538574412454585">
<title>Neurological Assessment and Clinical Follow-Up</title>
<p>Patient outcome was measured using the modified Rankin scale (mRs) every 3 months up to 1 year by a stroke neurologist using in an outpatient setting. Infarctions were categorized as secondary to CV, other, or unknown causes. Outcome was considered good when the patient could perform the activities of daily living independently; mRs was ≤2, while outcome was considered poor when the patient required assistance (mRs, 3-5).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1538574412454585">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis was performed with the statistical package SPSS 17. Data are reported in frequency tables. The effect of treatment modality on clinical outcome was assessed using the χ<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412454585">2</xref>
</sup> test (for comparison of proportions), Student <italic>t</italic> test (continuous variables), and Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test (ordinal variables). <italic>P</italic> ≤ .05 was considered statistically significant.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section10-1538574412454585">
<title>Results</title>
<p>We performed 22 intra-arterial nimodipine and 8 BA in 30 patients. The mean age was 44 ± 16 years; 60% (18) was female. At admission, the neurologic condition was assessed using the HH Score, I: 20%, II: 20%, III: 47%, and IV: 13%. Computerized tomography scans were evaluated according to the Fisher classification; Fisher III: 33% and Fisher IV: 67%. In 17 (57%) patients, the treatment was surgical clipping, whereas 13 patients (43%) underwent coil endovascular treatment. Mean flow velocities in the middle cerebral arteries preprocedure (210 cm/s) and postprocedure (95 cm/s; intra-arterial nimodipine treatment and BA) were measured by TCD, the mean pressure in the MCA postprocedure diminished at least 45% from the basal values. The ventriculostomy procedure was done almost in the half of the patients. The degree of vasospasm was severe in 19 patients (63%), moderate in 9 (30%), and mild in 2 (7%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538574412454585">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We compare the clinical effects of intra-arterial nimodipine treatment in patients with symptomatic vasospasm after aSAH and BA treatment. The main aim of both techniques is to improve cerebral blood flow by reversing angiographically visible vessel vasospasm. Intra-arterial injection of nimodipine has been the elective endovascular treatment performed in our department in cases of CV refractory to medical treatment. Balloon angioplasty is more rarely performed and was less used in this series of 30 consecutive patients. Angioplasty is widely considered to be the most effective endovascular procedure because of the excellent and permanent, angiographically confirmed reversal of vasospasm, which is often followed by high rates of clinical improvement.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574412454585">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Although the safety of the procedure has greatly increased in the greater experience and better technical devices, a potential for severe complications still exists.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574412454585">13</xref>
</sup> These include vessel rupture, branch occlusion, displacement of surgical clips, and rebleeding of unclipped aneurysms, none of these were presented in our series in the BA group. Moreover, angioplasty is applicable to only proximal, segmental vasospasm in the ICA, the M1 segment of the MCA, and the A1 segment of the ACA. In addition, because angioplasty is technically demanding, it should be performed only in center with experience in endovascular procedures.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574412454585">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Review of the 530 patients undergoing balloon angioplasty for subarachnoid hemorrhage and vasospasm, 62% improved clinically, with a range of 11% to 93%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574412454585">15</xref>
</sup> The largest series is by Eskridge and colleagues,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574412454585">16</xref>
</sup> reported on retrospective series of 50 consecutive cases that 61% of patients showed sustained early neurological improvement within 72 hours, while 6% deteriorated and 4% died immediately from vessel rupture. We had percentages within the range previously cited, in our balloon angioplasty series showed that 25% of patients had good clinical outcome defined by Rankin scale was ≤2 (no symptoms, no significant disability despite symptoms, and slight disability) and 37.5% (3 patients) had moderately severe disability (Rankin 3). None died due to the procedure. In comparison to the previous series, they noted to clinical improvement but they did not specified on outcome scale like us.</p>
<p>Other larger series have shown from 60% to 70% of neurological improvement<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574412454585">17</xref>
</sup> against others have reported lower rates of clinical improvement, but some of these are confounded by the combined use of papaverine and balloon angioplasty.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574412454585">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Evidence from a rat model indicated that reperfusion of parenchyma injured by an ischemic insult may lead to further injury,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538574412454585">19</xref>
</sup> this phenomenon could be one of the reasons why the uses of endovascular therapies are associated with unsatisfactory clinical results despite substantial vessel dilatation in some instances. However, BA is considered the only method of endovascular treatment that has been shown by numerous subsequent retrospective case series to produce durable clinical improvement, although this is confined to the proximal segments the circle of Willis and with the advantage of one procedure.</p>
<p>Other category of vasospasm treatment is by chemical relaxation of the contracted vessel wall by intra-arterial administration of drugs, such as nimodipine. The procedure is performed in conjunction with diagnostic angiography, which confirms the clinical suspicion of vasospasm. Pharmacologic dilation by means of intra-arterial nimodipine has the advantage of also acting on smaller distal branches and diffuses vasospasm. However, its beneficial effects are transient, and repeat treatment sessions are often necessary.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412454585">6</xref>
</sup> This was demonstrated in the intra-arterial nimodipine group in which until 7 procedures was required to reverse vasospasm in comparison to 1 session in the BA group. A retrospective series of 25 patients showed that intra-arterial nimodipine is effective and safe for the treatment of symptomatic vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage with 72% favorable outcome measured by Rankin scale score of 0-2.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574412454585">9</xref>
</sup> However, our series showed 45% favorable outcome measured by the same scale and score. This could be explained by the most of the patients in our intra-arterial nimodipine series were on Fisher IV (64%) and the rest on Fisher III and HH Scale III (54%). The Fisher and HH Scale had been reported as prognostic factor for the development of vasospasm secondary to aSHA,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538574412454585">20</xref>
</sup> thick clot, which fills any fissure, is the best predictor of vasospasm. This is further corroborated by another findings that HH ≥3 and Fisher grade ≥2 and admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) &lt;9 were significantly associated with the occurrence of delay cerebral ischemia (DCI) due to vasospasm.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538574412454585">21</xref>
</sup> Similarly in a study of 580 participants with spontaneous aSAH, HH score (≥3) has been reported as a risk factor for DCI,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1538574412454585">22</xref>
</sup> so we consider that these 2 scales may have affected the clinical outcome in our series as reported previously.</p>
<p>Regarding a possible rebound effect after intra-arterial nimodipine,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574412454585">9</xref>
</sup> we observed angiographic regression to the basal level due to persistent vasospasm. Improvement after some of intra-arterial nimodipine procedures was observed; the median of procedures was 3.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the only study that compares BA versus intra-arterial nimodipine and we did not find difference on clinical outcome between the 2 procedures despite the behavior on flow velocities in the MCA. Previously, one study reported no differences in clinical outcome between BA and intra-arterial verapamil treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1538574412454585">23</xref>
</sup> Neither of the 2 treatment forms showed an effect of therapy timing on neurological outcome.</p>
<p>Our study was limited to some extent (1) data collection was retrospective and (2) the number of patients was relatively small in both groups. However, this study has strength as it compares 2 treatment modalities. The authors pointed out that a long time would be required to gather enough patients at a single institution or a small group of institutions to achieve adequate statistical power.</p>
<p>Another possible problem in our study is that we assessed only the immediate and long-term clinical efficacy of the treatment. Immediate clinical results suggest that intra-arterial nimodipine and BA are effective in the treatment of these patients. Long-term clinical efficacy may be influenced by many factors, so the positive trend toward symptom reversal and good outcome is not sufficient to claim the efficacy of treatment.</p>
<p>Ideally, cerebral blood flow should be continuously monitored, before and after treatment, in patient recovering from aSAH to optimize the timing and indication of the endovascular procedure and to assess the real efficacy of the treatment in preventing cerebral ischemia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1538574412454585">24</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>However, the patients in the present study were monitored with the standard tools currently used at our institution; these tools do not include the routine assessment of cerebral perfusion.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although our data have some limits, results of this retrospective analysis suggest that BA and intra-arterial nimodipine are effective and safe in select cases of vasospasm following aSAH. Prospective, randomized studies evaluating cerebral blood flow are needed to confirm these results and to determine whether this therapy is truly cost-effective and superior to intensive medical care.</p>
