<p>Many business school graduates are treading into a challenging reality on exiting their academic programs. Not only are they graduating into one of the toughest economies for jobs in current history, they are also finding themselves deficient in one key area for professional success—communication. Effective “soft skills” such as oral and written communication are cited more and more frequently in industry literature as one of employers’ top wish list items when it comes to business graduates entering the workplace.</p>
<p>Increasingly, employers are selectively seeking job candidates who possess both the technical and specialized knowledge required by their profession as well as the ability to communicate clearly, correctly, and convincingly. For any student, developing and enhancing these soft skills—including audience awareness, decorum, rhetorical strategy, and many others—must start with a strong foundation in basic business writing principles. Sadly, many students, even at the graduate level, lack these skills on graduation. Understanding and using the fundamental components of mechanics, grammar, and language usage is something that young graduates and more seasoned MBA students cannot do without. Their success in the workplace depends on it.</p>
<p>To teach effective business communication, instructors must get to the heart of students’ current weaknesses in writing. One method for doing so is by assigning writing exercises. When used heuristically, by allowing students to “grade” their own work, writing exercises encourage students to practice self-assessment, self-evaluation, active learning, and knowledge transfer, all while reinforcing the basics of good writing. In addition to the core assignments, using writing exercises as a diagnostic or maintenance tool at different stages in the semester can drastically improve undergraduate and graduate student writing and increase the probability that these students will transfer that writing knowledge into other courses and into their practices as professional writers in industry.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, gaps and deficiencies in the writing skills of entry-level professionals as well as MBA-level students have been duly noted by industry experts and academic researchers in the field of business communication who call for a strengthening of communication skills at all levels of learning. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1080569912466438">Alsop’s (2004)</xref> special report in <italic>The Wall Street Journal</italic> identifies the communication shortcomings noted by employers and recruiters of recent MBA graduates. In the report, Alsop quotes investment banker Darren Whissen, Director of Research at Waveland LLC, who sums up the collective concern of many employers: “seemingly qualified candidates are unable to write even the simplest of arguments. . . . No matter how strong one’s financial model is, if one cannot write a logical, compelling story, then investors are going to look elsewhere” (as quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1080569912466438">Alsop, 2004</xref>, p. B2). Whissen goes as far as to call MBA student writing “abysmal” in many cases, as evidenced in the student responses to an interview exercise where MBA graduates are asked to draft an executive summary of a fictitious company and persuasively offer recommendations or cautions to hypothetical investors. Whissen’s collective observation of the student responses: Most reflect “sub-seventh-grade-level” content that is peppered with spelling and grammar errors and “a casual tone suitable for e-mails between friends but lacking the professionalism necessary to communicate with sophisticated investors” (as quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1080569912466438">Alsop, 2004</xref>, p. B4).</p>
<p>Similarly, according to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1080569912466438">National Association of Colleges and Employment (2010)</xref>, employers list communication as the top soft skill necessary for recent graduates to succeed in the workplace. Figures cited in the National Association of Colleges and Employment’s 2011 Job Outlook Survey and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1080569912466438">Driscoll’s (2011)</xref> analysis find that students are not coming into the workforce with enough expertise and skill in communication to be effective in their jobs, despite having the technical knowledge of a specialized degree. Often, Driscoll adds, they lack the ability to verbalize a clear and concise thought, use proper tone, or engage effectively with various audiences. Instant messaging and other impersonal and informal forms of social media communication, including email, are identified by Driscoll and other experts cited in her article as possible factors in these communication deficiencies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1080569912466438">Ford’s (2007)</xref> research also warns that students lack the soft skills more workplaces require. Based on results from a biannual survey of the graduate job market by the Association of Graduate Recruiters, Ford found that 43% of employers left many of their job posts unfilled because the students interviewed for these jobs were unable to match the hiring criteria in the three major areas of leadership, teamwork, and, most important, communication.</p>
<p>In various communication research, sources (industry experts, researchers, and practitioners alike) explicitly underscore the need for a renewed focus on basic writing skills for graduates. For example, University of California Santa Barbara’s Careers Services Director, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1080569912466438">Michael Kemp (2009)</xref>, explores how to bridge the gap between the skills that employers want and that students lack, noting especially that employers “weep over college graduates’ poor writing skills” (para. 2). Of particular importance to solving the problem, Kemp argues, is encouraging students to gain job experience while in school as well as requiring students to take a business writing course, or at least making this course available as an elective to students who are not required to take it as part of their degree plan. Equally important, he notes, is promoting the class to students in all majors, given that all students—not just business majors—will eventually be required to write at work.</p>
<p>An interesting finding worth noting as part of this literature review is that the call for stronger writing skills appears to be taking the dimensions of a global initiative.</p>
<p>Employers and educators outside of the United States are also looking for ways to improve the communication skills of their graduates entering the workforce. The globally-based culture and communication skills consultancy firm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1080569912466438">Communicaid Group Ltd. (2010)</xref> reports that employers across the world are investing in writing training to fortify the writing areas that graduate recruits are lacking. According to Communicaid,
<disp-quote>
<p>employers observe a range of issues from poor grammar and punctuation, a lack of attention to detail to an inability to adapt the academic style and register appropriate for essay writing to a more concise punchier business style. Graduate recruits who think that it is sufficient to get their ideas down on paper without worrying too much about how articulately they express themselves may find their employers are disappointed with their inability to write brief updates, proposals and reports or even draft a simple well structured email (para. 2).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1080569912466438">Communicaid (2010)</xref> also points out that many employees—entry level and more seasoned hires—are often unable to compose a message devoid of basic grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors. Additionally, the issue of tone and decorum—“the absence of sophisticated language necessary when influencing and persuading”—is also commonly noted in employee communication (para. 4). As with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1080569912466438">Driscoll, 2011</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1080569912466438">Communicaid (2010)</xref> also identifies pervasive text messaging and informal email usage as possible causes for these communication habits that lack an understanding of audience and propriety. As a potential solution, Communicaid adds, many organizations around the world are including business writing testing as part of the screening process for new hires while others are offering company-wide business writing courses with emphasis on punctuation, grammar, and report and email writing; this is done not only to remedy the skills gap but also to increase employee confidence in their own writing ability.</p>
<p>Clearly, effective writing and language usage are increasingly important given the global nature of business and the ascendency of a global business English, often known as Business English as a Lingua Franca (BELF). Succeeding across borders requires more than a deep understanding of the cultures we interact with for business purposes. Good global business requires the ability to communicate with the many English-speaking or BELF users across the world. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1080569912466438">Kankaanranta and Planken’s (2010)</xref> BELF study suggests that international business professionals in European multinational companies emphasize the value of clarity and simplicity in the use of English. According to Kankaanranta and Planken, “interviewees emphasized the value of using—and accommodating to the level of—simple and clear English . . . that hardly contained idiomatic expressions, complicated phraseology, or complex sentence structures” (p. 392). While interviewees in Kankaanranta and Planken’s study cited “grammatical inaccuracies” as “commonplace . . . but of little consequence,” these interviewees did point out that while the English does not need to be perfect, the core message must get across to avoid misunderstanding or miscommunication (p. 393). Interviewees who participated in Kankaanranta and Planken’s BELF study also listed clarity—language that is explicit, simple, and compact—as key to communicating with global business professionals (p. 396).</p>
<p>The need for students to develop stronger writing skills is very evident and may be even overstated here. Yet it truly is a concern—not only for those graduates who will soon be released into a highly competitive and scarce job market but also for those of us who teach business communication or business writing courses. As instructors in these courses, we are in the front lines of writing instruction and we are often the last hope that students have for learning to be effective writers (given that most students have already taken composition before reaching our courses). As a result, what we choose to include in our core assignments and in-class activities can either continue to compound the deficit of skills (by allowing students to keep slipping through the proverbial cracks) or it can secure the skills that students will need to succeed as writers in their organizations. The writing exercise activity described in this article is but one modest and simple example of how we can teach students destined for industry to be more professional, competent, and confident writers. In particular, because employers often highlight the need for improvement of basic writing skills and because these skills lay the groundwork for effective writing, the writing exercises that follow focus on developing foundational competencies in areas such as sentence structure, punctuation, pronoun usage, and active language.</p>
<p>The writing exercise/activity described in more detail in subsequent sections is extremely flexible: Instructors may assign only one set of exercises as a diagnostic tool in the first few weeks of the semester, or additional sets may be assigned at midterm, final, or other stages of the course, depending on the instructor’s preferences or on collective student need for additional writing instruction. Each student is asked to “grade” or evaluate his or her own work while the instructor and the class review and answer the problems together. For better outcomes as part of a heuristic model, writing exercises should not be measured or assessed by traditional grading methods (e.g., numerical grade assigned by the instructor) but, rather, should ideally be graded for completion (checkmarked) as part of a larger course participation grade, as will be elaborated on later.</p>
<p>A key component of these types of writing exercises is that they are heuristic in nature. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1080569912466438">Shafer (2009)</xref>, heuristics encourage communicators to “operate within the [professional] contexts that they must navigate” (p. 310), through the use of simulations or other hands-on activities that encourage self-teaching to improve performance. Heuristic activities allow students to “tinker” with writing, at their own pace; to make decisions about language and its uses based on their intuition, instinct, and experience; and to assess their own work, with only themselves to hold responsible for errors or areas for improvement. In the process of evaluating and correcting their own answers, the hope is that students will loop this new learning into their growing repertoire of writing skills and continue to use these skills beyond the business communication classroom.</p>
<p>Thus, the benefits of heuristic writing activities are many, both for the student and the teacher. As the following description of the writing exercises will demonstrate, these exercises can be easily incorporated into the standard business communication curriculum and they are simple and low labor intensive to grade. Most important, heuristic writing activities allow “private learning” for each student as well as “communal learning” as a class. These exercises empower the student by making him or her a partner in the learning and evaluation process. And because of their user-friendly design and how they are graded, these writing exercises allow instructors to truly teach and foster basic writing skills in business communication courses without losing the focus on core assignments of audience analysis, persuasive messages, and bad news messages, for example, which often leave very little precious time to devote to actual writing instruction.</p>
<sec id="section1-1080569912466438">
<title>Sample Writing Exercises</title>
<p>The following is one example of the writing exercises (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1080569912466438">Figure 1</xref>) that can be used for a heuristic activity (the answer key is provided in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1080569912466438">appendix</xref>). The exercises below cover components such as thesis statements, noun-pronoun agreement, identification of subjects/predicates, fragments/run-ons/comma splices, and active voice and passive voice. Instructors may choose from several methods for assigning and distributing the exercises (electronically, hard copy, etc.) based on the resources available and the nature of the audience.</p>

</fig>
<p>These simple exercises assess and develop students’ basic understanding of the fundamentals of writing, business writing in particular. One of the benefits of using writing exercises is that instructors have the flexibility and latitude to focus or highlight any writing principles or components of their choice. Moreover, instructors may develop their own writing exercises to meet the specific needs, demands, or requirements of their course, curriculum, or program. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1080569912466438">Figure 2</xref> illustrates some of the possible components that may be covered in writing exercises.</p>

</fig>
<p>The broad range of writing-related topics available for assessment emphasizes the scope and great utility of writing exercises. These uncomplicated exercises are easy to incorporate as an in-class activity or homework activity, in addition to the core assignments for the course. They require minimal grading time from instructors but have a high return of benefits for students throughout the semester. Writing exercises are flexible, giving instructors the freedom to choose when, how many, and how often to assign them. Students who participate in these exercises are empowered by being allowed to “grade” their own paper, with the instructor’s guidance. This gives students the opportunity to reap the benefit of instruction and feedback without feeling self-conscious about their writing ability and mistakes. Additionally, the exercises permit students to share in the process of evaluation, encouraging important skills in self-assessment of writing that will serve students well in their professional lives. Overall, the exercises featured here serve as valuable, invested, hands-on learning where students can increase proficiency in business writing by engaging more actively in the basic components of writing and composition. These simple exercises can have a substantial positive impact on undergraduate as well as graduate business students’ writing skills, particularly in courses such as business communication where very little time can be spent on reviewing or relearning basic writing skills. What follows are simple recommendations for using and scoring a heuristic writing activity such as the writing exercises.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1080569912466438" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method, Measurement, and Grading</title>
<p>Writing exercises may be assigned as a diagnostic tool at the beginning of the semester, as a midterm measurement in the middle of the term, as a final assessment tool at the end of the term, or all of the above. The instructor may choose the best options for assigning writing exercises, based on the dynamics, skill set, and course agenda for each course. The writing exercises may be assigned as an in-class activity or as an overnight homework activity.</p>
<p>Once students turn in the writing exercises, the instructor may scan the content but should not assign a numerical grade. Rather, the instructor can “grade” only for completion by assigning a check mark if all sections of the exercises are filled out. If a student fails to complete the exercises or misses them all together, this will result in a deduction from the overall participation grade for the course. Instructors may choose what deductions to take and should make these deduction policies clear in the portion of the syllabus (or other location) that describes the writing exercises. Instructors may then return the “checkmarked” or “graded” writing exercises back to the students and the students’ self-assessment may begin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1080569912466438">
<title>Student Self-Assessment</title>
<p>Students will “grade” their own writing exercises as the instructor reviews the answers with the class. Instructors may do this by copying the answer key on a transparency and writing in the answers with a nonpermanent marker or by sharing the answer key as a Word.doc on a projected computer screen and filling in the answers using the keyboard. As each exercise is reviewed, the instructor may engage the class by asking students to volunteer their responses and having one or two students share their answers with the class. As students grade each of the writing exercises, it is important to explain the writing principle that is being assessed, what causes issues/errors in this area (e.g., comma splices), and how to avoid/fix them (and demonstrate the flexibility of language by showing that there is more than one way to write the sentence correctly, if possible). Using a transparency and a nonpermanent marker or a projection on a live computer screen allows the instructor to write in examples/corrections and model whatever writing principle is being discussed. Instructors may conclude the self-assessment activity by reinforcing the concept of knowledge transfer and the expectation that these newly learned skills should be reflected not only in subsequent core assignments for the course but also in the writing students do in other courses and in their workplaces. At the end of the self-assessment, students will have accomplished the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1080569912466438" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Received participation credit for completing the writing exercises</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Gained experience in assessing their own writing, which can be useful in enhancing editing and proofreading skills overall</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Received instruction and examples in the basic principles of writing, business writing in particular</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Shared the responsibility for evaluating and grading their performance</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Learned about knowledge transfer and the expectation/accountability of incorporating learning in subsequent writing for academic and professional purposes</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1080569912466438">
<title>Knowledge Transfer</title>
<p>Instructors may look to the core assignments in the course to see if students are transferring knowledge of what they are learning in the writing exercises. The core assignments are where accountability, that is, numerical grades, may take place, in addition to accountability for completion of the writing exercises as part of the participation grade. If, collectively, students are exhibiting errors in one particular area, perhaps it is useful to revisit that writing issue the first few minutes of the following class. Or perhaps another writing exercise session would be helpful, if time permits. Knowledge transfer from the writing exercises to other forms of professional writing may also be assessed in student communication with the instructor throughout the semester, via email, text messaging, or whatever other forms of communication are used as part of the course. Finally, the instructor may also assign a brief freewrite activity in the days or weeks following the writing exercise session, as an additional diagnostic measurement of how well students are transferring knowledge and learning of basic writing skills.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1080569912466438" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Like most courses, business communication is a performance-based course. And this mirrors the performance-based expectations of the employers who will (hopefully) hire our undergraduate and graduate students on graduation. Business communication courses are laden with a multitude of core assignments (bad news messages, persuasive messages, reports, emails, etc.), all of which are usually graded for content and, hence, reflect a student’s individual performance and quantitative accountability at the end of the term. This performance-based model, however, does leave room for incorporating alternate and complementary methods of instruction and assessment, some of which can be easily incorporated into the classroom to reinforce the foundational writing skills that employers and recruiters so desperately need from our graduates. Heuristic writing exercises can be considered as one of these methods—they represent an undemanding yet powerful way to teach good writing in the business communication course, ensuring that students are guided through the trenches and are given the tools they need to successfully write their way out into the world.</p>

<p>Starbucks Coffee Company has gone through drastic changes over the past 37 years. A globally recognized brand, it has stores in 45 markets outside the United States with a store count of 16,680 as of September 28, 2008. The company went through a period of tremendous growth, opening stores at a rate that few companies could match. This rapid growth has now slowed greatly due to a change in the business climate and in company performance. The company has seen the value of its stock reduced by 75% since late 2006 (Barker, 2008) and, as a result, has been going through a major transformation since the beginning of this year to try to recover losses and rebuild. <bold><italic>The driving cause for Starbucks’ recent volatility is its accelerated overgrowth, which caused the company to lose much of its identity.</italic></bold> This paper will investigate the current state of the company and how it got where it is today, what steps it has taken to recover, how successful those steps have been, and what lessons have been learned from the changes the company has gone through.</p>
