<abstract>
<p>Osteomyelitis frequently complicates infections in the feet of patients with diabetes. Gram-positive cocci, especially <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, are the most commonly isolated pathogens, but gram-negative bacteria also cause some cases of diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO). These gram-negatives require different antibiotic regimens than those commonly directed at gram-positives. There are, however, few data on factors related to their presence and how they influence the clinical picture. We conducted a retrospective study to determine the variables associated with the isolation of gram-negative bacteria from bone samples in cases of DFO and the clinical presentation of these infections. Among 341 cases of DFO, 150 had a gram-negative isolate (alone or combined with a gram-positive isolate) comprising 44.0% of all patients and 50.8% of those with a positive bone culture. Compared with gram-positive infections, wounds with gram-negative organisms more often had a fetid odor, necrotic tissue, signs of soft tissue infection accompanying osteomyelitis, and clinically severe infection. By multivariate analysis, the predictive variables related to an increased likelihood of isolating gram-negatives from bone samples were glycated hemoglobin &lt;7% (odds ratio [OR] = 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-3.5) and a wound caused by traumatic injury (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.0-3.9). Overall, patients whose bone samples contained gram-negatives had a statistically significantly higher prevalence of leukocytosis and higher white blood cell counts than those without gram-negatives. In conclusion, gram-negative organisms were isolated in nearly half of our cases of DFO and were associated with more severe infections, higher white blood cell counts, lower glycated hemoglobin levels, and wounds of traumatic etiology.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Persons with diabetes frequently develop foot complications, largely related to the presence of peripheral neuropathy, as well as peripheral vascular disease and poorly understood immunological perturbations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734613477423">1</xref></sup> These abnormalities often lead to the development of foot ulcers, which can become infected. Unless appropriately treated, infection can spread contiguously to bone, causing diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734613477423">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734613477423"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734613477423"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734613477423">5</xref></sup> The bacteria causing most foot infections derive from the skin flora; thus, gram-positive cocci (GPC), especially <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, are the predominant pathogens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734613477423">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734613477423"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734613477423"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734613477423">9</xref></sup> Gram-negative rods (GNRs) are also reported as causative pathogens in patients with DFO,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734613477423">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734613477423">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734613477423">9</xref></sup> usually in mixed infections with GPC and in patients with chronic or previously treated infections. More recently, reports from less developed countries with warm climates have demonstrated that GNRs are among the most common isolates in diabetic foot infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734613477423">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734613477423">11</xref></sup> While GNRs may represent colonizers or contaminants, when isolated from deep tissue specimens (like bone) they are usually true pathogens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734613477423">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Definitive antibiotic therapy in DFO usually requires isolating the causative organism from a specimen of infected bone, but this is not routinely done in most centers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734613477423">12</xref></sup> Thus, therapy is often empirical and directed mainly at GPC. If infection with GNRs is proven or suspected, clinicians will generally alter their choice of antibiotic regimen to broader spectrum agents that cover these bacteria. Unfortunately, there is little published information about the epidemiological, demographic, or clinical factors that may help predict the presence of GNRs in patients with DFO. Nor are there data on how the presence of these organisms, as opposed to GPC, influences the clinical picture at presentation.</p>
<p>DFO with GNRs is a common finding in the patients seen in our diabetic foot center. To better understand the factors associated with, and the clinical presentation of, these infections, we undertook a retrospective review of our experience. We were particularly interested to determine whether any external or host factors were related to isolation of GNRs from bone samples and to determine if infection with these organisms had any influence on the clinical presentation of DFO.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>We conducted a retrospective study of patients treated in our department during 10 years (January 1, 2002, to January 1, 2012) who had diabetes and osteomyelitis of the foot. Our Surgery Department is located in a 120-bed hospital that includes a Diabetic Foot Unit, which accepts patients who are referred from surgical specialists and from other hospitals. We identified patients by cross-matching 2 items in our database that only includes patients with diabetes and foot lesions: “infection” and “osteomyelitis.” We extracted all clinical and microbiological data from our database, which we have used since 1999. The diagnosis of osteomyelitis in each case was based on a sequential combination of the probe-to-bone (PTB) test and plain x-rays, as published elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734613477423">13</xref></sup> Briefly, this consisted of performing PTB with a sterile metal probe at the initial evaluation of the patient and taking a plain x-ray of the affected foot. Patients in whom PTB was positive or plain x-ray was suggestive of osteomyelitis were diagnosed with probable DFO and underwent surgery. We categorized the location of osteomyelitis as forefoot when it involved the metatarsal heads and the phalanges, midfoot when it involved the region from the metatarsal neck to the Chopart joint, and hindfoot when it involved the Chopart joint to ankle. Lesions also were classified as being either plantar or nonplantar, and according to the location of the point of entry of the infection. Clinicians included in the database when a traumatic injury was the cause of the wound that acted as the point of entry of the bone infection.</p>
<p>Every patient with suspected DFO underwent surgery during which we extracted bone samples aseptically and sent them to both the pathology and microbiology laboratories. Our microbiology laboratory performed aerobic (but not anaerobic) cultures on submitted specimens using usual methods. We diagnosed peripheral arterial disease if the patient lacked both pedal pulses or had an ankle brachial index less than 0.9. We diagnosed soft tissue infections either preoperatively (if there were superficial signs or symptoms of inflammation, necrosis, or purulence) or during surgical procedures (if there was deep tissue purulence or necrosis), according to previously published criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734613477423">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534734613477423">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734613477423">15</xref></sup> If bone samples were lost or not properly processed, we excluded the patient from the study. We categorized cases in which any GNRs were isolated, either alone or together with any GPCs, as the GN group. Cases in which no GNRs were isolated from bone were designated the non-GN group. Since cases that we included in which no bacteria were isolated were always confirmed to have evidence of osteomyelitis by histopathology, we included them in the non-GN group.</p>
<p>We defined anemia according to World Health Organization criteria as a hemoglobin concentration &lt;12 g/dL in women and &lt;13 g/dL in men, and leucocytosis as a white blood cell count of &gt;11 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L. We considered patients whose glycated hemoglobin was &lt;7% to have good metabolic control and those with a higher value to be poorly controlled. As per the IDSA guidelines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734613477423">1</xref></sup> we classified the severity of the infection as mild, moderate, or severe.</p>
<sec id="section3-1534734613477423">
<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>For descriptive purposes, we used median and quartiles 1 and 3 for nonnormally distributed continuous variables and percentage for discrete variables. By univariate analysis we compared discrete variables using the χ<sup>2</sup> test; for continuous variables we used the nonparametric Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. Then, to model the effects of predictors of isolating GNRs from bone samples while controlling for potential confounding variables, we conducted a stepwise logistic regression analysis for all variables with <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;.1.</p>
<p>To study the influence of the duration of the wound on isolating gram-negative bacteria, we calculated the median and quartiles of the duration of the ulcer. Cases were classified into 4 groups according to duration of the ulcer, corresponding to minimum-quartile 1, quartile 1-median, median-quartile 3, and quartile 3-maximum. We conducted a χ<sup>2</sup> test with 3 degrees of freedom using cases included in each quartile and the presence of gram-negative isolates, with a <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 as the threshold of statistical significance. We performed statistical analysis with SPSS version 15.0 for Windows (IBM SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).</p>
<p>This retrospective study did not require approval by an ethics committee since all the procedures were part of our standard practice; we did not alter or exceed our usual scope of medical care. All patients gave written informed consent for surgery, for photographs taken of their wounds, to be included in our computer database, and for their (anonymized) case data to be included in a publication.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We treated 352 patients with DFO during the period of study, but excluded 11 cases because bone samples were not available. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534734613477423">Table 1</xref> shows the demographic data and comorbidities of the included study patients. About two thirds of the patients were men, with a median age of 65 years. The median duration of diabetes was 19 years, and just over half were treated with insulin. The prevalence of comorbidities was high, especially anemia, hypertension, and retinopathy, and 60.4% had had a previous foot ulcer or amputation.</p>

<p>Wounds caused by traumatic injury had a median duration of 60 days (Q1 15, Q3 90), whereas nontraumatic wounds had a median duration of 60 days (Q1 30, Q3 150), <italic>P</italic> = .06. Median duration of the ulcer was 60 days (Q1 30, Q3 120) in the GN group and 60 days (Q1 30, Q3 150) in the non-GN group (<italic>P</italic> = .22). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734613477423">Figure 1</xref>, there was no significant difference in the duration of the foot ulcer distribution of the 2 groups by quartiles (<italic>P</italic> = .48, χ<sup>2</sup> test with 3 degrees of freedom). Results of univariate analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534734613477423">Table 2</xref>. By multivariate analysis, the predictive variables related to an increased likelihood of isolating GNRs from bone samples were glycated hemoglobin &lt;7% (odd ratio [OR] = 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-3.5) and a wound caused by traumatic injury (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.0-3.9). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534734613477423">Table 3</xref> demonstrates differences between the 2 groups according to clinical presentation. Patients in the GN group more often had leukocytosis and had a higher mean white blood cell count than those in the non-GN group. There was, however, no difference in ESR between the groups. Fetid odor, necrosis, and soft tissue infection accompanying the osteomyelitis and clinically severe infection were each found more frequently in patients in the GN group than the non-GN group. Of all isolates from bone specimens (n = 384), 58.3% were gram-positive, 40.6% were gram-negative, and 1.1% were fungi. Among 341 cases of DFO, 150 had a gram-negative isolate (alone or combined with a gram-positive), comprising 44.0% overall and 50.8% of those with a positive bone culture. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1534734613477423">Table 4</xref> shows the gram-negative bacteria, isolated either exclusively or together with gram-positives, in all study patients.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Managing osteomyelitis of the foot in persons with diabetes is a difficult and contentious problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534734613477423">16</xref></sup> Although most cases are caused by GPC, especially <italic>S aureus</italic>, GNR are also relatively frequent. This is especially the case in patients with chronic infections and those who have recently received antibiotic therapy. Data from several studies show rates of gram-negative pathogens in patients with diabetic foot osteomyelitis of 18% to 57%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534734613477423">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534734613477423"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534734613477423">19</xref></sup> More recently, studies from less developed countries that have predominantly warm climates, such as India, have shown high rates of gram-negative foot infections, including osteomyelitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734613477423">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734613477423">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534734613477423">20</xref></sup> Infections with gram-negative organisms generally require different antibiotic agents than those with gram-positive organisms, and many cases of DFO are treated empirically (without bone culture).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534734613477423">21</xref></sup> Thus, it could be useful to know if demographic or clinical features can help predict which patients with DFO are infected with GNRs.</p>
<p>In our study, we compared the data on 150 patients with biopsy-proven DFO from whom GNRs (alone or mixed with gram-positive organisms) were isolated to that from 191 with no GNRs (which either had only other species or were sterile). We found no relationship between the likelihood of isolating GNRs and the duration of the food wound. Indeed, GPCs were isolated at a higher rate in quartiles 3 and 4 of duration of the wounds, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Although our medical center is located in a warm climate, the most frequent isolates in our patients were gram-positive bacteria. We did find 2 variables that were independently and significantly associated with an increased likelihood of isolating GNR bone isolates: wounds that developed after trauma and patients with good glycemic control. We found no similar findings in the published literature.</p>
<p>The types of trauma incurred by our patients were quite varied, including nail puncture, falling, self-use of blades for removing callus, sliver puncture, foreign bodies in the shoes, or hot water scalding. Thus, it is difficult to draw any conclusions with on the mechanism by which trauma could be a causative factor in GNR infections. More surprising is our finding that patients with good metabolic control had a higher rate of GNR bone isolates. We have previously reported that the glycated hemoglobin level did not have any influence on the outcomes of surgical treatment of DFO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534734613477423">22</xref></sup> In other studies of diabetic foot complications, inadequate metabolic control as measured by glycated hemoglobin levels were found to be a variable associated with longer time to healing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534734613477423">23</xref></sup> and failure of transmetatarsal amputation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534734613477423">24</xref></sup> Theoretically, host defenses in patients with good metabolic control should be better than in those with poor control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534734613477423">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534734613477423">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534734613477423">26</xref></sup> The effect of trauma on the microbiology of the wound, or differences in the normal skin flora depending on metabolic control, could affect the types of organisms causing infection, but we cannot draw any definitive conclusions from this study. Previous antibiotic treatment, surgery with admission in another hospital, and ischemia did not have any influence on the likelihood of isolating GNRs from bone samples.</p>
<p>The presence of GNRs was associated with the severity of clinical presentation. Local signs such as fetid odor, necrosis, and associated soft tissue infection were more frequent when GNRs were isolated. We elected not to address the influence of having gram-negative isolates on the outcomes of treatment of DFO because all the patients in this retrospective series underwent surgical treatment, and we included some patients who have previously been included in other published studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734613477423">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534734613477423">27</xref></sup> which could create an important bias. Other limitations of this study are its retrospective nature and the fact that we did not perform anaerobic cultures, although obligate anaerobes are rarely isolated from bone cultures in DFO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534734613477423">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534734613477423">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534734613477423">29</xref></sup> The strengths of the study include the fact that we had access to a large population of patients for whom a culture was taken from bone biopsy in sterile conditions during surgery and had a system in place for thoroughly documenting our patient’s demographic and clinical findings.</p>
<p>In conclusion, compared to patients without GNRs, those with them are more frequently isolated from bone samples in cases of DFO in patients with wounds that developed after a trauma and in those with a glycated hemoglobin less than 7%. The presence of GNRs was also associated with a more severe clinical presentation both of local signs, such as fetid odor, necrosis, and soft tissue infections, and systemic signs, such as leukocytosis. Recognizing these findings might help clinicians consider empiric antibiotic coverage for gram-negative organisms in selected patients with DFO who have one or more of the potential risk factors noted.</p>
