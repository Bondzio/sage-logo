<abstract>
<p>Language and math are intertwined during children’s learning of arithmetic concepts, but the importance of language in adult arithmetic processing is less clear. To determine whether early learning plays a critical role in the math-language connection in adults, we tested retrieval of simple multiplication in adult bilinguals who learned arithmetic in only one language. We measured electrophysiological and behavioral responses during correctness judgments for problems presented as digits or as number words in Spanish or English. Problems presented in the language in which participants learned arithmetic elicited larger, more graded, and qualitatively different brain responses than did problems presented in participants’ other language, and these responses more closely resembled responses for digits, even when participants’ other language was more dominant. These findings suggest that the memory networks for simple multiplication are established when arithmetic concepts are first learned and are independent of language dominance in adulthood.</p>

<p>The acquisition of simple arithmetic is mediated by language (e.g., through the verbal rehearsal of multiplication tables). Accordingly, it has been argued that exact mathematical concepts, such as simple multiplication, are represented in a language-specific format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612446347">Dehaene, 1997</xref>). In bilinguals, this means that mathematical concepts are accessed more efficiently in the language in which the person learned simple arithmetic (language of arithmetic, or LA+) than in the person’s other language (LA–; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612446347">Dehaene, Spelke, Pinel, Stanescu, &amp; Tsivkin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0956797612446347">Spelke &amp; Tsivkin, 2001</xref>). However, factors such as language proficiency play an important role in bilingual language processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612446347">Elston-Guttler, Paulmann, &amp; Kotz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797612446347">Moreno &amp; Kutas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0956797612446347">Weber-Fox, Davis, &amp; Cuadrado, 2003</xref>), affecting the efficiency of retrieving and using words. By inference, language proficiency could similarly affect accessing and processing of language-dependent arithmetic concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612446347">Frenck-Mestre &amp; Vaid, 1993</xref>). Thus, it is not clear to what extent the representations established in childhood determine the strength and relationships of arithmetic facts in adulthood and whether access to adult representations is dependent on the original language in which those facts were learned. In the study reported here, we took advantage of the bilingual brain to determine whether early learning plays a critical role in the math-language connection in adults.</p>
<p>The debate over the cognitive relationship between language and math (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612446347">Campbell &amp; Clark, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612446347">Dehaene et al., 1999</xref>) focuses in part on the extent to which math is dissociable from other cognitive functions, including language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612446347">Cipolotti &amp; Harskamp, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0956797612446347">Spelke &amp; Tsivkin, 2001</xref>). Co-occurring impairments in math and language skills in neuropsychological patients and language-based development of number concepts in childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612446347">Dehaene &amp; Cohen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612446347">Gelman &amp; Butterworth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797612446347">Gelman &amp; Gallistel, 1978</xref>) allude to a relationship between these domains. This relationship is more obvious for mathematical concepts that rely on language-specific representations than for mathematical concepts that rely on abstract representations (e.g., multiplication tables versus approximate calculations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797612446347">Delazer &amp; Benke, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612446347">Hittmair-Delazer, Sailer, &amp; Benke, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0956797612446347">Spelke &amp; Tsivkin, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Typically, both bilinguals and monolinguals learn arithmetic concepts, such as multiplication, once. The ability to separate learned mathematical facts from the language used to learn them can prove challenging in the healthy monolingual brain, in which words and arithmetic concepts have a one-to-one mapping. In contrast, the bilingual brain—with multiple mappings for the same concepts—provides an excellent resource for teasing apart the relationship between arithmetic and language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612446347">Dehaene et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612446347">Frenck-Mestre &amp; Vaid, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The sole model of bilingual arithmetic posits separate representations for arithmetic facts, one in each language and in each language-independent digit format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612446347">Campbell &amp; Epp, 2004</xref>). There is some evidence from studies of bilinguals suggesting that concepts such as multiplication are intimately linked to LA+. Adult bilinguals trained on novel exact-number facts (e.g., base-6 addition) retrieve these facts more effectively in LA+ than in LA–, even when LA+ was not their preferred or first natural language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612446347">Dehaene et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0956797612446347">Spelke &amp; Tsivkin, 2001</xref>). This finding implies that arithmetic facts should be represented in adults more strongly, or solely, in LA+. This hypothesis is in line with anecdotal reports from bilinguals who feel the need to count or perform simple arithmetic in their first language, even when communicating in the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612446347">Dehaene, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>A bilingual’s use of each language, however, is dynamic over a lifetime, and the language in which concepts were learned in childhood does not necessarily remain the language of preference in adulthood. The language that is more dominant or more frequently used changes based on a bilingual’s environment, beginning in early childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797612446347">Kohnert, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612446347">Linck, Kroll, &amp; Sunderman, 2009</xref>). In many instances, the language of early education can become the less dominant language in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612446347">Bahrick, Hall, Goggin, Bahrick, &amp; Berger, 1994</xref>). In the United States, for example, early education can take place in a language other than English for both immigrant populations (e.g., in English-as-a-second-language or dual-language programs) and native English speakers (e.g., language-immersion programs). Ultimately, dominance and proficiency in a language can affect language performance and modulate the underlying neural processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612446347">Elston-Guttler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797612446347">Moreno &amp; Kutas, 2005</xref>). In the present study, we tested whether LA+ is the critical factor in representation and retrieval of arithmetic facts, or whether high proficiency or dominance in a language can change early representations of arithmetic concepts.</p>
<p>Generally, the memory network for arithmetic within a language is thought to have extensive connections among arithmetic facts, similar to conceptual networks for other domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612446347">Campbell &amp; Clark, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612446347">Niedeggen &amp; Rösler, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0956797612446347">Stazyk, Ashcraft, &amp; Hamann, 1982</xref>). Each operand in a multiplication problem, and the problem as a whole, can trigger a candidate set of solutions in the network through an automatic spread of activation. In turn, each possible solution is activated proportionally to the strength of its relation with the operands (e.g., the problem 2 × 3 not only triggers the solution 6, but also the numbers 4 and 9 more weakly as multiplication factors of each operand). In monolinguals, correctness judgments for simple multiplication problems are faster for correct solutions than for incorrect ones, and faster for incorrect solutions unrelated to either operand (e.g., 2 × 3 = 13) than for incorrect solutions related to either operand (e.g., 2 × 3 = 15, in which 15 is a factor of 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612446347">Niedeggen &amp; Rösler, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0956797612446347">Niedeggen, Rösler, &amp; Jost, 1999</xref>). This relatedness effect is thought to reflect interference from potential solutions that are automatically activated when processing digits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797612446347">Galfano, Rusconi, &amp; Umilta, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0956797612446347">Niedeggen et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>These effects of arithmetic correctness and relatedness are also observed in monolingual electrophysiological data, specifically on the N400 component, a negative-going event-related potential (ERP) peaking around 400 ms after stimulus onset. The N400 is thought to reflect the automatic spread of activation among representations of arithmetic facts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612446347">Niedeggen &amp; Rösler, 1999</xref>). Similar to the N400 effect for semantically related versus unrelated words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612446347">Federmeier &amp; Kutas, 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0956797612446347">Kutas &amp; Hillyard, 1980</xref>), N400 amplitude is larger for unrelated than for related incorrect arithmetic solutions, with the smallest N400 amplitude observed for correct solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0956797612446347">Niedeggen et al., 1999</xref>). The operand-solution relationship also modulates a late positive component (LPC), which shows larger positivity as the relationship between them becomes more distant. The LPC is thought to reflect more controlled processes than the N400 does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612446347">Coulson, King, &amp; Kutas, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612446347">Kolk &amp; Chwilla, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0956797612446347">Wicha, Moreno, &amp; Kutas, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The goal of this study was to determine whether LA+ establishes the quality and strength of representations for multiplication facts in adult bilinguals, and whether these representations are independent of natural language dominance. We addressed this question by measuring behavior (in a reaction time, RT, experiment) and brain electrical responses (in an ERP experiment) to multiplication-fact retrieval in adult bilinguals. From this data, we inferred the strength and interconnection of arithmetic fact representations in each language. We selected Spanish-English bilinguals who learned both languages early in childhood and who were proficient in both languages but learned arithmetic in only one. Critically, the specific language in which arithmetic was learned (Spanish or English) was independent of which language was more dominant.</p>
<p>If early learning determines the structure of representations for arithmetic facts, then even bilinguals who are proficient in both languages should show greater sensitivity (e.g., stronger modulation of the N400 amplitude to correct than incorrect solutions) and more extensive connectivity (e.g., gradation in N400 response across solutions based on relatedness of the solution and the operands) for multiplication problems presented in LA+ than in LA–. This relationship between the N400 response and problems presented in LA+ should be independent of language dominance. In contrast, if proficiency or general language dominance can override early-established memory traces for arithmetic facts encoded in LA+ under normal conditions (e.g., in typical bilingual adults who do not relearn arithmetic concepts in their other language), then the N400 effects should either be larger in the dominant than in the nondominant language, irrespective of the language used for learning math during childhood, or similar in both languages.</p>

<p>Participants were healthy, right-handed, Spanish-English bilinguals exposed to Spanish from birth and English by age 15 (mean age of exposure = 7.1 years); none had math expertise. Of the 11 participants in the RT experiment (5 male, 6 female; mean age = 21.7 years, range = 20–23 years), 6 learned arithmetic in English, and 5 learned arithmetic in Spanish. Of the 22 participants in the ERP experiment (6 male, 16 female; mean age = 23.5 years, range = 19–32 years), 12 learned arithmetic in English, and 10 learned arithmetic in Spanish; 4 of the subjects in the ERP experiment also participated in the RT experiment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0956797612446347">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Language assessment</title>
<p>Language proficiency was assessed with two measures administered to each participant in both Spanish and English: the Boston Naming Test (BNT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797612446347">Kaplan, Goodglass, and Weintraub, 1983</xref>) and the Verbal Fluency Test (VFT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612446347">Benton, Hamsher, and Sivan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0956797612446347">Rey &amp; Benton, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612446347">Table 1</xref>). On the BNT, participants were presented with 60 line drawings one at a time, and they had to name the items pictured in English and Spanish. On the VFT, participants named words from three semantic categories and from three categories of words starting with a specific letter (English: <italic>f, a</italic>, and <italic>s</italic>; Spanish: <italic>p, t</italic>, and <italic>m</italic>). Relative dominance of the participants’ two languages (scores in English minus scores in Spanish) varied across participants. Although this variance was small, it was sufficient to allow us to use relative dominance as a regressor for ERP effects. Relative dominance was correlated between the BNT and the VFT (<italic>r</italic> = .65, <italic>p</italic> = .001); the BNT score was used as a regression factor. All analyses compared scores in LA+ with scores in LA–, collapsed across languages. Participants also reported the daily frequency with which they used each language.</p>

<title>Stimuli and procedure</title>
<p>Stimuli were simple multiplication problems printed in white text centered on a black background. Stimuli appeared on a 19-in. CRT monitor positioned approximately 1 m from the participant. Each trial sequence began with a 1-s fixation marker, followed by the first operand, which appeared for 350 ms. After a 250-ms blank interstimulus interval, the second operand appeared for 350 ms, followed by a 150-ms blank interstimulus interval. The solution then appeared for 350 ms. The problems were presented with no symbols (e.g., “2 3 6”).</p>
<p>Participants sat in a dimly lit sound-attenuating chamber. In the behavioral experiment, participants made a speeded correctness judgment at the solution onset. In the ERP experiment, a question mark appeared 1 s after solution onset (to ensure movement artifacts did not appear in the ERP) to cue a delayed correctness judgment. Judgments of whether the solution presented was correct or incorrect were made using two different fingers of the right hand on two keyboard keys, counterbalanced for order across participants.</p>
<p>Problems appeared as digits and as lowercase words in Spanish and English (see Table S1 in the Supplemental Material). The solution could be correct, incorrect but related to one of the operands (e.g., “2 3 15,” in which 15 is a factor of 3), or incorrect but unrelated to one of the operands (e.g., “2 3 13”). Number words were matched for lexical frequency across languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612446347">Davies, 2002</xref>; see Table S2 in the Supplemental Material). Naturally, there were more syllables for Spanish than for English words, <italic>F</italic>(1, 11) = 32.51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .74; however, in comparing responses in LA+ with responses in LA–, we collapsed Spanish and English items across participants, controlling for effects of syllable length. There were no significant differences in length or frequency across solution types (correct, related, or unrelated) in either language.</p>
<p>In total, there were 288 trials consisting of 96 trials per format (digits, LA+, LA–). Forty-eight of the 96 trials presented correct solutions, and the other 48 presented incorrect solutions. Across each of the 48 trials, 24 presented solutions related to one of the operands, and 24 presented solutions unrelated to one of the operands. These 288 trials were divided into three blocks and pseudorandomized. Problems were never presented twice consecutively; there were no more than three consecutive correct or incorrect items or items in the same format.</p>

<title>Electroencephalogram (EEG) recording and analysis</title>
<p>Continuous EEGs were recorded from 26 scalp electrodes placed in a geodesic array with the left mastoid as a reference. Recordings were obtained using SA Instrumentation bio-amplifiers and band-pass filtered from 0.01 to 100 Hz at a sampling rate of 250 Hz. Impedances were kept below 5kΩ. Free electrodes recorded blinks, horizontal eye movements, and left and right mastoid processes as references. Trials with eye or other artifacts were removed (there was roughly equal data loss across conditions). Data were rereferenced to the average mastoids. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a significant interaction between correctness (2 levels), format (3 levels), and electrode (26 levels), <italic>F</italic>(50, 1050) = 2.38, <italic>p</italic> = .043, η<sup>2</sup> = .10; thus, 20 representative electrodes were selected for further analyses to capture this interaction.

Rectangles identify the six representative electrodes for which waveforms are shown in this figure, and color coding shows the four regions of interest used in statistical analysis. Grand-average difference ERPs (b) from the six representative electrodes illustrate the N400 correctness effect for multiplication problems presented in three formats: digits, the language participants used to learn arithmetic (LA+), and participants’ other language (LA–). The N400 correctness effect was calculated by subtracting the N400 amplitude on all trials that presented the correct solution from the N400 amplitude on all trials that presented the incorrect solution. Spline-interpolated isovoltage maps (c) show the topographic distribution of the mean N400 correctness effect (top row) and mean N400 relatedness effect (bottom row) for the three formats. The N400 relatedness effect was calculated by subtracting the N400 amplitude on trials that presented solutions related to the operands from the N400 amplitude on trials that presented solutions unrelated to the operands.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The goal of the present study was to determine whether early learning plays a critical role in the organization of arithmetic memory in adults. Using bilinguals who learned arithmetic in only one of their proficient languages, we measured behavioral and electrophysiological responses while participants judged the correctness of simple multiplication problems. The problems were presented as digits or as words in either language, and the solution was correct, incorrect but related to the operands, or incorrect but unrelated to the operands.</p>
<p>As expected, faster RTs were observed for correct solutions, followed by unrelated then related incorrect solutions. Similarly, the N400 amplitude was larger for incorrect than for correct solutions, and larger for unrelated than related solutions. These findings are consistent with the notion of a graded spread of activation among concepts based on their relation to the multiplication problem. This effect was larger for problems presented in LA+ and as digits than for problems presented in LA–, which suggests weaker activation in LA–. In addition, access to related concepts in LA– was qualitatively different, as indexed by the LPC relatedness effect, compared with the more automatic N400 effect for LA+ and digits. Critically, the effects of correctness and relatedness for LA+ and LA– were not affected by language dominance or high proficiency in LA–.</p>
<p>Finally, a positive correlation between dominance in LA+ and the size of the N400 correctness effect for digits provides additional support for the importance of LA+ in establishing the memory network for multiplication facts. Overall, our findings suggest that arithmetic is differentially represented in each language in the bilingual brain and that these representations are established during early learning and maintained into adulthood independently of natural language dominance.</p>
<p>These findings clarify the role of arithmetic representations in both bilinguals and monolinguals. The size of the N400 amplitude is thought to be inversely related to the strength of activation of arithmetic facts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612446347">Niedeggen &amp; Rösler, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0956797612446347">Niedeggen et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, the smaller N400 correctness effect for LA– than for LA+ and for digits—and the lack of a behavioral correctness effect—suggests weaker spread of activation from operands to solutions. Previous studies have shown that digits automatically activate a network of related concepts, including multipliers, even when multiplication facts are irrelevant to the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797612446347">Galfano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797612446347">LeFevre, Bisanz, &amp; Mrkonjic, 1988</xref>). The N400 relatedness effect we found for digits supports these findings. In addition, by inference, the same automatic activation of related concepts occurs in LA+ but not in LA–, indicating that connections between related operands and solutions are not as well established in LA–.</p>
<p>In addition to providing strong evidence for the importance of early learning, our data downplay the role of language dominance for arithmetic fact retrieval in fluent bilinguals. If proficiency could strengthen or reorganize the network in LA–, then results for our bilinguals who had similar proficiency in LA– and LA+ or greater proficiency in LA– than in LA+ should have shown this reorganization. Instead, LA– remained the weaker and less connected of the two languages. Moreover, problems presented in LA– shared less similarity in the pattern of effects with problems presented in the digit format than problems presented in LA+ did, which suggests qualitatively different processing. A higher percentage of daily use of LA– did increase the efficacy of discriminating correct and incorrect solutions, but still did not lead to an N400 relatedness effect. It is possible that the representations in LA– could become more like the representations in LA+ if pushed to the extreme (e.g., in bilinguals with very low proficiency or infrequent use of LA+) or if these concepts are relearned explicitly or implicitly in LA–. We are addressing these possibilities in ongoing research.</p>
<p>The absence of an N400 relatedness effect in LA– alludes to a gross categorization of correct and incorrect solutions in this language. Also, unlike solutions in LA+ and for digits, related solutions in LA– elicited larger late-positive amplitudes than unrelated solutions did. This indicates that this information is accessed, but on a later time scale and perhaps through more controlled processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612446347">Coulson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612446347">Kolk &amp; Chwilla, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0956797612446347">Wicha et al., 2004</xref>), such as translation into a more dominant format. The behavioral data show no difference in timing between languages for related or unrelated incorrect solutions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0956797612446347">Table 2</xref>), even though a delay in processing problems presented in LA– due to translation would be expected. Alternatively, these effects in LA– could be due to implicit or automatic activation of a more dominant format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797612446347">Kroll, Bobb, Misra, &amp; Guo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0956797612446347">Thierry &amp; Wu, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Still, implicit activation of LA+ could explain the weaker correctness effects in LA–, but not the qualitative shift of a relatedness effect from the N400 to the LPC. Another possibility is that all formats require access to a concept-level representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0956797612446347">McCloskey, Marcuso, &amp; Whetstone, 1992</xref>) and that LA– requires more effortful, controlled access than digits and LA+ do. In either case, our data demonstrate that solutions to simple multiplication problems are less available and retrieved with more effort in LA– than in LA+.</p>
<p>An important remaining question is whether the effect of LA+ is specific to arithmetic or whether it can apply to any concept learned. There is evidence to suggest that exact number facts, such as simple multiplication problems, may be indeed treated uniquely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612446347">Dehaene et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0956797612446347">Spelke &amp; Tsivkin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0956797612446347">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). It may be the method of learning such abstract concepts or the concepts themselves that make the reliance on LA+ so important. Although it is known that factors such as age of acquisition and proficiency modulate access to meaningful words in a language, it is not known whether the semantic networks for other concepts have finer connections that make them more accessible and sensitive to relatedness in LA+ than in LA–.</p>
<p>In sum, our results show that arithmetic facts are organized into strong associative memory networks for problems presented in LA+ and digit formats, with a weaker network for problems presented in LA–. Problems presented in LA– displayed quantitatively and qualitatively different patterns of effects compared with problems presented in LA+ and digit formats. Though frequency of language use changed overall processing efficiency in LA–, it did not strengthen the spread of activation to related concepts. Finally, high LA– proficiency or LA– dominance (when LA+ was the weaker natural language) did not change the networks for arithmetic in either language. Thus, a connection between language and math is established at the time of learning and maintained into adulthood independently of natural language dominance. This finding may have important implications for teaching and testing young bilinguals, and it highlights the idea that bilinguals should not be treated as two monolinguals in one brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797612446347">Grosjean, 1989</xref>).</p>

<p>All analyses were performed with and without these 4 subjects, and the same pattern of effects was observed in both cases (for more details, see ERP Analyses Excluding 4 Participants from Behavioral Study in the Supplemental Material available online).</p>

<p>We assumed that the frequency of language use includes frequency of hearing and verbalizing math concepts.</p>

<p>These findings should be interpreted with caution in light of the debate over the necessity of a verbal code for processing digits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612446347">Campbell &amp; Clark, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612446347">Dehaene &amp; Cohen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0956797612446347">McCloskey, Marcuso, &amp; Whetstone, 1992</xref>). Scalp distributions for both the effects of correctness and relatedness on the N400 showed that words elicited a more widely distributed N400 response than digits did; the Format × Correctness × Anteriority and Format × Relatedness × Anteriority × Hemisphere interactions were both significant, <italic>F</italic>(2, 42) = 10.4, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .33, and <italic>F</italic>(2, 42) = 8.48, <italic>p</italic> = .008, η<sup>2</sup> = .29, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612446347">Fig. 1c</xref>). This finding suggests that words and digits rely on overlapping but nonidentical neural activity. In addition, latencies were 40 ms shorter for digits than for words (290–390 ms and 330–430 ms, respectively), <italic>F</italic>(2, 42) = 16.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612446347">Fig. 1b</xref>), whereas the opposite would be expected if digits required additional decoding and mapping than words did. These results suggest that arithmetic facts presented as digits can be processed without obligatory access to a verbal code.</p>
