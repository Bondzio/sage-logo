<p>In an impassioned call for the revitalisation of sociology, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741659012444432">Burawoy (2005)</xref> has argued for a reflexive discipline that deploys its energy beyond the enclaves of academics and experts. Superseding the perennial controversy between advocates of ‘scientific sociology’ and their critics who see in such ‘science’ methods without substance, he has expressed the view that the discipline should engage with the outside world, reaching beyond university, to enter into a dialogue with the public itself about fundamental values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741659012444432">Zussman and Misra, 2007</xref>). Public sociology includes a form of teaching that engages with the students’ own lives and experiences, helping them understand what made them who they are. Most importantly, it is a sociology that works in close connection with a visible, active public critiquing the present state of things and pursuing social change through collective action. Implicit here is an allusion to civil society, understood as an array of associations and movements that express autonomous needs and set up independent forms of organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741659012444432">Clawson et al., 2007</xref>). Public sociology seeks contentious actors and defends individuals and groups against dominant forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741659012444432">Touraine, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In the following pages a variety of opinions and observations about public sociology will be reviewed, before examining how criminology (as a branch of sociology) has reacted to the call to ‘go public’. Dilemmas, potential strengths and manifest weaknesses will emerge, mostly due to the peculiar disciplinary position of criminology, an area of enquiry which, by claiming improbable independence from sociology, is forced to neglect those very sociological concepts that would indeed make it more ‘public’.</p>

<title>Social Movement or Noisy Squabble?</title>
<p>The success of public sociology, it is argued, will not come from above, but from below.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It will come when public sociology captures the imagination of sociologists, when sociologists recognise public sociology as important in its own right with its own rewards, and when sociologists then carry it forward as a social movement beyond the academy. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741659012444432">Burawoy, 2005</xref>: 24)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This ambitious project may raise scepticism among those who believe that even the popular press is better equipped than sociology to stimulate public debate. On airport bookshelves and on TV one may well find more information about, and empathy with, deprived urban communities than in academic papers, books or reports. In this sense, the call for a more engaged public sociology may succeed in stirring a debate within the academy, but in the outside world the call is unlikely to leave an echo. A ‘noisy squabble entirely internal to professional sociology’, the public sociology advocated by Burawoy is seen as part and parcel of the petty politics of office-seeking inside the American Sociological Association, an occupational charade. In a personal attack, it is depicted as ‘the toy and the ploy of a repentant Marxist who, having renounced transforming the world and failed to transform the craft, uses his presidential bully-pulpit to try and change the profession’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741659012444432">Wacquant, 2011</xref>: 440). In a final lunge, Wacquant wonders how an academic who has never written a single essay for a non-academic journal and has never bothered to intervene in public debate in four decades of a distinguished career can see himself as a participant in a social movement.</p>
<p>In response, the very nature of sociology itself is mobilised, a discipline that is rooted in civil society, namely in the institutions, the organisations and the movements which operate outside the state and the market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741659012444432">Jeffries, 2010</xref>). State and market, it is argued, are destroying civil society and its autonomy, therefore they are destroying the basis of sociology. Defending civil society, thus, is ‘not only defending sociology, it’s also defending humanity against political tyranny and market despotism. The interests of sociologists coincide with that of the human race!’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741659012444432">Kalekin-Fishman, 2011</xref>: 595). Moreover, with the erosion of university autonomy, sociology is forced to engage with the society it studies:
<disp-quote>
<p>It will have to grapple with its place in the world, recognise its distinctive standpoint, and become ever more reflexive—shaped by, and at the same time shaping, the worlds it examines. (ibid: 596)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In brief, leaving aside the issue whether an academic discipline may realistically claim participation in a social movement, its strategy and role may well situate it in a position adjacent to actors and discourses aimed at social change. Four elements identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741659012444432">Burawoy, Chang and Fei-yu Hsieh (2010)</xref> appear to pinpoint how sociology can contribute to the construction of a global civil society. These are a professional, a public, a policy and a critical element or role. With the first, the discipline is required to produce theoretical knowledge on current social problems, while in its ‘public’ role it is expected to establish a dialogue with different actors and groups. The policy role is associated with the capacity to help communities define problems and identify solutions, while the critical element pertains to the ability to disclose the limits of official views and promote new values, ideas and practices.</p>
<p>Critics do not focus on public sociology as an aspect of internal ‘squabble’, let alone on its commitment to promote social change. Rather, it is observed, first, sociology cannot be public without taking a normative position. Second, to be public is to be in politics. And, third, ‘anyone who is or who is contemplating becoming a public sociologist must decide how far along the action chain he or she is willing to proceed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741659012444432">Etzioni, 2005</xref>: 373). On the other hand, it is legitimate to wonder how, after years of advanced ‘scientific’ research, endless seminars, self-centred careers and cut-throat competition with colleagues, sociologists are adept at making good political activists.</p>
<p>Public sociology encompasses many things, and critics see in all of these a background of false assumptions and patronising certainties. To promote one’s conception of social justice, to reveal the knowledge one believes one possesses, or to contend that sociological insight helps solve problems is tantamount to claiming a leadership no one suffering problems would dream of bestowing on academics. In short, public sociology
<disp-quote>
<p>assumes an unjustified moral superiority. It jeopardizes accomplishments of goals that would make sociology genuinely useful. It is somewhat dishonest in claiming more than can be delivered and in the process undermines sociological credibility. And it often patronizes those outside the profession. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741659012444432">Tittle, 2004</xref>: 1643)</p>

<title>Crime Talk and Public Criminology</title>
<p>It may be true that an analogous debate within criminology pre-dates Burawoy’s impassioned call, raising the question of academic criminology’s relationship to public policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741659012444432">Chancer and McLaughlin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741659012444432">Garland and Sparks, 2000</xref>). Such debate has attempted to move policies in more progressive directions, and to make the discipline an integral part of policy-making. ‘Criminologists have had to confront the embarrassing fact that in a society saturated with “crime talk”, they have utmost difficulty in communicating with politicians, policy makers, professionals and the public’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741659012444432">Chancer and McLaughlin, 2007</xref>: 157). Criminologists address the sources of their own ‘troubling marginality’, highlighting the powerful disincentives that operate within the discipline, ‘including the pressure to publish ever more narrow research in peer-reviewed journals at the expense of efforts at synthesis and dissemination’. Such marginality, however, is mainly found in the ‘distressingly little impact on the course of public policy toward crime and criminal justice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741659012444432">Currie, 2007</xref>: 175). A version of public criminology is ‘newsmaking criminology’, which refers to ‘the conscious efforts and activities of criminologists to interpret, influence or shape the representation of “newsworthy” items about crime and justice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741659012444432">Barak, 2007</xref>: 191).</p>
<p>A hypothetical cluster of themes that demand the engagement of public criminologists would include, for example, the growing rates of incarceration vis-a-vis the declining rates of offending. Another theme, surely, might revolve around the excessive cost of punishment when measured against its effectiveness. The public could be led to consider that the amount of unproductive resources squandered through the criminal justice system might be better invested in mending the social dysfunctions favouring the criminal choice. In this sense, the role of public criminology could be to ‘cool’ the heat in the popular and political discourse about crime and punishment and, most importantly, to direct attention towards the impunity of the elite, the crimes committed by powerful groups and individuals. Reframing cultural images of the criminal, in this respect, may prove essential, as would reconsidering the power relationships implicit in rule-making and the legal process as a whole. But how can public criminologists act as citizens in a participatory democracy and as professional social scientists simultaneously?</p>
<p>One response may lie in the choice of research questions made in dialogue with communities affected by crime and crime control, rather than determined by institutional funding bodies. Dissemination of findings, in this case, would not be limited to the professional community, but would attempt to access public forums, thus reducing ‘servility’, the chief pathological trait of academic research. The question remains how new are these ideas: is there not a rich history of public scholarship that lays the groundwork for today’s public criminology? On the one hand, one may argue that, throughout the last century, criminology researchers have attempted to empower communities and influence legislation by offering alternative visions and concrete examples that challenge conventional thinking on crime, justice and punishment. On the other hand, one may rejoice that criminology has failed to influence institutions and the public, as some of its tenets were (and are) embarrassing and fortunately they have been kept hidden. Some colleagues, therefore, may feel happy that the celebration of property crime as proletarian re-appropriation of wealth was never thoroughly disseminated. Personally, however, I am happier that realist criminology never made it into the public arena, with its prosaic analysis of taking crime (mainly conventional, street, crime) ‘seriously’, which even its disgraceful, natural interlocutor, New Labour, did not take seriously.</p>
<p>Advocates of public criminology stress that, historically, the discipline has been the domain of reformist intellectuals prepared to engage in discussions of social problems and interact with equally sensitive groups and individuals. Criminological knowledge, in this perspective, is deemed suitable for forging views, insinuating doubt, rejecting face-value assumptions about crime and control, and promoting fairer justice policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741659012444432">Loader and Sparks, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741659012444432">2011</xref>). The search for ‘windows of opportunity’ through which knowledge can pass to receptive groups and individuals is, therefore, instigated as if criminologists, ‘respectable, kind and useful’, were there, permanently pursuing any opportunity to help our societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741659012444432">Christie, 2011</xref>: 709). The calm, limited engagement proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741659012444432">Loader and Sparks (2010)</xref>, on the other hand, is interpreted as a message implying that ‘criminology might serve the public and the polity best by doing pretty much what it is already doing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741659012444432">Currie, 2011</xref>: 711). The ‘cultural workers’ of the abolitionist tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741659012444432">Ruggiero, 2010</xref>) are turned by Loader and Sparks into ‘democratic under-labourers’, devoted to the production of alternative knowledge and the cultivation of better policies. The notion that such alternative knowledge and better policies may be appreciated and met with the consent of the authorities, however, hides an unrealistic view of the political arena, where ‘crime policy, like other realms of social policy in our time, has been a battle waged by groups with often starkly opposing interests, wielding very different degrees of political power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741659012444432">Currie, 2011</xref>: 712). The elite, it is argued, is contemptuous of democracy, of ‘better policies’ and, for that matter, of knowledge itself. Contemporary ‘democratic politics’ is, in fact, the problem, a core factor ‘in the degradation of political institutions and in the perversion of the law and order debate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741659012444432">Sim, 2011</xref>: 724). How can the criminological ‘democratic under-labourer’ engage with a political process ‘steeped as it is in the turgid mire of such hypocritical cynicism—cynicism that is underpinned by the generalised pathology of chronic mendacity that prevails in modern capitalist culture?’ (ibid: 725).</p>
<p>In response to critics, advocates of public criminology may rightly contend that, while being a site of power struggle, politics is also an arena where conflicts are resolved and resources allocated, therefore making reform attempts worthwhile. This is a key point, the discussion of which may perhaps lead the debate towards a new direction. Such a discussion, however, cannot proceed without considering how criminology, traditionally, deals with the notion of conflict and other variables (i.e. resource allocation) triggering social change.</p>

<title>Fear and Change</title>
<p>There is an endogenous mechanism within the development of criminology as a discipline, more precisely as an ‘independent’ discipline, that makes its attempt to ‘go public’ extremely difficult. In order to claim its own scientific uniqueness, criminology has always been tempted to delimit its field of study, and often to distance itself from the very mother discipline that gave it birth. I am alluding to classical sociology and social theory, which contain conceptual traces of ‘social movement’, though such traces form a vague corollary to its central concern around conflict and social change. Often, both the concept of ‘movement’ and that of ‘change’ are hidden behind, and coalesce with, notions of instability and incumbent menace. Exclusive attention to the latter notions was part of the cost criminology had to pay for its ambition to independence. Disciplinary independence, in other words, grew out of the ambivalent nature of the social forces bringing change, their unpredictability and presumed irrationality. Ultimately, confronted with unprecedented industrial and urban development, criminology sustained its independence with what I would term a deep sociological ‘fear of living together’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741659012444432">Ruggiero, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741659012444432">2003</xref>). Concepts such as ‘social change’ and ‘collective action’ are less useful to the expansion of criminology than variables like ‘fear’ and ‘hell’. As a consequence, transitional zones and criminal areas became central scenes of enquiry, with the sociological gaze being diverted from more general conflicts. Let us remind ourselves that the major concerns of sociological theory in general have always been conflict, movements and social change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741659012444432">Durkheim (1960)</xref> explains how an unwanted division of labour in society leads to movements trying to modify that division of labour (right to combat). Of course, for a sociologist <italic>avant la lettre</italic> like Marx, conflict, movement and social change are the core, if not the exclusive issues, on which any theorising should be based. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741659012444432">Max Weber (1947)</xref> describes ‘class action’ and includes in his reasoning a crucial element of subjectivity: collective action requires not only a distinctly recognisable condition of social injustice, but also an awareness that such injustice is unacceptable, because based on an arbitrary distribution of resources and power. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741659012444432">Georg Simmel’s (1978)</xref> notion of fluidity and movement describes a feeling of dizziness but also one of perpetual change. In his <italic>Philosophy of Money</italic> one perceives a constant conflict between the objectivity of technological production and financial exchange and the subjectivity of individuals and groups making choices in their daily life. In brief, the founders of sociological thought are concerned with the variables and concepts which are central to the study of social movements. Criminology forgoes these concepts when claiming its academic and scientific independence. Its mission, not only among mainstream representatives of the discipline, consists in devising a mere social technology, one which can be applied in response to synchronic, immediate and urgent situations. This sense of urgency hinders the understanding of the historical dimensions of social action, while limiting the criminological horizon to immediate contingencies.</p>
<p>Public criminology encounters a similar Gordian knot: the more it talks about itself, the more it has to distance itself from social theories: even when ‘conflict’ and the ‘allocation of resources’ are brought into the equation, only risible conflicts can be addressed and negligible degrees of redistribution achieved. In this sense, the ‘arrogance’ detected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741659012444432">Tittle (2004)</xref> in public sociology denotes, in fact, most criminology, a discipline which needs ‘informants’ not peers, a type of social inquiry that needs to teach others in what contexts they are situated, which the others presumably ignore. Criminologists, Olympian observers, believe they can see the whole picture. ‘The excuse for occupying such a bird’s eye view is usually that scientists are doing reflexively what the informants are doing unwittingly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741659012444432">Latour, 2005</xref>: 33). Lack of proximity, in this context, makes criminology unaware of change, movement, of how individuals and groups shift from one form of association to another, in brief, how they engage in the reassembling of the collective. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741659012444432">Bauman (2011</xref>: 163) has contended, our objects of study are not dumb by nature, but in order to retain our status ‘and to secure the sovereign authority of our pronouncements, the objects to which our pronouncements refer need first to be made dumb’.</p>
<p>This ‘dumbness’ emerges even when re-reading the classical texts of new, radical criminology, where the topics of conflict and collective action constitute an extraordinary omission in the range of deviant acts and crimes which, allegedly, ‘contribute to human liberation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741659012444432">Taylor, Walton and Young, 1973</xref>). Therefore, while deviant hedonistic activity, vandalism (‘kicking back at a rejecting society’), forms of individual industrial sabotage (‘working at one’s pace’) (ibid: 271), and even ‘some sex crimes’ (sic!) are all included among the subjective choices to challenge ‘the social structure and the structure of power’, organised collective action is surprisingly excluded. The suspicion arises that such omission is due to the very organised nature of collective action, which may turn violent, and express too high a degree of subjectivity even for new criminologists to handle. In other words, when faced with socially vulnerable actors it is always possible for criminologists to attribute a degree of subjectivity to those actors and offer an interpretation of their conduct in the form of sympathy, whether or not those adopting such conduct explicitly request or welcome such sympathy. This is part of the propensity of some criminologists to study marginalised communities with a missionary zeal and a honeyed paternalism that derive from traditional philanthropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741659012444432">Ruggiero, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741659012444432">2006</xref>). Such criminologists need their objects of study more than the objects need them, and in the face of strong expressions of subjectivity, attributions of subjectivity from without become totally inappropriate. Ultimately, the only forms of political action with which the new criminologists seem analytically ‘comfortable’ are those embryonic forms of social dissent, or even those ‘unconscious’, ‘pre-political’ elements of contention that one could (naively?) read in conventional criminal acts. In this case, at least, criminologists can fulfil their mandate by unveiling the ‘conscious’ meaning behind such acts, while their role tends to wither away when consciously organised conducts prove that, at times, actors have nothing to learn from those interpreting them.</p>
<p>With new developments, for example the emergence of cultural criminology, little appears to change. Crime is located in everyday life, a site of drama, tragedy and joy, and it is captured as a holistic phenomenon, with ‘its adrenaline, its pleasure and panic, its excitement, and its anger, rage and humiliation, its desperation and its edgework’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741659012444432">Young, 2011</xref>: 84). But again, all of this describes ‘transgressive’ acts which remain pre-political in nature, while it is for criminologists to detect a latent subjectivity in those acting and a desire for social change of which the ‘dumb’ actors are not aware.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1741659012444432">
<title>Power as Social Movement</title>
<p>With the exception of the 1970s anti-psychiatric movement, formed by ordinary citizens, patients, their families and academic activists, I know only one criminological school which can claim to have always adopted a public stance. I am thinking of abolitionism, which is closer to public sociology than to the version of public criminology discussed above. The former focuses on collective actors and social movements, whereas the latter mainly addresses policy-makers, legislators and the media. Christie talks to serial killers and former concentration camp officers, Mathiesen spends as much time with students as he does with prisoners, while Hulsman is (was, sadly) engaged in practical experiments, meeting disputants in problematic situations, all individuals who are the protagonists within the domain of ‘crime and justice’ monopolised by experts. The sociology inspiring abolitionism, in brief, prioritises specific actors and their collective action that can bring change from below. In this way, abolitionism shares the views of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741659012444432">Touraine (1985)</xref>, who believes that by dealing with social movements, one is forced to deal with sociological thought as a whole: the notion of social movement does not describe part of reality, but is an element of a specific mode of looking at (or constructing) social reality. According to this perspective, sociological analysis should be organised less around the notions of society and social system than around that of social movement. Therefore, instead of analysing the social system as a set of norms and forms of organisation, the emphasis should be laid on the structural conflicts in a given society. In this approach, social actors are both culturally oriented and involved in structural conflicts. Sociology has always attempted to make sense of collective desires, as those for example expressed by social movements, and it is unlikely that it will survive as a discipline unless it continues to embody the ever-emerging ambitions of individuals organised in collective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741659012444432">Urry, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741659012444432">Pierre Bourdieu (2001)</xref> stresses that there is no meaningful change or even policy without movements capable of imposing such change or policy; hence the study of social processes and change coincides with that of social movements. To put the question in other terms, sociology survives best when it is engaged with public issues, and when it develops into social criticism. In this respect, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1741659012444432">Turner (2004)</xref> remarks that, without political and public commitments, sociology may turn into an esoteric, elitist and eccentric intellectual interest.</p>
<p>Something esoteric and elitist still remains in the description of ‘public criminology’ provided above, in that experts working in academia seem to seek the help of experts working in adjacent areas and, while begging for their benevolence, try to improve the lives of others, namely non-expert actors. This ‘plea to be nice’ addressed to policy-makers displays yet another element of what earlier I have described as missionary and paternalistic criminology, which is prepared to stand by the underdogs as far as they remain such. This type of criminology echoes the call for <italic>clementia</italic> that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741659012444432">Seneca (2009)</xref> addressed to Nero, elevating clemency (not justice) as the ruler’s cardinal virtue. Seneca supported autocracy as a virtuous form of government, and clemency, namely the capacity to grant mercy or pardon, as the prime prerogative of autocrats. Abolitionists, instead, seem aware that disadvantaged people have to find their own way of articulating their experiences of injustice and expressing their need for recognition. Academics acting as mere ‘mediators’ between the socially excluded and the authorities perpetuate the ‘mechanism of dominance’ enacted through the expropriation of speech. Unwittingly, such mediators may ‘destroy the communicative infrastructure that constitutes the basis for a cooperative mobilisation and elaboration of feelings of injustice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741659012444432">Honneth, 2007</xref>: 88).</p>
<p>Abolitionism does not address the powerful with ‘pleas to be nice’, because such pleas would give them a clear monopoly over the power to pardon. As this power solidifies, disadvantaged actors might grow accustomed to interpreting their deeds as exclusive outcomes of their individual decisions, rather than the result of collective, social, conditions. They might even get accustomed to the notion that, while being pardoned, they themselves are required to pardon the groups and the mechanisms responsible for the conditions in which they live. According to what is termed the ‘capability approach’, focused on what people are actually able to do and to be, every individual should be above an established threshold making them truly function as humans and citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741659012444432">Nussbaum, 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741659012444432">2000b</xref>). Abolitionism fights alongside individuals who are situated below this threshold.</p>
<p>Public criminology as practised by abolitionism posits academic work as intellectual activism, as a form of cultural work engaged in a social conflict. Abolitionists are not scared away from the notion of conflict; in fact they believe that conflict is a precious resource and has to be nurtured and cherished. In this way, they echo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741659012444432">Georg Simmel (1971)</xref>, for whom conflict is a fundamental experience leading to socialisation. As for knowledge, abolitionists would argue that it is not only a question of ‘windows of opportunity’ through which knowledge is transmitted to receptive groups. It is also constituted by a number of tools, experiences and repertoires of action that help people engaged in conflict. The research-action advocated by Thomas Mathiesen is an example: his involvement with groups of prisoners aims to produce knowledge that can be of use in their struggles for reform.</p>
<p>An example which may explain the abolitionist notions of knowledge and conflict simultaneously is found in some variants of restorative justice that are particularly congruent with the abolitionist project. As Nils Christie has noted, restorative justice cannot simply ‘restore’ the conditions prior to the emergence of the problematic situation. Something, at the same time, has to change. Some conflicts may find resolution when the parties involved engage in dialogue, so that information and knowledge are exchanged and the precise contours of what happened is clarified. At times, the disputants may discover that their social condition and their expectations are similar and that it is in their mutual interest to coexist peacefully. At other times the parties may ‘humanise’ each other, with the offender recognising in the victim a unique, inviolable, human being, and the victim finding the offender an ordinary, even pleasant, fellow being. In ideal situations, both may join forces to pursue common ends, namely seeking to change the similar social condition in which they live. There are, however, other cases in which such harmonious resolution of conflicts is impossible, particularly when there is little similarity in socioeconomic terms between the parties involved. Such conflicts will inevitably return into the arena from which they arose, that is, in the unequal society where access to resources is contested, negotiated and fought for. Conflicts may be precious, as abolitionism contends, not because they help us resolve trouble, but because they can be used to pave the way for social change. Ultimately, abolitionism itself can be precious as a component of a social movement (as Buroway suggests) and as a form of public sociology.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the reluctance of academics to ‘go along the action chain’ (see Etzioni above) may be tempered through the recognition that mainstream academics are themselves well connected in this chain and engaged in a social movement. In this respect, it is useful to adopt the following concise definition: a social movement consists of an informal network of groups and individuals engaged in conflict which produces and is produced by collective identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741659012444432">Diani, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741659012444432">Ruggiero and Montagna, 2008</xref>). Are we sure that ‘scientific’ inquiry itself is so neutral, that it is not involved in a social movement? Surely, mainstream criminology is constituted by an informal network of groups and individuals engaged in a conflict against the powerless, for the perpetuation of the status quo and the exacerbation of social injustice, a conflict which produces and is produced by a specific, dominant, sectarian, collective identity.</p>
