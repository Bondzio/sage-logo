<abstract>
<p><bold>Objective</bold>: To evaluate a pilot trial of a postdischarge physiotherapy intervention to improve patient function versus usual physiotherapy in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty aiming to assess: recruitment rate, feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and control, suitability of outcomes, retention and adverse events and to inform sample size calculation for a definitive trial.</p>
<p><bold>Design</bold>: Exploratory pilot randomized controlled trial using independent assessment.</p>
<p><bold>Setting</bold>: Mixed urban and rural, UK.</p>
<p><bold>Participants</bold>: Patients undergoing primary, elective unilateral knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis.</p>
<p><bold>Intervention</bold>: Two additional home physiotherapy visits of functional weight-bearing exercises, functional task-specific training versus treatment as usual.</p>
<p><bold>Main outcome</bold>: Oxford Knee Score at 12 months. Secondary outcomes: completion rates, adverse events, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, leg extensor power, timed 10-m walk, timed sit-to-stand, resource use diaries. Assessments completed at baseline (pre-operatively), 3, 6 and 12 months.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Of 181 eligible participants 107 (59.1%) were randomized over 13 months, one participant withdrew, no adverse events. Intervention group <italic>n</italic> = 56 (mean age 67.8), control group <italic>n</italic> = 51 (mean age 70.8). The difference in mean change of Oxford Knee Scores between groups (intervention – control) at 12 months was 0.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) –3.8, 4.2), <italic>P</italic> = 0.94. Patient diaries revealed non-trial additional physiotherapy requires improved measurement.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Successful recruitment and retention rates were achieved. The intervention appeared feasible and acceptable but may be suboptimal in intensity given recent research. A sample size of 1271 participants would be required for a fully powered randomized controlled trial using the main outcome. However new outcomes, potentially of greater validity and responsiveness, require consideration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is estimated that osteoarthritis of the knee joint results in disabling knee symptoms in 10% of people over 55.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511427749">1</xref></sup> Total knee arthroplasty is a common procedure for patients with severe symptomatic knee osteoarthritis who have not responded satisfactorily to other treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511427749">2</xref></sup> Recent figures suggest around 86 852 primary total knee arthroplasties take place in the UK per year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511427749">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511427749">4</xref></sup> (R Stewart DHSSPSNI, personal communication, 6 January 2009). While total knee arthroplasty is generally considered an effective intervention to improve pain and function, 15–30% of patients experience continuing problems, in terms of pain, impairment and functional limitations post operatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511427749">5</xref></sup> In addition, patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty experience substantial functional impairment when compared with age- and gender-matched peers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511427749">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Physiotherapy is a traditional component of postoperative patient care following total knee arthroplasty, with early mobilization generally promoted as the ‘gold standard’ approach for the achievement of functional mobility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511427749">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511427749">8</xref></sup> Inpatient rehabilitation includes gait re-education and exercises and concentrates on achieving sufficient functional independence for discharge and on improving knee range of motion and muscle strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511427749">8</xref></sup> Following discharge, although physiotherapists consistently provide gait retraining and exercise prescription,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511427749">8</xref></sup> wide variation exists in the amount and type of physiotherapy provided to patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511427749">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511427749">10</xref></sup> In the UK there is an increasing emphasis on decreased length of hospital stay and moving towards enhanced recovery programmes for knee arthroplasty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511427749">11</xref></sup> The adoption and evaluation of brief interventions, for example brief pain management programmes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511427749">12</xref></sup> raises the question whether a brief intervention following discharge from hospital would be more effective in terms of improving patient function than current NHS rehabilitation.</p>
<p>The lack of evidence regarding the type, duration, dosage, timing and intensity of physiotherapy required to benefit patients following discharge after total knee arthroplasty is known: recent systematic and Cochrane reviews, exploring the effectiveness of postdischarge physiotherapy exercise and multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes following total knee arthroplasty confirm the need for high-quality trials to provide evidence for the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of rehabilitation following total knee arthroplasty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511427749">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511427749">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aims of this exploratory trial were to test the feasibility and acceptability of providing a brief intervention in a UK trial, given the wide variation within current practice, to assess the suitability of outcome measures for a future trial, to assess recruitment, retention and adverse event rates and to inform future sample size calculation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269215511427749" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The design of the study is an exploratory single blind (outcome assessment) randomized clinical trial (Oxford Local Research Ethics Committee approval AQREC No: A03.018). Trial Registration: International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register ISRCTN07624314. The study took place within the community of Oxfordshire (UK).</p>
<p>Patients undergoing elective primary total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis in one UK specialist orthopaedic centre and residing within Oxfordshire were eligible to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria included: bilateral arthroplasty, planned unicompartmental prosthesis, minimally invasive surgery, planned further joint surgery within 12 months, inflammatory arthritis, existing comorbidities preventing participation in treatment and inability to provide informed consent.</p>
<p>Sample size calculations were both inappropriate and not possible for this exploratory feasibility trial. The study aimed to provide information to enable future calculations to be performed. Hospital data regarding patient throughput indicated that 100 patients would be a realistic sample size to achieve within the available funding resources and timescale of the study.</p>
<p>Consecutive eligible patients were invited to participate prior to attending the hospital’s preoperative admission clinic. Baseline assessments occurred following clinic. Randomization was independently performed using random permuted blocks (block size of 10) and transferred to a sequence of sealed, opaque envelopes used in strict consecutive order. Envelopes were given to patients following baseline assessment by their assessor. Patients opened, resealed and returned their envelopes with the trial coordinator (CJML) arranging treatment delivery. Patients were asked to conceal group allocation during subsequent assessments and blind outcome assessment procedures were employed and assessed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511427749">15</xref></sup> Following surgery, all patients received inpatient physiotherapy including an advice booklet with non-weight-bearing exercises to regain movement plus exercises: isometric quadriceps contractions, inner range quadriceps with rolled towel under knee, knee flexion in supine, knee flexion and extension in sitting, sit-to-stand, placing operated foot onto a step and off again.</p>
<p>Patients were discharged when medically stable and sufficiently mobile based on standardized care pathway criteria of independent ambulation, achieving 90 degrees knee flexion and ability to perform independent personal care. Patients attended the department for 3- and 12-month research follow-up. All assessments were performed by an independent assessor blinded to group allocation. Six-month follow-up data were obtained via postal questionnaire. The primary end-point was 12 months. Patient resource use diaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511427749">16</xref></sup> enabled participants to record any additional non-trial physiotherapy received during the study.</p>
<p>The primary outcome was the Oxford Knee Score which measures function and pain following total knee arthroplasty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511427749">17</xref></sup> This self-administered 12-item questionnaire rates the difficulty and pain associated with performing activities of daily living (score range 0–48, highest denoting the best outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511427749">18</xref></sup> Secondary outcomes included the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0269215511427749" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score: This is a self-report outcome evaluation after knee injuries, including osteoarthritis, consisting of 42 items in five subscales, symptoms, pain, function in daily living, function in sport and recreation and knee related quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511427749">19</xref></sup> Subscales are scored separately and transformed to a 0 (extreme knee problems) to 100 (no knee problems) percentage score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511427749">19</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Leg extensor power: The generation of adequate power is required to successfully achieve functional tasks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511427749">20</xref></sup> The leg extensor press, measuring leg extensor power, has been strongly associated with functional activities, such as stair climbing, in the elderly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511427749">21</xref></sup> The highest recorded power value (in watts) for each participant, obtained from up to 10 repetitions, is reported in W/kg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511427749">21</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The timed sit-to-stand test (STS): This is an objective functional measure of strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511427749">22</xref></sup> correlating with ambulatory independence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511427749">23</xref></sup> The number of completed sit-to-stands (arms folded) in 30 seconds was recorded.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The 10-metre timed walk test (in seconds): This measures functional physical activity in the elderly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215511427749">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215511427749">25</xref></sup> To ensure patient safety in the immediate postoperative period, patients were asked to walk at a normal comfortable speed rather than their maximum.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The home visit intervention for the trial was developed using a systematic review,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511427749">13</xref></sup> the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215511427749">26</xref></sup> the Medical Research Council’s Framework for the Development and Evaluation of RCTs for Complex Interventions to Improve Health,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511427749">27</xref></sup> and an iterative consensus approach incorporating opinions of clinical, lay and research people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511427749">28</xref></sup> The intervention included two postdischarge home visits (within two weeks, then 6–8 weeks of discharge). During visits the physiotherapist assessed participant’s function and progressed their rehabilitation; including gait re-education, progression/removal of walking aids, plus the following exercises: weight shifts (progressing to single-legged standing balance, progressing to eyes closed if appropriate), partial knee bends/quarter squats, standing knee flexion and extension ‘wall sits’, bilateral heel raises (progressing to unilateral), knee raises (with alternate arm raises), step overs (alternate leading leg), achilles and soleus stretches in standing, quadriceps stretch in prone lying/standing (as able). (Note: Sit-to-stand and step ups, also commonly used,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511427749">13</xref></sup> plus hamstrings stretches, were already included in the inpatient information booklet provided to all participants.) Repetition rate, frequency and progression of exercises were left to the physiotherapist’s discretion. Ideally, patients initally aimed for five repetitions of stretches with 5-second ‘holds’ and 10 repetitions of all other exercises twice daily for at least three months. Task training, identified from six-month postoperative Oxford Knee Score responses obtained in previous research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511427749">17</xref></sup> was included: getting in/out of a car, getting up from a chair at a table, walking outside and stairs. Participants were asked about activity limitations and participation restrictions and these were included and addressed where possible/appropriate. Any individual patient concerns were answered/addressed.</p>
<p>Physiotherapists completed case report forms recording visit duration (minutes), estimated time (minutes) spent upon each element of the intervention, any additional treatment components and patient concerns; as previously used to check protocol adherence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215511427749">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>The control group patients received the usual physiotherapy treatment provided at the hospital without additional home visits. All patients received similar inpatient rehabilitation and were provided with the same booklet which provided advice about gait re-education and performing stairs as well as an advised 10–15 minutes of exercises daily for at least three months. Bed exercises were static quadriceps contractions, inner range quadriceps contractions and knee flexion. Standing exercises were knee flexion and placing the operated foot on to a step and off again. Sitting exercises were knee extension (with hamstring stretch) and sit to stand. Repetition rate was at the ward physiotherapist’s discretion. Although patients are not routinely referred for outpatient physiotherapy following discharge, each patient has a discharge plan and may be referred if slow to progress during inpatient stay. Patients are reviewed six weeks post operatively by their surgical team and seen by an extended scope practitioner physiotherapist who initiates outpatient physiotherapy if a patient is not achieving their expected recovery targets (20% of patients).</p>
<p>Recruitment and retention numbers were described. Self-reported complications, additional comorbidities and additional lower limb arthroplasty procedures occurring throughout the trial period were described and their frequencies presented to inform sample size calculation. Baseline characteristics were described for each group. An intention-to-treat analysis approach was used. Because of the pilot nature of this trial, formal statistical hypothesis test results are inappropriate. Instead, group mean/median change scores for outcomes within the two groups, and differences in mean/median change scores between the two arms, from baseline to each follow-up point were calculated with 95% confidence intervals for outcomes which were successfully completed and judged suitable for future use in a phase III trial (SPSS version 18, Minitab version 16; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p>

<p>The pilot trial was not intended or powered to demonstrate treatment effect. As planned, the data from this pilot trial was used to calculate sample sizes needed for a definitive trial for those outcomes considered suitable for future use. Based upon a minimal clinical difference of 2.5 for the primary outcome variable of the Oxford Knee Score (score 0–48), SD of 8.9 and standardized difference of 0.28, 521 patients per arm would be required to achieve 90% power and 0.05 level of significance. Using other outcome variables to calculate sample size for the timed walking test, based on a minimal clinical difference of 0.17 m/s, over 1000 patients per arm would be required to achieve 90% power and 0.05 level of significance. Lack of available information regarding the minimal clinical difference for this population prevented a sample size calculation being undertaken for sit-to-stand. Loss to follow-up was not an issue in this trial but the calculated sample size needs to be increased by 22%, to <italic>n =</italic> 1271, to allow for patients not undergoing surgery within the recruitment time, patients undergoing unexpected unicompartmental arthroplasties and further unanticipated lower limb arthroplasty.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This pilot trial successfully tested the feasibility and acceptability of providing a new brief intervention designed to improve patients’ function following discharge following total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis. Sample size calculations, using Oxford Knee Score data, calculated that 1271 participants would be required to evaluate the intervention in a future definitive trial.</p>
<p>Recruitment to the trial was successful and good trial retention rates were achieved. Twenty-seven (43%) patients declining to participate spontaneously stated that transport/parking issues/hospital attendance, rather than reluctance/unwillingness to participate in the intervention, were their prime reason for refusal. In addition, 12% (12/98) of participants were unwilling/unable to attend for final follow-up and were only retained in the trial by the utilization of postal/telephone follow-up. Only one person withdrew from the study. Reluctance to attend for follow-up cannot be underestimated; loss to follow-up at 12 months in one physiotherapy feasibility trial was nearly 50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215511427749">30</xref></sup> It is believed that the self-report Oxford Knee Score contributed to effective follow-up since participants appeared less willing to attend for face-to-face follow-ups over time. The inclusion of non-hospital-based assessments is therefore recommended in a future phase III trial. Successful blind outcome assessment was achieved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511427749">15</xref></sup> All allocation envelopes were used in their correct sequence but for a large trial independent computerized randomization would be used in future.</p>
<p>The mean ages and body mass index classifications are considered typical for total knee arthroplasty patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511427749">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215511427749">31</xref></sup> Baseline functional comorbidity means appear low when, by having osteoarthritis which is included in the index, all participants had minimum score of one point.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215511427749">32</xref></sup> Knee joint ranges of motion (operated leg) were similar for both groups. Final extension range exceeded normal range extension limitations in this age group but was less than the 5 degrees generally considered a fixed flexion contracture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215511427749">33</xref></sup> Final knee flexion was slightly above the 105 degrees optimal postoperative range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511427749">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Case form content, as previously,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215511427749">29</xref></sup> revealed successful adherence to the intervention protocol. All patients received the intended treatment content. The intervention was judged feasible to deliver and acceptable to the participating physiotherapists and patients.</p>
<p>The Oxford Knee Score was found, as previously,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215511427749">34</xref></sup> to be easy to complete but mainly measures impairment and not participation restriction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269215511427749">35</xref></sup> As participation restriction was included in the trial, the Oxford Knee Score’s inability to measure this aspect means scores are less likely to have shown an intervention treatment effect. New research measures, appearing highly appropriate, are now available reflecting all three of the main International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health components of impairment, activity limitation and participation restriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269215511427749">36</xref></sup> and measuring osteoarthritis pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269215511427749">37</xref></sup> These newer measures may prove more suitable for rehabilitation trials than the Oxford Knee Score and raise the possibility of less expensive trials with smaller numbers than the 1271 participants calculated during this study.</p>
<p>With regard to the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, many participants commented adversely regarding questionnaire length. Completion was generally good bar the sports and recreation subscale which, as previously,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269215511427749">38</xref></sup> fewer than half the participants completed at most time timepoints. Participants said the questions were inappropriate. The measure would not be included in the phase III trial.</p>
<p>Leg extensor power means obtained at three months were similar to previous total knee arthroplasty research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269215511427749">39</xref></sup> but below the average values for the corresponding 65–74 age group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511427749">20</xref></sup> Thirty-one per cent (34/107) of participants were either unable/unwilling to undergo leg extensor press measurement or provided fewer repetitions than desired; predominantly due to pain and/or anxiety. This measurement tool lacks portability, requiring hospital follow-up. Flexible follow-up is considered more important to a future trial than this measure, especially since it moderately correlated with sit-to-stand at baseline (Spearman’s rho = 0.329, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01) and strongly correlated at 12 months (Spearman’s rho = 0.550, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01).</p>
<p>Observationally, as previously, total knee arthroplasty patients found sit-to-stand difficult, compensating by taking more weight through the non-affected side and/or increasing forward leaning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269215511427749">40</xref></sup> However, the timed sit-to-stand version, instead of the time taken to perform a specific number of repetitions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269215511427749">41</xref></sup> meant all participants undergoing objective testing were able to provide scores. Again, the means reflect the poorer functioning of this group compared to their non-total knee arthroplasty peers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269215511427749">42</xref></sup> The measure is considered suitable for future use.</p>
<p>The 10-m timed walk test could be completed by all patients attending final hospital follow-up, is portable and could be performed in any follow-up setting. The outcome assessors spoke of the seemingly high face validity of the test; participants appeared to strongly agree that measuring walking was meaningful.</p>
<p>This is an early exploratory trial and was not intended to provide a definitive answer regarding the effectiveness of physiotherapy following total knee arthroplasty. While new pilot research indicates that delayed balance exercise programmes may improve function,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269215511427749">43</xref></sup> the lack of information remains concerning physiotherapy dosage, timing, intensity and content following total knee arthroplasty that was highlighted in 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511427749">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interestingly, although equal at baseline, the groups did not remain similar post randomization. The majority of serious comorbidities that developed during the trial affected the intervention group. These comorbidities are considered unlikely to be related to physiotherapy treatment. The intervention group experienced more postoperative complications likely to affect outcome. Again these self-reported complications (such as intra-operative fracture, pulmonary embolus, deep vein thrombosis, stroke and infection) did not appear physiotherapy intervention related. Eleven patients subsequently underwent further lower limb arthroplasty, eight in the intervention group, and such surgery was likely to impact upon their outcome measures. The trial was not designed to statistically evaluate whether issues such as these masked any treatment effect.</p>
<p>Although feasible, concern is now present regarding the intervention’s intensity following recent debate that many exercise programmes lack adequate intensity to lead to optimal recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269215511427749">44</xref></sup> The intervention was deliberately designed to be a brief intervention, feasible for the NHS to consider funding in the event of the intervention proving effective. It is recognized that the content of the pilot intervention may be suboptimal in the light of recent research. Internationally, where different healthcare systems and funding systems allow much greater doses of physiotherapy to be provided, research indicates that 12–18 hours of physiotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269215511427749">45</xref></sup> or a mean of 17 visits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269215511427749">46</xref></sup> may be needed to produce benefit. These dosages appear well beyond those delivered, or able to be delivered, to patients within the UK NHS healthcare system at the current time.</p>
<p>In addition, the information from the patient resource use diaries was of limited value and requires improvement. More physiotherapy contacts were recorded by the treatment-as-usual group (<italic>n</italic> = 119, intervention <italic>n</italic> = 93). However, this number of contacts is conservative because it became apparent that participants were recording both research and clinical follow-ups. All visit dates were checked and physiotherapy visits occurring on hospital follow-up dates were removed to prevent duplication. Some people may have received clinical physiotherapy on the same date as attending research follow-up and these visits will not have been captured for analysis. In addition, not all diaries captured the true extent of additional physiotherapy; for example one participant recorded a 7-day intensive rehabilitation programme but the number of sessions or time spent with physiotherapists was not recorded. Therefore the data demonstrated the need to record non-trial additional physiotherapy but it shows that the diary questions require modification to provide a clearer picture of additional care.</p>
<p>There remains an evident need for further trials exploring rehabilitation for this large patient group. This pilot trial successfully recruited 107 patients and provided data to inform sample size. It indicates the potential value of employing flexible follow-up strategies to maximize recruitment and retention to trials and thus enhance the generalizability of future findings. It refined the choice of suitable outcomes and identified necessary modifications to the patient diary. While the trial has informed the design of a future trial, concerns regarding the intensity of the intervention must be addressed prior to a much needed phase III trial to determine whether rehabilitation costs are worth while in terms of benefit to patients and acceptability to funders of healthcare.</p>
