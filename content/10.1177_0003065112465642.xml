<body>
<p>Félix Velasco-Alva begins his book on an integrative approach to treating couples by noting that the theory and practice of couples therapy tends to fall into two broad models, one based on systems theory and the other on psychoanalysis. According to Velasco-Alva, because this field comprises biological, social, intrapsychic, and interactional phenomena, an integrative model is needed. Thus, his interest in systems theory has led him to find in constructivisim a point of contact with psychoanalysis. In this original contribution, Velasco-Alva proposes a new model for working with couples, which he calls “The Psychodynamic-Constructivist Model, with an Intersubjective Focus.”</p>
<p>A word on the title is warranted: this book is anything but a simple treatment manual. Readers will find here Velasco-Alva’s rich integration of advances in intersubjectivist and constructivist approaches in psychoanalysis and related therapies. His work concentrates on demonstrating the value of these lines of thinking in working psychoanalytically with families and couples, where the “history of the therapist, as well as of the couple, opens a space for the construction of new worlds and the deconstruction of others, permitting the co-constructing of contexts that expand affective, cognitive, and action territories” (Castañon, preface in Velasco-Alva 2004, p. xii; all translations mine). Intersubjectivity may be broadly defined as “the reciprocal influence of the conscious and unconscious subjectivities of two people in a relationship” and as such forms “the basic process of psychotherapy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003065112465642">Natterson and Friedman 1995</xref>, p. 1). In the constructivist view, objective truth cannot exist independently of the observer, who always plays a role in what he or she observes, thus constructing it. Clinically, patient and therapist construct each other’s experience in a way that the therapist’s awareness of his subjective involvement is crucial to understanding the patient. Emphasizing the importance of the therapist’s own therapy as part of his specialized training, Velasco-Alva describes how the clinician’s flexibility and profound self-knowledge are needed to access the self as an instrument of intervention and understanding. As he sees it, couples come into treatment asking the same question the therapist faces in his own life: How does one live with someone and remain one’s self?</p>
<p>The psychoanalytically informed clinician interested in working with couples within a constructivist framework will find in this manual a valuable resource in both the conceptual and practical realms. It is divided into three main sections: theoretical, technical, and clinical. There is a helpful glossary containing concise definitions of vague analytic concepts (e.g., <italic>self</italic>), as well as esoteric philosophical ones (e.g., <italic>first-</italic> and <italic>second-order cybernetics</italic>) closely tied to systems theory. I found the illustrative charts and figures dispersed throughout the book to be similarly indispensable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0003065112465642">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>I will not delve too deeply into the history of intersubjectivist and constructivist thinking in psychotherapy, both because I would not do justice to Velasco-Alva’s thoughtful and concise treatment of these themes and their complicated nuances, and because I want to devote as much space as possible to his technical approach. However, a review of some of the author’s ideas on the relationship between constructivist thinking and psychoanalysis—in the end this is a psychoanalytic book more than anything else—is warranted, as their similarity may not be as self-evident to the reader as it is for Velasco-Alva. While he is writing specifically about couples treatment, he is also making a general case for the constructivist roots of psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>The chapter on constructivism, midway through the book, is perhaps the most helpful in placing constructivism in historical context, outlining its relation to contemporary thought and psychotherapy specifically. Constructivist thinking posits that reality is multiple and diverse, not uniform and monolithic, and requires interpretation and construction. This of course is one of the central tenets of the postmodern project, which the author describes in relation to the modernism that characterized thinking and cultural life from the renaissance to the present-day crisis of modernity. A review of how postmodernism arose (beginning in the latter half of the last century and overlapping with the final stages of modernity) spontaneously, atheoretically, and in response to disillusionment with modernist convictions such as unity, uniformity, and democracy, takes the reader to cybernetics and social constructivism. These currents share a certain loss of belief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065112465642">Lyotard 1979</xref>), leading to the uncertainty and crisis that characterize our times: “we don’t know what is happening to us, and that is what is happening to us” (Ortega y Gasset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003065112465642">1930</xref>). This chapter is thoughtful and gives the reader a taste of the thinking of such notable Mexican intellectuals as Octavio Paz and Carlos Fuentes.</p>
<p>Social constructivism connects with psychotherapy through the works of Maturana and Varela, Kenneth Gergen, and George Kelly, among many others. Biological and social constructivism share a rejection of the modernist conception of a real, objective, and knowable world. However, while in the former the human nervous system is a closed circuit and perceptions and constructions, though instigated from without, ultimately originate from within, in the latter ideas, concepts, and memories arise from social interaction and are mediated by language. Meaning and knowledge, then, are communal constructions. We move through the world and construct our ideas about it in our conversations with others. Thus, the relation replaces the individual as the locus of knowledge. Velasco-Alva weaves together these two different, yet intimately connected perspectives into a coherent, clinically viable point of view.</p>
<p>Clinical work is a place where these ideas, and constructivism in general, open myriad possibilities as yet unexplored. Velasco-Alva concedes a need for building more bridges between theoretical conceptions and clinical problems, including clarifying and translating much of the theoretical language. He effectively describes how the therapist’s relinquishing of his cognitive and experiential superiority allows for the participation of his own internal world and its maps as first-line elements in the construction of the therapeutic process and a new reality. It ceases to be important for the therapist to ask himself about the reality he encounters; rather, the real question becomes, In what sense can he promote the generation of alternative, less restrictive realities?</p>
<p>Using a systems approach, Velasco-Alva describes the evolution of the couples therapist as having gone through three distinct phases: the therapist as one who <italic>reacts</italic> and can be influenced by his own family of origin, to one who also <italic>describes</italic> and <italic>modifies</italic> systems,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0003065112465642">2</xref></sup> to one who considers his role as <italic>co-constructor</italic> of a system along with the couple.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0003065112465642">3</xref></sup> It is in this last phase of the therapist’s evolution that Velasco-Alva sees constructivist thinking as aligning itself with intersubjectivity and thus with recent developments in psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>Velasco-Alva emphasizes the internal world of the therapist as he or she interacts with the couple. Thus, he views the interaction between the couple, as well as between both of them together and separately with the therapist, as comprising mutual projective identifications of self- and object representations that confirm or destabilize individual identities and self-esteem. Marital conflict is the current scenario of past conflicts, and the therapist enters this intersubjective field as a new player. As a full player, he is no longer limited to observing but participates. The social-constructivist perspective the author espouses posits that once treatment begins the couple does not exist independently of the therapist, and that each of the three individuals reads the other from within his or her own perspective. The fundamental contribution of this paradigm is the importance it attributes to the role of the therapist in determining the experience of the couple/patient in the relationship. Velasco-Alva mentions Robert Langs’s observation that therapy is less a projection onto a blank screen than it is a transaction.</p>
<p>How Velasco-Alva uses an intersubjective lens to craft his interventions comes across most clearly in his case discussions. For example, with Isabel and Antonio, understanding that Isabel’s seemingly arbitrary and demanding behavior reminded him of his ex-wife allowed him to recognize that he had been siding with Antonio in the sessions. It is easy to miss the importance of an insight like this, seemingly typical of this work. It is only after this couple “forgets” to appear for a session that the analyst, using the hour to reflect on his own participation, is able to access this part of his unconscious participation and can now see how it is that Isabel’s transference, while remaining her repetition, is also to a significant degree responding to his rejection of her. Because this type of couples work is located in the here and now and far from the analysis of the intrapsychic processes of the couple, the analyst promotes “a mutual and collaborative examination of the nature of the relation between the couple and himself, and the interactional patterns that arise” (pp. 48–49). The couple, on the verge of quitting the treatment and getting a divorce, were now encouraged to express their negative feelings toward the therapist.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0003065112465642">4</xref></sup> Having already engaged in his own self-analysis, the therapist was able to analyze with the couple their ambivalence and how they displaced their impotence and fear onto him, whom they now held responsible for their wanting a divorce. It was Velasco-Alva’s reflection on his involvement in the couple’s predicament that allowed him to accompany them empathically.</p>
<p>Notably, in this case there is no self-disclosure, and, in my reading, this is where the author is different from many contemporary intersubjectivist analysts today who rely heavily on it. Perhaps it’s a subtle shift of emphasis that I am noting, as, to be sure, Velasco-Alva does self-disclose in other interventions reported in the book. However, I think that for him what matters in the therapeutic use of self-reflection and the clinical fact of intersubjectivity is, on one level, an increased awareness of how countertransference may cloud the therapist’s ability to resonate empathically with the patient and, on another level, the ability to <italic>change</italic> with the patient/couple. This means a thorough and constant process of self-analysis and, I think, of self-cure, understood as never ending, that keeps the analyst in constant touch with his or her deepest conflicts and continuous sources of pain as well as of knowledge.</p>
<p>When discussing his technical framework, Velasco-Alva encourages therapists to allow themselves to become part of the system formed by the couple. From the moment of the first interview, he is asking himself what it feels like to be a member of this system. The interviewer is always functioning on three levels: on one paying attention to what is happening between the couple; at a second level allowing for reverie, registering thoughts, feelings, and fantasies in response to the couple’s verbal and nonverbal material; and at yet another level analyzing the interactions between all members. In this manual that is not exactly a manual, he recommends that the clinician not follow a pre-set structure or format that might block the formation of spontaneous constructions. The interviewer’s attitude should remain a balanced mix between negative capability and an active approach with frequent questioning, focusing, and direction of attention to important themes. For example, Velasco-Alva does not take a formal history but allows it to emerge spontaneously as the sessions proceed, with the couple associating naturally to their narratives and the therapist examining his internal responses.</p>
<p>Velasco-Alva holds firmly to the systems idea that problems within a couple comprise interplays of distorted communications that slowly become permanent and result in homeostasis. Psychoanalytically, he thinks that the best way to approach this problem is through a close examination by the members of their transferential reactions and defensive maneuvers vis-à-vis each other and the therapist. The intersubjective focus means that transference and countertransference are the manifestation of the encounter between three subjectivities. A triadic system develops as the therapy proceeds, and the therapist’s internal experience becomes a rich source for understanding his own contribution. Working in this manner means managing the intense intersubjective interactions unfolding between the three participants, eventually giving rise to a new narrative. These interactions are often revealed through nonverbal communications, gestures, or attitudes. For Velasco-Alva mutative interpretations are focused on the <italic>dual</italic> transference, as opposed to primary or secondary transferences,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0003065112465642">5</xref></sup> whereby the couple share the same experience as the therapist and attribute a specific role to him. Despite the dense theory that frames Velasco-Alva’s clinical approach, he does not shy away from offering specific practical suggestions, and a chapter is devoted to issues such as motivating effective communication while avoiding such common phenomena as one spouse’s presuming to interpret the unconscious of the other. How to listen to the other is broken down in clear demonstrable steps, as are the types of questions the therapist should ask or ways of avoiding destructive acting out. The reader will find psychoeducation an implicit aspect of Velasco-Alva’s approach.</p>
<p>I found Velasco-Alva’s book a pleasure to read and of immediate clinical applicability. To my mind his integration of psychoanalytic and systems/constructivist approaches is valuable and uncommon, and helps make systems theory more accessible to purely psychoanalytic ears. For example, his use of projective identification as the means through which a “reciprocal double bind” can develop within a couple humanizes what can otherwise seem like a cold communicative process. Probably the biggest turnoff about systems theory, for me, is how its constructs tend to disembody the conflict. Velasco-Alva’s approach makes the best of this externalization—a means of seeing the conflict without the emotional intensity that might obscure it—while bringing it back to the intrapsychic forces that, becoming intersubjective, bind the couple in painful repetitions of each other’s pasts. The constructivist approach, like the systems one, is focused on what is happening <italic>now</italic>, how we understand what is being created <italic>now</italic>. A psychoanalytic approach uses an historical lens to grasp what is being (re)created in the present between the couple. Reconciling these paradigms with their differing etiologies is not an easy task but one I think the author accomplishes.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I recommend this book to both beginning and experienced psychotherapists interested in exploring the expanded possibilities presented here for the therapeutic use of the self in couples work. North American readers will be introduced to a thoughtful, often humorous analyst whose desire to keep thinking through the intricate complexities and possibilities between different, though related fields of study comes across in a playful analytic style and a clear rendering of ideas.</p>
