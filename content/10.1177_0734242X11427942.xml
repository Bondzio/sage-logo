<abstract>
<p>In an attempt to look at means for reduction of corrosion in boilers, combustion experiments are performed on demolition wood with kaolin as additive. The experiments were performed in a multi-fuel reactor with continuous feed of pellets and by applying staged air combustion. A total characterization of the elemental composition of the fuel, the bottom ash and some particle size stages of fly ash was performed. This was done in order to follow the fate of some of the problematic compounds in demolition wood as a function of kaolin addition and other combustion-related parameters. In particular chlorine and potassium distribution between the gas phase, the bottom ash and the fly ash is reported as a function of increased kaolin addition, reactor temperature and air staging. Kaolin addition of 5 and 10% were found to give the least aerosol load in the fly ash. In addition, the chlorine concentration in aerosol particles was at its lowest levels for the same addition of kaolin, although the difference between 5 and 10% addition was minimal. The reactor temperature was found to have a minimal effect on both the fly ash and bottom ash properties.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Biomass is receiving increased interest from decision makers which has resulted in more utilization over recent years. Different final products originating from biomass are produced nowadays and include biofuel for the transport sector, chemicals, power and heat. The purpose of biomass utilization is to replace fossil fuel and thereby decrease greenhouse gas emissions which are contributing to global warming. The increased biomass consumption has resulted in higher prices of virgin wood up to a range at which it is no longer profitable to operate power stations based on combustion of wood alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X11427942">Baxter et al., 1998</xref>). This has resulted in the increased utilization of alternative fuels that are less expensive to acquire but have different properties in comparison with virgin wood, which makes combustion more problematic. This also holds true for small power units that usually rely on indigenous fuel supply delivered at minimal transport costs. Alternative fuels such as peat, agricultural waste, different grass types and fast- growing species, which are solely combusted or co-combusted, all have one thing in common, namely a high ash content. The higher ash content in such fuels may cause severe problems resulting in unscheduled and expensive shutdown periods in power plants. In fixed bed combustors, the alkali metals in particular can become volatile and stick on heat transfer surfaces downstream in the process. Such deposits are difficult to remove and cause lower efficiencies due to a decrease in heat transfer and a higher flue gas temperature. They can also bridge between the tubes and restrict flue gas flow which results in higher pressure drops. The deposits themselves have a composition which make them quite aggressive resulting in attacks on the metallic surface of the heating tubes. For example, the chlorine in the ash facilitates the mobility of alkalis such as potassium, forming KCl which has a low melting temperature. During combustion there is not much one can do to prevent chlorine compounds from leaving the bottom ash as different gaseous volatiles passing through the process along with the flue gas. However, the capture of alkalis through the use of additives has helped to lower the alkali chlorides concentration in the flue gas and thereby decrease corrosion in boilers substantially. Chlorine having to compete for the alkalis during chemical reactions is usually released as HCl, a compound that is corrosive on its own but lacks the sticky property that alkali chlorides have. In addition, HCl is easily cleaned from the flue gas in a post-combustion stage by scrubbing it with limestone or by dry-sorption with Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11427942">Yin et al., 2008</xref>). In fluidized bed combustion systems, agglomeration can become a serious problem for fuels containing high amounts of potassium oxides (K<sub>2</sub>O). The K<sub>2</sub>O and other alkali oxides react with silicate (Si) found in the sand that is usually used as bed material and form compounds with low melting points (760–875 °C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X11427942">Werther et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, in such cases the role of additives has been shown to have a positive effect on abating agglomeration by forming compounds that can withstand the high temperature environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11427942">Bartels et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11427942">Davidsson et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11427942">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11427942">Khan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X11427942">Llorente et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11427942">Pettersson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11427942">Vamvuka et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11427942">2008</xref>). Additives can be either mixed with the fuels prior to combustion, they can be added to the bed material in case of fluidized bed combustor or they can be sprayed at critical stages directly into the flue gas at an optimized gas temperature. Depending on their elemental composition, additives can be separated into groups containing calcium, phosphorous, sulfur, aluminium or aluminium–silicate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X11427942">Bäfver et al., 2009</xref>). For liquid-based additives, the so-called ChlorOut system developed by Vattenfall has shown some promising results in substantially decreasing the alkali chlorides in the flue gas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11427942">Broström et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X11427942">Henderson et al. 2006</xref>). ChlorOut is based on spraying a solution of ammonium sulfate prior to the superheater section in the boiler. Other sulfate solutions such as aluminium and ferric sulfates have also shown to have a similar effect to the ChlorOut system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11427942">Aho et al., 2008</xref>). Additives in the form of solid particles can also be mixed with the bio-fuel prior to combustion. Sulfur-rich additives such as peat or pure sulfur are expected to chemically react with potassium and sodium to form M<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, where M can be either K or Na. Sulfur addition to agricultural waste has shown promising results in decreasing the potential of corrosion in boilers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11427942">Aho and Silvennoinen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11427942">Skrifvars et al., 2004</xref>). Calcium–phosphorous and aluminium–silicate-based additives were tested in a full-scale straw pellet boiler at the Amager power station in Denmark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11427942">Tobiasen et al., 2007</xref>). Among the tested additives were sand, dicalcium phosphate, chalk and bentonite. The work concluded by picking sand and bentonite as having favourable properties for combating deposits in the boiler.</p>
<p>In this study, kaolin was chosen as the additive to demolition wood in order to study in detail its effectiveness in capturing the alkalis from the gas phase. Kaolin reactivity with gaseous alkalis has already been shown to be quite effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11427942">Tran et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11427942">2005</xref>) and many publications applying kaolin as additive in full-scale applications have shown good tendencies towards benefits in preventing agglomeration, fouling and corrosion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11427942">Coda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11427942">Davidsson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11427942">Vamvuka et al., 2008</xref>). However, in this work a laboratory-scale reactor with good control over temperature, fuel and air inputs in addition to gas and particle measurement was used to study some parameter variations on the reactivity of kaolin. The aluminium silicates in kaolin can react with alkalis and form compounds with higher melting point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11427942">Davidsson et al., 2008</xref>). The reactions between alkali chlorides and aluminium silicates are expected to follow mechanisms presented in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0734242X11427942">Equation (1)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0734242X11427942">Equation (2)</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11427942">Coda et al., 2001</xref>).</p>

<p>Demolition wood was provided by Vattenfall from the combustion plant at Nyköping, Sweden. The demolition wood was ground in a mill to produce a maximum particle size of 2–3 mm. The particles were then mixed with appropriate amounts of kaolin to produce fuels with 1, 5 and 10 wt.% kaolin relative to the fuel. The additives were mixed manually while spraying approximately 8% water relative to the total mass into the blend. The water was necessary in order to produce pellets of adequate quality which was performed in a laboratory scale pellet machine. The produced pellets had a diameter of 6 mm and a of length 5–15 mm and were air dried to an average moisture content of 12 wt.% before they were used in experiments. The proximate analysis of the sample was carried out according to the ASTM standards ASTM E871, ASTM E872 and ASTM D1102, respectively, for the moisture content, volatile matter and ashes. The fixed carbon was calculated by difference to 100%. The results of both the proximate and ultimate analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X11427942">Table 1</xref>. A chemical analysis of the ash content of the primary fuel and all the blends was determined by the inductive coupled plasma equipped with an atomic emission spectrometry analyser (ICP-AES) and inductive coupled plasma equipped a mass spectrometry analyser (ICP-SFMS) methods. The element composition of the ash for the different fuel mixtures are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X11427942">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Experimental setup</title>
<p>The experiments were carried out in an electrically heated high-temperature multi-fuel reactor. Its schematic drawing is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X11427942">Figure 1</xref>. The reaction section, located above the grate is 1.6 m long, while the section below the grate is 0.4 m long. The reactor heating system is fitted inside the insulation shell and consists of four separate 0.5 m high heating zones of 4 kW each (16 kW in total) that enclose the ceramic tube. The combustion air is preheated to the reactor temperature in external pre-heaters. The primary air is added under the grate and the secondary air is added above the grate. The lower part of the multi-fuel reactor is the section containing two-grate system (10 cm apart): a primary grate and a final burnout grate and an ash collection system. Both the reactor flue gas composition and the composition of the fuel gas after the primary zone as well as the particle emission size distribution were continuously monitored.</p>

<p>For gas analysis in the primary zone a Varian CP-4900 micro gas chromatograph (GC) was used. The exhaust gases were quantified online with two different Fourier transform infrared spectrometers (FTIRs), a Bomem 9100 and a Gasmet DX-4000. In order to detect instabilities during combustion a gas analyser with a fast response time (HORIBA PG-250) was used. Particle size distribution and concentration in the flue gas were measured by an electrical low pressure impactor (ELPI). The ELPI measures airborne particle size distribution in a range of 0.03−10 µm with twelve stages and a time resolution of 2 to 3 s. The nominal air flow is 10 L min<sup>−1</sup> and the lowest stage pressure is 100 mbar. The aerosol samples measured by means of a 13-stage low-pressure impactor were collected on aluminium plates. The chemical analyses of the samples were made by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis connected to a scanning electron microscope (SEM/EDX). The total mass of the particles on each plate was around 10 to 100 µg. For each run, four plates with the particle sizes (<italic>D</italic>
<sub>50%</sub>) 0.093, 0.26, 0.611 and 1.59 µm were chosen for analysis. Five EDX spot analyses were taken from different locations on each plate. After standard ZAF-correction the analysis was normalized to 100% by weight. The signals for carbon, oxygen and aluminium cannot be used for quantitative information for several reasons. The carbon signal can originate from possible unburned residue in the samples, but also from the adhering Vaseline. These same sources can also disturb the oxygen signal. The aluminium signal comes mainly from the plate beneath the samples. As kaolin contains aluminium, the effect of those additions on the fly ash could not be studied. The assumptions made for the data treatment of the aerosol concentrations are explained elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11427942">Backman et al., 2011</xref>). Temperature was measured in the reactor at several heights and in the flue gas channel. All experiments in this work were carried out with demolition wood and demolition wood with kaolin employing staged air combustion and isothermal conditions. The total excess air ratio was about 1.6, and the primary air stoichiometry was about 0.8 for most of the experiments but was also varied in order to study the effect on the volatility of chlorine and other alkali compounds of a lean O<sub>2</sub> condition in the primary zone. The reference experiment was run first at a reactor temperature of 850 °C and with no addition of kaolin. Three other experiments were run under the same conditions with the exception of the kaolin addition of 1, 5 and 10% of weight, respectively, to the demolition wood. Another two were run with 5% of kaolin addition but with different reactor temperatures of 800 and 900 °C. Finally two experiments were performed with lower (marked as LP) and higher (HP) air supply to the primary zone in comparison with the reference experiment. The secondary air combustion was changed, respectively, in order to obtain a total air excess ratio of 1.6. The feeding frequency was set to ensure a feeding rate of 400 g h<sup>−1</sup>. The pellets were primarily combusted on the upper grate. The pellets were gradually moved from the fuel-feeding inlet to a slot leading to the second grate by rotating blades. Each grate had two rotating blades moving at a speed of 3 min per round. Final burnout took place on the second grate before the ash was moved to a slot from where it fell into the ash bin. Due to small variation in pellet size, it was not possible to feed the target rate of 400 g h<sup>−1</sup> exactly. Accordingly, the supply of primary air could not be regulated accurately to attain the under stoichiometric condition of 0.8, although the variations were within an acceptable range. The primary air supply was adjusted so that the CO concentration from the primary zone was approximately 3%. The combustion time for each experiment was dependent on whichever of the following two events occurred first: (i) minimum stable combustion conditions of 2 h; or (ii) a 90% fill signal of aerosols in the impactor.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Due to the relatively long reactor residence time (30–60 s) and the high reactor temperature (800–900 °C), the amount of unburnt gases were very low (typically below 50 ppm CO at 11% O<sub>2</sub> in dry flue gas). However, during an initial stabilization period and short periods of high fluctuation in the fuel feeding, the air excess ratio deviated from the target value of 1.6. During such periods the CO emission level increased to typically 200 ppm at 11% O<sub>2</sub> in dry flue gas. The combined emission levels of hydrocarbons were typically below 5 ppm at 11% O<sub>2</sub> in dry flue gas. The average concentration and standard deviation (in brackets) were 8.2% (1.0), 28 ppm (30) and 11.5% (0.9), respectively, for O<sub>2</sub>, CO and CO<sub>2</sub>. These are average values for all the measured data points and for all the conducted experiments.</p>

<title>Bottom ash analysis</title>
<p>In order to be able to check the fate of some of the ash elements during combustion and the effect of kaolin, the chemical composition of the bottom ash was determined by the ICP-AES and ICP-SFMS methods. The concentrations of the most important elements for all the experiments are shown graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11427942">Figure 2</xref>. The increase of silicon and aluminium due to increased kaolin content is noticeable in the bottom ash. The potassium and chlorine also decrease as kaolin increases, although from this figure alone it is difficult to conclude whether this is due to chemical reactions or a dilution effect.</p>

<p>The ash fusion temperature for the bottom ash was determined in an oxidizing atmosphere in a carbolite ash fusion analyser according to the international test standard (ISO 540:1995). The ash samples from each experiment were shaped into three duplicates of cube pellets with a size of 3 mm. The ash cubes were put on a tile and placed inside the furnace that was programmed to increase the temperature at a rate of 8 °C min<sup>−1</sup> and up to 1500 °C. The changes of the shape of the ash cubes were recorded with a high resolution video system. The initial deformation temperature (IDT), the softening temperature (ST), the hemisphere temperature (HT), and the fluid temperature (FT) were determined after a visual observation of the recorded video. The average values of the four characteristic temperatures are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X11427942">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

<p>As this method for determining the fusion characteristics for ash depends on visual observation of the ash deformation, some uncertainties can be expected due to the human error factor. With the exception of the experiment with 10% kaolin, all the different temperature characteristics seemed to increase with increasing kaolin share in the bottom ash. Increasing kaolin share also resulted in greater scatter among the different characteristics. Some irregular tendencies were also found, mostly for the initial deformation temperature and to some extent for the soften temperature. These two ash temperature characteristics were the most difficult to determine by visual observation. The results of these temperatures could vary by a 100 °C depending on the person interpreting the deformation of ash cube pellets.</p>

<title>Aerosol size distribution</title>
<p>The particle size distribution in the flue gas was monitored with an ELPI for the aerosols in the range of 0.03–10 µm. It is acknowledged by the authors that larger particles belonging to the coarse fly ash range might exist in addition to the size range discussed in this study. It is however believed that these particles are most likely found in moderate quantities because of a low probability of entrained particles. This is due to the straight reactor geometry and the extremely low flow velocity (0.03–0.07 m/s). The results of the particle size distribution are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X11427942">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X11427942">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734242X11427942">6</xref>.</p>

<p>In general, it can be concluded that the addition of kaolin to demolition wood decreased the particle load in the flue gas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X11427942">Figure 4</xref>). This holds true for all the particle size ranges with the exception of the range 0.07–0.12 µm for which the trends were more or less constant. In comparison with the work performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X11427942">Bäfver et al. (2009)</xref> on oat grain in a residential boiler with a kaolin addition of 2 and 4%, the particle size distribution range and shape was quite similar to the ones shown in this study. The only exception was a higher particle load for the smallest particles for experiments with kaolin. This difference could be attributed to totally different reactor geometry and air flow pattern between the two reactors. The influence of reactor temperature on the fly ash load in the flue gas can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X11427942">Figure 5</xref>. For particles smaller than 0.2 µm the particle load was highest for a reactor temperature of 850 °C. For higher particle sizes, increasing temperature gave increased particle load. The same trends can also be found for the experiment with different primary air conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734242X11427942">Figure 6</xref>). For particles smaller than 0.31 µm, the highest particle load was obtained for a primary air stoichiometry of 0.8 after the primary zone (the middle series). The load for larger particles increased with increased combustion air through the primary zone.</p>

<title>Aerosol composition</title>
<p>The main components in the analysed particles were K, S, Cl and Na. On average 50 wt.% of the oxygen-free samples (excluding carbon and aluminium) consisted of these elements. Zn and Pb constituted on average 35 wt.% whereas the portion of the inert oxide forming elements Si, Ca, Fe, P, Mg and Cr was 15 wt.%. P and Mg were very low in all samples. The portion of inert metals were generally higher in the larger particle size fractions than in the smaller fractions, indicating that the compounds of these metals (oxides) originate from the original fuel ash and were not devolatilized. Lead and zinc were partly in oxide form, partly in salt form. The oxides were most probably ZnO and PbO. The salt part was constituted by sulfate and chloride of K, Na, Zn and Pb and calculated from the elemental composition according to the following assumptions: (i) potassium and sodium are as chlorides or sulfates; (ii) silicon, calcium, iron, magnesium and chromium are as oxides; (iii) zinc and lead can be both as oxides and/or chlorides and sulfates. Only the salt formation in the aerosols is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734242X11427942">Figures 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734242X11427942">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0734242X11427942">9</xref>. For kaolin addition at 850 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734242X11427942">Figure 7</xref>), the salt part was richer in chloride for the reference run and at 1% kaolin addition (30–40% as chloride) than for the runs with higher kaolin addition (5–10% chloride), the rest being sulfate. There is no big differences between smaller (0.1 µm) and bigger (1.6 µm) particles. The ratio between sodium and potassium was quite constant (1 : 2). However, in the reference sample the portion of potassium decreased with increasing particle size and zinc increases. A similar trend can be observed in the samples with 5 and 10% kaolin addition. The Pb content decreased slightly with increasing particle size.</p>

<title>The fate of chlorine</title>
<p>The chlorine distribution among the bottom ash phase and the gas phase relative to the chlorine input in the fuel is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0734242X11427942">Figure 10</xref>. This figure does not include the chlorine part found in the fly ash because not all of the impactor stages were chemically analysed. However, the chlorine part belonging to the fly ash was assumed to have a minor influence on the total mass balance due to the relatively small amounts of fly ash compared to bottom ash.</p>

<caption><p>Distribution of chlorine between gas phase (as measured HCl) and bottom ash.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0734242X11427942-fig10.tif"/></fig>
<p>From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0734242X11427942">Figure 10</xref> it can be seen that the chlorine distribution was somewhat unbalanced due to uncertainties in the chemical analysis of the raw fuel, the bottom ash and measurements in the gas phase. Nevertheless, the figure gives important information about trends that influence the chlorine distribution as a function of increased kaolin, temperature, and combustion air distribution. The chlorine in the bottom ash decreased with increased kaolin amounts and reactor temperature. Leaner conditions in the primary zone seem also to decrease the chlorine content in the bottom ash. The kaolin seemed to be facilitating the chlorine mobility although this was not detected as increased amounts in the gas phase throughout the entire range of the kaolin addition. The trends were clearer for the different reactor temperatures in which less chlorine in the bottom ash, due to increased temperature, translated into more HCl release. As has been described earlier (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0734242X11427942">Equations (1)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0734242X11427942">(2)</xref>), the effect of kaolin on abating the chlorine release in the fly ash is done by capturing the potassium and sodium in the bottom ash. This should translate into increased potassium and sodium for increased amounts of the additive in the raw fuel. However, this is not the case as a similar mass balance to that for chlorine shows that the ratios for K and Na (bottom ash to input fuel) were close to unity for all experiments.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>An experimental attempt was made to understand the behaviour of the corrosive chlorine compounds for variations in reactor temperature, combustion air distribution and kaolin addition. The gas phase was monitored with several gas analysers in both the primary zone and in the stack. A complete characterization of the raw fuel and the bottom ash was also performed for all the experiments. Kaolin was found to facilitate the mobility of chlorine by decreasing its concentration in the bottom ash by 37, 74 and 78%, respectively, for 1, 5, and 10% kaolin addition. The fly ash particle size distribution was also monitored and in addition a chemical analysis of the fly ash from four impactor stages was performed. Kaolin was found to be effective at reducing the chlorine concentration in the fly ash. The optimal addition was 5% and a further increase to 10% did not result in a noticeable chlorine reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734242X11427942">Figure 7</xref>). The addition of 5% has almost eliminated the chlorine content for the impactor stages 3 and 5. For fuels with high chlorine content, one can conclude that an addition of 5% kaolin could lead to reduced corrosion potential due to a significant reduction of chlorine in the fly ash. The effect of reactor temperature was not clear in terms of the chlorine content in the fly ash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734242X11427942">Figure 8</xref>). This is probably because the reactor temperature does not influence the temperature close to the combusting fuel greatly. On the other hand, leaner air conditions in the primary stage, which should mean lower temperature in the reacting region between the solid and the gas phase, resulted in decreased chlorine content in the fly ash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0734242X11427942">Figure 9</xref>). The addition of kaolin clearly changed the composition of the bottom ash as well. The chlorine content in the bottom ash decreased as kaolin increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0734242X11427942">Figure 10</xref>). Kaolin also influenced the melting behaviour of the bottom ash as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X11427942">Figure 3</xref> in which the fusion temperature characteristics increased with increased addition of kaolin.</p>
