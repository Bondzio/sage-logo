<p>Customer satisfaction remains the ultimate goal for all the firms. Most businesses link their performance to the satisfaction of their customers. Customer satisfaction is considered the essence of success in today’s highly competitive business world. Thus each firm should assign significance to customer satisfaction in strategy development to be ‘market oriented’ and ‘customer focused’.</p>
<p>The book provides factual understanding of customer satisfaction concepts which can be adopted by firms as a corporate goal while striving for quality in their services and products.</p>
<p>Ajit’s and Subhash’s book is a very meaningful attempt in this direction as it extends the understanding of customer satisfaction measurement with other important constructs like loyalty, value circle, brand-customer convergence, Net Promoters Score (NPS), internal–external benchmarking and finally implementing the survey findings.</p>
<p>This book stands out as it explains the subject of customer satisfaction in the most simple way. This book can be adopted by practitioners as a toolkit to create increased shareholder value and profits for all the stakeholders involved. Hence, this is a practical handbook for all marketing professionals and CEOs. Both qualitative and quantitative methods of customer satisfaction measurement have been discussed in the book. Authors also emphasize that mere recommender score is not sufficient but they suggest that its important to get to the root causes of various facets of loyalty so that companies can build more actionable plans.</p>
<p>Ajit has also tried to address customer satisfaction and relationship concepts using familiar constructs like Maslow’s need-hierarchy. The discussions around convergence of brand and customer are excellent. The Net Promoters Score (NPS) and advocacy question debated in the book is intriguing.</p>
<p>The readers will find a lot of action planning frameworks suggested by the authors quite useful. The book has delved with customer satisfaction/experience research, benchmarking and normative databases and survey finding implementations in a ‘real’ way from a decision maker’s view-point. Authors have clearly stated toolkits to reduce ambiguity in customer satisfaction measurement. The book provides a deeper insight and clear direction in the customer satisfaction/experience research and the misuse of such research that predominates in today’s corporate domain.</p>
<p>The book follows an easy and conversational style that makes it a suitable read for managers to encompass the room of customer experience. The various issues like: How customer satisfaction can be conceptualized and measured? What is the importance of customer satisfaction to businesses? etc., can be addressed by marketing managers after reading the book which covers variety of examples across product/service categories dealt during the authors’ personal 40 years of experience. The authors provide a capacity to gain an accurate and deep intuitive understanding of customer behaviour to marketing practitioners. This makes this book a must read for anybody who is in the customer service, research, relationship management, customer engagement and marketing domain.</p>
