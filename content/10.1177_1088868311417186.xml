<abstract>
<p>Two quantitative meta-analyses examined how the presence of visual channels, vocal channels, and synchronicity influences the quality of outcomes in negotiations and group decision making. A qualitative review of the literature found that the effects of communication channels vary widely and that existing theories do not sufficiently account for these contradictory findings. To parsimoniously encompass the full range of existing data, the authors created the communication orientation model, which proposes that the impact of communication channels is shaped by communicators’ orientations to cooperate or not. Two meta-analyses—conducted separately for negotiations and decision making—provide strong support for this model. Overall, the presence of communication channels (a) increased the achievement of high-quality outcomes for communicators with a neutral orientation, (b) did not affect the outcomes for communicators with a cooperative orientation, but (c) hurt communicators’ outcomes with a noncooperative orientation. Tests of cross-cultural differences in each meta-analysis further supported the model: for those with a neutral orientation, the beneficial effects of communication channels were weaker within East Asian cultures (i.e., Interdependent and therefore more predisposed towards cooperation) than within Western cultures (i.e., Independent).</p>

<p>In 1978, President Carter of the United States mediated the Camp David negotiations between Israel and Egypt. After 3 days of direct face-to-face negotiations offered no progression, with the views of Sadat, the Egyptian president, and Begin, the Israeli prime minister, appearing to be inherently and irrevocably incompatible, Carter made a bold choice. He decided that the only way to make progress was to restrict face-to-face contact and meet with each leader individually to draft a single negotiating document. In revising this document, offers and counteroffers were exchanged back and forth by Carter and his aides so as to avoid direct interaction between the two leaders. The removal of face-to-face contact between the two adversaries played a critical role in achieving the ground-breaking Camp David Accords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1088868311417186">Richardson, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, when NASA fired the main engine of the Mars Climate Orbiter on September 23, 1999, to begin its orbit around the planet in an effort to understand Mars’s water history, the orbiter was lost. Because of the angle of the launch, the spacecraft came much closer to Mars than planned and beneath a level at which it could function, resulting in an overheated and disabled propulsion system. Investigations revealed that the prime reason for this failure and the consequent loss of the spacecraft was a communication error between the spacecraft team in Colorado and the mission navigation team in California: One team was working with information in English units (e.g., inches, feet, and pounds) whereas the other team was working with information in metric units (e.g., centimeters, meters, and kilograms). Investigation reports indicated that the key reason for the failure was that the two teams rarely engaged in face-to-face communication and relied almost exclusively on communication channels such as email (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1088868311417186">Mishap Investigation Board, 1999</xref>). Had the two teams engaged in direct communication using face-to-face meetings or weekly audio conferences, this critical mistake might have been detected and corrected.</p>
<p>These examples illustrate that face-to-face contact can hinder as well as help the ability to craft and achieve mutually satisfactory negotiation agreements and high-quality decision-making outcomes. Although the effects of communication channels have been widely studied by psychologists and communication scholars, the literature is divided regarding their impact on negotiations and group decision making. For example, evidence provides inconsistent and contradictory conclusions as to how communication channels and the potential presence of sight, sound, and communication synchronicity (the ability to provide direct feedback in real time) influence the quality of negotiation and group decision-making outcomes: Some studies find that the presence of these communication channels increases the quality of outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-1088868311417186">Valley, Moag, &amp; Bazerman, 1998</xref>), whereas other studies find no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088868311417186">Croson, 1999</xref>) or that face-to-face contact decreases the quality of outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088868311417186">Carnevale, Pruitt, &amp; Seilheimer, 1981</xref>). Moreover, dominant theoretical approaches underlying these findings conflict with one another, with none of them parsimoniously explaining the full range of available data.</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to resolve and synthesize these contradictions and offer a new model that parsimoniously explains the full range of existing findings. Toward this end, we propose the communication orientation model and then examine its validity through a series of meta-analytic tests. The communication orientation model proposes that the presence of visual, vocal, and synchronous communication channels (a) helps communicators with a neutral orientation achieve efficient and effective negotiation and group decision-making outcomes, (b) does not affect the achievement of high-quality outcomes for communicators with a cooperative orientation, but (c) hurts the outcomes of communicators with a noncooperative orientation. Our model and its empirical support in the meta-analyses provide theoretical synthesis and also offer practical guidelines to help negotiators and decision makers decide when to use versus avoid certain communication channels to achieve high-quality interaction outcomes.</p>

<title>Negotiation and Group Decision-Making Outcomes</title>
<p>Our central research question is whether and when the presence of sight, sound, and synchronicity helps or hinders the ability to achieve high-quality negotiation outcomes and group decision-making outcomes. Our focus in the present review is on the quality of outcomes at the dyadic or small group level. Critical to high-quality outcomes for both negotiations and group decision-making is the integration and reconciliation of different information, interests, and perspectives among negotiating partners or group members.</p>
<p>In negotiations, a high-quality outcome is defined in two ways. First, a high-quality outcome refers to successfully reaching an agreement when there is one or more possible agreements that make both parties better off versus declaring an impasse and walking away from the table, which would leave both parties worse off than if a deal had been reached. Second, a high-quality negotiation outcome involves reaching an agreement that expands the total amount of resources available to both parties, often referred to as joint profit. To achieve high joint profit the parties must make mutually beneficial trade-offs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1088868311417186">Pruitt &amp; Carnevale, 1993</xref>) or identify and optimize compatible interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-1088868311417186">Thompson &amp; Hrebec, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Although negotiations generally have a mixed-motive incentive structure that involves both individual and joint gain and therefore requires a balance between cooperation and competition, group decision-making tasks are generally characterized by cooperative incentive structures that encourage group members to strive for a common, high-quality, outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1088868311417186">McGrath, 1984</xref>). A high-quality group decision-making outcome can be defined in three ways. First, a high-quality group decision-making outcome refers to whether decision makers select an objectively right answer. Second, in the absence of objective criteria, a high-quality group decision-making outcome is a decision that has been identified as superior by outside experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1088868311417186">McGrath, 1984</xref>). Third, a high-quality group decision-making outcome refers to a group’s ability to reach consensus on a judgment task when agreement among group members is superior to no agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1088868311417186">McGrath, 1984</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1088868311417186">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the negotiation and group decision-making literatures, sharing and integrating information is considered to be a precondition for high-quality outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088868311417186">De Dreu &amp; Carnevale, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088868311417186">De Dreu, Nijstad, &amp; Van Knippenberg, 2008</xref>). For example, negotiators who achieve a better understanding of others’ interests are more likely to reach a settlement and also utilize all the available resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088868311417186">Galinsky, Maddux, Gilin, &amp; White, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1088868311417186">Swaab, Postmes, Van Beest, &amp; Spears, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-1088868311417186">Thompson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1088868311417186">Thompson &amp; Hastie, 1990</xref>). Similarly, when group members share and have a greater understanding of task-relevant information, they achieve more optimal decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1088868311417186">Hollingshead, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1088868311417186">Liang, Moreland, &amp; Argote, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1088868311417186">Liljenquist, Galinsky, &amp; Kray, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1088868311417186">Stasser, Stewart, &amp; Wittenbaum, 1995</xref>).</p>

<title>The Link Among Sight, Sound, Synchronicity, and Outcome Quality: Theoretical Approaches and Empirical Inconsistencies</title>
<p>Three major theoretical approaches—the richness approach, social information processing (SIP), and the social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE)—have attempted to provide a framework for understanding the effect of communication channels on interaction outcomes. Unfortunately, each of these approaches fails to fully account for the available data, with existing findings providing some consistent data along with failures to support their specific predictions. These inconsistencies do not lead us to claim that these theories are not valid and that communication channels do not have systematic impact on whether or not high-quality interaction outcomes are reached. Instead, we propose that these theories can be reconciled through a new theoretical lens that offers a parsimonious integration of the existing findings.</p>
<p>In the current review, we present the communication orientation model, which proposes that people’s orientations to cooperate or not shape the extent to which communication channels help or hurt negotiation and group decision-making outcomes by influencing the communicator’s tendency to share and integrate information or to display aggression or antagonism. On one hand, the presence of communication channels (sight, sound, and synchronicity) may increase the likelihood that communicators will develop incipient levels of trust necessary to discover and integrate information for mutual benefit. On the other hand, as the Israel–Egypt example suggests, eliminating these communication channels may increase the probability of high-quality agreements. In these cases when enmity already sits on the doorstep of impending negotiations, seeing and hearing each other may only intensify the antagonism and competitive spirit. Thus, not being able to see, hear, or directly respond to others may shroud antagonistic behaviors that can be roadblocks to information sharing and integration.</p>
<p>Overall, we contend that the relationship between communication channels and the quality of negotiation and group decision-making outcomes depends on people’s orientations that precede communication between them. The manifestation of these orientations via communication channels enables (or suppresses) people’s ability to develop trust and inhibit jaundiced suspicion on the road to exchanging and integrating information to achieve a high-quality decision. The overall objective of the current research is to examine whether our theoretical model is justified on empirical grounds by using meta-analytical techniques.</p>
<p>We first explore the specific predictions made by previous theories regarding the impact of communication channels on high-quality negotiation and group decision-making outcomes. We then present our communication orientation model as a theoretical lens for resolving the inconsistencies of the previous approaches by explaining how people’s cooperative versus noncooperative versus neutral predispositions explain why the same communication channel (e.g., the ability to see others) has different effects in different studies. Third, we present two meta-analyses to test our model in the domain of negotiations (Meta-Analysis 1) and group decision making (Meta-Analysis 2). Fourth, to test the validity of our theoretical model further, we analyze potential cross-cultural differences in the impact of communication channels on negotiation and group decision-making outcomes.</p>

<title>The Richness Approach and the Positive Role of Communication Channels</title>
<p>It is often assumed that communication improves when people can see, hear, or directly respond to one another in real time. For example, the added value of visual contact is acknowledged in the familiar wisdom that seeing equals believing or that a picture says more than a thousand words. Along these lines, a broad set of theories that we will call the richness approach has postulated that communication settings differ along a continuum of richness, where richness is based on the ability of communication channels to provide communication synchronicity and carry visual or vocal information exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088868311417186">Daft &amp; Lengel, 1986</xref>). The richness approach encompasses a variety of theories including social presence theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1088868311417186">Short, 1974</xref>), information richness theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088868311417186">Daft &amp; Lengel, 1986</xref>), the cuelessness model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1088868311417186">Stephenson, Ayling, &amp; Rutter, 1976</xref>), and the reduced social cues approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1088868311417186">Kiesler, Siegel, &amp; McGuire, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>The key proposition of the richness approach is that the presence of sight, sound, and synchronicity makes social interactions more personal, and as a result the capacity of any a communication channel to convey multiple communication cues (i.e., sight, sound, and synchronicity) determines whether people will be able to work effectively with each other, especially when they are faced with an ambiguous task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1088868311417186">McGrath &amp; Hollingshead, 1993</xref>). The implication for negotiators and decision makers is that developing rapport and trust is more difficult when communication channels are limited. Thus, the richness approach argues that the ability of communication channels to carry visual channels or vocal channels or provide rapid feedback through synchronous communication facilitates rapport building and information exchange (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1088868311417186">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1088868311417186-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The richness approach proposes that more sight, more sound, and more synchronicity are better for achieving high-quality outcomes. The presence of visual channels enriches social interactions because the ability to see others personalizes the message conveyed and makes it easier to cooperate, whereas the inability to see others can make it harder to establish and maintain rapport. Eye contact, for example, can fulfill an important role in building rapport and signaling respect to the counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1088868311417186">Andersen, 2008</xref>). Empirical evidence supports the idea that presence of visual channels is a key determinant of cooperation and information integration. For example, findings reported in the negotiation literature show that negotiators are more contentious and less cooperative when they cannot see their counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-1088868311417186">Turnbull, Strickland, &amp; Shaver, 1976</xref>). Similarly, a lack of visual channels can make coordination and cooperation more difficult in group decision-making tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088868311417186">Baltes, Dickson, Sherman, Bauer, &amp; LaGanke, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Along similar lines, the richness approach has argued that the ability to hear and speak to other is of critical importance. The level, range, and variability of voice pitch, as well as the loudness and tempo of voice, are all thought to be helpful to interpret emotions accurately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088868311417186">Daft &amp; Lengel, 1986</xref>; but also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1088868311417186">Scherer, Banse, Wallbott, &amp; Goldbeck, 1991</xref>). This assumption implies that the absence of vocal channels makes it harder to effectively communicate. As a result, misunderstandings are more likely to occur over email than in phone conversations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1088868311417186">Kruger, Epley, Parker, &amp; Ng, 2005</xref>), and the inability to speak to and hear others decreases the use of cooperative tactics in negotiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1088868311417186">Lim, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1088868311417186">Smith, 1969</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the richness approach has argued that communication suffers when people cannot directly respond to one another in real time. The underlying reasoning is that communication synchronicity facilitates the ease with which people can socially validate each other’s opinion, which then increases the exchange of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1088868311417186">Dennis, Fuller, &amp; Valacich, 2008</xref>). Asynchronous communication on the other hand, in which people are not able to provide direct feedback (e.g., in a letter or email), makes it harder to communicate spontaneously and increases the likelihood that messages are misinterpreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088868311417186">Byron, 2008</xref>). Negotiation research supports this claim; negotiators are less likely to share information and integrate interests when they use asynchronous communication channels such as email instead of synchronous communication channels such as instant messaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1088868311417186">Loewenstein &amp; Morris, 2011</xref>). Similarly, research in group decision-making settings has found that asynchronous communication can decrease information sharing and the quality of group decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088868311417186">Baltes et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the richness approach has received some empirical support, there is also evidence directly contradicting the approach. Mixed results have been reported for the role of visual channels, vocal channels, and synchronicity, such that their presence does not always have a positive impact on social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1088868311417186">DeSanctis &amp; Poole, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088868311417186">Fulk, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088868311417186">Fulk, Schmitz, &amp; Steinfield, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1088868311417186">McGinn &amp; Keros, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1088868311417186">Morris, Nadler, Kurtzberg, &amp; Thompson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1088868311417186">Postmes, Spears, &amp; Lea, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1088868311417186">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1088868311417186">Reicher, Spears, &amp; Postmes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1088868311417186">Sassenberg &amp; Postmes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1088868311417186">Spears, Lea, &amp; Lee, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1088868311417186">Spears, Postmes, Lea, &amp; Wolbert, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-1088868311417186">Tanis &amp; Postmes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-1088868311417186">Walther, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-1088868311417186">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-1088868311417186">Walther, Anderson, &amp; Park, 1994</xref>). As a result, the richness approach has been heavily criticized for being incomplete.</p>
<p>The core of the criticism of the richness approach has been that the approach is technologically deterministic and ascribes too much influence to the presence or absence of communication channels and too little attention to the role of the social context in which communication takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1088868311417186">Spears et al., 2002</xref>). This criticism defines a second set of theories that emphasize the importance of accounting for sociocontextual influences in interactions that do not involve face-to-face contact. These theories deemphasize the importance of communication channels (e.g., visual, vocal, synchronicity) and instead focus on social cues that provide insight into the idiosyncratic characteristics of the individual communicators or the nature of their relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1088868311417186">Postmes et al., 1998</xref>). We briefly review the two most influential theories.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1088868311417186">
<title>The Social Information Processing Theory (SIP)</title>
<p>SIP theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-1088868311417186">Walther, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-1088868311417186">1994</xref>) proposes that communicators strive to develop positive and meaningful relationships and that social cues and information are indispensable for the development of such relationships. The model proposes that because computer-mediated communication does not transmit social cues at the same speed as face-to-face communication, developing meaningful relationships in the absence of visual contact, vocal contact, or synchronicity, takes more time. The absence of communication channels simply slows down the process of building social relationships. However, over time, users can adapt to the inherent limitations of computer-mediated communication and effectively develop meaningful interpersonal relations. In a meta-analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-1088868311417186">Walther and colleagues (1994)</xref> demonstrated that the negative effects of non face-to-face interactions on the establishment of social relationships diminish over time. Consistent with this relationship development model, negotiators and group decision makers who rely predominantly on text-based communication channels can be equally successful as face-to-face teams if they take the time to establish a positive interpersonal connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088868311417186">Barsness &amp; Tenbrunsel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1088868311417186">McGinn &amp; Keros, 2002</xref>). According to this theory, when people have established a relationship or are comfortable with a particular communication technology, the boost from additional communications channels (i.e., the presence of sight, sound, or synchrony) diminishes.</p>

<sec id="section5-1088868311417186">
<title>The Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Effects</title>
<p>SIDE proposes that the salience of social identities moderates the effects of communication channels on group processes. SIDE particularly focuses on the presence or absence of visual channels, suggesting that anonymous computer-mediated communication affects group processes such as polarization, social attraction, and conformity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1088868311417186">Postmes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1088868311417186">Reicher et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1088868311417186">Spears &amp; Lea, 1994</xref>). This model, which has both cognitive and strategic components, acknowledges that the presence of communication channels—specifically visual contact—can either intensify or diminish a group process depending on existing social identities.</p>
<p>The cognitive component of SIDE concerns <italic>intragroup</italic> discussions and describes how the salience of social identity moderates the effects of visual contact. Specifically, it argues that conditions of anonymity (i.e., the absence of visual channels) may either lead to depersonalized perceptions of self and others and strengthen the salience of social identities that are already in place or amplify personal identity and independence in contexts in which no shared identity exists from the outset (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1088868311417186">Lea &amp; Spears, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1088868311417186">Reicher et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1088868311417186">Spears et al., 1990</xref>). For example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1088868311417186">Spears et al. (1990)</xref>, groups with a strong social identity displayed more group polarization when they could not see each other than when they could, suggesting that the impact of the group norm was most pronounced in the absence of visual contact but in the presence of a shared social identity, and least pronounced in the presence of visual channels and personal identities.</p>
<p>In addition to its cognitive component, SIDE also has a strategic component that describes how the absence or presence of individuating information enhances or diminishes influence in <italic>intergroup</italic> interactions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1088868311417186">Reicher &amp; Levine, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1088868311417186">Spears et al., 2002</xref>). Specifically, the strategic component of SIDE argues that conditions of anonymity can increase a low-power party’s strategic freedom and influence when the communication environment obscures and shrouds their lack of power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1088868311417186">Reicher &amp; Levine, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1088868311417186">Spears &amp; Lea, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with SIDE, strong social identities can overcome the absence of communication channels. For example, research shows that outcome quality is not negatively affected when negotiators share a common group membership in their online conversations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1088868311417186">Moore, Kurtzberg, Thompson, &amp; Morris, 1999</xref>) and when members of virtual teams strongly identify with their team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088868311417186">Fiol, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1088868311417186">Mortensen &amp; Hinds, 2001</xref>) or their organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-1088868311417186">Wiesenfeld, Raghuram, &amp; Garud, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>The Advances and Shortcomings of SIP and SIDE</title>
<p>Despite their different foci, both SIP and SIDE go beyond the technological deterministic view proposed by the richness approach that communication channels have a fixed impact on communication. Both are built around the assumption that people’s behaviors in non-face-to-face interactions are driven by the interaction between technological and social cues that frame interpersonal relationships and shared social identities. Both argue that a positive connection or a shared group membership can help to overcome the difficulties that communicators face in the absence of communication channels. Thus, the theories directly contradict the richness approach by showing that the absence of visual, vocal, and synchronous communication channels does not necessarily deteriorate social interactions.</p>
<p>However, despite resolving certain empirical contradictions, SIP and SIDE too have left a theoretical gap by not explicitly addressing the evidence supporting the richness approach showing that the mere presence of visual channels, vocal channels, or synchronicity can increase the ability to achieve high-quality outcomes in both negotiations and group decision making. These findings have led to countercriticism from advocates of the richness approach, who still claim that this approach, at least partly, is correct (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1088868311417186">Kock, 2004</xref>, for a review).</p>
<p>Most importantly, none of the previous theories—the richness approach nor SIP or SIDE—provide a full explanation for why the presence of communication channels may sometimes have negative consequences for negotiation and group decision-making outcomes. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1088868311417186">Lewis and Fry (1977)</xref>, for example, demonstrated that people with a noncooperative approach to their interaction achieved higher quality negotiation outcomes when they could not see each other compared to when they could. Along similar lines, negotiations over instant messaging (where negotiators could not see or hear the other side) can sometimes yield more integrative outcomes than face-to-face negotiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088868311417186">Citera, Beauregard, &amp; Mitsuya, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, neither SIP nor SIDE provides a comprehensive model that covers both negotiations and group decision making. It is true that SIDE does describe how the presence of visual channels can disrupt group processes and social influence when personal identities are salient, but it does not provide a systematic examination of how the mere presence of visual channels, vocal channels, and communication synchronicity can hurt the quality of group decision-making <italic>outcomes</italic>. Although SIDE is concerned with group processes such as group polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1088868311417186">Spears et al., 1990</xref>) and prime-consistent behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1088868311417186">Postmes, Spears, &amp; Cihangir, 2001</xref>), whether these processes lead to objectively better or worse outcomes is unclear. Furthermore, SIDE has not systematically examined the impact of all the “communication channels”—visual, vocal, and synchronous ones—or applied its model to mixed-motive interactions such as negotiations.</p>
<p>Overall, no existing theory encompasses all communication channels, is applicable to both negotiations and group decision making, and can accurately predict when communication channels help, hurt, or have no impact on the quality of outcomes. Thus, we developed the communication orientation model to explain all the effects—positive effects, noneffects, and negative effects—that visual, vocal, and synchronous channels have on the quality of negotiations and group decisions.</p>

<title>The Communication Orientation Model</title>
<p>At the center of our communication orientation model is the proposition that the main orientation with which people approach their interaction holds the key to theoretical and empirical parsimony. In addition, the communication orientation model proposes that sharing and integrating information is a critical process by which these orientations interact with communication channels to affect negotiation and group decision-making outcomes.</p>
<sec id="section8-1088868311417186">
<title>Communicator Orientation and Sharing and Integration of Information</title>
<p>A key assumption of our model is that information sharing and integration is critical for effective social interactions because it increases the likelihood of comprehension, problem solving, and finding common ground by allowing people “to formulate their contributions with an awareness of what their addressee does and does not know” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1088868311417186">Krauss &amp; Fussell, 1990</xref>, p. 112). This strong link between information sharing and integration on one hand and outcome quality on the other that we noted earlier implies that interactions are not necessarily driven by the presence or absence of either communication channels or social cues but instead by the extent to which people share information and whether they can effectively integrate relevant information.</p>
<p>Information sharing and integration are strongly influenced by the orientation that people hold toward their negotiation or group discussion partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088868311417186">De Dreu &amp; Carnevale, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088868311417186">De Dreu et al., 2008</xref>). In interdependent decision making and social settings more generally, some communicators adopt a cooperative approach whereas others have a less cooperative approach, and still others are unsure of what approach to take because of limited knowledge about their counterparts. A cooperative orientation leads people to actively seek, share, and integrate information that benefits themselves as well as others. Indeed, a cooperative orientation is typically manifested in mutually beneficial behaviors such as sharing priorities that allow negotiators to make trade-offs in negotiations or sharing expertise and unique information in group discussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088868311417186">De Dreu et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, a noncooperative orientation refers to an approach where communicators strive to maximize only their own outcomes and that typically results in withholding information that could benefit others as well as a reluctance to accept and trust information from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1088868311417186">Ross &amp; Stillinger, 1991</xref>). Research suggests that communicators are more likely to establish high-quality outcomes when they adopt a cooperative approach compared to when they adopt a noncooperative approach because cooperation facilitates the sharing and integration of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088868311417186">De Dreu et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The decision to adopt a cooperative or noncooperative orientation can be influenced by both motivational and categorization processes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088868311417186">De Dreu &amp; Carnevale, 2003</xref>, for a review). First, people’s social motives influence their behavior during the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1088868311417186">McClintock, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1088868311417186">McClintock, Messick, Campos, &amp; Kuhlman, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1088868311417186">Messick &amp; McClintock, 1968</xref>). Individuals often come to the bargaining table with a social value orientation geared toward cooperation or noncooperation, and these social motives influence the extent to which groups disseminate information and reach settlements, especially when both negotiators share the same orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088868311417186">De Dreu et al., 2008</xref>). Second, communication orientations are rooted in social categorization processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1088868311417186">Postmes, Haslam, &amp; Swaab, 2005</xref>). When people interact with others who belong to similar social categories, they infer a similar understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-1088868311417186">Turner, 1991</xref>) and are more likely to exchange and integrate information and achieve higher quality interaction outcomes as a result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1088868311417186">Haslam, 2001</xref>). The recognition of a shared social identity can result in greater information integration because it leads communicators to adopt a more cooperative orientation toward their interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-1088868311417186">Swaab, Postmes, &amp; Spears, 2008</xref>). So, whether because of motivational or categorizational processes, communication orientations strongly influence the quality of interaction outcomes.</p>
<p>Our central, synthesizing thesis is that the type of orientation people adopt (neutral, cooperative, or noncooperative) interacts with the presence of visual channels, vocal channels, and synchronicity to determine the quality of negotiation and group decision-making outcomes. More specifically, we propose that communicator orientation moderates the relationship between communication channels on one hand and the level and ease of information exchange and integration and ultimately the quality of outcomes on the other.</p>

<title>The Positive Effect of Communication Channels for Communicators With Unknown Orientations</title>
<p>Although people often start their conversation with either a cooperative or noncooperative orientation, communicators are sometimes uncertain about an upcoming interaction and unsure of whether to take a cooperative or noncooperative stand. As a result, they look for information to determine what orientation to embrace. In these cases, communication channels serve a very important function: The presence of nonsemantic information such as head nods, smiles, and brief verbalizations such as “yeah” and “m-hmmm” helps to determine whether the other side is cooperative or not. In other words, the presence of paraverbal and nonverbal cues such as tone of voice, facial expression, and gesture allows communicators with unknown orientations to learn more about the other side and potentially trust them enough to share and integrate information. In these cases, the presence of communication channels help establish rapport.</p>
<p>Our reasoning implies that communication channels should have a positive impact on subsequent behaviors when communicators are unsure of whether to approach the interaction cooperatively or not. For instance, when they do not know their counterpart and have neither a preexisting cooperative nor noncooperative motive, the absence of communication channels can decrease the ability to develop rapport and trust and thus reduce their tendency to share and integrate information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1088868311417186">Thompson &amp; Nadler, 2002</xref>). This prediction is similar to the richness approach in that we expect the presence of communication channels to have positive effects. However, it also differs from this approach because we argue that communication channels facilitate information integration only when communication orientations are neither clearly cooperative nor noncooperative. By contrast, the richness approach ascribes a strong influence to communication channels regardless of prior orientation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1088868311417186">
<title>The Limited or Noneffect of Communication Channels for Cooperatively Oriented Communicators</title>
<p>People with cooperative communication orientations are more likely to value joint welfare, share information about priorities and preferences, and interpret others’ actions as efforts to coordinate, which, in turn, increases the quality of their interaction outcomes (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088868311417186">De Dreu &amp; Carnevale, 2003</xref>). When individuals approach an interaction with a cooperative orientation, because of a shared history or shared identity, they are primed to think the best of their partners. As a result, the paucity of paraverbal and nonverbal cues present when the partners cannot see or hear each other no longer poses a threat to trust and rapport; the communication between the partners is still interpreted with the best of intentions. For example, a meta-analysis of the effects of social motivation on negotiations demonstrated that cooperatively oriented negotiators (i.e., those with high concern for their own and others’ welfare) share more information about underlying interests and priorities and achieve higher joint gains than those with noncooperative (i.e., egoistic) orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088868311417186">De Dreu, Weingart, &amp; Kwon, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The tendency to enter an interaction with trust and rapport should facilitate the sharing of information and make cooperatively oriented communicators less dependent on the presence or absence of communication channels. In other words, the presence of visual channels, vocal channels, or communication synchronicity will not be as influential in helping communicators discover trade-off potential and unique information because their cooperative orientation is sufficient to produce trust and rapport.</p>
<p>Empirical research supports this claim. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1088868311417186">McGinn and Keros (2002)</xref> demonstrated that people have greater difficulty developing a shared logic of exchange and coordination when they communicate through email but only when they interact with strangers and not when they interact with others with whom they have strong social ties. Similarly, online negotiations are less likely to result in an impasse when they take place between people who are interpersonally acquainted or share common group membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1088868311417186">Moore et al., 1999</xref>). The cooperative orientation that flows from interpersonal ties and shared identities allows people to share and discuss information and perspectives more freely, even in the absence of certain communication channels.</p>
<p>This prediction is consistent with SIP and SIDE in suggesting that non-face-to-face interactions can be as effective as face-to-face settings after a positive relationship has been established. At the same time, this hypothesis differs from SIP and SIDE in focusing on how a cooperative communication orientation based in strong interpersonal ties and shared social identities leads individuals to share and integrate information regardless of the presence of communication channels.</p>

<title>The Negative Effect of Communication Channels for Noncooperatively Oriented Communicators</title>
<p>The communication orientation model proposes that communication channels have markedly different effects when people come to the negotiation table with a noncooperative orientation. Using a noncooperative lens to define the situation, people may interpret each other’s actions as efforts to dominate and exploit, which then inspire competitive tactics to defend and protect one’s own interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-1088868311417186">White, Tynan, Galinsky, &amp; Thompson, 2004</xref>). Because visual channels, vocal channels, and synchronicity not only transmit factual information but also can intensify feelings, their presence has the potential to escalate (already existing) noncooperative predispositions. Thus, the presence of communication channels can create mutually reinforcing competitive tactics and intensify negative emotions that decrease the chances of disclosing accurate information about underlying interests for communicators with noncooperative orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1088868311417186">Pruitt &amp; Carnevale, 1993</xref>). Indeed, a competitive history between people decreases the likelihood of coordinated information exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1088868311417186">Ross &amp; Stillinger, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-1088868311417186">Toma &amp; Butera, 2009</xref>). Similarly, in a study examining the effects of eye engagement and the valence of verbal content, frequent eye contact intensified negative evaluations when people engaged in negative verbal exchanges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1088868311417186">Ellsworth &amp; Carlsmith, 1968</xref>).</p>
<p>Because communication channels are the window through which noncooperatively oriented people witness an opponent’s noncooperative intent or express aggressive and dominating behaviors themselves, we predict that information sharing and successful integration for communicators with noncooperative orientation are more likely to be achieved in the <italic>absence</italic> of communication channels. That is, the ability to hear, see, or directly respond to each other can intensify noncooperative intent that impedes information sharing and integration.</p>
<p>Consistent with this prediction, negotiators with noncooperative orientations are more likely to apply competitive tactics when they can see each other compared to when they cannot and, as a result, achieve lower joint gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088868311417186">Carnevale et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1088868311417186">Lewis &amp; Fry, 1977</xref>). Similarly, noncooperative negotiators were less likely to exchange a pool of offers large enough to contain a mutually profitable solution when they could see each other than when they could not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088868311417186">Fry, 1985</xref>). Another study found that male negotiators perceived the presence of eye contact in negotiations as more competitive and threatening than female negotiators, and, as a result, they shared more information in the absence of eye contact than in its presence. The reverse was true for women, who achieved more creative outcomes in the presence of eye contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1088868311417186">Swaab &amp; Swaab, 2009</xref>). These studies suggest that communication channels intensify the already existing negative or noncooperative feelings and can fuel hostility and less information sharing.</p>
<p>None of the previous theories can provide a full explanation for how the presence of visual channels, vocal channels, and communication synchronicity can have a negative effect on achieving high-quality negotiation outcomes. The richness approach hypothesizes only that the presence of communication channels produces beneficial consequences for information integration. SIP focuses only on the time it takes to establish online personal relationships. And SIDE focuses predominantly on social identity as a moderator of anonymity effects and does not address objective negotiation outcomes.</p>
<p>The communication orientation model can account for these varied effects and offers three specific hypotheses for how communication channels interact with the orientation of communicators to produce specific effects on the quality of outcomes.</p>

<title>Cross-Cultural Differences as a Test of the Communication Orientation Model</title>
<p>The communication orientation model predicts that when the communication context gives rise to cooperative orientations, the positive effects of communication channels will be lower because cooperation orientations already possess the seeds of rapport and trust that directly increase information integration. One implication of this hypothesis is that cultures that are more cooperatively disposed should have less difficulty reaching high-quality outcomes when communication channels are absent. Although behavior varies within and between cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088868311417186">Choi, Nisbett, &amp; Norenzayan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-1088868311417186">Vandello &amp; Cohen, 1999</xref>), we focus on the difference between Eastern and Western cultures because research has clearly differentiated them from one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-1088868311417186">Triandis, Bontempo, Bond, Leung, &amp; Hui, 1990</xref>), particularly in the context of interdependent decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088868311417186">Adair, Weingart, &amp; Brett, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1088868311417186">Gelfand &amp; Brett, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the most widely studied differences between Eastern and Western cultures is the extent to which individuals within each culture see the self as interconnected with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1088868311417186">Hofstede, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1088868311417186">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1088868311417186">Oyserman &amp; Lee, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-1088868311417186">Triandis, 1995</xref>). Individuals from interdependent cultures are more likely to think of themselves in the context of the larger social world, tend to define themselves in terms of their group memberships and relationships with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088868311417186">Brewer &amp; Gardner, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1088868311417186">Cousins, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1088868311417186">Cross &amp; Madson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1088868311417186">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>), and give in-group goals priority over personal goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-1088868311417186">Triandis, 1995</xref>). All of these tendencies lead individuals in interdependent cultures to adopt a cooperative approach to social relations—at least with in-group members.</p>
<p>In contrast, individuals from independent cultures tend to think of themselves as autonomous individuals separate from others, give personal goals priority over in-group goals, and approach their social world with a less cooperative approach to interdependent decision making. The bonds between members of Western cultures are looser than those of Eastern cultures suggesting that individuals cannot rely on the cooperative intent of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1088868311417186">Cousins, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1088868311417186">Gelfand, Nishii, &amp; Raver, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1088868311417186">Hofstede, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1088868311417186">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>). In support of this distinction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1088868311417186">Probst, Carnevale, and Triandis (1999)</xref> found that people from Eastern cultures behave more cooperatively toward members of their cultural in-group than people from Western cultures do.</p>
<p>This last point suggests that these cultural effects on cooperative intent are contingent on the cultural composition of the dyad or group such that they should occur only in intracultural interactions. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1088868311417186">Leung and Bond (1984)</xref> found that Chinese negotiators were willing to concede only if their opponent was Chinese and not when they were American. These findings suggest that <italic>intracultural</italic> interactions within an Eastern cultural context are more likely to possess the rapport and trust that facilitate the sharing and integration of information than intracultural interactions within a Western cultural context. In contrast, the development of rapport and the sharing and integration of information are quite difficult to achieve in <italic>intercultural</italic> interactions. For example, a study comparing the cultural composition of negotiators found that the quality of intercultural negotiation outcomes was lower than that of intracultural negotiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1088868311417186">Brett &amp; Okumura, 1998</xref>) and that these effects were the result of the difficulties associated with understanding and integrating relevant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1088868311417186">Gelfand &amp; Christakopoulou, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Because the cultural setting affects people’s communication orientations, when communicators are neutrally predisposed (e.g., nothing has tipped the balance toward either cooperation or noncooperation), their cultural background should moderate the positive impact that the absence of communication channels has on outcome quality within intracultural negotiations. Because people in Western cultures are less cooperatively predisposed, and visual channels, vocal channels, and synchronicity facilitate the exchange of information for those with a neutral orientation, they should experience greater rapport and information integration in the presence of these channels. However, because communicators in Eastern cultures are more likely to be cooperatively predisposed toward each other, they should gain less from the presence of visual channels, vocal channels, and synchronicity integrating information.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1088868311417186">2</xref></sup></p>

<p>We present two studies that use meta-analytical techniques to evaluate the validity of the richness approach, SIP, SIDE, and our communication orientation model in the context of negotiations and group decision making. We use a meta-analytic procedure because individual studies reveal mixed evidence and rely heavily on the significance of a given study finding instead of the effect size of the finding. In addition to testing the validity of the theoretical approaches, using meta-analytic procedures provides an opportunity to examine the impact of moderating variables such as our core construct—communicator orientation (neutral, cooperative, or noncooperative). In addition, we tested whether variations in findings are the result of differences in research methods used. Although all studies used laboratory studies, role-playing simulations, and tasks that were somewhat comparable, the type of manipulation of communicator orientation (individual, interpersonal, or group based), the type of sample (undergrads vs. professionals), and the time given to complete the task (restricted vs. unrestricted) differed. We tested whether these methodological differences influenced effect sizes. Finally, we tested for file-drawer bias to examine whether there is a publication bias in the literature (published vs. unpublished).</p>

<title>Literature Search</title>
<p>A literature search was conducted to retrieve data on the relationship between the presence of communication channels as independent variables and negotiation outcomes as a dependent variable. Articles and doctoral dissertations (until May 2010) were retrieved from theoretical reviews and integrations and through computer searches using PsycINFO and Google Scholar. Recent issues of psychology, communication, information systems, and organizational behavior journals were hand searched for additional articles. We conducted manual searches in the following journals until May 2010 for the preceding 4 years as well as relevant articles in press: <italic>Administrative Science Quarterly, Academy of Management Journal, Journal of Management, Journal of Organizational Behavior, Journal of Applied Psychology, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, European Journal of Social Psychology, British Journal of Social Psychology</italic>, and <italic>Small Group Research</italic>. In addition, we contacted experts in this area of research to send relevant new work that was not yet published. Finally, we examined proceedings of the Academy of Management Conference and the International Association for Conflict Management to allow for the systematic inclusion of unpublished work.</p>

<title>Criteria for Inclusion</title>
<p>After collection, the studies were individually examined and included if they (a) reported a test between at least one of the communication channels (the presence vs. the absence of visual channels, or vocal channels, or synchronicity) and the dependent variable of interest, (b) allowed for social interaction between the participants, and (c) provided the necessary statistical information to compute effect sizes. This ruled out studies using experimental games (e.g., prisoner’s dilemma) and preprogrammed opponents. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088868311417186">Table 1</xref> presents an overview of the studies included in each meta-analysis and their key attributes. As can be seen in columns VIS (visual), VOC (vocal), and SYN (synchronicity), different studies allowed us to compare the impact of the presence of these channels.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Some studies allowed us to examine the impact of the presence of visual channels on negotiations (VIS = 1) because they compared negotiations in which these visual channels were present (e.g., face-to-face, video conference) with negotiations in which visual channels were absent (e.g., audio conference, computer chat, email; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1088868311417186">Purdy, Nye, &amp; Balakrishnan, 2000</xref>). It was also possible to disentangle the impact of vocal channels. Some studies, for example, made it possible to examine the presence of vocal channels in negotiations (VOC = 1) because they compared negotiations in which vocal channels were present (e.g., face-to-face, audio conference, video-conference) with negotiations in which vocal channels were absent (e.g., computer chat negotiations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1088868311417186">Suh, 1999</xref>). Other studies made it possible to analytically separate the impact of a lack of synchronicity (SYN = 1) because they compared synchronous communication (e.g., face-to-face, audio conferences, computer chats) with asynchronous communication (e.g., negotiations through the exchange of notes, voicemail, email; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1088868311417186">Loewenstein, Morris, Chakravarti, Thompson, &amp; Kopelman, 2005</xref>). We coded communication channel comparisons by categorizing them as synchronous versus asynchronous.</p>
<p>Measures of negotiation outcome quality were reported in 34 articles. Because some of these were multistudy articles or allowed for multiple comparisons (e.g., synchronous vs. asynchronous and visual vs. no visual), we could extract a total of 81 effect sizes. Because different studies reported more than one outcome variable, we focused our analyses on the two important indicators of negotiation outcome quality. In negotiations that included multiple issues, negotiators could make trade-offs and expand the pie by conceding on low-priority issues in exchange for gains on high-priority issues. Thus, for multi-issue negotiations, we included a measure of joint profit, the total value both negotiators created (typically the sum of the number of points each negotiator obtained). This is an indicator of negotiation outcome quality because it reflects how much negotiators integrated information on their relative priorities to utilize the available resources fully. When negotiations revolved around a single issue that allowed for profits for both sides, we included settlement ratio as our measure of outcome quality. This is an indicator of outcome quality because reaching <italic>a deal</italic> is better than <italic>no deal</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088868311417186">Bazerman &amp; Caroll, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1088868311417186">Pruitt &amp; Carnevale, 1993</xref>). Because all single-issue negotiations except one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1088868311417186">Loewenstein &amp; Morris, 2011</xref>) involved negotiations in which a deal was better than no deal, we dropped this specific experiment from the analyses. In the moderator analyses, we first provide the results for both outcomes in conjunction, followed by an analysis of each quality indicator separately.</p>

Each coder coded all studies, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. The percentage of disagreement for coding the objective study characteristics as well as the coding of moderators was close to zero. The first author independently coded all studies, and any remaining discrepancies were resolved in conference with the two coders.</p>

<title>Communication orientation</title>
<p>We coded the moderating impact of “orientation” using the instructions participants received prior to their negotiation. Three orientations were classified. Orientations were coded as <italic>neutral</italic> when the instruction materials did not provide any information that could foster cooperative or noncooperative intentions and explicitly invited unacquainted negotiators.</p>
<p>Orientations were coded as <italic>cooperative</italic> when participants were instructed to have high concern for the other negotiator’s outcome, had a positive interpersonal bond with the other side (e.g., because their negotiation was preceded by a getting-acquainted exercise or because they were negotiating with friends), shared common group membership, or anticipated future interaction with their counterpart. Research has demonstrated that these factors foster cooperative intentions among negotiators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1088868311417186">Haslam, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1088868311417186">Moore et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-1088868311417186">Swaab et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Orientations were coded as <italic>noncooperative</italic> when participants were instructed to pursue their own outcomes only (e.g., egoistic outcomes). In addition, we coded orientations as noncooperative when participants were instructed to do better than their counterpart (e.g., concern with relative gain).</p>
<p>A fourth and related subset constituted a group of studies that could not be coded as noncooperative or cooperative but also not as neutral because some of the participants may have had a previous experience with their counterpart. These were studies in which the impact of communication channels was examined as part of an in-class exercise but did not provide information about or control participants’ relationships. Because of the possibility that negotiators in these studies shared a history but that history could have been positive or negative, we excluded this subset from our analyses. This reduced the number of effect sizes in our analysis to a total of 72 effect sizes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1088868311417186">
<title>Cultural context</title>
<p>The cultural context of the negotiation was coded as (1) Eastern when the study was conducted in East Asian countries such as South Korea and Singapore and (2) Western when it was conducted in the United States or Western Europe.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1088868311417186">
<title>Methodological codings</title>
<p>Because cooperative and noncooperative orientations were manipulated differently across studies, we also coded the manipulation of negotiator orientation into three categories. The orientation manipulation was coded as (1) “individual” when orientations were manipulated through social motive instructions. For example, some studies instructed participants to care about their own outcomes only, or also about others’ outcomes as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1088868311417186">Lewis &amp; Fry, 1977</xref>). Orientation manipulation was coded as (2) “interpersonal” when the orientation manipulation involved the relationship between the two parties. For example, some studies manipulated cooperative intentions by having participants develop rapport first in a small-talk phase prior to their negotiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1088868311417186">Morris et al., 2002</xref>) or by informing participants that they would negotiate with the same person in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1088868311417186">Purdy et al., 2000</xref>). Orientation manipulation was classified as (3) “structural” when the manipulation induced cooperation or competition through other instructions. For example, to induce noncooperation, some studies manipulated the extent to which negotiators were accountable to their constituents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088868311417186">Carnevale et al., 1981</xref>). For the manipulation of noncooperation specifically, we tested for differences between the two types of manipulations to (1) adopt an egoistic motive or (2) be concerned with relative gain.</p>
<p>We also tested whether communication orientations were embedded in the nature of the task procedure (1) or independently manipulated from communication channels (2). We further coded for the type of sample (1 = <italic>undergrads</italic>, 2 = <italic>professionals</italic>), whether or not time in the negotiation experiment was restricted (1 = <italic>restricted</italic>, 2 = <italic>unrestricted</italic>), and publication status (1 = <italic>published</italic>, 2 = <italic>unpublished</italic>). To resolve any residual disagreements, coders went back to the research report together and reached consensus on the appropriate coding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1088868311417186">
<title>Computation and Analysis of Effect Sizes</title>
<p>Because our primary interest involved how the presence of communication channels influenced the likelihood of high-quality negotiation outcomes, we used the group (or dyad) as the level of analysis. Because of the relatively large number of empirical studies investigating these relationships and the likely existence of variables moderating the strength of association, we used a meta-analytic approach to integrate the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1088868311417186">Lipsey &amp; Wilson, 2001</xref>). In the original studies included in meta-analyses, effects of the independent variable on the dependent variables are typically reported in the form of an <italic>F</italic> or a <italic>t</italic> statistic or in the form of average treatment effects (means and standard deviations). Each of these statistics can be converted into an effect size index, which measures the magnitude of an effect—in this case, the magnitude of difference between the certain communication channels. In the case of this meta-analysis, we chose Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> coefficient as our measure of effect size. Effect sizes were weighted such that studies conducted with larger sample size carried more weight in the analyses. We coded effect sizes so that as the weighted effect size Cohen’s <italic>d<sub>w</sub></italic> gets larger, the effect that visual contact has on the quality of the negotiated outcome gets stronger and more positive. An effect size Cohen’s <italic>d<sub>w</sub></italic> with an absolute value of 0.20 is considered small, 0.50 is medium, and 0.80 is large. We used the unbiased effect size for our analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1088868311417186">Lipsey &amp; Wilson, 2001</xref>). As recommended by guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1088868311417186">Lipsey &amp; Wilson, 2001</xref>), we used the more conservative random-effects model with moderators to test for the effects of moderator variables, thus decreasing the probability of Type I errors.</p>

<title>Analytic overview</title>
<p>To determine whether the effect sizes were consistent across the studies reviewed, we tested the homogeneity of the effect sizes. When we found heterogeneous effect sizes, we explored moderator variables that might account for differences in the size of the effects across studies. We examined categorical models to test whether negotiator orientation, culture, social context, and study characteristics are related to heterogeneity of effect sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1088868311417186">Lipsey &amp; Wilson, 2001</xref>). The logic of this test is similar to ANOVA with the between-class goodness-of-fit statistic <italic>Q<sub>b</sub></italic> being analogous to a main effect, and the within-class goodness-of-fit statistic <italic>Q<sub>w</sub></italic> being analogous to homogeneity within each class. We conducted comparisons when there were at least four effect sizes in each class, when <italic>Q<sub>w</sub></italic> was significant, and when we had hypothesized a difference in effect sizes.</p>

<p>However, the support for the richness approach should be interpreted with caution because the effect sizes are small and the significant <italic>Q</italic> values revealed that effect sizes varied across studies and all homogeneity tests were statistically significant.

<title>Negotiator orientation as a moderator.</title>
<p>The communication orientation model predicted that the presence of visual channels, vocal channels, and communication synchronicity (a) helps negotiation outcome quality for negotiators with a neutral orientation, (b) does not affect negotiation outcome quality for negotiators with a cooperative orientation, and (c) hurts negotiation outcome quality for negotiators with a noncooperative orientation. To test the first three hypotheses, we used negotiator orientation as a moderator.</p>
<p>First, we examined whether communication orientation moderates the effect of the presence of all communication channels (visual, vocal, and synchronicity) combined on negotiation outcome quality. As predicted, the analysis of negotiator orientation revealed a significant between-classes effect, <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(2) = 58.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The mean effects for noncooperative studies (<italic>d</italic> = −0.84*) and cooperative studies (<italic>d</italic> = 0.10) differed from one another, <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 20.70, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and were both significantly smaller than neutral studies (<italic>d</italic> = 0.45*), <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 44.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 and <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 14.29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, respectively. The type of outcome did not moderate these findings: The impact of the presence of communication channels did not differ between settlement ratios and joint profit (<italic>p</italic> = .08 for neutral studies, <italic>p</italic> = .56 for cooperative studies, no comparison possible for noncooperative studies). Thus, the <italic>overall</italic> presence of communication channels (a) increased outcome quality for negotiators with a neutral orientation, (b) did not affect outcome quality for negotiators with a cooperative orientation, and (c) decreased outcome quality for negotiators with a noncooperative orientation.</p>
<p>Next, we examined the hypothesis that communication orientation moderates the effect of the presence of each communication channel separately. First, we examined the moderating impact of negotiator orientation on the effect of the presence of visual channels on outcome quality. As the first column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1088868311417186">Table 4</xref> shows, the analysis of negotiator orientation revealed a significant between-classes effect <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(2) = 61.69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The mean effects for noncooperative studies (<italic>d</italic> = −1.05*) and cooperative studies (<italic>d</italic> = 0.14) differed from one another, <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 24.88, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and were both significantly smaller than neutral studies (<italic>d</italic> = 0.51*), <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 44.74, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 and <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 11.00, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, respectively. The type of outcome did not moderate these findings: The impact of the presence of visual channels did not differ between settlement ratios and joint profit (<italic>p</italic> = .24 for neutral studies, <italic>p</italic> = .66 for cooperative studies, no comparison possible for noncooperative studies). Thus, the presence of visual channels (a) increased outcome quality for negotiators with a neutral orientation, (b) did not affect outcome quality for negotiators with a cooperative orientation, and (c) decreased outcome quality for negotiators with a noncooperative orientation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1088868311417186">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We next examined the hypothesis that negotiator orientation moderates the effect of the absence of vocal channels on negotiation outcome quality. The analysis of negotiator orientation revealed a significant between-classes effect <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(2) = 22.81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The mean effects for noncooperative studies (<italic>d</italic> = −0.38*) and cooperative studies (<italic>d</italic> = 0.08) differed from one another, <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 3.93, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and were both significantly smaller than neutral studies (<italic>d</italic> = 0.53*), <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 16.57, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 and <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 12.95, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, respectively. Again, the type of outcome did not moderate these findings: The impact of the presence of vocal channels did not differ between settlement ratios and joint profit (<italic>p</italic> = .15 for neutral studies, <italic>p</italic> = .52 for cooperative studies, no comparison possible for noncooperative studies). So the presence of vocal channels (a) increased outcome quality for negotiators with a neutral orientation, (b) did not affect outcome quality for negotiators with a cooperative orientation, and (c) decreased outcome quality for negotiators with a noncooperative orientation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1088868311417186">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we examined whether negotiator orientation moderates the effect of the absence of communication synchronicity on negotiation outcome quality. The analysis of negotiator orientation revealed a significant between-classes effect, <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(2) = 22.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The mean effects for noncooperative studies (<italic>d</italic> = −0.57*) and cooperative studies (<italic>d</italic> = 0.04) differed from one another, <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 3.90, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and were both significantly smaller than neutral studies (<italic>d</italic> = 0.58*), <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 18.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 and <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 14.83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, respectively. Again, the type of outcome did not moderate these findings: The impact of the presence vocal channels did not differ between settlement ratios and joint profit (<italic>p</italic> = .93 for neutral studies, <italic>p</italic> = .98 for cooperative studies, no comparison possible for noncooperative studies). In all, the presence of communication synchronicity (a) increased outcome quality for negotiators with a neutral orientation, (b) did not affect outcome quality for negotiators with a cooperative orientation, and (c) decreased outcome quality for negotiators with a noncooperative orientation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1088868311417186">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the three meta-analyses of visual channels, vocal channels, and communication synchronicity revealed nonsignificant homogeneity statistics (<italic>Q</italic><sub>W</sub>) for the cooperative and neutral categories, indicating that these models are correctly specified. However, the significant <italic>Q</italic><sub>W</sub> for noncooperative studies in all three analyses suggests that this effect may be further qualified by additional moderators. We tested additional moderators of this effect in the analyses of methodological moderators.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-1088868311417186">
<title>The impact of culture</title>
<p>As an additional test of the communication orientation model, we tested the hypothesis that for negotiators with a neutral orientation, the presence of (a) visual channels, (b) vocal channels, and (c) synchronicity increases negotiation outcome quality more in Western cultures than in Eastern cultures, in which people presumably enter into negotiations with a more cooperative orientation.</p>
<p>As predicted and consistent with the communication orientation model, visual channels had a stronger positive impact on negotiation outcome quality in Western cultures (<italic>d</italic> = 0.64*) than in Eastern cultures (<italic>d</italic> = 0.19), <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 8.81 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The type of outcome did not moderate these effects: The impact of the presence of visual channels did not differ between settlement ratios and joint profit (<italic>p</italic> = .52 for Western culture studies).</p>
<p>Similar effects were found for the impact of vocal channels. That is, the presence of vocal channels positively influenced negotiation outcome quality in Western cultures (<italic>d</italic> = 0.64*) more strongly than in Eastern cultures (<italic>d</italic> = 0.24), <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 5.99, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. The type of outcome did not moderate these effects: The impact of the presence of visual channels did not differ for settlement ratios and joint profit (<italic>p</italic> = .52 for Western culture studies).</p>
<p>There was an insufficient number of effect sizes to compare the impact of communication synchronicity in Eastern cultures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-1088868311417186">
<title>Methodological moderators</title>
<p>Because we retrieved only two effect sizes manipulating noncooperative orientations through a concern with relative gain, we could not test for meaningful differences between different manipulations. Nevertheless, descriptive analyses indicate that the impact of noncooperative orientations was not further moderated by the type of manipulation (egoistic vs. relative gain), <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 2.64, <italic>p</italic> = .27.</p>
<p>To explore the impact of methodological moderators further, we tested whether the manipulation of negotiator orientation, sample type, time restriction, and publication status moderated the impact of the presence of visual channels, vocal channels, and synchronicity on negotiation outcome quality. Analyses revealed that for negotiators with neutral orientations, the presence of visual channels and vocal channels positively influenced outcome quality less strongly for undergraduate samples (<italic>d</italic> = 0.31* for visual channels and <italic>d</italic> = 0.39* for vocal channels) than for professional samples (<italic>d</italic> = 0.88* for visual channels and <italic>d</italic> = 0.80* for vocal channels), <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 12.81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 and <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 5.90, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, respectively. No moderating effects were found for time restriction, publication status, or whether the manipulation of orientation was embedded in the task or independently manipulated.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-1088868311417186">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Taken together, the negotiation meta-analysis strongly supports the communication orientation model by demonstrating that the presence of communication channels improved negotiation outcome quality for neutrally oriented negotiators, had no effect on outcome quality for cooperatively oriented negotiators, and decreased outcome quality for negotiators with a noncooperative orientation. These findings strongly support Hypotheses 1, 2, and 3.</p>
<p>We also explored whether the effects of communication channels on the outcomes for those with a neutral orientation differ across cultures. We found support for Hypothesis 4 such that the positive effects of communication channels were more pronounced in Western cultures, in which people presumably enter into negotiations with a neutral orientation, than in Eastern cultures, in which people likely enter into negotiations with a more cooperative orientation.</p>
<p>Although the meta-analysis provides strong support for the communication orientation model in the context of negotiations, we believe that the model is also applicable to other contexts that (a) involve social interaction and (b) have the potential to produce an objectively high- or low-quality outcome. Specifically, we propose that the communication orientation model will also apply to group decision-making contexts because these require information sharing and integration to achieve a high-quality outcome.</p>
<p>Importantly, negotiation and group decision-making tasks differ in their incentive structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1088868311417186">McGrath, 1984</xref>). Although negotiators generally face a mixed-motive incentive structure, members of group decision-making tasks generally have no other goal than to reach a common, high-quality decision. Because of their cooperative incentive structure, group decision-making tasks also serve as a more conservative testing ground for the communication orientation model. That is, the cooperative nature of group decision-making tasks should make it more difficult to find differences between cooperative and neutral negotiators because the cooperative incentive structure might give rise to more cooperative behavior overall, thereby minimizing the differences between neutrally oriented and cooperatively oriented communicators. To examine whether the communication orientation model would also be applicable to group decision-making contexts, we conducted an additional meta-analysis that tested whether communicator orientation moderated the impact of communication channels (visual, vocal, and synchronous) on the quality of group decision-making outcomes.</p>

Recent issues of psychology, communication, information systems, and organizational behavior journals were hand searched for additional articles.

<title>Criteria for Inclusion</title>
<p>The studies were individually examined and included if they (a) reported a test of the relationship between at least one of the communication channels (the presence vs. the absence of visual channels, or vocal channels, or synchronicity) and the quality of group decision-making outcomes, (b) allowed for social interaction between the participants, (c) included a task that required interdependence and information sharing between group members, (d) included a task with an optimal or correct solution, and (e) provided the statistical information needed to compute effect sizes. This included intellective and judgmental decision making tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1088868311417186">McGrath, 1984</xref>) but ruled out studies using preprogrammed opponents, brainstorming tasks, and execution tasks. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1088868311417186">Table 5</xref> presents an overview of the studies included in each meta-analysis and their key attributes. As can be seen in columns VIS (visual), VOC (vocal), and SYN (synchronicity), different studies allowed us to compare the impact of the absence of these channels.</p>

<p>The presence of communication channels in a group decision-making setting was coded in the same manner as in the negotiation meta-analysis.</p>
<p>Measures of decision quality were reported in 31 articles. Because some of these were multistudy articles or allowed for multiple comparisons, we could extract a total of 63 effect sizes. We focused our analyses on whether or not groups identified the correct decision (intellective task) or whether they achieved group consensus (judgmental task).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1088868311417186">Table 5</xref> provides an overview of each category in our coding scheme and a description of each moderator. Coding decisions were initially made by two coders who were trained (discussion of coding scheme, practice coding, how to deal with disagreement) prior to coding all articles. One of the coders was also involved in coding the negotiation meta-analysis. As in the negotiation meta-analysis, each coder coded all studies, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. The percentage of disagreement for coding the study characteristics and coding moderators was close to zero. As in the first meta-analysis, the first author independently coded all studies, and any remaining discrepancies were resolved in conference with the two coders.</p>

<p>We coded the moderating impact of “communication orientation” using the instructions participants received prior to their decision-making activity. Two orientations were classified.</p>
<p>Orientations were coded as <italic>neutral</italic> when the instruction materials did not provide any information that could foster cooperative intentions and explicitly invited unacquainted group members. In addition, we coded orientations as neutral when the study randomly assigned classmates of large undergraduate classes to ad hoc groups. As in the negotiation meta-analysis, we excluded studies that did not randomly assign classmates to ad hoc groups.</p>
<p>Orientations were coded as <italic>cooperative</italic> when participants had a positive bond with their fellow group members (e.g., because their decision-making group was preceded by a getting-acquainted exercise or because they were working with friends), shared a common identity, or anticipated future interaction with their counterpart.</p>
<p>In contrast to the negotiation meta-analysis, we did not obtain any studies that enabled us to examine the impact of noncooperative orientations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section36-1088868311417186">
<title>Cultural context</title>
<p>The cultural context of the study was coded as (1) Eastern when the study was conducted in Middle East or East Asian countries such as South Korea and Singapore and as (2) Western when it was conducted in the United States or Western Europe.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section37-1088868311417186">
<title>Methodological codings</title>
<p>As in the negotiation meta-analysis, we coded for whether communication orientations were embedded in the task procedure (1) or independently manipulated (2), the type of sample (1 = <italic>undergraduates</italic>, 2 = <italic>professionals</italic>), and whether or not time was restricted (1 = <italic>restricted</italic>, 2 = <italic>unrestricted</italic>). Because group size is an important variable in group decision making, we also coded for the number of group members within each study. Because all the studies in our final sample except one were published, we could not test the impact of publication status.</p>

<title>Computation and Analysis of Effect Sizes</title>
<p>Since our primary interest was how the presence of communication channels influenced the likelihood of high-quality group decision-making outcomes, we used the group (dyad) as the level of analysis. Effect sizes were coded and analyzed in the same way as in the negotiation meta-analysis.</p>

<p>First, we examined whether communication orientation moderates the overall effect of the presence of all communication channels (visual, vocal, and synchronicity) combined on group decision outcome quality. As predicted, the mean effects for studies with a neutral orientation were significant (<italic>d</italic> = 0.43*), whereas those for cooperative studies were not (<italic>d</italic> = 0.02), <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 7.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The type of outcome did not moderate these findings: The presence of communication channels did not affect intellective task outcomes and judgment task outcomes differently (<italic>p</italic> = .71 for neutral studies, <italic>p</italic> = .77 for cooperative studies). Thus, the presence of communication channels (a) increased outcome quality for decision makers with a neutral orientation and (b) did not affect outcome quality for negotiators with a cooperative orientation.</p>
<p>Next, we examined the hypothesis that communication orientation moderates the effect of the presence of each communication channel separately.</p>
<p>As predicted, the mean effects for studies comparing the presence versus absence of visual channels for people with a neutral orientation were significant (<italic>d</italic> = 0.48*), whereas those for cooperative studies were not (<italic>d</italic> = 0.03), <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 7.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The type of outcome did not moderate these findings: The presence of visual channels had similar effects on intellective task outcomes as on judgment task outcomes (<italic>p</italic> = .43 for neutral studies, <italic>p</italic> = .75 for cooperative studies). Thus, the presence of visual channels (a) increased outcome quality for decision makers with a neutral orientation and (b) did not affect outcome quality for negotiators with a cooperative orientation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1088868311417186">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We next examined the hypothesis that communication orientation moderates the effect of the presence of vocal channels on outcome quality. As predicted, the mean effects for studies on groups with a neutral orientation were significant (<italic>d</italic> = 0.56*), whereas those for studies on groups with a cooperative orientation were not (<italic>d</italic> = 0.03), <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 9.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The type of outcome did not moderate these findings: The effects of the presence of vocal channels did not differ on intellective task outcomes and judgment task outcomes (<italic>p</italic> = .81 for neutral studies, <italic>p</italic> = .72 for cooperative studies). Thus, the presence of vocal channels (a) increased outcome quality for decision makers with a neutral orientation and (b) did not affect outcome quality for negotiators with a cooperative orientation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1088868311417186">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we examined the hypothesis that communication orientation moderates the effect of the presence of synchronicity on outcome quality. Although the mean effects for studies on groups with a neutral orientation (<italic>d</italic> = 0.17) were descriptively greater than the mean effects for studies on groups with a cooperative orientation (<italic>d</italic> = −0.01), neither one differed significantly from zero or from each other, <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 0.57, <italic>ns</italic>. The type of outcome did not moderate these findings: The presence of synchronicity had comparable effects on intellective task outcomes as on judgment task outcomes (<italic>p</italic> = .14 for neutral studies, no comparison possible for cooperative studies). Thus, the presence of synchronicity did not increase outcome quality for decision makers with a neutral orientation or for decision makers with a cooperative orientation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1088868311417186">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<p>The pattern for the impact of visual and vocal channels completely replicates the findings from the negotiation meta-analysis. Decision making conducted with group members with a neutral orientation consistently showed that the presence of visual channels and vocal channels significantly increased outcome quality regardless of the type of group decision-making outcome. In contrast, for those groups with a cooperative orientation, there was no effect of visual or vocal channels.</p>

<sec id="section42-1088868311417186">
<title>The impact of culture</title>
<p>We tested the hypothesis that for group members with a neutral orientation, the presence of visual channels increases outcome quality more strongly in Western cultures than in Eastern cultures. As predicted and consistent with our communication orientation model, the presence of visual channels had a positive impact on outcome quality in Western cultures (<italic>d</italic> = 0.54*) but not in Eastern cultures (<italic>d</italic> = 0.05), <italic>Q<sub>B</sub></italic>(1) = 3.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. The type of outcome did not moderate these effects: The absence of visual channels had a similar impact on intellective task outcomes as it had on judgment task outcomes (<italic>p</italic> = .69 for Western culture studies). There was an insufficient number of effect sizes to compare the impact of vocal channels and communication synchronicity in Eastern cultures.</p>
<p>The moderating effect of culture replicates the findings from the negotiation meta-analysis. Decision-making studies conducted with Western cultures found that the presence of visual channels increased outcome quality in intellective and judgment tasks. In contrast, there was no effect of visual channels for those studies conducted in Eastern cultures.</p>

<title>Methodological moderators</title>

<p>The results from the group decision-making meta-analysis strongly support the predictions made by the communication orientation model: The positive impact of the presence of communication channels on group decision making was lower when people held a cooperative orientation compared to when they had a neutral orientation for both intellective and judgment decision tasks, supporting Hypotheses 1 and 2. Replicating the findings from the negotiation meta-analysis, we further found that culture moderated the findings for people with a neutral orientation such that the positive effects of visual channels were more pronounced in Western cultures than in Eastern cultures, supporting Hypothesis 4.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>The current meta-analyses compared the communication orientation model with three existing theories to understand the impact that communication channels had on high-quality negotiation and group decision-making outcomes (richness approach, SIP, and SIDE). The communication orientation model proposed that the extent to which communicators approach an interdependent task with a cooperative versus noncooperative orientation influences how the presence or absence of communication channels affects their ability to integrate information and, as a result, to achieve high-quality outcomes.</p>
<p>Consistent with the richness approach, our results demonstrated that people are more likely to achieve integrative negotiation outcomes or high-quality group decision-making outcomes when their communication contains visual channels, vocal channels, or synchronicity compared to people who communicate in the absence of these channels. However, this support for the richness approach comes with a critical caveat: The presence of communication channels benefits the quality of outcomes only when people had neither a noncooperative nor a cooperative orientation prior to their interaction. This finding shows that the presence of communication channels can significantly increase outcome quality provided that people are neither strong cooperatively or noncooperative predisposition. These findings provide clear insight into when to expect support for the richness approach.</p>
<p>Consistent with claims made by SIP, we found that the presence of communication channels was less likely to lead to high-quality outcomes when interpersonal relationships were already developed and positive (i.e., and thus involved a cooperative orientation). However, contrary to the SIP prediction that the impact of communication channels would be weaker when people are given more time for their social interaction, we did not find that time moderated the impact of communication channels on outcome quality. This finding is somewhat surprising because negotiations and group decision-making tasks are both contexts in which time would appear to be necessary to share more information and achieve higher quality outcomes.</p>
<p>We also found support for the SIDE model such that the presence of communication channels did not significantly affect outcome quality when negotiators or groups had a cooperative orientation prior to their decision making. Although the SIDE model primarily focuses on the role of personal and social identities, we found that in addition to the moderating role of identity, the presence of trust, prosocial motives, and positive interpersonal bonds also mitigated the positive consequences of the presence of communication channels. Thus, the communication orientation model extends the SIDE model by acknowledging that factors beyond personal and social identity can cultivate a cooperative orientation that can bridge the difficulties people face in integrating information when they do not have access to communication channels. This finding further suggests that cooperative intentions can be sufficient to achieve high-quality interaction outcomes even without seeing, hearing, or directly responding to others.</p>
<p>Despite some support for the richness model, SIP, and SIDE, the communication orientation model provides a more parsimonious approach to thinking about the effects of communication channels in negotiation and group decision making. The communication orientation model provides greater explanatory power over the richness, SIP, and SIDE models because it specifies when the presence of communication channels can in fact be detrimental.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1088868311417186">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Based on the idea that the orientation with which communicators approach an interaction is critical because it shapes the way in which people interact, we found that noncooperatively oriented negotiators are more likely to achieve high-quality negotiation outcomes when their conversation <italic>lacks</italic> visual channels, vocal channels, or synchronicity. Because noncooperative orientations can form a roadblock to agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-1088868311417186">White et al., 2004</xref>) and the presence of communication channels can intensify antagonism, we predicted and found that the negative impact of noncooperation could be reduced by removing visual contact, auditory cues, and communication synchronicity.</p>
<p>Overall, we found strong support for the communication orientation model. Ultimately, the pattern of findings from the meta-analyses rejects the central main effect assumption underlying the richness approach that more communication channels are always better or necessary for complex tasks such as negotiations and group decisions. And the communication orientation model goes beyond SIP and SIDE, which are silent on when the presence of communication channels (but not on the presence of social cues) might be debilitating for achieving high-quality outcomes. We believe our model provides a parsimonious synthesis of the literature because it successfully reconciles the contradictory research findings and predicts the precise pattern of the relationship between communication orientation (neutral, cooperative, and noncooperative) and the impact of communication channels on negotiation and group decision-making outcomes (positive, no effect, and negative).</p>
<p>Additional support for the communication orientation model was provided by the analyses of culture. We found that the positive impact of the presence of communication channels was greater in Western cultures than in Eastern cultures. Consistent with the claim that cooperative orientations decrease the impact of communication channels, communicators in an interdependent (Eastern) cultural context, who presumably approach the average negotiation or group decision with a more cooperative orientation, were less affected by communication channels both in negotiations and when making group decisions. For independent cultures such as those found in the West, where negotiators and decision makers likely have neutral orientations, communication channels were necessary to achieve high-quality outcomes.</p>
<p>For the domain of group decision making, our meta-analysis could not test our full model because no studies have manipulated noncooperative orientations. The lack of noncooperative studies in the group decision-making meta-analysis might be a result of the fact that noncooperative intentions are more common in negotiations than for group decision-making contexts and, as a result, more often studied. Nevertheless, the communication orientation model should apply to noncooperative orientations in group decision-making studies. In fact, two recent studies involving a face-to-face intellective group decision-making task by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-1088868311417186">Toma and Butera (2009)</xref> revealed that group members with a noncooperative orientation were more likely to withhold unshared information and more reluctant to disconfirm their initial preferences than group members with a cooperative orientation. As a result, decision quality was lower under a noncooperative definition of the situation than under cooperative definition. Participants in these studies interacted face-to-face, and although this research did not compare the presence of different communication channels, the results are consistent with the communication orientation model in showing that noncooperative orientations can lead to negative outcomes when more communication channels are present.</p>
<p>Finally, the effects in the group decision-making meta-analyses tended to be stronger for vocal and visual channels than for synchronicity. The weaker findings for synchronicity suggest that the opportunity to give direct feedback is not as important for achieving high-quality group decision-making outcomes as seeing and hearing fellow group members. Future research should explore the conditions in which synchronicity is essential for people to develop the rapport necessary to share and integrate information effectively.</p>
<sec id="section46-1088868311417186">
<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>Our meta-analyses enabled us to reconcile the competing theoretical perspectives of the richness approach and SIP and SIDE. By focusing on the orientations that people hold prior to their conversation, we were able to explain and integrate the contradictory findings found in the literature.</p>
<p>A major contribution of the communication orientation model is that it provides a coherent framework for negotiation and group decision-making research, which has lacked a model that parsimoniously explains the role of communication channels. Although the dual concern model has made somewhat similar predictions by proposing a link between the effects of people’s concerns about their own and others’ outcomes on subsequent behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1088868311417186">Pruitt &amp; Carnevale, 1993</xref>), this model is restricted to negotiations and does not address the role of communication channels. By contrast, the communication orientation model addresses the specific role of communication channels and speaks to the domains of both negotiation and group decision making.</p>
<p>Research has consistently found that people from interdependent cultures have a more cooperative interpersonal approach with others from their own culture than people from independent cultures. Finding cultural differences in the effect of communication channels is entirely consistent with our communication orientation model. However, factors other than interdependence may also distinguish Eastern and Western cultures. Future research should explicitly measure cooperative orientations to see if they account for the between-cultures difference in the effect of communication channels on negotiation and group decision-making outcomes.</p>
<p>Although we focused on the differential impact of communication channels within different cultural contexts, our results do not speak to intercultural settings. Unfortunately, no studies were found that compared the presence of communication channels on intercultural decision making and negotiation directly. Because information integration might be more difficult in intercultural settings, the joint impact of communication channels and orientations might be stronger in intercultural communication than in intracultural communication. On one hand, if intercultural negotiations simply produce a neutral orientation, then communication channels may be necessary for a high-quality outcome to be achieved. On the other hand, if intercultural negotiations activate noncooperative orientations, then the absence of visual, vocal, and synchronous channels may facilitate achieving high-quality outcomes. Future research is needed to investigate these claims.</p>
<p>Although we included a broad range of categories to operationalize noncooperative orientations—interdependence theory by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1088868311417186">Kelley and Thibaut (1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1088868311417186">1978</xref>), game-theoretic analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1088868311417186">Schelling (1960)</xref>, and conflict theory by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1088868311417186">Deutsch (1985)</xref>—all highlight that individualistic orientations induce different motivational, cognitive, and behavioral tendencies than competitive orientations. Despite the fact that the negotiation meta-analysis included only two competitive studies that had similar effects to individualistic studies, future research should examine the distinction between different types of noncooperative orientations and how these affect the role of communication channels on group decision and negotiation in greater detail.</p>
<p>A final shortcoming of the studies included in the meta-analyses is that all were time constrained. This fact is particularly important because the impact of communication channels can change over time as people’s orientations also change. Contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-1088868311417186">Walther’s (1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-1088868311417186">1994</xref>) relationship development model proposing that interactions become more cooperative over time, we did not find that the impact of communication channels decreased when interactions took more time. However, one can imagine that interactions can also become noncooperative over time, which would also change the impact of communication channels. Our model’s explanatory power requires knowing the communicator orientations at a given moment in time and then examining the immediate effects of communication channels. Future research should focus on these issues in greater detail and test whether the communication orientation model can predict the immediate effect of communication channels as orientations ebb and flow over time.</p>

<title>Practical Implications</title>
<p>The current research offers guidance for how negotiators and decision makers should manage communication channels. Specifically, our meta-analyses suggest both how to deal with the loss of communication channels as well as when to reduce the available channels for communications. First, our findings suggest that when people are unacquainted, using richer communication channels increase the likelihood that they will develop the rapport and trust necessary to integrate information effectively. Even when it is not possible to meet face-to-face, the meta-analyses show that having a phone or video conference to establish rapport is preferable to a text-based conversation, especially over asynchronous communication such as email. Perhaps the disastrous communication error in the Mars Climate Orbiter example could have been avoided if video or audio conferences had been used more frequently. Another method is for participants in a negotiation or group discussion to become acquainted prior to the conversation. Although it may not always possible to do this face-to-face, evidence suggests that short phone calls to engage in small talk are sufficient to establish the cooperative orientation needed to overcome the difficulties associated with text-based collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1088868311417186">Morris et al., 2002</xref>). If initial small talk is not an option, communicators can also frame the content of their communication to trigger cooperative orientations. For example, negotiators who use more collective frames of reference such as “we,” “us,” or “ours” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1088868311417186">Swaab, Kern, Diermeier, &amp; Medvec, 2009</xref>) or linguistically mimic their counterpart early in the negotiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1088868311417186">Swaab, Maddux, &amp; Sinaceur, 2011</xref>) are treated more cooperatively, even when already immersed in an online environment.</p>
<p>Our results also provide advice on how to manage communication settings when negotiators come to the bargaining table with a noncooperative or hostile orientation. Consistent with the Camp David example, our findings show that when negotiators have a noncooperative orientation, they may be better off restricting their contact and face-to-face communication. This might even take the form of restricting any communication, especially early on. Indeed, a series of studies demonstrated that third parties were more effective in resolving employment disputes when they organized a private meeting with each disputant separately first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1088868311417186">Swaab &amp; Brett, 2011</xref>). Moreover, these initial meetings were beneficial only when the third party built trust and did not discuss the nature of the conflict. Consistent with the communication orientation model, these findings suggest that when communicators have a noncooperative approach, it may be beneficial to eliminate all communication between them and to have a third party establish a cooperative orientation toward each party separately. This finding is of particular importance because current mediation training programs dissuade mediators from having private conversations prior to joint meetings. Corroborating these findings, the meta-analysis suggests that sometimes the absence of communication channels can help negotiators overcome their noncooperative orientation that would otherwise have been a roadblock to agreement.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results of the current meta-analyses support the validity and usefulness of the communication orientation model for understanding the impact of communication channels on negotiation and group decision making. By focusing on the extent to which communicators approach their interactions with cooperative, noncooperative, or neutral orientations, the model parsimoniously explains the full range of findings of the effect of communication channels on negotiation and group decision-making outcomes. In both negotiations and group decisions, the presence of communication channels increased the attainment of high-quality negotiation and decision-making outcomes only when neither cooperation nor noncooperation was high. However, when cooperation was the dominant orientation, communication channels neither helped nor hindered the ability to achieve high-quality outcomes. But when noncooperation dominated at the bargaining table, visual, vocal, and synchronous channels actually <italic>diminished</italic> outcome quality. The communication orientation model offers promise, at both the theoretical and practical levels, for higher quality decisions and sustained peace such as the one achieved with the historic handshake between Sadat and Begin at Camp David.</p>

<p>Although groups can make consensually bad judgments, the studies we used typically examined tasks where reaching agreement was the primary outcome variable and preferred over no agreement. Moreover, task type is controlled for in both meta-analyses.</p></fn>

<p>We further predict that for communicators with a neutral orientation, the presence of (a) visual channels, (b) vocal channels, and (c) synchronicity is likely to increase outcome quality more strongly in intercultural interactions than in intracultural interactions. Unfortunately, we could not test this hypothesis because of the lack of studies investigating the impact of communication channels on cross-cultural interactions. We discuss the implications of the communication orientation model for cross-cultural interactions in the general discussion.</p></fn>

<p>Although the social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE) does not make specific predictions regarding how the interaction between communication orientations and communication cues can yield detrimental effects, our findings are consistent with the strategic side of SIDE, which proposes that identifiably of a threatening out-group can produce negative effects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1088868311417186">Reicher &amp; Levine, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1088868311417186">Spears &amp; Lea, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1088868311417186">Spears, Postmes, Lea, &amp; Wolbert, 2002</xref>).</p></fn>
