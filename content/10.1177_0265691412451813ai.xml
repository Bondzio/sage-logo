<sec id="sec1-0265691412451813ai"><title>Elizabeth White, <italic>The Socialist Alternative to Bolshevik Russia: The Socialist Revolutionary Party, 1917–39</italic>, Routledge: Abingdon, 2011; ix + 180 pp.; 9780415435840, £80.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>Although it is not immediately obvious from the title, this is a book about the Socialist Revolutionary (SR) Party emigration in Prague between the two world wars. The author believes that the activities and intellectual life of the émigrés forms part of the history of twentieth-century Russian political thought as well as adding to an understanding of developments in the Soviet Union in the period. She also considers that the subject contributes to the understanding of twentieth-century Russian history, as the SR Party represents the continuation of <italic>narodnichestvo</italic>, one of the most important currents of Russian social and political thought.</p>
<p>The SR Party émigrés settled in Prague with the support of the Czechoslovak President Tomas Masaryk and the Foreign Minister Edvard Beneš. The Czechoslovak government hoped that when the Bolshevik regime fell – as they were sure it would – the SRs would be part of a government of moderate socialists. The Czechoslovak government supported the SR émigrés materially, making it possible for them to publish the journal <italic>Volya Rossii</italic> and the official newspaper <italic>Revolyutsionnaya Rossiya</italic>, which was edited by the SR leader Viktor Chernov.</p>
<p>In the early 1920s the Prague SRs were optimistic, confident that the Bolshevik regime would not last long, the New Economic Policy (NEP) seeming to furnish proof that the Bolsheviks faced a fundamental contradiction of being a Marxist party in an overwhelmingly agrarian country. They claimed that Bolshevik rule had not resulted in the industrialization of Russia, but in its agrarianization. The peasant commune (<italic>mir</italic>) had survived and grown stronger, the middle peasant was thriving and the co-operative movement had continued to develop. It was particularly gratifying for the Prague SRs to note that among the Bolsheviks Bukharin and his followers were adopting at least part of the SR analysis. Nevertheless they did not see Bukharin as a realistic alternative to Bolshevik orthodoxy, as his first loyalties lay with the Bolshevik party rather than with the peasantry.</p>
<p>White shows that the issue which caused most dissension among the Prague SRs was the national question, in particular the Ukrainians’ claim to independence. Chernov was an enthusiastic upholder of the right of nations to self-determination, and to advance this cause set up the ‘Socialist League of the New East’ in 1926. Most Prague SRs, however, believed in retaining the integrity of the former Russian Empire, and in a rare show of support for the Soviet government, claimed that the national question in Russia had, on the whole, been satisfactorily resolved.</p>
<p>The Prague SRs’ close study of developments in the Soviet Union from their peculiar viewpoint enabled them to predict more accurately than most observers of the day the course taken by the Stalin regime. Unlike Trotsky and the oppositionists inside Russia, they were not taken by surprise by Stalin’s left turn at the end of the 1920s. Yet the collectivization of agriculture presented the Prague SRs with something of a dilemma. An outright rejection of the policy would have meant condemning their own Party programme, which called for collective production in the future.</p>
<p>In this original study the author has done a very competent job in telling the story of the Prague SR émigrés, and she is right to say that their study is part of European history. Their commentary also makes possible a more profound understanding of developments in the Soviet Union, though it would have been useful to know to what extent the Soviet authorities modified what they did or said to avoid giving credence to the SR émigrés.</p>
<p>Since it is the author’s contention that the Prague SRs represented a continuation of <italic>narodnichestvo</italic>, it is surprising that the treatment of <italic>narodnichestvo</italic> is so inadequate. As White is aware, Richard Pipes ‘has argued that the concept of “<italic>narodnichestvo</italic>” was actually popularized by Russian Marxists at the end of the nineteenth century as a kind of slur to link other socialists with Slavophiles and other “mystics”’ (8). White doesn’t investigate this idea further, but a little research would reveal that Pipes has a lot of evidence to support his contention that ‘<italic>narodnichestvo</italic>’ was a catch-all concept which embraced a spectrum of views that the early Russian Marxists did not agree with. For example, N. K. Mikhailovskii, writing in 1893 denied that he was a <italic>narodnik</italic> and declared that he only knew two persons who accepted the designation, and each understood it differently. So if, as White goes on to say, ‘SRs were proud to call themselves <italic>narodniks</italic>’, the question arises: in what sense did they do so? Even though this question is not the main focus of the book, some discussion of it would have enhanced its value to its intended audience.</p>
