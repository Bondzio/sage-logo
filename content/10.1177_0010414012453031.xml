<abstract>
<p>Literature on substate mobilization in Europe has provided some useful insights into the factors and mechanisms shaping territorial interest representation in Brussels. Although recent studies have enhanced our understanding of the determinants of cooperative and bypassing paradiplomacy, those underpinning conflict have remained rather obscure. Using a new data set with information on more than 100 substate offices in Brussels, this article sheds some light on the determinants of conflict between member state diplomacy and substate paradiplomacy. It argues that they are very different from those of bypassing and cooperation and that resource richness and diplomatic accreditation significantly affect its frequency. These findings not only are robust to multilevel modeling and nonparametric bootstrapping but also are of theoretical import as they highlight that devolution and party political incongruence fail to affect the frequency of conflict in Brussels.</p>

<p>Contrary to expectations, academic interest in the Brussels activities of European substate entities (SSEs) has not died away. These SSEs, understood as the level of government and/or administration immediately beneath that of the state, have grown in powers and numbers throughout Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414012453031">Hooghe, Marks, &amp; Schakel, 2010</xref>). Though the idea of the emergence of a “Europe of the regions” did fade from both academic and practitioners’ narratives, territorial authorities have continued to invest resources both at home and abroad to strengthen their involvement in the European Union’s (EU) policy-making processes. This investment has manifested itself through the creation and expansion not only of “European” units in the home administrations but also of representational offices directly in Brussels.</p>
<p>A voluminous literature has analyzed these developments. It has shed some light on a number of important questions ranging from the determinants of territorial interest representation in Brussels, its objectives and purported influence, to the various channels used to ventilate such interests from the subnational to the supranational level. One comparatively neglected question has been that of the interaction between this growing substate activity in Brussels and the activities of their own member states. Much of this neglect can be accounted for by the fact that it was commonly assumed that if SSEs invested resources to represent interests at such a remote and complex level of governance, it would necessarily be to promote interests that had been ignored or blocked by their own member state. These activities would, inherently, bypass the member state. This assumption was rarely challenged. However, a number of authors have underlined that territorial interest representation can indeed bypass the member state but can also be conducted in tandem with it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414012453031">Criekemans &amp; Duran, 2010</xref>, p. 31; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0010414012453031">Soldatos, 1990</xref>, p. 38). This has encouraged some authors to explore the determinants of cooperation and bypassing on the European scene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012453031">Bauer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010414012453031">Callanan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012453031">Jeffery, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414012453031">Keating &amp; Hooghe, 2006</xref>). Their research has suggested that factors such as party political configurations and devolution levels are useful predictors of the nature of the interaction between state diplomacy and substate paradiplomacy.</p>
<p>If it is known that SSEs cooperate with but also bypass their member state and if some of the factors affecting these two types of activities have become more apparent, the determinants of <italic>conflicting</italic> interest representation have yet to be systematically explored. Part of the puzzle has been that bypassing and conflicting interest representation have often been conflated. Indeed, although cooperation is a particularly narrow concept that can be defined as working together toward the achievement of similar policy objectives, that of bypassing is, by essence, broader. Obviously, any concept can be further unpacked and—not unlike a Russian doll—infinitely broken down into subtypes. However, bypassing is a less strictly specified category and encompasses a number of subpatterns that could be the result of different data generating processes. As pointed out elsewhere, bypassing comes in at least two forms: one that creates open conflict between the state and its SSE and one that does not and either goes unnoticed or is tolerated by the member state. Conflictual, inconspicuous, and tolerated bypassing may have different determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010414012453031">Tatham, 2010a</xref>, p. 90). In other words, if SSEs work in tandem with their member state on certain issues and work solo on others, some of this solo work might be geared toward the achievement of policy objectives that contradict those sought by their own member state.</p>
<p>This article seeks to examine the determinants of conflicting state and substate interest representation in Brussels, thereby assessing to what extent these differ from cooperative and bypassing paradiplomacy. In this way, it hopes to substantively contribute to the ongoing discussions on substate paradiplomacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414012453031">Blatter, Kreutzer, Rentl, &amp; Thiele, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414012453031">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012453031">Bursens &amp; Deforche, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010414012453031">Cornago, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010414012453031">Criekemans, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0010414012453031">Mbaye, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0010414012453031">1</xref></sup> Using original survey data, this article argues that the determinants of conflict are different from those of cooperation or bypassing in that institutional, party political, size, or sociological <italic>explanans</italic> mostly fail to account for much of its variation. Instead, conflicting interest representation seems to be best predicted by resource richness and diplomatic accreditation. These findings not only are robust across various modeling and resampling techniques but also are at odds with much of the literature that has stressed the importance of devolution levels and party politics.</p>
<sec id="section1-0010414012453031">
<title>Shedding Light on the Obscure? Five Types of Explanations</title>
<p>Beyond the tautological explanation that conflicting interests will be represented when interests diverge (a <italic>necessary</italic> but clearly not <italic>sufficient</italic> condition), the drivers of conflicting interest representation have remained rather obscure. Undoubtedly, its conflation with bypassing has not helped, but hypotheses related to bypassing at least provide a number of expectations that, by extension, can also be applied to the analysis of conflict between state and substate interest representation. Building on hypotheses previously put forward to account for bypassing and cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012453031">Bauer, 2006</xref>, pp. 33-37; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012453031">Jeffery, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414012453031">Keating &amp; Hooghe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010414012453031">Tatham, 2010a</xref>, pp. 77-81), this research proposes an additional number of hypotheses and summarizes them under five general headings: institutional, party political, size, resource richness, and socialization effects.</p>
<p>The first cluster of hypotheses concerns the institutional determinants of strategic interaction. It groups four institutional factors that might affect the dependent variable. The first concerns devolution levels. The argument has often been made that the more powers are devolved from the state to the substate level, the more the SSE will seek to be involved at the European level and hence bypass its member state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414012453031">Goldsmith, 1993</xref>, p. 698; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0010414012453031">Hocking, 1997</xref>, p. 105; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414012453031">Marks, Haesly, &amp; Mbaye, 2002</xref>, p. 9), thereby potentially increasing the frequency of conflicting paradiplomacy. Many authors have made such reasoning explicit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010414012453031">Bache, George, &amp; Rhodes, 1996</xref>, p. 319; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414012453031">Keating &amp; Hooghe, 2006</xref>, p. 281; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010414012453031">Pollack, 1995</xref>, p. 377), and the devolution hypothesis may be extended from bypassing to conflicting interest representation in the following way:</p>
<list id="list1-0010414012453031" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1 (H1):</italic> The higher the level of devolution, the more frequent conflicting paradiplomacy.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The second institutional <italic>explanan</italic> deals with the impact of diplomatic accreditation of substate staff in Brussels. Some qualitative work has underlined that such accreditation might affect the behavior of substate officials in Brussels, including vis-à-vis their own member state. More specifically, it has been argued that accreditation grants substate officials similar access to both internal member state documentation (e.g., briefing papers, memos) and EU institutions (e.g., council meetings, working groups) to that enjoyed by member state officials, the flip side being that accredited officials are therefore expected to behave as state officials and—in theory at least—not go against their member state official line once such a line materializes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0010414012453031">Tatham, 2008</xref>, p. 507, for further details).</p>
<p>Only SSEs from Belgium and the United Kingdom devolved governments benefit from full accreditation. However, many SSEs benefit from what could be called “partial diplomatic accreditation” in that the staff in the regional Brussels office does not have accreditation but the SSE either has some staff specifically representing it in the state’s Permanent Representation (PR), hence with diplomatic accreditation, or has a collective representative for all regions in the PR, hence with diplomatic accreditation. Austrian and German <italic>Länder</italic> have a collective representative in their member state PR in the form of a <italic>Länderbeobachter</italic> for the latter and a joint <italic>Länder</italic>/VST representative for the former. The Italian regions and autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano have four regional officials nominated to the PR by the State-Region conference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0010414012453031">Mabellini, 2005a</xref>, p. 201), whereas the Spanish Autonomous Communities have created, since 1996, the post of Counsellor for Autonomous Affairs as an integral part of the PR and the December 2004 agreement increased this presence with two extra officials from the Autonomous Communities themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414012453031">Aldecoa &amp; Cornago, 2009</xref>, p. 255; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0010414012453031">Mannozzi, 2005b</xref>, pp. 239-240). Although they also benefit from “partial” accreditation, the situation is slightly different for the islands of Åland, Madeira, and the Azores, which each have an official representing their specific interests within the member state PR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0010414012453031">Mannozzi, 2005a</xref>, p. 220; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010414012453031">Ronchetti, 2005</xref>, p. 139). In this light, the diplomatic accreditation hypothesis can be formalized in the following way:</p>
<list id="list2-0010414012453031" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2 (H2):</italic> If the SSE has diplomatic accreditation in Brussels, conflicting paradiplomacy decreases.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The third institutional explanation has to do with substate European Court of Justice (ECJ) appeal rights. The theoretical expectation is that domestic provisions for SSEs to request their member state to appeal to the ECJ against EU decisions through the annulment procedure spelled out in Article 230 of the EC Treaty might affect the dependent variable. The causal mechanisms would be that the right to appeal would encourage the member state to include its SSEs in its interest representation at the prelegislative phase so as to decrease the likelihood of a (inevitably costly) substate appeal at the postlegislative phase. Only Austrian and German <italic>Länder</italic> and the Belgian and Italian SSEs can formulate binding requests on their state, whereas these can be only nonbinding in the case of the Spanish Autonomous Communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414012453031">Ferrara, 2005</xref>, pp. 88-89; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010414012453031">Kiefer, 2009</xref>, p. 72; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0010414012453031">Mabellini, 2005a</xref>, pp. 206-207; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010414012453031">2005b</xref>, pp. 293-294). The hypothesis can be formalized in the following way:</p>
<list id="list3-0010414012453031" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3 (H3):</italic> If the SSE has ECJ appeal rights, conflicting paradiplomacy decreases.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The fourth institutional explanation concerns the formal leverage that the member state has in the EU decision-making process. One can expect that formally more powerful member states will be particularly anxious to preserve their dominant position in the decision-making process by concealing or even repressing (territorially) heterogeneous policy preferences. Hence the more formally powerful the member state, the tighter its ship, including its substate components. Formally weaker states would be comparatively less harmed by perceived heterogeneity of preferences and therefore would invest fewer of their scarce resources on harnessing their SSEs. Furthermore, from the substate viewpoint, not cooperating with a powerful member state (likely to nontrivially influence the policy process at the decision-making phase) is much more detrimental than lack of cooperation with a formally weaker member state (which has less formal leverage on the outcome). This expectation is derived from some work done on Council voting weight distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010414012453031">Barberà &amp; Jackson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0010414012453031">Hosli, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010414012453031">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010414012453031">Leech, 2002a</xref>). In addition, a model of the interaction between state and substate interest representation which would not factor <italic>formal member state power</italic> in the right-hand side of the equation would surely be omitting at best an important control variable, at worst a crucial <italic>explanan</italic>. The hypothesis can be formalized in the following way:</p>
<list id="list4-0010414012453031" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4 (H4):</italic> The more formally powerful the SSE’s member state, the less frequent conflicting paradiplomacy.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The second cluster of hypotheses deals with party politics and seeks to capture whether a partisan element underpins the nature of substate EU paradiplomacy. The first hypothesis concerns the impact of opposition party government at the substate level. A number of authors have suggested that it affects state–SSE interactions in a detrimental way in the case of party political incongruence and in a beneficial way in the case of party political congruence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012453031">Bauer, 2006</xref>, p. 34; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010414012453031">Keating, 1999</xref>, p. 12; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0010414012453031">Marks, 1996</xref>, pp. 411-412). The hypothesis can be formalized in the following way:</p>
<list id="list5-0010414012453031" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 5 (H5):</italic> If the opposition party is in government at the substate level, conflicting paradiplomacy increases.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The second partisan hypothesis concerns the impact of government by regionalist and/or nationalist parties at the substate level. The literature on these parties does not offer a clear expectation of what the effect of such a partisan configuration might be on the dependent variable since regionalist and nationalist parties tend to have diversified and sometimes ambivalent relations both with the central government and with the phenomenon of European integration itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414012453031">Elias, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010414012453031">Hepburn, 2008</xref>). However, it is not unreasonable to expect that the presence of a regional or nationalist party in government at the substate level could have a similar impact to that of the opposition party. The hypothesis can be formalized in the following way:</p>
<list id="list6-0010414012453031" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 6 (H6):</italic> If a nationalist or regionalist party is in government at the substate level, conflicting paradiplomacy increases.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The third cluster of hypotheses has a look into “size” effects. Size, be it geographic, demographic, or economic, would affect the capacity and willingness of SSEs to seize on opportunities at the supranational level. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414012453031">de Rooij (2002</xref>, p. 464) has argued that the bigger its absolute size the more proactively involved the local authority, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414012453031">Fleurke and Willemse (2006)</xref> have claimed that, compared to smaller ones, larger SSEs “have increased their position by direct communication with the Commission, <italic>bypassing central government</italic> [italics added]” (p. 95). In the same way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0010414012453031">Nielsen and Salk (1998</xref>, p. 244) have outlined that absolute size could increase territorial representation whereas greater <italic>relative</italic> size could increase cooperation with the member state since the latter would be more easily influenced by the former within the domestic context. SSEs of a smaller size relative to that of their member state would then be more likely to go solo. The absolute and relative size hypotheses can be formalized in the following way:</p>
<list id="list7-0010414012453031" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 7 (H7):</italic> The greater the absolute size of the SSE, the more frequent conflicting paradiplomacy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 8 (H8):</italic> The greater the relative size of the SSE, the less frequent conflicting paradiplomacy.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The third “size” hypothesis deals with the issue of density and more particularly that of the SSE’s population. It captures the idea that, though a SSE might be demographically, geographically, and economically weighty, population density might also affect the dependent variable. Indeed, some of the center–periphery relations literature suggests that remote rural areas can be more easily overlooked by central decision makers to the benefit of more urbanized areas. The argument would be that it is more costly for decision makers to overlook urbanized areas as opposed to less populous ones. Similarly, it can be argued that higher population density levels make stakeholder mobilization and interaction stronger and more efficient and result in greater pressures on central government to include these substate interests (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414012453031">Nagel &amp; Olzak, 1982</xref>, p. 131, on ethnic mobilization and urbanization). Not dissimilarly, much literature on political participation, interest intermediation, and representation points to the relevance of the rural–urban divide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010414012453031">Oddbjorn, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0010414012453031">Tarrow, 1971</xref>). In sum, including population density constitutes not only a test for a possible “rural–urban divide” effect but also a welcome control for the potentially conditioning effect of urbanization levels on other types of “size” effects. The hypothesis can be formalized in the following way:</p>
<list id="list8-0010414012453031" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 9 (H9):</italic> The greater the population density of the SSE, the less frequent conflicting paradiplomacy.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The fourth cluster of hypotheses delves into resource effects. It argues that resource richness, both relative and absolute, matters in that it may determine a SSE’s capacity to act independently. A number of authors have highlighted that greater resources enable greater, more autonomous, and more efficient interest representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414012453031">Blatter et al., 2008</xref>, p. 468; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414012453031">Marks et al., 2002</xref>, p. 9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0010414012453031">Marks, Nielsen, Ray, &amp; Salk, 1996</xref>, p. 169; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0010414012453031">Nielsen &amp; Salk, 1998</xref>, p. 239). Following a logic not unlike that regarding size effects, the absolute and relative resource-richness hypotheses can be formalized in the following way:</p>
<list id="list9-0010414012453031" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 10 (H10):</italic> The higher the absolute resource-richness of the SSE, the more frequent conflicting paradiplomacy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 11 (H11):</italic> The higher the relative resource-richness of the SSE, the less frequent conflicting paradiplomacy.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The fifth and final type of explanation has to do with the effect of the length of exposure to the European integration process. EU policy making can be characterized by its iterative nature. Much research has suggested that repeated games between interdependent players usually evolve toward cooperation rather than any other form of interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414012453031">Andreoni &amp; Miller, 1993</xref>). One can expect the Brussels polity to implement—more or less explicitly—rules of appropriateness regulating interactions. It can be theoretically anticipated that these socialization effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0010414012453031">Scharpf, 1997</xref>, p. 38) combined with the iterative and interdependent nature of EU policy making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0010414012453031">Wessels, 1997</xref>) could encourage convergence toward cooperative practices and a gradual decrease in the frequency of conflict. This hypothesis can be formalized in the following way:</p>
<list id="list10-0010414012453031" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 12 (H12):</italic> The longer the length of exposure to the European integration process, the less frequent conflicting paradiplomacy.</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0010414012453031">
<title>Database and Measurement</title>
<p>So as to get some grip on the frequency of conflicting interest representation in Brussels as well as information on a certain a number of explanatory factors, this research made two methodological bets. The first one is the idea that the interaction between state and substate EU interest representation can best be captured through a survey instrument targeted at the main undertakers of the interest representation activity. This circumvents the problem posed by the largely immaterial nature of interest representation (informal talks, behind the scenes negotiations, anonymous briefings, etc.) while not necessarily downplaying the more visible parts of these activities (official position papers, press releases, etc.). The second bet is that substate Brussels offices can be used as a proxy for the SSEs themselves since most of their EU interest representation is carried out by these offices or at least mediated by them. Clearly, both bets entail certain risks in terms of potential data biases. However, I believe these risks are not only reasonable but also worth taking.</p>
<p>An online survey was therefore sent to 217 heads of substate offices in Brussels. Respondents were guaranteed anonymity, and the survey was password protected, was left open for a period of 13 months (June 2008–July 2009), and reaped a response rate of about 48% (<italic>N</italic> = 104). A complete list of the surveyed Brussels offices can found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010414012453031">Appendix A</xref>. With the exception of Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Luxembourg, Malta, and Slovenia, offices from all member states answered, thereby contributing to the largest survey database of this kind.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0010414012453031">2</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Conflicting</italic> interest representation was operationalized as representing interests that are different from the position taken by the member state. To this end, the survey enquired about the frequency of this outcome on a 6-point scale ranging from <italic>never</italic> to <italic>always</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414012453031">Fowler, 1995</xref>, p. 56). The survey question is reported in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0010414012453031">Appendix B</xref>.</p>
<p>To measure <italic>devolution levels</italic>, I constructed an index score (0–4) by adding four survey-extracted dummy variables that measured whether the SSE has a directly elected body, whether it can make laws, whether it can set or change the rate of some taxes, and finally whether it has competences outside of economic, cultural-educational, and welfare policy.</p>
<p><italic>Diplomatic accreditation</italic> was operationalized with a score of zero if there is no diplomatic accreditation, a score of 0.5 if there is partial diplomatic accreditation (as defined in H2), and a score of 1 if there is full diplomatic accreditation (as defined in H2). Data sources consist of secondary literature analysis.</p>
<p><italic>ECJ appeal</italic> is understood as whether there are provisions for SSEs to request their member state to appeal to the ECJ against EU decisions (when legislation impinges on their competences) through the annulment procedure spelled out in article 230 of the EC Treaty. The variable was coded with a score of zero if there is no such mechanism in place, 0.5 when such a mechanism exists but can only be nonbinding, and 1 when such a mechanism exists and can be binding. Data sources consist of secondary literature analysis.</p>
<p><italic>Member state formal power</italic> in the EU decision-making process was operationalized using council voting weights. Such a crude measure of formal power was preferred because of lack of agreement in the literature on the optimal method of measurement. Though undoubtedly more fancy, specialized literature has indicated that power indices such as the Shapley–Shubik and the Banzhaf indices rely on different assumptions and are varyingly efficient under distinct conditions. Because the voting models underlying these indices differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010414012453031">Leech, 1990</xref>, pp. 298-299), their predictions about power also differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0010414012453031">Leech, 2002b</xref>, p. 19) and can sometimes lead to erroneous conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010414012453031">Gelman, Katz, &amp; Bafumi, 2004</xref>). Considering the strong assumptions underlying these power indices as well as their contestation as valid measures of power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010414012453031">Gelman et al., 2004</xref>) and that some of the literature considers that “the weights laid down by the Nice Treaty are approximately proportional to the voting power they represent [and] are close to being fair for most members” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010414012453031">Leech, 2002a</xref>, pp. 459-460), it is less contentious to simply use council voting weights as a proxy measure of member state formal power in the EU decision-making process.</p>
<p><italic>Party political configurations</italic> were measured in two ways, each time through the survey instrument. First, the opposition party was identified through a simple “opposition in government” dummy (1 = <italic>if the main opposition party in the national parliament is in government at the substate level</italic>, 0 = <italic>otherwise</italic>). Second, nationalist/regionalist party was operationalized through a simple “regionalist/nationalist party in government” dummy (1 = <italic>regionalist/nationalist party</italic>, 0 = <italic>otherwise</italic>).</p>
<p>Since size has geographic, economic, and demographic components, absolute and relative sizes were operationalized by extracting factor scores from these variables. <italic>Absolute size</italic> is a factor score of the SSE’s GDP (million euros, 2006), population (thousand, 2008), and geographical area (square kilometers, 2007–2008), whereas <italic>relative size</italic> is a factor score of the SSE’s percentage of member state GDP, population, and geographical area. Data are the latest Eurostat data available at the time of data collection. The factor score was calculated through principal component analysis (varimax, Anderson–Rubin method). Substate <italic>population density</italic> was measured using 2007 Eurostat data.</p>
<p>The concept of <italic>absolute resource richness</italic> was operationalized in two ways: both at home and in Brussels. Consistent with previous quantitative studies of substate mobilization, GDP per capita (Eurostat, 2006)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0010414012453031">3</xref></sup> was used as a proxy for substate resource richness at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0010414012453031">Nielsen &amp; Salk, 1998</xref>), whereas the number of full-time employees (survey data) was used as a proxy for substate resource richness in Brussels. Meanwhile, <italic>relative resource richness</italic> was operationalized by subtracting member state GDP per capita from the substate GDP per capita, resulting in positive sums for SSEs that have a GDP per capita higher than their member state and negative sums for those that have a lower one.</p>
<p><italic>Length of exposure to the European integration process</italic> was measured twice: once for the SSE itself and a second time for its Brussels office. The SSE measure is its date of EU membership (which is differentiated from the member state’s for East German <italic>Länder</italic>). The SSE’s length of exposure in Brussels was measured by the date of its Brussels office opening (survey data). This second measure is consistent with the argument that “the older and more established regional representations” are more embedded within the Brussels polity than younger ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010414012453031">Moore, 2008</xref>, p. 517).

<title>Analysis and Results</title>
<p>The descriptive statistics displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414012453031">Table 1</xref> already indicate a number of things. First, some of the variables previously used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010414012453031">Tatham (2010a)</xref> have highly similar means and standard deviations despite the sample growing from 61 to 104 observations. On average, these SSEs joined the EU in 1976–1977 and opened an office in Brussels in 1998–1999. Such an office would today contain about five full-time employees and represent SSEs where the GDP per capita is around €23,000, but on average lower than their member state’s by more than €900. The average population density is over 430, whereas about 21% of these SSEs have a nationalist/regionalist party in government and 36% the main statewide opposition party. Devolution levels average around a value of three, whereas the member state’s number of council votes is at around 19 (less than Spain, but more than Romania). The most striking statistic though is that of the frequency of conflicting interest representation. The mean of 2.6 indicates that, on average, SSEs represent interests that are different from the position taken by their member state precisely between <italic>rarely</italic> and <italic>sometimes</italic>, in other words not very frequently. I analyze this rather uncommon phenomenon using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression: Each cluster of hypotheses is initially tested separately and then concomitantly in a final model. The results are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414012453031">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>The institutional block accounts for about 4% of the variance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0010414012453031">4</xref></sup> However, this result is mainly driven by the diplomatic accreditation variable, which is the only one to be significant in both reduced and full models. The effect of diplomatic accreditation is consistent with that predicted by H2 in that it reduces the frequency of conflicting interest representation by a full unit across models (e.g., from <italic>sometimes</italic> to <italic>rarely</italic>). This is not a trivial effect. Diplomatic accreditation therefore not only grants substate officials state-like rights in Brussels but also seems to bestow the duty to avoid contradicting their member state in their interest representation activities. The other institutional variables, however, are insignificant in both reduced and full models, and their effect is also much weaker. For example, it would take 50 council votes in Model 1 to provoke a one-unit change in conflicting interest representation. The effect of ECJ appeal is similarly limited, the variable provoking a shift of about a quarter of a unit in conflicting interest representation. It is interesting that this effect is contrary to the hypothesis: The binding possibility of an ECJ appeal in fact increases conflict. This result, however, cannot be extended beyond the sample.</p>
<p>Both the lack of significance and the weakness of the devolution effect are counterintuitive, especially considering previous findings concerning its impact on cooperation and bypassing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012453031">Jeffery, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010414012453031">Tatham, 2010a</xref>) and on regional mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0010414012453031">Marks et al., 1996</xref>, p. 183; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414012453031">Marks et al., 2002</xref>, p. 9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0010414012453031">Nielsen &amp; Salk, 1998</xref>, p. 247). Indeed, beyond being statistically insignificant in reduced and full models, it would take a 25-point increase in devolution levels for a shift of one unit in the frequency of conflicting interest representation (Model 1). Considering that the devolution index consists of a 5-point scale (0–4), such a finding makes little sense. Alternative measures of devolution such as Hooghe et al.’s (2010) regional authority index produce quasi-identical results.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0010414012453031">5</xref></sup> Hence, if devolution is a driver of substate mobilization on the European scene and affects cooperation with and bypassing of the member state, it hardly seems to affect conflicting interest representation at all.</p>
<p>Party political <italic>explanans</italic> perform even less well than institutional ones. Though the opposition and nationalist/regionalist party variables are in the expected direction (H5), they are significant in neither reduced nor full models, indicating that if the frequency of conflict is affected by some institutional features (i.e., diplomatic accreditation), it is not significantly affected by party politics. These results are at odds with findings that have stressed the link between partisan dynamics and regional mobilization at the EU level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0010414012453031">Marks et al., 1996</xref>, p. 187) and its impact on cooperation and bypassing in Brussels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012453031">Bauer, 2006</xref>, p. 34; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012453031">Jeffery, 2007</xref>, p. 8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010414012453031">Tatham, 2010a</xref>). Hence, if past research has underlined that party political incongruence can adversely affect cooperation and reciprocally increase bypassing on the EU stage, such a factor does not seem to affect the frequency of conflicting interest representation. This is an important qualification to the effect of party political incongruence on state and substate interactions in Brussels.</p>
<p>One can reasonably expect, however, that the effects of party political incongruence might be conditioned—or even magnified—by the institutional setting. For example, regarding regional–EU issues, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010414012453031">Kemmerling and Bodenstein (2006)</xref> have suggested that
<disp-quote>
<p>it is possible that partisan effects are stronger in federalist political systems where regional actors have more political clout than they do in centralized systems. . . . It is also likely that partisan effects are stronger if the same party rules on different levels of government. (p. 380)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is hence not improbable that party politics would matter more when devolution levels are high than when those remain low. Although this would in part account for some of the above counterintuitive findings, such an explanation is not upheld by empirical testing. Interaction effects between devolution and government by the opposition as well as between devolution and government by a nationalist/regionalist party returned insignificant estimates, even when relaxing the linearity assumption by introducing a higher order polynomial. These findings are graphically reported in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0010414012453031">Appendix C</xref>. They further increase our confidence that party political incongruence and devolution levels do not significantly affect the frequency of conflicting interest representation, even when interacted with one another.</p>
<p>In line with previous findings concerning cooperation and bypassing, size and length of exposure to the integration process do not seem to affect the interaction between state and substate interest representation. The “size” block hardly captures any variation, whereas that of the length of exposure to the integration process captures all of 0%. Hence, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected concerning the impact of absolute and relative size, of population density, or of the length of exposure (both at home and in Brussels). The only caveat to these conclusions is that relative size significantly decreases the frequency of conflict when controlling for all other factors (Model 6). This is consistent with H8 but is conditional on the presence of suppressor effects in the model and therefore of weaker immediate empirical interest.</p>
<p>If the number of full-time employees is a nonsignificant and instable factor across models, the two other resource-richness measures are highly significant predictors of conflict. The effect of relative GDP per capita is both significant and strong in reduced and full models and is consistent with the hypothesis that the greater the resource richness relative to the embedding country, the less frequent conflicting interest representation. Absolute GDP per capita also very strongly and significantly predicts conflict in both reduced and full models, although it affects the dependent variable in the opposite direction to that of relative GDP per capita. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the higher the absolute resource richness of the SSE, the more frequent conflicting interest representation. Hence, although resource-based explanations of cooperative and bypassing interest representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010414012453031">Tatham, 2010a</xref>) and of substate mobilization at the EU level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0010414012453031">Marks et al., 1996</xref>, pp. 181-182; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0010414012453031">Nielsen &amp; Salk, 1998</xref>, p. 244) were disappointing, resource richness at home, both relative and absolute, seems to play a crucial role in predicting the frequency of conflicting interest representation. The resource-richness block captures 7% of variance on the conflict variable, hence accounting for most variation of all explanatory blocks. In this sense, domestic resource richness seems to play a double role. In absolute terms it would provide a basis for diverging interests to be represented at the EU level; however, in relative terms it would increase the SSE’s importance within its member state and therefore decrease the likelihood of its main interests being overlooked by central government. Conversely, the cost of overlooking the interests of less prosperous SSEs would be smaller, hence increasing the likelihood that their less compatible interests would be domestically marginalized and would consequently reappear at the EU level.</p>
<p>Such a theoretical explanation also suggests that the effect of absolute GDP per capita might not be completely linear, especially beyond a certain threshold. Indeed, in some exceptional cases (e.g., that of a SSE containing a rich member state’s capital), extremely high absolute values might also imply high relative values. These outliers on the absolute GDP per capita variable would reverse the relationship as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414012453031">Figure 1</xref> illustrates. Although theoretically interesting, such cubic modeling will increase predictive accuracy only for outlying values and indeed only a very small number of SSEs within the EU.</p>

<title>Reliability and Limits</title>
<p>The above results fill an important gap in the research on the possible determinants of conflicting paradiplomacy on the European scene. They confirm some expectations and contradict others. Since these findings counter some widespread expectations, it is legitimate to investigate how confident we can be about them. The following paragraphs detail some of the tests that have been undertaken to assess their validity.</p>
<p>Fears that results are driven by outliers or influential cases are discarded through the evaluation of Cook’s distances (always &lt; .12) and leverage values.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0010414012453031">6</xref></sup> A second concern is that the modeling technique is inappropriate for the collected data and, more particularly, that OLS estimation is not suitable considering the dependent variable’s ordinal but categorical nature. Though a valid concern, ordered logit analysis only confirmed findings reached through the OLS method (including interaction effects). The reduced models are strictly similar, whereas the only notable difference concerning the full model is that council votes becomes significant at the .10 level. However, such significance resulting from suppressor effects present in the full model is of limited theoretical import.</p>
<p>A third type of test deals with the idea that results might be a consequence of the violation of various model assumptions and that one cannot therefore generalize these findings beyond this sample. One commonly occurring violation in small-<italic>N</italic> cross-sectional research is that of heteroscedasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414012453031">Gujarati, 2003</xref>, p. 401). Plotting the studentized residuals against the standardized fitted values does not reveal any pattern, whereas a histogram of the distribution of standardized residuals as well as its normal P-P plot all suggest that the residuals are normally distributed. These visual tests were confirmed by a series of heteroscedasticity detection tests.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0010414012453031">7</xref></sup> Unsurprisingly, various calculations of heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors hardly differed from the results of the classical linear model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0010414012453031">8</xref></sup> Meanwhile, Ramsey’s regression specification error test indicated that no misspecification of the model could be detected by taking powers of the fitted values <italic>ŷ</italic> and adding them to the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0010414012453031">Kleiber &amp; Zeileis, 2008</xref>, p. 103). Some of the above tests are visually summarized in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3-0010414012453031">Appendix D</xref>.</p>
<p>Since OLS regression relies on asymptotic approximation of the distribution of test statistics that are not always reliable in small samples, nonparametric bootstrapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0010414012453031">Keele, 2008</xref>, p. 178) was used as an additional method for statistical inference and to compensate for sample size. As the functional form of the model is correct, errors are identically distributed, and the model does not suffer from high-leverage outliers, fixed-x bootstrapping was employed. The final regression model was bootstrapped 5,000 times using fixed-x resampling, and results further confirmed that the initial findings can be generalized beyond the sample.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0010414012453031">9</xref></sup> These findings are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0010414012453031">Appendix E</xref>.</p>
<p>Given that SSEs are nested within countries, it is not unreasonable to expect that the country to which they belong might affect the dependent variable and therefore the reliability of the model. Multilevel modeling offers an efficient method to control for potential country effects while making sure that the complete pooling of the data in the above analyses has not biased parameter estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0010414012453031">Gelman &amp; Hill, 2007</xref>, pp. 6-8). With 20 countries and 104 observations, this data set is particularly well suited to such a method of analysis.</p>
<p>Calculation of the intraclass correlation (ICC) reveals the data set does exhibit a multilevel structure (ICC = 0.21, likelihood ratio test = 7.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and that a moderately high amount of variance is captured by the clustering of SSEs within their countries. However, a comparison between pooled OLS results and mixed-effects maximum likelihood estimates reveals no real differences,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0010414012453031">10</xref></sup> whereas the random-intercept model was not statistically different from the pooled model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0010414012453031">11</xref></sup> The lesson that one can draw from these two types of tests is that using a random-intercept model in which a country-specific error component captures the combined effects of omitted country characteristics and unobserved heterogeneity returns almost identical results to completely pooled OLS regression. The immediate conclusion is that, if the model suffers from any omitted variable bias, then it is probably not a country-level variable. Hence, it is unlikely that the predictive accuracy of Model 6 could be much improved by the inclusion of further country-level indicators.</p>
<p>Finally, considering the methodological bets entailed by the survey instrument and the use of Brussels offices as a proxy for the SSEs themselves, one can question whether similar conclusions would be drawn from different data analyzed with different tools. A series of 117 semistructured qualitative interviews of EU, member state, and substate politicians and civil servants, both in Brussels and in their state and regional capitals, further suggested that the above results are not an artifact of data or methodological biases. Although the effects of resource richness were more difficult to assess because of “degrees of freedom” limitations in such a qualitative setting,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0010414012453031">12</xref></sup> conclusions drawn from this additional pool of data mostly corroborated the above findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010414012453031">Tatham, 2010b</xref>). These interview data not only confirmed the (unexpectedly) low frequency of conflicting interest representation and its lack of systematic association with devolution levels or party political configurations, but also provided supporting evidence of its negative association with diplomatic accreditation.</p>
<p>Though we can have some confidence that the above findings are relatively robust across data sources and analytical methods, and therefore can be generalized beyond the sample, it is nonetheless necessary to acknowledge some limitations. The most obvious is that only 16% of observed variance has been accounted for. Although there are some grounds to believe that none of the uncovered relationships are spurious, it is equally certain that other factors can account for some of the variance left unexplained. Some might be difficult to measure and have to do with human factors such as personal alchemies or individual skills (leadership, entrepreneurship, networking abilities, Brussels know-how), others might be more historical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012453031">Bursens &amp; Deforche, 2010</xref>) or cultural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0010414012453031">Marks et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0010414012453031">Nielsen &amp; Salk, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0010414012453031">Putnam, Leonardi, &amp; Nanetti, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0010414012453031">Soldatos, 1990</xref>, pp. 44-46). Future research will have to assess the nature and scope of their impact on the dependent variable.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Implications</title>
<p>These past few years have witnessed a strong revival of research on the extrastate activities of European SSEs. Some authors have even gone as far as stating that the difference between state diplomacy and substate paradiplomacy is narrowing to the extent that they now share many characteristics and could usefully be considered alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010414012453031">Criekemans, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414012453031">Criekemans &amp; Duran, 2010</xref>). Although some may take issue with such a statement—in that it mainly applies to a limited number of regions with legislative powers—one can nonetheless point out two things. First, such an interpretation is given some weight by the explanatory power of the “diplomatic accreditation” variable which highlights that when substate officials are formally treated as state officials they will less frequently represent conflicting interests. This is clearly the case concerning the U.K. devolved authorities and the Belgian SSEs, but also partially the case concerning Austrian, German, Italian, and Spanish SSEs and the islands of Åland, the Azores, and Madeira. Second, it highlights the extent to which substate paradiplomacy has become visible and salient. SSEs continue to open offices in Brussels, and these offices in turn continue to grow, not only in maturity but also in number of staff and financial muscle. If substate paradiplomacy is less and less different from state diplomacy, then the interaction between these two activities has surely become more relevant and hence worthier of analysis.</p>
<p>Although our understanding of the drivers of tandem and solo work has increased over time, the question of conflicting interest representation had not been systematically investigated. Analysis of a database comprising more than 100 Brussels offices reveals not only that conflicting interest representation occurs rarely but also that its determinants are very different from that of bypassing (<italic>sensu lato</italic>) and cooperation. Although resource richness and diplomatic accreditation play significant roles, devolution levels and party political incongruence, surprisingly, hardly affect such an activity. To some extent, this is good news for member states. It means that empowering territories with further competences will not weaken them in Brussels even when these freshly empowered SSEs are governed by opposition, nationalist, or regionalist parties. The absence of such a relationship therefore has important policy implications in terms of the territorial structure of the state and the distribution of powers within it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414012453031">Hooghe &amp; Marks, 2009</xref>). It also highlights that such processes are not governed by zero-sum logics. Previous research had indicated that devolution increased rather than decreased cooperation on the Brussels scene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012453031">Jeffery, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010414012453031">Tatham, 2010a</xref>). This research shows that it does not affect levels of conflict within such an arena. Hence, devolved and nondevolved states are equally unlikely to be undermined by their SSEs, even in the context of party political incongruence.</p>
<p>Finally, from a conceptual point of view, this research allows us to take a step down from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0010414012453031">Sartori’s (1970)</xref> ladder of abstraction and to further disentangle paradiplomacy from bypassing and bypassing from conflicting interest representation. Analysis of the latter reveals that conflicting paradiplomacy is not only rare in its occurrence but also shaped by a different data generating process to that of its bypassing or cooperative equivalents. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414012453031">Criekemans and Duran (2010)</xref> have recently pointed out,
<disp-quote>
<p>One of the challenges in the academic study of sub-state diplomacy is to <italic>gather comparable data</italic> on the institutional mechanisms, the diplomatic instruments and the organizational structures which non-central governments utilise so as to develop a foreign policy, parallel, complementary or conflictual to those of their central state colleagues. (pp. 35-36)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This research provides an additional step in this direction, thereby illustrating the value of further unpacking and analyzing the paradiplomacy of European SSEs.</p>
