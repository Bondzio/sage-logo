<abstract>
<p>This article considers the workplace partnership–employee involvement nexus. While an empirical association has been recorded, there has been limited exploration of the potential benefits to be derived from the coupling of these interventions. Developing the idea of forward and reverse synergies this article argues the relationship is complex. The tendency for partnership to act as an antecedent for the utilization of employee involvement and wider organizational change has been documented – forward synergy. However, the reverse scenario, where involvement is used by management to initiate and subsequently bolster workplace cooperation and consensus has received far less scrutiny. This article seeks to shed light on both phenomena.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Within the academic and practitioner literature much space is devoted to the concept of employee involvement (EI) and its constituent practices (e.g. upward problem solving, teamworking and downward communication) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X11423113">Butler and Glover, 2010</xref> for an overview). Conterminously, the phenomenon of workplace partnership has figured increasingly prominently as a source of scholarly interest. While debate around ‘who benefits’ remains a source of controversy within this latter body of work (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11423113">Danford et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143831X11423113">Stuart and Martinez Lucio, 2002</xref>), more optimistic formulations make reference to workplace cooperation as a precursor to mutually beneficial outcomes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11423113">IPA, 1997</xref>). Often a twin-track or ‘hybridized’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11423113">Guest and Peccei, 2001</xref>: 210) approach has been recorded (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X11423113">Dundon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X11423113">Munro, 2002</xref>) with partnership and EI intertwined within the same organization. On the face of it such dualism appears theoretically incoherent. Partnership, on the one hand, with its reaffirmation of the role of trade unions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X11423113">Munro, 2002</xref>: 278), is best conceptualized as a component of employee participation – a phenomenon grounded in pluralist thinking and democratic theory. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11423113">Hyman and Mason (1995</xref>: 29) acknowledge, employee participation ‘emerges from a collective employee interest to optimize the physical security and aspirational conditions under which employees are contracted to serve’. EI, conversely, is strongly associated with ‘soft HRM’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143831X11423113">Storey, 1992</xref>) and more explicitly, productivity and efficiency considerations – i.e. unitary theory. Such initiatives are promoted by management with a view to mobilizing the support and tacit knowledge of employees towards corporate goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X11423113">Butler and Glover, 2010</xref>), and typically preclude the opportunity for workers to have any input into high-level decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X11423113">Marchington and Wilkinson, 2000</xref>). The motivation for EI – the ‘<italic>new</italic> collectivism’ (Bacon and Storey, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X11423113">Munro, 2002</xref>; emphasis added) – therefore differs fundamentally from participation in that it is not born of a desire to increase the influence of employees vis-a-vis the employer, rather it is concerned with issues of corporate efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X11423113">Butler and Glover, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the different premises of EI and participation, an emergent body of literature has sought to explore the frictions unleashed by their parallel utilization (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X11423113">Munro, 2002</xref>: 278). The often observed <italic>long-term</italic> coupling of the two approaches (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11423113">Dundon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X11423113">Munro, 2002</xref>) however, suggests that in practice there may well be synergies or ‘institutional complementarities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143831X11423113">Brewster et al., 2007</xref>) to be realized from their combination as well as tensions. The analysis of the interrelationship between EI and partnership nonetheless remains relatively underdeveloped. Hitherto, any discussion of the complementarities has tended to focus on what we henceforth term ‘forward synergies’ – i.e. the mechanisms through which the utilization of partnership serves to underpin practices of EI and changes to aspects of work organization more generally. Hence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11423113">Guest and Peccei (2001</xref>: 210) have argued that ‘if employee involvement initiatives are to thrive . . . they require the support of a formal joint governance system’. Most obviously, the imprimatur of formally elected trade union representatives may serve to legitimize organizational change in the eyes of employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11423113">Danford et al., 2005</xref>: 599; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143831X11423113">Oxenbridge and Brown, 2005</xref>: 89). Beyond this restricted analysis there has been little exploration of ‘reverse synergies’ – i.e. EI as a catalyst and facilitator of workplace partnership. While an empirical association has been reported (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11423113">Dundon et al., 2004</xref>), the managerial rationale underpinning the connection remains underexplored. This article seeks to address this and related themes and issues. Drawing on research undertaken in a unionized, heavy engineering MNC (<italic>Engco</italic>), we seek to investigate the interdependence and potentially mutually reinforcing nature of these interventions. As such our research is predominantly concerned with the process of partnership, a significant empirical blindspot (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X11423113">Johnstone et al., 2009</xref>), rather than outcomes. We commence by exploring various theoretical insights that might allow us to shed light on the partnership–EI nexus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0143831X11423113">
<title>Theoretical overview</title>
<p>The phenomenon of workplace partnership has attracted significant comment over the last decade or so (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X11423113">Johnstone et al., 2009</xref> for an overview). Much of the early material sought to probe the nature of this much ‘contested concept’ (see, in particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11423113">Ackers and Payne, 1998</xref>). A subsequent wave of research was outcomes-orientated, the prognosis for trade unionism being subject to particularly close scrutiny (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0143831X11423113">Terry, 2003</xref>). Belatedly, commentators have turned their attention to matters of process. Particular emphasis has been placed on the necessity of trust (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X11423113">Dietz, 2004</xref>) as an ‘enabler’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X11423113">Johnstone et al., 2009</xref>) of partnership and the dynamics of consultation and collective bargaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X11423113">Bacon and Storey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143831X11423113">Marks et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143831X11423113">Samuel, 2007</xref>). While the association between partnership and EI is pertinent to matters of process, this area remains relatively unexplored.</p>
<p>At a conceptual level, at least, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11423113">Guest and Peccei’s (2001</xref>: 208–10) overview of the ‘intellectual traditions’ of partnership helps cast light on aspects of the relationship. The apparent cohabitation of partnership with EI stems from the hybridized manner in which the former was operationalized within the UK – here partnership actually emerged as an amalgam of unitarism and pluralism. Such variegation was driven by a domestic public policy supportive of neoliberalism, allied to EU-inspired legislation sympathetic to the information and participative rights of workers; and, in certain sectors, the presence of strong trade unions. The outcome is an accommodation; one based on pluralist assumptions which recognize the importance of representative systems, allied to an acceptance of the value of direct forms of employee involvement. The former component safeguards the presence of independent employee voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11423113">Guest and Peccei, 2001</xref>: 209), while the latter aims to maximize employee’s ‘psychic stake’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11423113">Guest and Peccei, 2001</xref>: 210) in the enterprise through behavioural change. At a normative level the partnership phenomenon may hence be justified in terms of both equity and efficiency (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143831X11423113">Brewster et al., 2007</xref>: 1247). The empirical task of this article is to shed light on aspects of process and the outcomes that flow from the twinning of these interventions at the micro level. In essence we are concerned with the concept of institutional ‘embeddedness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11423113">Cox et al., 2006</xref>: 252–3). While this is potentially a multifaceted construct, our focus is upon ‘network embeddedness’, i.e. ‘the mutual reinforcement derived from complementary practices’; the notion that multiple interventions may be dependent on each other for their successful operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11423113">Cox et al., 2006</xref>: 252).</p>
<p>This line of enquiry speaks directly to topical debates pertaining to the sustainability of partnership. Scholars have identified several variables as impacting upon the resilience of the phenomenon. Pre-eminent among these are the strength and institutional security of unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143831X11423113">Roche and Geary, 2002</xref>: 682), the scope and style of consultation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X11423113">Bacon and Storey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143831X11423113">Oxenbridge and Brown, 2004</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143831X11423113">Samuel, 2007</xref>) and the degree of trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X11423113">Dietz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11423113">Guest and Peccei, 2001</xref>). Significantly, the role management might play in propagating a relationship centred on accommodation and cooperation has received surprisingly little comment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11423113">Dobbins and Gunnigle (2009</xref>: 568) have argued that the sustainability of partnership requires ‘vigilance from management’ but this potentially important insight has not been significantly interrogated. Certainly, much attention has focused on how management might manipulate ‘counterfeit partnership’ for short-term ends. However, insufficient emphasis has been placed on the strategies management utilize to embed systems of partnership for <italic>mutually</italic> beneficial outcomes.</p>
<p>Reflecting the unitary roots of EI and the critical orientation of contemporary industrial relations (IR) scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143831X11423113">Dickens, 2009</xref>), commentators have long observed how the practice of EI may be used to marginalize and ‘by-pass’ trade unions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X11423113">Ackers et al., 1992</xref>). Wider and more socially and democratically benign ‘interaction effects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143831X11423113">Kim et al., 2010</xref>: 389) have however been little considered and it is our contention that EI might equally function as a lever for micro-concertation. This proposition stems from the requirement for partnership to be sufficiently institutionalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X11423113">Kochan and Osterman, 1994</xref>) and ‘vertically aligned’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11423113">Dobbins and Gunnigle, 2009</xref>: 567), allied to the emphasis placed on communication, openness and transparency in standard prescriptions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11423113">IPA, 1997</xref>: 4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0143831X11423113">TUC, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>A convenient way to conceive of the relationship between partnership and EI is to unpack the latter construct. Problem solving and upward and downward forms of communication represent three core EI practices (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11423113">Marchington et al., 1992</xref>). Problem solving (or task participation) is characteristically viewed as a downstream process of partnership (i.e. an example of forward synergy). Under this scenario a relationship based on cooperation is cultivated as a precursor to the introduction of new working practices (e.g. problem solving groups and teamworking). Through workplace partnership trade unions might function as enablers of change in several respects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143831X11423113">Stewart and Wass (1998</xref>: 90) have stressed the role of union involvement in ‘new management techniques’ and employees’ acceptance of the necessity of employment reform. In addition to the obvious linkages to the legitimization of change, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11423113">Cox et al. (2006</xref>: 263) observe that union representatives are well placed to ensure managers make such modes of participation meaningful to employees because of their experience, so enhancing engagement with the process. The complementarities could conceivably, however, flow in the reverse direction. According to Levine and Tyson (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143831X11423113">Kim et al., 2010</xref>: 376) by participating in teams, for example, workers suffer less from information asymmetries. Data provided on performance targets, and metrics on outcomes supportive of perceptions of job security, could conceivably serve to enhance wider employee support for strategies premised on consensus and accommodation.</p>
<p>Attitude surveys are perhaps the best known variant of upward communication. The basis for their use draws on two distinct strands of theory, both of which are preoccupied with productivity and efficiency considerations First, Hirschman’s exit–voice model, as adapted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11423113">Freeman and Medoff (1984)</xref>, suggests voice mechanism can provide employees with an opportunity to express dissatisfaction with the nature of the employment relationship, reducing employee turnover or ‘exit’. High employee turnover both increases training costs and potentially mediates the quality of production/service delivery. Second, surveys represent a further means by which management may appropriate the ‘tacit knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143831X11423113">Polanyi, 1966</xref>) of employees, enhancing corporate efficiency.</p>
<p>The utilization of surveys as a means of embedding workplace partnership has attracted limited comment. Certainly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X11423113">Guest et al. (2008</xref>: 140), in their work on the relationship between partnership and trust, have observed that attitude surveys are associated with high mutual trust between management and employee representatives. Nonetheless, the theoretical connection between the two variables has not been explored. Correctly executed, such interventions provide a concise ‘snapshot’ of the mood of the workforce, allowing management to take the IR ‘temperature’. In contrast to representative participation, such ‘environmental scanning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143831X11423113">Quinn, 1996</xref>: 384) could plausibly augment the ability of managers to extract input from employees in an undiluted manner, enhancing their capacity to gauge the behavioural effects of decisions downstream. The output could represent a convenient means of calibrating employee perceptions of ‘the balance of advantage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11423113">Guest and Peccei, 2001</xref>) in partnership arrangements at any given point in time; employee views indicating distortion or ‘constrained mutuality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11423113">Guest and Peccei, 2001</xref>: 231), serving to prompt managerial reconsideration of the measures needed to underwrite partnership.</p>
<p>The relationship between downward communication and partnership has attracted still less academic scrutiny. We might reasonably hypothesize that top-down communication <italic>qua</italic> information disclosure would be a correlate of partnership. There are two strands to this proposition. First, the long-term viability of partnership depends on micro-aspects of process – most obviously, the degree of trust (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X11423113">Dietz, 2004</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11423113">Guest and Peccei, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X11423113">Johnstone et al., 2009</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X11423113">Guest et al. (2008</xref>: 128), the success of partnership depends significantly on the establishment of informal relationships between managerial champions of partnership and employee representatives. If partnership is to be sustained and diffused throughout the organization, however, a positive attitude towards partnership among a wider section of the workforce is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X11423113">Guest et al., 2008</xref>: 128). Here <italic>direct</italic> information disclosure via newsletters, notice boards, team briefings and the like could be important vehicles for the dissemination of material. This practice could be pivotal in securing the trust of the shop floor and, incidentally, middle managers, who are often threatened by any redistribution of power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11423113">Evans et al., 2001</xref>: 305). Second, it has been well documented that information sharing is positively associated with financial adversity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143831X11423113">Peccei et al., 2010</xref>). The partnership literature suggests that a key variable underpinning a shift towards such pacts is organizational crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143831X11423113">Oxenbridge and Brown, 2005</xref>: 86). As such we might again expect partnership to be strongly correlated with downward communication.</p>
<p>Recent years have seen some notable contributions exploring the antecedents of information disclosure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143831X11423113">Peccei et al., 2010</xref>). Surprisingly enough, given the aforementioned emphasis on transparency, the theme of workplace partnership has not figured in the body of work. Summarizing the literature in this area, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11423113">Peccei et al. (2008</xref>: 343) suggest (uncontroversially) that information disclosure will be shaped by the nature of the employment relationship. In a situation of ‘goal alignment’ – akin to the partnership scenario – disclosure operates to bring the parties close together on the basis of shared understandings and cooperation. Conversely, in a ‘residual claims game’ there are disagreements over distributive issues. Higher levels of disclosure would be expected under the former scenario because management will trust employees not to take advantage of its openness. In the latter, disclosure will be more limited because of the fear that employees will use the data to extract a greater share of the organizational surplus. Peccei et al.’s own research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11423113">2008</xref>: 358) confirms ‘managerial perceptions of shared values are a fundamental basis for information sharing’.</p>
<p>Useful as these insights are, relating them to partnership exposes some logical challenges and indeed some dilemmas for management. Often the parties are moving away from a formerly antagonistic relationship and shared values will clearly take time to become embedded. If unions are to be sure of managerial bona fides this may require an initial ‘leap-of-faith’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X11423113">Dietz, 2004</xref>: 10) in terms of information disclosure that such modelling cannot account for. An interesting empirical issue hence centres on whether top-down information disclosure is a precursor, correlate or outcome of partnership.</p>
<p>Drawing on the above insights this contribution seeks to explore the association between partnership and EI; more specifically, the existence of ‘reverse synergies’. As such we are concerned with the concept of ‘vigilance’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11423113">Dobbins and Gunnigle, 2009</xref>), i.e. the EI strategies used by management to embed workplace partnership in what is often a hostile environment. The remainder of the article is structured as follows. Initially there is a discussion of methodological issues. This leads into a description of the study organization. In the main body of the article the cross-linkages between partnership and EI are explored. In the closing section the theoretical implications of the findings are considered.</p>

<title>Research strategy</title>
<p>The focus of this article is the tactics management deploy to initiate and embed systems of workplace partnership. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X11423113">Martinez Lucio and Stuart (2004</xref>: 421), ‘the study of partnership requires an approach that is sensitive to internal processes of decision making and the rationales that underpin the elaboration of strategies regarding work’. As such, we sought to navigate the inherent complexities and subtleties via the use of a heavily embedded longitudinal case study, using interviews, company documents, observations and employee surveys. Numerous visits were made to the research location over a four-year period (2006–10) with in excess of 150 interviews conducted. Testimony was obtained from the convenor and deputy convenor, shop stewards and various managerial actors. The managerial respondents comprised a structured horizontal and vertical sample – interviews were conducted with junior, middle and senior managers, undertaking both operational and support (mostly HR) functions. Additionally, steps were taken to capture worker responses to partnership, an overlooked constituency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11423113">Danford et al., 2005</xref>). Discussions were held with a representative cross-section of the population taking in both skilled (craft and maintenance) and semi-skilled (team member) grades. Interviews, which lasted for an average of 50 minutes, were recorded, transcribed and analysed using QSR software.</p>
<p>A further feature of the study was the use of non-participant observation. This approach is particularly apt when researchers are seeking to decode issues pertaining to the collective nature of labour relations, since certain qualitative techniques, including face-to-face interviews, ‘entail an inherent methodological individualism’ (Hodson et al., cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143831X11423113">Friedman and McDaniel, 1998</xref>: 119). Such observations included employee ‘away days’, where the necessity for workplace cooperation and consensus was outlined, and various feedback events where the research team briefed managers, trade union activists and employees on the findings.</p>
<p>An important additional aspect of the research was the use of an employee survey. This was conducted at two specific junctures, winter 2006 and spring 2008. These two time points reflect important phases in the development of partnership. Phase one is concerned with employee experiences during the initial stages of the accord. In contrast, phase two reflects experiences nearly two years after the initial brokering of workplace partnership. Given the centrality of trust to most formulations of partnership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X11423113">Dietz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11423113">Guest and Peccei, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X11423113">Johnstone et al., 2009</xref>) the survey sought <italic>inter alia</italic> to gauge the degree of trust employees had in management. Trust was measured through three questions where employees were asked to indicate the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with each statement (1 = strongly disagree and 6 = strongly agree), where the higher the score the greater the trust employees had in management. The questions were, ‘middle management have always provided reliable information’; ‘I believe the information that middle management provides’; and ‘I believe the information senior management provides’. These questions were added together to create a scale measuring trust. The reliability coefficients for the scale at both time points were high (time 1, Cronbach’s α .86, mean 3.38, SD .79, <italic>N</italic> = 196; time 2, Cronbach’s α .83, mean 3.57, SD .74, <italic>N</italic> = 196), far exceeding the minimum recommendation of .60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143831X11423113">Nunnally, 1978</xref>), which indicates that the three items have good internal reliability and are a consistent measure of trust. The individual means for each question at time 1 and time 2 are shown in Table A1 in the Appendix; there is a general upward trend across all questions.</p>

<title>Engco</title>
<p>Employing a total of 84,000 workers in five countries, Engco is a subsidiary of a major MNC. The core business – continuous process heavy engineering – serves a wide variety of markets including construction, automotive, packaging, the aerospace industry and ‘yellow goods’. The organization is based around three international business streams. Geographically, around one-third of the total workforce are employed in the UK at five main locations, including the study plant. At the commencement of research in 2006, the workforce, including contractors, numbered 6000. Within the UK this plant dominates its own division in terms of personnel and output. The focus of our research is a critical unit within the plant, sitting at the confluence of a range of production processes. The nature of the business is highly cyclical and the company has taken an aggressive stance on cost reductions and business improvements in recent years with significant workforce reductions, plant closures and the ‘mothballing’ of underutilized facilities.</p>
<p>Two trade unions are recognized for collective bargaining, one for semi- and unskilled workers, the other for the craft grades (henceforth referred to as the ‘general’ and ‘craft’ unions). Levels of membership are high and the plant was routinely described as a de facto closed shop. Collective bargaining is conducted at national level via a single table format through a central coordinating committee. The high degree of centralization leaves little room for local input on pay issues beyond the fine tuning of bonus payments.</p>
<p>‘Arm’s length’ best describes the traditional managerial–trade union relationship, the managerial approach being neatly captured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143831X11423113">Purcell and Gray’s (1986)</xref> constitutional (sophisticated modern) managerial style. Periodic bouts of downsizing had nurtured a lack of trust and an acrimonious relationship. Experiments in task participation had been ‘shambolic’ (shop steward, general union). A recent flirtation with teamworking, for example, was widely criticized as a crude exercise in demanning – albeit imposed via voluntary redundancies – and the cull of many key operators resulted in a significant loss of knowledge stocks. The unions were especially critical of the way alterations to working practices had been foisted upon them without meaningful consultation. It was into this rather forbidding context that a newly appointed managing director (MD) sought to introduce partnership working in 2005.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section6-0143831X11423113">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>The partnership initiative was a central component of a wider cultural change programme, branded by the new MD as ‘The Mission’. It was introduced in the latter part of 2005 as an agenda ‘to inspire every single employee to change the business for the better through their own actions’ (Divisional Newsletter, August 2006). The twin catalysts for the intervention were health and safety and production and efficiency considerations. Two fatalities had occurred in 2005. These tragic events had ‘shaken [the] business to the core’ (MD, quoted in Divisional Newsletter), triggering some ‘considerable soul searching’ (HR director) regarding the underlying problems within the organization. Wider manifestations of such included quality complaints from internal and external customers, a significant productivity deficit vis-a-vis an overseas sister facility and lax standards of housekeeping. An initial brainstorming session among the senior managerial team concluded the root causes were threefold: habitual breach of rules, poor processes and lack of consequences for inappropriate behaviour (HR director).</p>
<p>The necessity for wholesale change was subsequently cascaded throughout the division. An initial meeting labelled ‘The Top 100’ was held with the 100 most senior managers. Based around the principles of neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), a change management model that had acquired significant practitioner kudos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0143831X11423113">Woodall and Douglas, 2000</xref>), the central aim was to ‘reframe’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143831X11423113">Bandler and Grinder, 1983</xref>) corporate behaviour. The assembled managers were asked to consider the behavioural traits of the organization set against their own aspirations. The conclusion that ‘the two were almost opposite’ (HR director) confirmed the MD’s belief in the widespread presence of a ‘cultural malaise’.</p>
<p>Given the strength of organized labour, trade union buy-in was considered a necessary precursor for any cultural transformation. Local activists were invited to meet the MD, where the need for change was communicated via a combination of education, exhortation and persuasion. The shop steward community was broadly supportive. As one activist observed,<disp-quote>
<p>In the past you wouldn’t get anywhere near the top [management] let alone talk to them the way we’re talking to them. I believe it’s the last chance saloon. If we don’t make the change now we’ll have a long time to regret it. In a sense this could be biggest con we have ever gone through but I tend to think it isn’t and the bloke [MD] is genuine enough and we need to change. (Shop steward, general union)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a means of progressing cultural change, and more specifically, the search for consensual and transparent IR, a barrage of EI techniques was subsequently unleashed on the workforce. It is now well accepted that the organizational shape of EI can be characterized in terms of ‘wave’ patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143831X11423113">Marchington et al., 1993</xref>: 555). The wave metaphor thus provides a convenient means of illustrating the relationship between EI and the development of partnership at Engco (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143831X11423113">Figure 1</xref>). Following Marchington et al.’s original schema, the horizontal axis measures time while the vertical axis depicts the <italic>centrality</italic> and <italic>prominence</italic> of the various techniques. The former indicates the significance of each intervention within the organization, while the latter demonstrates the importance of each technique in relation to other forms of EI at different points in time. The waves concept is simply a ‘descriptive metaphor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143831X11423113">Marchington et al., 1993</xref>: 560) which ‘does not <italic>per se</italic> explain [or predict] why the waves occur or vary in shape duration or impact’. It is nonetheless a useful schematic aid to explication and reference will be made to the various ‘waves’ depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143831X11423113">Figure 1</xref> as the narrative unfolds.</p>

<p>The need for cultural change and the requirement for more cooperative IR was relayed to the wider workforce via a series of launch events held at a local convention centre. In terms of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11423113">Marchington et al.’s (1992)</xref> typology, these comprised a combination of downward communication and upward problem solving – the senior trade union activists were consulted on form and content. Herein, change management was operationalized via a process of normative re-education, the aim being to ‘unfreeze’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143831X11423113">Dale and Cooper, 1992</xref>) established modes of behaviour. A local media company was commissioned to assemble a series of ‘high impact’, ‘emotionally orientated’ (manufacturing manager) videos, which included brief eulogies of the two deceased workers. To the backdrop of the Sex Pistols’ <italic>Pretty Vacant</italic> soundtrack, photo shots of deficiencies in H&amp;S procedures, quality, corporate efficiency and general standards of housekeeping were catalogued – the lyric ‘<italic>and we don’t care</italic>’ was used to emphasize the degree of ‘cultural malaise’. The message, which some workers described as ‘shock tactics’, was deliberately brutal – ‘this is <italic>your</italic> company, it’s a mess, it’s going to close, we are polluting the environment, it’s killing people’ (manufacturing manager). The ‘reframing’ process was described thus,<disp-quote>
<p>What it seeks to do is use videos of the ‘<italic>as is</italic>’ situation to get people to actually see it with new eyes, external eyes, because they become so consumed in the culture. What we want them to do is stand back from it, look at it and realize ‘well it is only actually staying like that because I am part of an organization that keeps it like that’. (Manufacturing manager)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast with previous practice, shop stewards acted as facilitators in break-out sessions; the established format was for continuous improvement (CI) coaches to lead problem solving events. Workers were asked to consider the ‘to be’ situation – i.e. where they wanted the organization to go. The initial relationship between partnership and EI was therefore the standard one of ‘forward synergy’. The presence and support of the unions was utilized to underwrite acceptance of the need for significant adjustments to EI and working practices.</p>
<p>There is broad agreement that consultation is a fundamental partnership practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143831X11423113">Oxenbridge and Brown, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143831X11423113">Samuel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0143831X11423113">Terry, 2003</xref>). Reflective of this, the initial manifestation of a shift towards more cooperative IR was captured in a change to the tenor of consultation. The monthly joint consultative committee (JCC) gatherings had traditionally been fractious and often hostile affairs. Indeed, the consultative apparatus had been convened 20 years earlier to deal with overmanning. The process of consultation was therefore closely associated with rationalization and mass redundancies; the very presence of the body symbolic of divisiveness and distrust.</p>
<p>Communication was regarded by the newly incumbent MD as a key tenet of the new accord. One consequence of the desire for more cooperative IR was far greater discussion of key business metrics, elements of which were share price sensitive, e.g. the escalating cost of raw materials and profitability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143831X11423113">Oxenbridge and Brown (2004</xref>: 393) suggest one measure of ‘robust’ partnership lies in the capacity of trade union representatives to contribute ideas at the earliest practical stage. Significantly, managers exhibited a greater degree of receptiveness to trade union input, especially with regard to those issues centring on the so-called ‘new’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143831X11423113">Stuart and Martinez Lucio, 2002</xref>: 191) industrial relations agenda, e.g. training, appraisal and employee welfare. In line with the emergent ethos of partnership, the ‘range’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X11423113">Marchington and Wilkinson, 2000</xref>: 343) of substantive issues subject to consultation was extended, a dynamic reflected in the enhanced centrality afforded to consultation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143831X11423113">Figure 1</xref>). Activists spoke of being ‘involved every step of the way’ on decisions that would previously have been a <italic>fait accompli</italic>. As the HR manufacturing manager observed,<disp-quote>
<p>When we develop policies now we get the trade unions involved from minute one and say this is what we are looking to do . . . let’s talk it through. Before we would have developed it, gone to them and said this is it and they would have kicked off.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One important outcome of extensive consultation was the successful introduction of a pay-for-competence initiative. A consequence of the introduction of teamworking had been the erosion of skill sets, especially among craft workers. Managers were keen to address the situation, not least because of the escalating costs of using contract labour to plug skills gaps. The unions had long been resistant to the erosion of payment on the basis of seniority and the use of contingent pay beyond the negotiation of local bonus payments. The unions’ support in this instance derived from concerns regarding chronic deskilling. As one shop steward lamented, ‘we’ve got boys who haven’t been on tools for years. We’ve got a fitter in one department that’s been a “brickie’s” mate for the last seven years! He hasn’t picked a tool up.’ Settlement on this issue afforded management with a greater degree of flexibility. It was estimated that savings in the region of £8 million had been reaped due to reduced overtime and improved output.</p>
<p>Consider here also the drugs and alcohol policy. Alcohol abuse had long been rife among a small but significant group, a reflection of high disposable income and a work hard play hard culture. Working under the influence of drugs or alcohol had traditionally been interpreted as gross misconduct and met with summary dismissal. An upshot of lengthy consultation was the convening of a management–trade union working party which sought more proactive, consensual solutions. One corollary was the appointment of two drugs and alcohol counsellors, sponsored jointly by management and unions. Their role was to offer support and treatment to workers affected by drugs and alcohol misuse. This development was regarded as a significant improvement on the erstwhile policy of ‘zero tolerance’ – ‘do you put them on the scrap heap or help them out? [Now] we give them a chance’ (shop steward, general union).</p>
<p>For those close to the consultative process the invocation of jointly formulated solutions to long-standing organizational problems engendered a degree of trust traditionally lacking in management–trade union relations. Other studies, however (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X11423113">Dietz, 2004</xref>), have demonstrated the limits of partnership where trust is restricted to an influential core of key actors. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X11423113">Dietz (2004</xref>: 18) has argued that,<disp-quote>
<p>. . . trust levels on the shop floor will be higher where managers meet more frequently with them and/or devolve joint problem solving properly to them. Where this is not feasible, the key players should share information openly and explain the reasons for organizational decisions, lest they be seen as a remote elite – a self serving ‘cosy club’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A noteworthy finding was the degree of resourcing devoted to the dissemination of messages supportive of partnership via the EI architecture. The initial launch events were a fundamental component of this process of ‘re-education’, later buttressed by away (‘mission’) days and newsletters. In terms of the former, the prescriptive literature routinely argues that under the process of change management a demonstration of current ineffectiveness is essential (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143831X11423113">Dale and Cooper, 1992</xref>). Much emphasis was therefore placed on ‘market realities’ and the ‘business case’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11423113">Danford et al., 2005</xref>) for partnership via the provision of production metrics. The ‘politics of investment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143831X11423113">Martinez Lucio and Weston, 1994</xref>: 113) were an integral component with workers systematically reminded of investment competition between plants and the crucial importance attached to efficiency considerations. ‘Coercive comparisons’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143831X11423113">Mueller and Purcell, 1992</xref>) were made between the study plant and its world-class overseas sister facility, with the requirement for leanness through energy savings and quality issues afforded significant coverage.</p>
<p>Sessions were typically organized around syndicated exercises that provided room for bottom-up communication and problem solving, with union activists again acting as facilitators. In one early event, for example, groups of workers were asked to consider the antecedents of unsafe working practices,<disp-quote>
<p>An awful lot of safety issues have been brought onboard. . . . A lot of things still haven’t been addressed but hopefully we’re going to get there. . . . Things that we’ve been bringing up that haven’t been done <italic>are</italic> being done now. [For example] they’ve brought in ‘pre-flight’ inspections every time a crane’s used now – so that’s obviously going to help with safety. (Team member)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In later sessions participants explored potential economies in energy usage. At this juncture workers expressed broad satisfaction, appreciating the opportunity to enhance their organizational awareness and contribute to aspects of plant efficiency:<disp-quote>
<p>It [away day] was very impressive. Up until then you didn’t seem to know what was happening. . . . You weren’t getting the information. Now you understand where the company is going and what they are trying to achieve. Before there wasn’t any information, you had to find it out yourself. (Contractor)</p>
<p>I would like to see more of them [away days]. They are very, very helpful. Even people that do certain jobs on quite a regular basis are not aware of the problems that are being brought up in those breakout sessions. . . . They are very definitely a useful source of information. Most of the information, important information, comes from these away days. (Team member)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The transformation programme started to yield tangible dividends in terms of productivity, environmental metrics and most significantly H&amp;S:<disp-quote>
<p>There aren’t many industries apart from petrol chemicals and nuclear, where you have got such high temperatures, high pressure hydraulics and high pressure steam. Everything is so heavy; people don’t realize. When things go wrong you don’t get away with it. There aren’t many industries like this with such a hostile working environment. . . . It is a very hard area to build in a lot of safety by the very nature of the work. [But] we’ve made tremendous inroads to improve safety here compared to what it was years ago. I think considering the environment we are in, we are doing remarkably well. (Team member)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The content of away days incrementally reflected this dynamic with time spent using multi-media to celebrate the resultant gains reaped from partnership. In one session, to the backdrop of Davie Bowie’s <italic>Changes</italic>, managers formally set out the achievements made vis-a-vis yield, quality and housekeeping standards. Implicit indicators of job security, e.g. the provision of inward investment, were afforded prominence as management sought to ‘re-freeze’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143831X11423113">Dale and Cooper, 1992</xref>) behaviour and sell the benefits of cooperation.</p>
<p>Beyond the ‘mission’ days, workers were exposed to a much improved and more extensive system of downwards communications. Standard procedure here was to disseminate material via monthly corporate and divisional newsletters. As can been from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143831X11423113">Figure 1</xref>, however, the prominence of newsletters increased as the change initiative progressed. To sell the business case for partnership a dedicated fortnightly plant-focused offering, <italic>Mission News</italic>, was established. The publication of this was the key task of a dedicated six member communications team. The empirical key note was the quantity and quality of information disclosure, which, with its localized and highly contextualized focus, was described as a ‘revelation’, ‘read fairly religiously’, compared with the erstwhile ‘glib and glossy’ centrally produced offerings. <italic>Mission News</italic> again sought to ‘educate’ employees vis-a-vis business imperatives by focusing on specific areas – industry outlook, business performance indicators (e.g. achievement of production milestones and inward investment), H&amp;S issues, recruitment trends and environmental metrics.</p>
<p>The editorial content was heavily steered by internal and external events. Consider in this instance the recession of 2008/9. At the height of the economic downturn the organization culled 3500 jobs across European operations – 2500 in the UK. Yet during this period the content remained markedly upbeat. Against this turbulent backdrop an attempt was made to ‘sell up’ the benefits of <italic>local</italic> accommodation and consensus as a means of insulating the partnership accord from events at group level. There are affinities here with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11423113">Evans et al.’s (2001</xref>: 303) study of the Rover (Longbridge) restructuring of the late 1990s, where managers were aware that internal communications had to compete with reports in the wider media; reports which could destabilize trust and management–shop floor relations.</p>
<p>One manager described the editorial dilemma thus:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s a bit of a paradox for us in terms of how we sell the message [change programme], because what we’ve got is one [local component of the process] that is breaking all records, operating at world-class productivities but the <italic>business</italic> is losing massive amounts of money every month. So there is a difficult message for us, on one hand we want to celebrate, but also we want the workforce to understand that we are not in good shape as a business.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The tendency for direct communications to usurp collectively orientated modes has been well documented (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143831X11423113">Marchington et al., 1993</xref>). In this instance written bulletins and consultation were viewed as parallel rather than competing processes, i.e. there was a measure of ‘network embeddedness’ or mutual reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11423113">Cox et al., 2006</xref>: 253). Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11423113">Danford et al. (2005</xref>: 615) suggests worker disengagement with the practice and content of consultation can diminish shop floor support for partnership. The provision of a synopsis of JCC discussions in the newsletter with direct quotes from both senior managers and the convenor was an important innovation. Complementing the desire to reproduce the pluralism of consultation, the leading article from the MD was routinely reinforced with a supportive trade union note, emphasizing, albeit often implicitly, the potential benefits to be reaped from cooperation and consensus. The following extracts taken from facing pages of the June 2009 issue are characteristic examples:<disp-quote>
<p>It will be a real challenge to implement price rises in the coming period and coupled with a 80–90% increase in certain raw materials, it puts our business in a potentially unenviable position. . . . By working together we will come out of these current difficulties better prepared for the future. (MD)</p>
<p>We could be the benchmark plant in Europe. . . . We’ve heard about the confidence that people are starting to have in us, so if we want to leave a legacy for future generations, we have the opportunity now. (Convenor)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Away from task participation and downward communication, an employee survey was a further component of the EI mix. Undertaken by the research team, this sought to explore employee attitudes and perceptions of the impact of The Mission intervention. The survey was commissioned by the unit manager hosting the research. As such it was the single EI initiative under review not coordinated at divisional level. The survey, depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143831X11423113">Figure 1</xref> by two waves of varying intensity, was administered to the workforce during the winter of 2006 and spring 2008 (technical detail is provided in the Appendix).</p>
<p>Given the centrality of trust to most formulations of partnership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X11423113">Dietz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11423113">Guest and Peccei, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X11423113">Johnstone et al., 2009</xref>), we focus on this aspect of the survey. The survey included a measure of employee perceptions of the trust they had in senior and middle management (Table A1 in Appendix). The results show that employees had developed a significantly greater degree of trust in the information provided by management. Paired <italic>t</italic>-test comparisons are used to test if there is a significant increase in the reported level of trust at time 2 compared to time 1, and this is confirmed (<italic>t</italic> –3.255, d.f. 195, <italic>p</italic> .001).</p>
<p>In terms of the complementarities between partnership and EI – i.e. how management utilized the data – the results from phase one were used as a reference point for decision-making. The findings were actually more positive than managers had anticipated. There had been a time lag between the commencement of the change initiative and the first survey. A full year had elapsed involving intense managerial efforts to sell the benefits and necessity for partnership. Better than anticipated outcomes served to reinforce perceptions regarding the cogency of the extant EI programme and ‘ideological supports’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11423113">Danford et al., 2005</xref>: 615) for partnership. However, by phase two a new unit manager had been appointed replacing the erstwhile owner and ‘champion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143831X11423113">Marchington et al., 1993</xref>: 566) of the survey process. Our interpretation here was of some schism in the managerial ranks regarding the added-value to be derived from a cultural survey and partnership more generally. Interviews with trade union representatives suggested the incumbent had sought to revert to an arm’s length relationship with the local union activists. One corollary was the downgrading of the survey component of the EI mix as a managerial priority; significantly less time was devoted to the second feedback event than the first. Employees similarly commented on the overly cursory nature of the second tranche of the feedback process. This deprioritization is reflected in the damping down of the relevant wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143831X11423113">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>Research suggests the use of EI is often associated with workplace partnership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X11423113">Dundon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X11423113">Munro, 2002</xref>). Hitherto, however, insufficient emphasis has been placed on the strategies management utilizes to embed workplace partnership, especially in those situations where the parties are moving away from a formerly antagonistic relationship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11423113">Marchington et al. (1992)</xref> have indicated a number of factors that may drive interest in EI but so far the links to partnership have been underexplored. In this article we have sought to unpack the relationship between the two phenomena; as such our work is less concerned with outcomes than matters of process.</p>
<p>The standard approach is to conceive of the coupling in terms of ‘forward synergies’ – union involvement may imbue organizational change programmes, which often utilize techniques of EI, with a measure of legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11423113">Ackers and Payne, 1998</xref>: 531; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143831X11423113">Stewart and Wass, 1998</xref>). Our findings bear out these twin notions of coupling and complementarity. The invocation of partnership was paired with the use of various EI interventions within a wider change management programme. Union support was deemed a critical antecedent of broader workforce acceptance. Our findings however indicate that the nature of the relationship went beyond the unidirectional synergies depicted in extant accounts. A burgeoning EI architecture was used <italic>itself</italic> to confer a parallel legitimacy on the fledgling partnership accord, an example of reverse synergy. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143831X11423113">Figure 1</xref> illustrates how the waves of EI (with the exception of the cultural survey) acquired increased prominence and ‘institutional embeddedness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11423113">Cox et al., 2006</xref>: 253) in tandem with the main partnership process – consultation. Management sought to surmount the potential ‘information asymmetries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143831X11423113">Kim et al., 2010</xref>: 376) that can arise from a narrow reliance on the latter process, where information may be confined to a ‘remote elite’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X11423113">Dietz, 2004</xref>). Such a restricted approach can undermine trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X11423113">Dietz, 2004</xref>) and general workplace support for partnership (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X11423113">Guest et al., 2008</xref>: 128). There were two features to this process. First, managers sought to invoke behavioural change through the ‘re-education’ of employees regarding business imperatives. Second, in view of past failures and a long-standing antagonism, the celebration of advances reaped by workplace cooperation (e.g. proxy indicators of job security and improvements in H&amp;S metrics) was used to underscore the potential returns to both capital <italic>and</italic> labour. In this sense, information disclosure was both a precursor and correlate of partnership. The strengthening of employee trust in the information provided by management, within the context of an erstwhile fractious industrial relations climate, was the outward manifestation of the cogency of the tactics deployed. Useful as these findings are, future research in this area might explore trust dynamics utilizing a more refined benchmark of progress, e.g. the presence or otherwise of ‘goodwill’ trust – i.e. trust that can tolerate minor (managerial) defections as uncharacteristic aberrations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X11423113">Dietz, 2004</xref>: 7).</p>
<p>The findings reported link squarely into the theme of managerial ‘vigilance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11423113">Dobbins and Gunnigle, 2009</xref>: 567). The economic and organizational motives for partnership have been well documented (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143831X11423113">Stuart and Martinez Lucio, 2005</xref>: 12–14). Far less attention has been paid to the tactics and policies management deploys to embed such systems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11423113">Dobbins and Gunnigle (2009</xref>: 567) refer to the associated costs and the requirement for resources and support, but this line of analysis remains empirically muted. A key finding was the high degree of resourcing devoted to kick starting and sustaining myriad complementary EI interventions. The initial launch event at a local football stadium; subsequent off-site ‘away days’, with the provision of overtime payments for attendees; deployment of a dedicated communications team; and the costs of commissioning two surveys, all involved significant capital outlay .Vigilance, while necessary, is far from cost neutral.</p>
<p>Away from the financial implications, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11423113">Cox et al. (2006</xref>: 262) usefully caution that,<disp-quote>
<p>. . . the skills and knowledge demanded from both managers and employee representatives in order to reap the potential benefits of complementarity across EIP (employee involvement and participation) structures are considerable.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A noteworthy finding here was the degree of managerial dexterity evidenced. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11423113">Evans et al. (2001</xref>: 308) make the point that the various internal communication devices that can be deployed need to convey regular congruous information. This is likely to be more so in those situations where management lacks a monopoly of information, e.g. in unionized settings and/or where there is extensive press coverage of ongoing events. Such factors may mediate the degree of confidence employees have in corporately sourced information. In this instance the central vision espoused by the divisional MD was pivotal in ensuring consistency and fit among the various media. Within this broad steer, however, and driven by changing events, local actors were careful in balancing the twin imperatives for censure and celebration. This twin-track approach to direct information disclosure is a more sophisticated stance than standard references to ‘lifeboat democracy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143831X11423113">Cressey et al., 1985</xref>), where the provision of information is used to justify tough decisions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11423113">Evans et al., 2001</xref>). Periodic celebration was essential to legitimize workplace partnership and maintain morale, while censure was crucial in highlighting behaviour inconsistent with cooperation and the wider desire for cultural transformation.</p>
<p>Albeit modestly, the findings reported here update work done two decades ago by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11423113">Marchington et al. (1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143831X11423113">1993)</xref> exploring the dynamic of involvement and participation. The configuration of waves depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143831X11423113">Figure 1</xref> is subtly different to that catalogued in the early 1990s. With the exception of the rather ephemeral use of surveys, our model depicts the very tight coupling of EI and employee participation (i.e. consultation). In their own case studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X11423113">Ackers et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11423113">Marchington et al., 1992</xref>), Marchington and colleagues routinely plotted tensions, competition and limited alignment between the various interventions. In unionized settings EI was often used, for example, to usurp structures of consultation – so-called ‘human resource management participation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X11423113">Ackers et al., 1992</xref>). A significant process in our study, however, was the use made of EI to <italic>reinforce</italic> the position of the unions rather than undermine them, operationalized by the involvement of unions in downward communication through newsletters, for example.</p>
<p>There are self-evident dangers in extrapolating from one study, but the findings reported here provide some evidence for the presence of a less ‘Manichean’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11423113">Ackers and Payne, 1998</xref>: 534), defensive and more confident managerial approach – one prone to treat union presence and EI as complementary and mutually reinforcing, rather than binary alternatives. This echoes the finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143831X11423113">Croucher et al. (2006)</xref>, whose macro-level UK data demonstrate a positive association between union presence and direct communication, and reinforces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11423113">Dundon et al.’s (2004</xref>: 1167) assertion that ‘management is evidently thinking across the range of techniques’. Our findings suggest that under conditions of voluntarism three vital preconditions are necessary for the synergistic coupling of partnership with EI and, more broadly, the stabilization of institutional arrangements founded on transparency and cooperation. First, the presence of a ‘genuine’ as opposed to ‘containing’ partnership accord. The latter ‘shallow’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143831X11423113">Oxenbridge and Brown, 2004</xref>) approach often emerges as a result of employers coercing weak unions in order to implement <italic>immediate</italic> restructuring in response to business crisis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143831X11423113">Samuel, 2007</xref>: 461). Given the short-term, cost-driven focus, this variant of partnership is unlikely to spawn the complex and resource-intensive institutional architecture catalogued in the present study. Second, the presence of strong and well-organized trade unions. Where this condition holds, union power restricts the potential use of EI as a crude unitary, by-passing mechanism. Moreover, the legitimacy afforded by organized labour may smooth the introduction of innovative institutional arrangements and the wider processes of change management. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0143831X11423113">Terry (2003</xref>: 500) has opined, ‘Supine trade unions serve neither the interest of their members nor, ironically, of employers.’ Third, the emergence of trust is clearly crucial for the cohesion of labour–management pacts newly founded on cooperation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X11423113">Guest et al.’s (2008</xref>: 140) research is notable in this regard in indicating that direct participation is associated with high mutual trust. Our research supports this finding to the extent that task-based ‘away days’ were crucial vehicles for information sharing, complemented by the use of various written media. For the most part workers welcomed the significantly extended flow of information and the provision of key metrics. Managers, conversely, found the appropriation of workers’ tacit knowledge a useful means of improving the efficiency of work streams and aspects of H&amp;S. Important as this <italic>information</italic> exchange was, early <italic>tangible</italic> returns from the new institutional set-up to management, trade unions and their constituencies were the pivotal development invoking the necessary minima of trust. Once the parties had built up a track record of mutually beneficial exchanges, short-term inconsistencies were less likely to be viewed as opportunistic defections. Positive outcomes may similarly generate ‘buy-in’ from erstwhile sceptics, invoking a path-dependency where the new institutional architecture can flourish – the so-called ‘lock-in’ argument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143831X11423113">Peccei et al., 2010</xref>: 423). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143831X11423113">Peccei et al. (2010)</xref> argue vis-a-vis downward communication, ‘once management shares information with employees, it may well be difficult to discontinue, since expectations arise among employees to do more of the same’. Future research could usefully explore the wider salience of the findings presented here and the strides made by other organizations, and the problems encountered, in reaping the benefits of the synergies depicted.</p>
