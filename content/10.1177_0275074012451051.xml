<abstract>
<p>Strategic planning has the potential to enable cities to weather the effects of fiscal crises. City officials can use the information gathered though internal and external scanning to implement fiscal policy changes that can minimize their governments’ exposure to external fiscal shocks, and to experiment with alternative service delivery arrangements that generate cost savings. Linking strategic plans to budgets allows cities to focus on core services, and reduce expenditures for nonessential programs. Strategic plans can also provide a framework for operations, facilitating closer cooperation and coordination among managers and workers in preventing the further deterioration in the fiscal condition of their organization. Can cities that implement comprehensive strategic planning adjust better to the current fiscal crisis and minimize their budget deficits? The results of advanced econometric analysis are inconclusive. Adjusting for selection bias and endogeneity, strategic planning is associated with the perception of improving city government fiscal health. Planning, however, has no effect on actual deficits.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Great Recession—the second longest since World War II—officially ended in June 2009. For many city governments however, the local fiscal crisis is about to get worse. As federal stimulus money dries up, and with the anemic recovery in the housing and job markets, it seems inevitable that the Great Recession will soon give way to the Great Fiscal Calamity in local governments.</p>
<p>Some cities are laboring to turn the crisis into an opportunity to improve service delivery while reducing costs of operating government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0275074012451051">1</xref></sup> Others began earlier, having adopted popular management reforms in the1980s and 1990s to improve government performance. Such reforms include strategic planning that has been defined as a “disciplined effort to produce fundamental decisions and actions that shape and guide what an organization (or other entity) is, what it does, and why it does it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074012451051">Bryson, 2004</xref>, p. 6).</p>
<p>How well municipal governments cope with fiscal crises depends partly on their ability to limit their exposure to external risks and to implement necessary adjustments to internal operations. Through strategic planning, organizations scan their internal and external environments and formulate appropriate fiscal policy and organizational responses to minimize the effects of environmental shocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074012451051">Bryson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074012451051">Hendrick, 2003</xref>). Strategic plans can also provide a framework for budgeting and operations, enabling cities to rein in expenditures by focusing on core services and building support from various stakeholders on the process of fiscal retrenchment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0275074012451051">Behn, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0275074012451051">Levine, 1985</xref>). Has strategic planning influenced city governments’ fiscal performance during the Great Recession in terms of minimizing their budget deficits?</p>
<p>To answer this question, this research uses data from the International City/County Management Association’s (ICMA) 2009 State of the Profession Survey, and 1700 Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports from city governments across the US. The next section reviews the empirical literature examining the relationship between strategic planning and fiscal outcomes, followed by a discussion of why and how strategic planning can potentially enable cities to control their deficits during a period of economic recession. Succeeding sections describe the empirical model, including variables and data sources, and present the results of the econometric analyses and their implications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0275074012451051">
<title>Review of the Empirical Literature</title>
<p>A recent review of the literature on strategic planning in the public sector concludes that while a number of positive impacts are associated with this management process, “there is little research that tests the link between the planning process and these outcomes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0275074012451051">Poister, Pitts, &amp; Edwards, 2010</xref>, p. 539). Indeed, there is no research that has empirically examined the contributions of strategic planning to how governments adjust to fiscal crises, but there are a few studies that offer some clues on how strategic planning can matter for an organization’s fiscal performance.</p>
<p>Crittenden, Crittenden and Hunt (1988) focused on religious organizations in a U.S. Southwestern state and found that strategic planning practices such as financial analysis and implementation management were correlated with increased funding, but stakeholder analysis reduced external revenues. Siciliano (1997) found that environmental trends analysis, competition analysis, formulation of long-range goals and short-term objectives, presence of action plans, and results-monitoring improved the financial performance of YMCA organizations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0275074012451051">Boyne and Gould-Williams’ (2003)</xref> study of local authorities in Wales concluded that internal analysis during strategic planning decreased cost-effectiveness, but external analysis produced the opposite result. Using data from a survey of senior officials from municipal governments in the United States, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074012451051">Poister and Streib (2005)</xref> showed that different dimensions of strategic planning were positively correlated with an additive impact index that combined nineteen variables including maintenance of fiscal condition. A serious concern with these studies is that they do not control for the effects of other variables, other than those that measure aspects of strategic planning.</p>
<p>Using the results of the 1999 and 2001 Government Performance Project and controlling for fiscal institutions, political and economic variables, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0275074012451051">Jimenez (2011)</xref> found that state governments with higher quality managing-for-results systems (which include strategic planning) received higher bond ratings, lowering interest costs of borrowing. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0275074012451051">Gilmour and Louis’ (2007)</xref> multivariate analysis showed that federal programs that received higher scores in the strategic planning component of the Program Assessment and Reporting Tool (PART) registered budget increments as reflected in the President’s budget.</p>
<p>This research builds on these past efforts to link strategic planning with financial management, and examines the relationship between comprehensive strategic planning and the budget deficits of city governments during the Great Recession. Comprehensive strategic planning is defined here as a process that involves internal and external scanning, using performance information in updating plans, and linking plans to budgets and operations.</p>

<sec id="section4-0275074012451051">
<title>Why Strategic Planning Matters for Deficits: Rational Decision Making</title>
<p>At its core, strategic planning represents a rational process of decision making. Rationality refers to the extent to which a decision process involves the collection of information and use of this information in making choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0275074012451051">Feldman &amp; March, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0275074012451051">Dean &amp; Sharfman, 1996</xref>). Although rational decision making is purposive and coordinated, it transpires within organizational and individual information-processing limits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0275074012451051">Simon, 1957</xref>). Nevertheless, inherent in rational decision making is the belief that information and analysis can guide organizational behavior toward some desired goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0275074012451051">Boyne, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Strategic planning matters for how organizations cope with external fiscal shocks. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0275074012451051">Levine (1985</xref>, p. 696) argued, “The cities and agencies that adjusted best to deep and protracted levels of fiscal stress were able to formulate and stick to a strategic plan with a multi-year time frame.” One way strategic planning matters is by allowing organizations to systematically gather relevant information about their external and internal environments. Although strategic planning focuses on the long-term effectiveness of organizations,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0275074012451051">2</xref></sup> information gathered and analyzed during the planning process can provide impetus for decision makers to take timely action and implement necessary adjustments in response to external environmental threats and opportunities, and internal operational issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074012451051">Bryson, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Specifically, external scanning enables organizations to map relevant environments, asses what happened in the past and forecast trends that can affect their fiscal health. For example, the adverse effects of an economic recession on the local treasury can be anticipated and minimized by policies that diversify revenue sources. If there are institutional constraints (such as state-imposed local tax limits) or political resistance to revenue diversification (such as citizen rejection of new taxes or charges for services), local decision makers can focus on building slack, such as rainy day funds.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0275074012451051">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Assessment of the internal environment also provides local governments with information about internal strengths and weaknesses, specifically what works and what does not in the input-output-outcome linkage or value chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074012451051">Bryson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0275074012451051">Halachmi, 2000</xref>). Decision makers, among other things, can examine which services the local government can produce cost-effectively given the organization’s core competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0275074012451051">Levine, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074012451051">Bryson, 2004</xref>). Such examination may lead to a decision to pursue service contracting, other forms of privatization, or joint ventures with other local governments.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of internal assessment depends on the availability of performance information. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074012451051">Bryson (2004)</xref> argues that a performance information system is crucial for effective assessment of an organization’s value chain—helping to identify inefficient use of inputs, or activities that contribute little to desired outcomes. For example, in their documentation of the results of the performance benchmarking project involving North Carolina municipalities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0275074012451051">Ammons and Rivenbark (2008)</xref> noted that analysis of performance data led to more efficient ways of utilizing inputs such as equipment and personnel that resulted in significant cost savings.</p>
<p>Other scholars argue that a performance measurement system can help assess the outcomes of previously adopted strategic decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0275074012451051">Poister 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0275074012451051">Bryson et al. 2010</xref>), providing important feedback information that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0275074012451051">Moynihan (2008)</xref> avers can be used in double-loop organizational learning. As originally elaborated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074012451051">Argyris (1977)</xref>, double-loop learning enables decision makers to reevaluate and change the fundamental structure and goals of an organization, in contrast to single-loop learning which involves correcting errors in routine organizational processes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0275074012451051">Moynihan (2005</xref>, p. 204) points out that instead of merely assessing whether a program is operating efficiently, double-loop learning asks “whether the program is worth pursuing” in the first place.</p>
<p>Related to the above point, another way strategic planning may contribute to minimizing budget deficits during recessions is by articulating and clearly defining goals which then serve as a framework for resource allocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0275074012451051">Boyne &amp; Gould-Williams, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0275074012451051">Berry &amp; Wechsler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074012451051">Poister &amp; Streib 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0275074012451051">Levine (1985</xref>, p. 692) points out that a strategic perspective allows managers “to develop a clear understanding of what their department’s mission and core services are, to prioritize accordingly, and to create administrative arrangements to finance and deliver these services.” In periods of economic downturns when revenues decline precipitously, it is crucial for organizations to adapt their mix of services by reducing or terminating fringe services to rein in expenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0275074012451051">Miller &amp; Svara, 2009</xref>). Through goal prioritization and clarification, city governments can avoid overstretching limited resources to support numerous but unnecessary programs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0275074012451051">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, strategic planning can affect budget deficits by providing guidance to operations. The development of a shared vision through a strategic planning process can help structure employee behavior, and facilitate communication, coordination and purposive action among actors at different levels of the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074012451051">Bryson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074012451051">Hendrick, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0275074012451051">Boyne and Gould-Williams, 2003</xref>). The shared understanding of organizational goals, challenges, threats, and corresponding strategies has the potential of molding a cohesive community of workers informed of what they should and could not to improve the performance of their organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0275074012451051">Halachmi, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0275074012451051">Halachmi (2000</xref>, p. 358) argues that by transforming the organization into a community with shared values, strategic planning “can influence productivity by fostering loyalty and a sense of commitment that are called for when operational problems require employees to perform beyond the call of duty.” In a difficult fiscal environment, committed and loyal employees may be more willing to forego benefits such as paid leaves, accept furloughs, work longer hours for the same pay, and experiment with new ways of doing things to prevent further deterioration in the fiscal condition of their organization. Based on the previous arguments, it is expected that comprehensive strategic planning is associated with lower budget deficits.</p>

<sec id="section5-0275074012451051">
<title>Why Strategic Planning Does Not Matter for Deficits: Politics and Symbolic Adoption</title>
<p>There is reason to believe that strategic planning will not influence how cities adapt to a fiscal crisis. One explanation comes from the literature on the political model of organizational decision making. Organizational theorists argue that decision making is inherently political, involving coalition formation, bargaining, and conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0275074012451051">Cyert &amp; March, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0275074012451051">Bachrach &amp; Lowler, 1980</xref>). In this context, the possibility that strategic planning will bring about comprehensive changes (such as changes in the city government’s fiscal structure, implementation of targeted cuts or termination of noncore services, and experimentation with alternative service delivery mechanisms) is limited. After all, coalition building and continuous renegotiation mean that change will tend to be incremental, rather than comprehensive.</p>
<p>Fiscal decline may exacerbate political competition especially in the budgeting process, further constraining the possibility that the organization will be able to make strategic choices about what services and programs should be prioritized in resource allocation (Rubin 2003). Levine, Rubin and Wolohojian’s (1981) comprehensive analysis of cutback management in local governments shows that periods of accelerated revenue decline activate different interest groups within and outside of government. Public sector unions, service recipients, business and neighborhood groups resist strategies that target cuts to expenditures and services benefiting their members. With voter discontent because of the fiscal crisis, electoral vulnerability forces officials to avoid making “enemies of any size or kind between elections” (Levine, Rubin, &amp; Wolohojian, 1981, p. 211). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0275074012451051">Wolman and Davis’ (1980</xref>, p. 244) case studies concluded, “to the maximum extent possible, conflict avoidance is likely to characterize 1ocal official expenditure cutback behavior. One of the most common and successful cutback strategies because it is relatively invisible and conflict free is to reduce through inaction.” Local governments cut budgets by not making any adjustments for inflation.</p>
<p>When inaction is no longer sustainable, cutting across the board is the preferred policy. Such share-the-pain cutback approach minimizes conflict by creating a sense of fairness and equity among budgetary claimants (Wildavsky 1988; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0275074012451051">Levine, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0275074012451051">1985</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0275074012451051">Levine (1985</xref>, p. 692) describes this as a strategy of decrementalism in which organizations “balance their budgets by making marginal adjustments in their operating procedures and expenditures.” Although decrementalism may have long-term negative effects on organizational effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0275074012451051">Levine, 1985</xref>), it can “minimize pain” in the short term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0275074012451051">Levine 1979</xref>, p. 182). Clearly, in decremental budgeting, strategic plans will have limited influence on budgetary choices, and consequently on the deficit.</p>
<p>Yet another explanation why strategic planning will not matter for city deficits comes from neo-institutional theory in organization studies. This theory argues that through a process of institutional isomorphism, organizations become more homogenous or begin to look alike as they adopt similar structures, processes, and programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074012451051">DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983</xref>). Organizations copy popular management templates to conform to external expectations of what a successful organization should look like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074012451051">Meyer &amp; Rowan 1977</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0275074012451051">5</xref></sup> For example, government officials may learn through membership in professional organizations or formal training in universities that strategic planning is considered a best practice in local government management.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0275074012451051">6</xref></sup> By adopting the state-of-the-art management technique, local governments improve their image in the eyes of external stakeholders including other organizations and citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074012451051">Meyer &amp; Rowan 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>The problem is that local officials may adopt strategic planning practices in form, but seldom in substance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0275074012451051">7</xref></sup> Symbolic adoption amounts to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0275074012451051">Boxenbaum and Jonsson (2008)</xref> called “image management,” and this may be important for organizations in terms of gaining legitimacy and resources needed for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074012451051">Meyer &amp; Rowan, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074012451051">DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983</xref>). Ceremonial implementation of strategic planning in city governments can mitigate popular perceptions of government inefficiency, without actually creating a more efficient government. The reputational effect points to a sinister view of government reform—citizen trust is gained with hypocritical reforms. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0275074012451051">March and Olsen (1983)</xref>, even the mere announcement of reform may be enough to persuade a pessimistic public. They argue that<disp-quote>
<p>Announcing a major reorganization symbolizes the possibility of effective leadership and the belief [in] that possibility may be of greater significance than the execution of it. The most important things appear to be statements of intent, an assurance of proper values, and willingness to try. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0275074012451051">March &amp; Olsen, 1983</xref>, p. 290)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A possible result of symbolic reform and image management is that local residents may be more willing to shoulder increases in taxes or user fees even during economic recessions with the expectation that management reforms will eventually create a more rational, efficient, and effective government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0275074012451051">8</xref></sup> It is highly unlikely however, that symbolic adoption will easily deceive local residents. Because of their proximity to citizens, it is easier for local taxpayers to control and hold their municipal government accountable for its performance (Oates, 1972). If public management reforms such as strategic planning are symbolically adopted and do not result in more efficient and cost-effective delivery of services, local residents are unlikely to support increases in taxes or fees. Consequently, there is no reason to believe that ceremonial implementation of strategic planning will matter for city budget deficits during the Great Recession.</p>

<title>Data, Measures and Estimation Methodology</title>
<sec id="section7-0275074012451051">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The main source of data for this research is the 2009 International City/County Management Association’s (ICMA) State of the Profession Survey. Some 2,214 city-like and county governments participated in the survey, representing a response rate of 26%. Only the ICMA data for municipal governments are analyzed in this research. Respondents included city managers and chief administrative officers.</p>
<p>Information on actual deficits in 2009 and 2010 was gathered from 1700 Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (CAFR) of city governments. CAFRs were downloaded from city websites, or gathered directly from the city officials through emailed requests. Data from the 2002 and 2007 Census of Governments, and the 2005-2009 (average) American Community Survey supplemented data from the ICMA survey and CAFRs.</p>
<p>After linking the data from various sources and removing non-usable responses in the ICMA survey, some 1100 city governments are left in the final sample. An analysis of the distribution of responding municipal governments vis-à-vis the distribution of all municipal governments in the U.S. by Census Divisions (there are nine Census Divisions) suggests that the sample is fairly representative with the exception of Divisions 2 (which is underrepresented in the sample) and 9 (which is overrepresented).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0275074012451051">9</xref></sup> Thus, care must be taken when claiming generalizability of the findings. In a subsequent section, more details are provided on how the estimation issues associated with missing cases are addressed.</p>

<sec id="section8-0275074012451051">
<title>Outcome and Main Independent Variables</title>
<p>Perception-based and objective measures of budget shortfalls are used based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0275074012451051">Schick’s (1980</xref>, p. 114) argument that conditions of scarcity “are defined as much by the aspirations and perspectives of budget makers as by the objective condition of the budget.” The first measure is based on the ICMA survey question, “How does the anticipated shortfall (in 2010) compare to cuts made in the FY2009 budget?” Responses ranged from “Less,” “Same” or “Greater.” The second measure is the actual budget deficits in 2009 and 2010 as reported in cities’ CAFRs, specifically the general fund deficit as a percentage of general fund expenditures.</p>
<p>Responses to yes-no questions in the ICMA survey were used to measure the main independent variable which is strategic planning. The first survey item asks, “Does your local government have a strategic and/or long-range plan?” A follow up question is “If your local government has a strategic and/or long-range plan, have you revised it since the recession was recognized in December 2007?” Respondents also indicated whether (a) internal stakeholders (elected officials, chief appointed official/manager, or local government staff) participated in planning; (b) external stakeholders participated (including private economic development foundation, citizen advisory board/commission, representatives from public schools, colleges, universities, citizens and residents, Chamber of Commerce, and other private business representatives); (c) performance information was used in planning; (d) the plan was linked to the budget process; and (e) the plan was linked to operations.</p>
<p>Two strategic planning indices were constructed using responses to the ICMA survey questions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0275074012451051">10</xref></sup> The first planning index (Cronbach’s alpha = .85.) ranges from 0 to 6 with 0 indicating that cities did not have a plan, or had plans but did not revise them, while the highest score means that cities updated their plans as a consequence of the economic recession in 2007, and undertook a) to e). The second planning index (Cronbach’s alpha = .83.) also ranges from 0 to 6 with 0 indicating that cities did not have a plan, while the highest score means that cities had a plan but did not revise them, and undertook a) to e).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0275074012451051">11</xref></sup> Both indices measure the comprehensiveness of the planning process. However, the two measures distinguish between cities that revised their strategic plans in response to the recession, and those that did not. This is a crucial distinction because it is highly unlikely that city officials could have accurately predicted the timing, extent and severity of the Great Recession.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0275074012451051">12</xref></sup> If the plans were developed before the recession hit, it is a stretch to argue that those plans contained strategies that would have enabled a city to adapt to a future, unforeseen recession.</p>

<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>City government budget deficits are influenced by a number of factors including external environmental variables, expenditure-related variables, city wealth and overall revenue structure, cash reserves, and the quality of the local administrative system. Among environmental factors, a bigger population may exacerbate a fiscal crisis given increased demand for government services. The concentration of a more dependent population in central cities, and the resulting increased demand for social support programs can also be a big strain on government finances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0275074012451051">Ladd &amp; Yinger, 1989</xref>). Declining population was also one of the earliest used indicators of a deteriorating socioeconomic condition in cities, and may indicate a declining tax base. Another measure of economic decline included in the model is the respondents’ perception of the severity of the local effects of the national economic recession.</p>
<p>How a city government copes with fiscal crises also depends on its size, which in turn, influenced by interest groups within and outside the local public sector. Budget-maximizing behavior attributed to public sector employees is an oft-cited concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0275074012451051">Niskanen, 1975</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0275074012451051">Schneider (1989)</xref> points to the increase in expenditures and the number of services provided by municipal governments as a reflection of budget-maximization in local governments. Research also has found that ethnic fragmentation can intensify societal group competition for particularistic goods, driving up overall local spending and increasing budget deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0275074012451051">Alesina, Baquir, &amp; Easterley 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Others point to a government’s revenue structure, specifically dependence on revenue sources more susceptible to fluctuations in the business cycle such as the sales tax compared to more stable sources such as the property tax (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0275074012451051">Hoene &amp; Pagano, 2009</xref>). Additionally, significant changes in intergovernmental revenue may have far-reaching consequences for the fiscal health of local governments. Changes in total tax and intergovernmental revenues are also included in the model. A windfall of revenues in the past may enable cities to minimize the effects of the current recession. Alternatively, cities could have used windfall revenues to fund new programs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0275074012451051">Schick, 1980</xref>) creating expenditure commitments that could no longer be sustained when the crisis worsened. Note that because deficits depend on revenues and expenditures, all revenue and expenditure control variables are constructed using 2002 and 2007 data, while the budget deficit data are for 2009 and 2010. The time lag should address any concern about endogeneity. Finally, median household income is used to measure the jurisdiction’s wealth and potential revenue base.</p>
<p>It is also important to control for the effects of cash reserves or fund balances. Local governments build reserves to manage cash flow and cover unexpected operational deficits. The models include unreserved fund balance which is the “portion of the total fund balance that is not restricted for future payments to satisfy outstanding or future liabilities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0275074012451051">Hendrick, 2006</xref>, p. 17). Beginning-of-the-year balances are used to avoid endogeneity.</p>
<p>City budget deficits can be affected by the quality of the general management system. To isolate the effects of strategic planning, the model controls for the quality of the local bureaucracy using council-manager form of municipal government as a proxy for professional government. However, studies have found that mayor-council city governments have become more professionalized and efficient by adopting many features of council-manager cities such as the appointment of a chief administrative officer or CAO (Frederickson, Johnson, &amp; Wood, 2004). This research uses other proxies for professionalization including dummies indicating presence of succession plans, provision of training and enforcement of a code of ethics, and a city manager/ CAO empowerment index which measures the extent of responsibility of these appointed officials over budget preparation, policy development and implementation, and appointment and supervision of key management personnel.</p>

<title>Estimation Issues: Endogeneity and Selection Bias</title>
<p>The two potential estimation issues are endogeneity and selection bias. The strategic planning indices are likely to be endogenous given findings in some studies that a stronger fiscal condition is associated with the implementation of strategic planning (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0275074012451051">Berry, 1994</xref>). For the perceived deficit severity model, endogeneity is not caused by simultaneous causation because the dependent variable is for 2010 while the strategic planning variable was for 2009 (the following year’s anticipated budget shortfall could not possibly have influenced the adoption and implementation of strategic planning in previous years). Rather, endogeneity is caused by an omitted variable. The issue is that the error terms in the perceived deficit severity model will be correlated with strategic planning assuming that both variables are dependent on past fiscal condition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0275074012451051">16</xref></sup> The easiest way to address the problem is to control for the previous years’ fiscal health. Since the ICMA survey does not have this information, financial data from the Census of Governments are used to construct a measure of past fiscal condition, specifically, the change in operating expenditures as a percentage of own-source revenues from 2002 to 2007.</p>
<p>When the outcome variable is the actual budget shortfall, there is a stronger possibility of simultaneous causation since the deficit data cover 2009 and 2010. Two-stage least squares regression (2SLS) is used to address this issue. In the first stage, the strategic planning index becomes the dependent variable, while the controls in the original deficit model are used as the independent variables. The predicted values of the strategic planning index from stage one are then used as instruments in stage two to isolate the exogenous effects of planning on actual deficits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0275074012451051">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another estimation issue is that nonreporting by some cities in the sample of their budget deficits may lead to selection bias. Almost a fourth of the cities did not report the severity of their 2010 deficits in the ICMA survey, while almost half of the cities in the sample did not provide their CAFRs (either through their websites or by responding to emailed requests). Differences in some unmeasured characteristics between reporters and nonreporters may bias the result. For example, it is plausible that cities that responded to the deficit question in the ICMA survey were those that were disproportionately affected by the Great Recession and reported higher deficits. The overconcentration of this type of city in this sample may result in a nonsignificant finding for strategic planning.</p>
<p>The Heckman two-step regression analysis or Heckit addresses the possible selection bias. In step one of the analysis or the selection equation, the probability that respondents will answer the fiscal deficit question in the ICMA survey (or provide their CAFRs) is estimated with probit regression. The dependent variable in the selection equation is therefore a dichotomous measure coded “1” for cities that reported their deficits (or provide their CAFRs), and “0” if not. The first step calculates the inverse Mills ratio for each observation. In the second step or the outcome equation, ordinary least squares regression or OLS is used to estimate deficit levels using only the subsample of cities that responded to the fiscal deficit question (or that provided their CAFRs), with the inverse Mills ratio used as an auxiliary regressor to control for the selection process (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0275074012451051">Wooldridge, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Because one of the dependent variables—perceived deficit severity—is ordinal, OLS cannot be used in step two of the Heckit regression. In this case, Heckit is modified to run the outcome equation using ordered logistic regression. When the dependent variable is the actual deficit, OLS will suffice since the variable is continuous.</p>
<p>The Heckit procedure requires that the control variables used in the selection equation are also used in the outcome equation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0275074012451051">Wooldridge, 2009</xref>). However, to avoid collinearity between the inverse Mills ratio and other regressors in the outcome model, the exclusion restriction requires that additional controls be included in step one that are not in step two of the system of equations. The simplest way to identify additional controls is to treat the selection equations as models predicting government fiscal transparency. Indeed, the decision to provide financial information in surveys or disseminate official financial reports is partially a reflection of how transparent a municipal government is.</p>
<p>Based on information available in the dataset, the additional controls for the selection stage include the percentage of population 18 and above with college education, percentage employed in professional and management positions, nonmetropolitan (nonurban) location of cities, and respondents’ educational attainment. Respondents who have advanced degrees are more likely to have been exposed to professional financial management norms including transparency, and report information about the fiscal performance of their governments. Additionally, cities in urban areas have more sophisticated administrative systems with the capacity to provide timely financial information. It is also possible that local residents who are highly educated or in professional or management positions will demand greater fiscal transparency through timely publication of audited financial reports.</p>

<title>Descriptive Statistics</title>
<p>Strategic planning seems to be a prevalent practice among municipal governments. The ICMA survey showed that 63% (<italic>n</italic> = 1,778) of cities had a strategic or long range plan, of which 74% reported that plans were linked to budgets, while 72% reported that plans guided operations. Among cities with strategic plans, 47% reported revising their plans in response to the 2007 economic recession, 48% allowed internal stakeholders such as elected officials and employees to participate in planning, while 23% involved external stakeholders such as private businesses, the local chamber of commerce, and organized and unorganized citizens.</p>
<p>Majority of the ICMA survey respondents reported that the local fiscal crisis took a turn for the worse in 2010. Approximately 54% reported that their 2010 estimated deficits were greater than 2009 figures, 36% reported that deficits were the same, while only 10% reported lower shortfalls (<italic>n</italic> = 1,104). Based on the CAFRs, the average actual general fund deficit in 2009 was 4.92%, increasing slightly to 5.07% in 2010 (n = 549).</p>

<title>Models Correcting for Endogeneity</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0275074012451051">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0275074012451051">3</xref> show the results for the base models and 2SLS. Model 1 is estimated with ordered logistic regression since the dependent variable—perceived deficit severity—is ordinal. The model also includes state dummies (there are no year dummies since the data is cross-sectional).The results show that when controlling for a measure of past fiscal condition to address endogeneity caused by an omitted variable, the strategic planning indices (with or without revision) have no statistically significant effects on perceived severity of the deficit.</p>
<p>Model 2 uses the same controls in model 1, but with actual deficits in 2009 and 2010 as the dependent variable, and is run using OLS. Because the actual deficit is for two years, model 2 includes a year dummy for 2009 to control for possible contemporaneous correlation among error terms. The results show that both strategic planning variables do not have any systematic effects on actual deficits.</p>
<p>The direction of the effect of most control variables conform to expectations, but the significance level is different across all models, which is understandable given that the outcome variables, as well as the sample sizes, are different. For example, ethnic fragmentation and perception of the seriousness of the 2007 economic crisis are positively correlated with perceived deficit severity, but shows statistically insignificant effects on actual shortfalls.</p>
<p>As expected, higher median household income and dependence on property tax revenues lead to lower actual deficits. Property taxes remain the most stable source of revenues for local governments especially during economic downturns. Although the recession affected housing markets, there is a significant lag time before the effects of a national economic recession register in the local treasury. This is because adjustments in real property assessments to reflect changes in housing values take time (which some calculate to be between 18 and 24 months) given various administrative and legal requirements (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0275074012451051">Hoene &amp; Pagano, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A history of declining fiscal condition (higher expenditure-to-revenue ratio) has no effect on perceived deficit severity but is positively correlated with actual shortfalls. Higher fund balance leads to lower actual deficits but is not significantly correlated with perceived deficits. Both results are consistent with the argument in the literature that subjective or perception-based and objective or actual measures of fiscal performance do not directly correlate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0275074012451051">Maher &amp; Deller, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Variables with consistent results across models include the service index and the dummy for succession plans. Cities offering more services report higher actual and perceived deficits, while the opposite is true for cities with more professional administrative system as indicated by the presence of a succession plan. An unexpected result is that for the variable central city which is associated with lower actual budget deficits. Central cities may have a deeper revenue base compared to suburban municipalities, enabling them to ride through the recession. The estimates for other variables fail to reach conventional levels of statistical significance.</p>
<p>Model 2 is reestimated with 2SLS regression because of possible simultaneous causation. Because 2SLS is applicable when there is only one endogenous variable, the two strategic planning indices are not included in the same equation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0275074012451051">18</xref></sup> The results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0275074012451051">Table 3</xref>. Model 3 includes the planning-with-revision index. The first stage shows that noncentral cities, those with bigger and heterogeneous population, higher per capita expenditures, dependent on own-source revenues (specifically property and sales tax revenues), less-reliant on intergovernmental revenues, experienced growth in tax revenues in the past years, lower fund balance, and have an empowered city manager or CAO and code of ethics, followed a comprehensive planning process. In the second stage, the coefficient of the planning-with-revision index remains insignificant, even when addressing simultaneous causation.</p>
<p>Model 4 shows the results for the no-revision-planning index. The first stage shows that cities with unrevised plans but follow a comprehensive planning process include central cities, those with growing population, higher income, have not been affected severely by the 2007 crisis, offer more services, less dependent on property tax revenues, have experienced a decline in tax revenues in the past, have a succession plan and council-manager form of government. The second stage indicates that the effect of the no-revision-planning index on actual deficits is largely random.</p>

<title>Models Correcting for Selection Bias</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0275074012451051">Table 4</xref> presents the results for the Heckit regressions. Model 5—the perceived deficit model—is estimated using modified Heckit in which the outcome equation is run with ordered logistic regression. The selection equation shows that cities with a higher probability of reporting perceived seriousness of deficits in the ICMA survey include those with revised plans and followed a comprehensive planning process, have experienced a decline in intergovernmental revenue from 2002 to 2007, severely affected by the 2007 economic recession, and have highly educated CAO or city manager. The parameter Lambda is also statistically significant which means that selection bias is a serious concern. The outcome equation shows that when controlling for the selection process, the planning-with-revision index exerts a negative and statistically significant effect (but only weakly so at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) on perceived deficit severity. On the other hand, the coefficient of the no-revision-planning index remains insignificant.</p>
<p>Model 6 is estimated with traditional Heckit because the outcome variable—actual deficits—is continuous. Cities that have a higher probability of publishing their CAFRs online or responding to emailed requests for financial documents include suburban cities, with a bigger population, offer more services, higher expenditures per capita, dependent on the sales tax, have experienced a decline in intergovernmental revenue, lower fund balance, more empowered and highly educated city manager or CAO, no succession plan, located in urban areas, and with a greater proportion of the population with a college degree or employed in professional or managerial occupations. Lambda is also significant. Finally, the outcome equation shows that the coefficients for both strategic planning indices fail to reach conventional levels of statistical significance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Strategic planning is not without its share of critics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0275074012451051">Mintzberg (1994)</xref> cautions against relying on strategic planning to drive organizational problem solving, pointing out that it can breed conformity rather than creativity and strategic thinking, and may in fact create inflexible plans. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0275074012451051">Miller, Rabin, and Hildreth (1987)</xref> adds that planning may be ineffective given government financial managers’ propensity to favor less risky, politically safe, and conservative choices, which run counter to the values and assumptions underpinning rational planning that favor substantive rather than incremental changes.</p>
<p>In contrast, others point to the beneficial impacts of strategic planning on organizational performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074012451051">Bryson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074012451051">Hendrick, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074012451051">Poster &amp; Streib, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0275074012451051">Boyne, 2001</xref>). Some claim that planning can help governments anticipate and adjust to major economic changes and other potentially disruptive social developments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0275074012451051">Kissler et al., 1998</xref>). In terms of the possible contributions of strategic planning to minimizing city budget deficits during an economic recession, the results of this research are inconclusive.</p>
<p>Correcting for endogeneity and selection bias, strategic planning is associated with the perception that budget deficits are declining. However, this is true only for cities which updated their plans in response to the 2007 economic recession. This result is not surprising—no city could have predicted the Great Recession, and cities that developed strategic plans before the recession hit could not have possibly planned for an unforeseen crisis.</p>
<p>The results also show that planning has no systematic effect on actual deficits. Linking the results to research on organizational decision making, it is possible that either political consideration overwhelms the need to make strategic choices, or that strategic planning process itself is purely ceremonial to begin with. Symbolic adoption can be ruled out as an explanation for the finding, given that managers from cities with more comprehensive strategic planning seem to be more confident about the capacity of their governments to weather the effects of the Great Recession. Managers in organizations that routinely adopt symbolic reforms are unlikely to be that optimistic about the future performance of their organizations.</p>
<p>The logical conclusion seems to be that strategic planning gives a confidence boost to city managers and chief administrative officers as reflected in their positive assessment of the near-term fiscal performance of their city governments. It is possible that in cities which recognized the 2007 financial crisis and updated their plans, decision-makers were immediately able to agree on strategies to minimize the expected fallouts from the recession, before the crisis increased in severity. Managers and workers had united behind a set of goals and strategies, enabling them to develop a sense of purpose and belief that they could exert a degree a control over the future of their organization (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0275074012451051">Behn, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>That strategic planning has led to the adoption of strategies which allowed city governments to introduce some adjustments to their revenue and expenditure policies, or pilot-test innovative service delivery arrangements to try to minimize the effects of the recession, is not far-fetched; but it is also plausible that such reforms were simply not enough to close actual budget deficits in such a severe economic recession. The politics of fiscal retrenchment could have hindered the development and implementation of a more comprehensive package of fiscal and organizational reforms. In other words, cities that engaged in strategic planning were neither trapped in decrementalism, nor were they blazing the path toward a fundamental rethinking of their mission and purpose and a radical redesign of how they do their business. City governments navigated the crisis by introducing major reforms where they could, and settling for change at the margins when they must. Admittedly, more research is needed to explore these possibilities.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Through careful analysis, this research showed that managers from cities with comprehensive strategic planning are more confident of the fiscal outlooks of their governments amidst a generally worsening local fiscal climate. While it is easy to dismiss this finding, it is important to revisit studies that have emphasized the central role of city officials’ subjective assessment of their governments’ fiscal health in the process of fiscal retrenchment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0275074012451051">Schick, 1980</xref>; Pammer, 1990). Specifically, a positive view of the organization’s future may help local governments better adjust to fiscal crises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0275074012451051">Behn, 1980</xref>). Periods of accelerated revenue decline are often associated with overall decline in organizational morale, disorganization, and decision paralysis (Levine, Rubin &amp; Wolohojian 1981; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0275074012451051">Levine, 1985</xref>). Improving organizational confidence is crucial because it creates a sense of control, and concomitantly, the capacity to act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0275074012451051">Behn, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>An important question remains: What strategies did cities actually adopt and implement to try to minimize the effects of the Great Recession on the local treasury? Clearly, the analysis presented in this research using a large sample of cities needs to be complemented with in-depth comparative case studies to understand the specific strategies implemented by municipal governments. Such approach will also help shed light on how the internal and external political dynamics in city governments influence attempts to use rational planning processes in periods of fiscal decline.</p>
<p>This research represents a first step, an initial contribution to an emerging research agenda in public administration and management that attempts to provide evidence-based answers to the “so what” question: So what if cities undertake strategic planning, or implement other good government reforms? Do we really end up with more effective local governments capable of navigating fiscal crises and responding to the needs of citizens that they serve?</p>

<p>A good example of how planning can be linked to budgeting is the capital improvement process. Through long-term capital planning, local governments can prioritize capital projects based on an assessment of current and future needs, identify funding requirements, and weigh the benefits and disadvantages of different financing options, including bonds. This rational process of matching needs with resources ensures that local governments do not overstretch their current and future fiscal capacity to support the development of new public facilities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0275074012451051">Jimenez, 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>In the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074012451051">Meyer and Rowan (1977</xref>, p. 349), organizations adopt “a formal structure that adheres to the prescriptions of myths in the institutional environment.” Public organizations, in particular, are especially susceptible to institutional pressures as they approximate “institutionalized organizations” whose outputs and outcomes are much harder to measure compared to production-oriented organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074012451051">Meyer &amp; Rowan, 1977</xref>).</p>

<p>Isomorphic organizational changes can occur through coercive, mimetic, and normative processes. The spread of strategic planning practices among local governments through educational training of city managers and membership in professional organizations is a normative isomorphic process. It also likely that local governments are just copying from “model” organizations—a process that approximates mimetic isomorphism. Coercive processes, on other hand, involve imposition of an organizational change by an external body (e.g. state governments prescribing financial management practices to their local governments) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074012451051">DiMaggio and Powell, 1983</xref>)</p>

<p>This can occur because the underlying assumptions of the adopted good government reform may be inconsistent with dominant organizational values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074012451051">Meyer &amp; Rowan, 1977</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0275074012451051">Moynihan (2008)</xref> observed, at least at the state level, that elected officials strongly supported laws requiring strategic planning and performance measurement in response to voters’ demand for good government reforms, but often refuse to relax traditional managerial controls, constricting agency managers’ ability to use the strategic planning process and performance information to introduce major organizational and budgetary changes. By limiting managerial authority, political superiors are merely responding to a dominant value in public organizations—that of preserving the hierarchy. This tradition dictates that the line of democratic control must always be observed by separating politics from administration, more specifically, by limiting the ability of unelected public administrators to make changes that may redefine the fundamental mission and structure of public agencies. Deprived of managerial and policy discretion, public administrators respond with ceremonial implementation of good government reforms.</p>

<p>The results for Divisions 2 and 9 can be explained by the fact that the ICMA survey targeted chief administrative officers or CAOs in council-mayor forms and city managers in council-manager government forms. Municipalities in Division 2 (which include New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) are mostly council-mayor forms, but not all of them necessarily have CAOs (which explains underrepresentation in the sample of cities from this area).

<p>Instrumental variable or IV regression is used when there are two or more endogenous variables. IV regression requires excluded instruments or variables that are not found in the original system of equations. Additionally, there should be at least as many excluded instruments as there are endogenous variables to produce consistent estimators of the regression parameters (this is known as the order condition for identification of the structural equation). To be valid, these instruments should be uncorrelated with the error process, but correlated with the endogenous variables. Unfortunately, it is not very easy to find multiple excluded instruments that satisfy these conditions.</p>
