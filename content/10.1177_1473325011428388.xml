<p>Commencing from this issue, <italic>Qualitative Social Work</italic> moves from four to six issues each year. For some time we have managed the backlog of accepted articles. Publication online ahead of print has helped, as has a temporary move to more pages per issue. Editorial stringency on word limits, and – less positively – holding back on planned innovations in journal features also have been part of our response. But the shift to six issues should resolve all these consequences of the journal’s expansion. The journal is also likely to introduce developments in the editorial team in the early months of 2012. The first of these has been the appointment, with this issue, of Dr Mark Hardy as European Review Editor for the journal.</p>
<p>Jenni-Mari Räsänen focuses on emergency social workers’ interview accounts regarding case recording. This brings together several important areas of practice – accounts of case records, technology and (less often recognized) the work of social workers undertaking emergency cover. This area is important, as she notes, because it involves the retrieval and transferring of information and responsibilities between organizations and practitioners. Her focus is on how social workers describe what kind of case records they should produce and what are the criteria of what she describes as the norm-talk of good case recording. Her article draws on a rewarding strand of social work research in the last decade or so, and one that illustrates the gains of a sociologically informed practice. Central to her analysis is the important question of how social workers distinguish what they see as the facts of the case from other kinds of talk.</p>
<p>A central editorial agenda for this journal is to provide a forum for research that exemplifies how qualitative methods contribute to welfare reform. Emily Thaden and Jill Robinson explore varying visions of well-being among staff working in a welfare organization within the USA welfare benefits system – Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). They utilize a narrative approach arguing for how such a research stance may surface ‘counter stories’ to dominant narratives. Their focus is on ‘marginalized narratives that hold possibility for a liberatory shift in organizational culture.’ Dominant narratives – e.g. that the welfare program leads to self sufficiency or that compliance with the program is the client’s choice – were shadowed by alternative and contrary narratives.</p>
<p>Kelly Jackson’s article on ‘Living the multiracial experience’, like Thaden and Robinson, is not written with an explicit ear open for echoes, mirror images or contradictions in other countries. But in Jackson’s case the judicious transfer of understanding is more straightforward, in that the challenge for social workers to critically examine and understand the complexity of multiracial identity is less contingent on national policy contexts. Her analysis elicited five themes of a shared multiracial identity experience, including shifting racial/ethnic expressions; racial/ethnic ambiguity; racial resistance; feeling like an outsider; and seeking community.</p>
<p>‘I like people I get to know; it is best not to set your hopes too high since you will probably be disappointed; there is so much to be done and so little time to do it in; I have a tendency to make mountains out of molehills.’ So go typical items on quantitative scale measures of optimism and pessimism. By way of comparison, and from a study of women on parole and probation who were undertaking the transition from correctional facilities to the community, Keri Flesaker and Denise Larsen investigated how reintegration counsellors fostered and maintained hope in their work, including their personal descriptions of hope. In accounting for ways in which people sought to maintain a hope-seeking orientation, they unpack the complexities in a thematic way through understandings of hope, views of life is a journey, hope maintained through life perspective, hope maintained by ‘down-to-earth’ expectations, and finding hope to be a learnable skill.</p>
<p>In the second article from Canada, Lea Tufford and Peter Newman address the perennial challenge of how qualitative researchers handle – or might better handle – the inevitable transmission of assumptions, values, interests, emotions and theories. They take the idea of bracketing – expressed at its simplest, the process by which qualitative researchers seek to put aside preconceptions so that the true experiences of respondents are reflected in the analysis and reporting of research. Picking up a complaint that has been around in the literature for some years, they reflect on how this process has become divorced from its phenomenological roots, and how despite a broad shared sense of the meaning of the term there remains a ‘lack of consensus over what is to be held in abeyance.’ They also signal the uncertainty of when bracketing ought to occur, who is doing it (the researcher? The participant?), and how one brackets. They bring their argument together in a helpful conceptual framework, and talk through research practice in the light thereof. In all a valuable reflection that will be equally of use in whatever field of qualitative inquiry.</p>
<p>Finally, and with an accompanying declaration of interest on the part of several of the editorial team, Mark Hardy provides an extensive review essay on the <italic>Sage Handbook of Social Work Research</italic> – a project that claims to be the first attempt to map social work research in its discipline-like qualities.</p>
