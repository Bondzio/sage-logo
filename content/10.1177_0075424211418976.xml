<abstract>
<p>This investigation is part of the authors’ larger research project on so-called minor declarative complementizers in the history of English, that is, connectives recruited mostly in the adverbial domain that are occasionally used in complementation. The present study sheds light on the complementizer use of the three originally comparative links <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> in Present-Day English complement structures. In the theoretical part of the article, the authors argue for the complement analysis of certain clauses depending on <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> (e.g., <italic>It seemed as if the strange little man had never been there</italic>). The empirical part of the study analyzes data drawn from the Brown family of corpora (LOB, Brown, FLOB, and Frown), the Diachronic Corpus of Present-day Spoken English (DCPSE), and the Toronto English Archive (TEA), which are representative of both written and spoken language at different time periods (1960s, 1990s, and early 2000s) and in different varieties of English (British English, American English, and Canadian English). Taking the corpus data as a starting point, and with the aim of revealing what ongoing change is observable in the contemporary language, the authors attend to the following issues: (a) the predicates and construction types associated with these minor links, (b) the factors determining the variation between the three comparative complementizers, and (c) the variation between <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> and the default declarative complementizer <italic>that</italic>.</p>

<p>The variation between the two major links introducing finite declarative complement clauses, <italic>that</italic> and zero, has received considerable attention in the literature on complementation, both for Present-Day English (PDE) and for earlier stages of the language (see, among others, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0075424211418976">Elsness 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0075424211418976">1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0075424211418976">Warner 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0075424211418976">Fanego 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0075424211418976">Rissanen 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0075424211418976">Finegan &amp; Biber 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0075424211418976">López-Couso 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0075424211418976">Tagliamonte &amp; Smith 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0075424211418976">Kaltenböck 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0075424211418976">Kearns 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0075424211418976">Torres Cacoullos &amp; Walker 2008</xref>). However, connectives normally associated with other types of subordinate clauses but that are occasionally used in complementation structures (e.g., <italic>as if</italic>) have so far not received systematic investigation. The research reported in this article is part of a larger project that aims to study the origin, development, and current use of these minor declarative complementizers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0075424211418976">López-Couso 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0075424211418976">López-Couso &amp; Méndez-Naya 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0075424211418976">2001</xref>, forthcoming). In particular, the present article is concerned with the complementizer use in PDE of the three originally comparative subordinators <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> in sequences of the type <italic>It seems as if/as though/like it’s going to rain</italic> or <italic>He looks as if he were older</italic>.</p>
<p>The article has a theoretical and a data-based component. In the theoretical part we first address the use of <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> in adverbial subordination (e.g., <italic>He talks as if he had a potato in his mouth</italic>) and then provide a number of criteria that favor the complement analysis for the subclause in structures such as <italic>It looks as if it’s going to rain</italic>, in which the clause introduced by <italic>as if</italic> conveys a semantic argument of a propositional attitude predicate. In the empirical part, which is based on data from a range of written and spoken corpora representative of different varieties of contemporary English, we examine (a) the predicates and construction-types associated with <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> in complementation; (b) the variation between these three minor links, paying attention to different types of structural, textual, and dialectal factors that may determine their choice; and (c) the variation between these connectives originating in the comparative domain and the default declarative complementizer <italic>that</italic>. This corpus analysis aims to reveal what ongoing change is observable in the contemporary language. Finally, the article closes with a summary of our main findings.</p>
<p>The data for the present study have been drawn from the Brown family of corpora (LOB, Brown, FLOB, and Frown; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0075424211418976">Hofland et al. 1999</xref>), the Diachronic Corpus of Present-day Spoken English (DCPSE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0075424211418976">Aarts &amp; Wallis 2006</xref>), and the Toronto English Archive (TEA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0075424211418976">Tagliamonte 2003–6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0075424211418976">2006</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>As If, As Though</italic>, and <italic>Like</italic> in Adverbial and Complementation Constructions</title>
<p>In PDE the subordinators <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> are normally associated with adverbial clauses of Comparison,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0075424211418976">1</xref></sup> as in examples (1)–(3) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0075424211418976">Quirk et al. 1985</xref>:1110-1111; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0075424211418976">Biber et al. 1999</xref>:844; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0075424211418976">Huddleston &amp; Pullum 2002</xref>:1151-1154, 1158). In addition, <italic>like</italic> can also introduce adverbial clauses of Similarity, as in (4).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0075424211418976">2</xref></sup></p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0075424211418976">Kortmann’s (1997)</xref> typological study of adverbial subordinators in European languages, Comparison and Similarity are identified as two of the thirty-two interclausal relations into which the adverbial semantic space can be divided. More specifically, they belong to the group of Modal relations, which also includes Manner, Comment/Accord, Instrument/Means, and Proportion, that is, those relations associated with the “tightly interconnected network of manner relations in the widest sense” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0075424211418976">Kortmann 1997</xref>:84).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0075424211418976">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The semantic affinity between Comparison and Similarity, and between these two relations and other members of the Modal domain, is evident. Example (1) above illustrates how the proposition in adverbial clauses of this kind answers ‘how’ questions (‘how does he talk?’). Moreover, Comparison involves Similarity, the similarity relation expressed by the adverbial clause being typically hypothetical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0075424211418976">Kortmann 1997</xref>:195): he talks as if he has a potato in his mouth, but does not have one. The close connection between Comparison and Similarity would explain why some subordinators, as is the case of <italic>like</italic> (and <italic>as</italic>), can signal both semantic relations.</p>
<p>Comparison and Similarity qualify as cognitively complex relations that stand at the extended core of adverbial relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0075424211418976">Kortmann 1997</xref>:144, 158). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0075424211418976">Kortmann’s (1997</xref>:159) view, the cognitive complexity of the conceptual space of Comparison may go a long way toward explaining why only a few languages make use of monomorphemic subordinators for this semantic domain. English mostly uses “complex subordinators combining an element of Similarity (<italic>as</italic>) with an element indicating hypotheticality (<italic>if, though</italic>), yielding <italic>as if</italic> and <italic>as though</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0075424211418976">Kortmann 1997</xref>:318), although monomorphemic connectives (such as <italic>like</italic>) are also found.</p>
<p>In addition to the basic adverbial use of <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> just described, these subordinators can occasionally be found in complementation structures introducing finite declarative clauses, such as those in (5)–(7). Structures of this kind are the concern of the present investigation.</p>
<list id="list2-0075424211418976" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(5) . . . and as time passed it seemed <italic>as if the strange little man had never been there</italic> (Brown PL23)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(6) It seemed <italic>as though she were always auditioning</italic>. (Brown F09)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(7) ‘cause some people seem <italic>like they’re older</italic> . . . (TEA sneville)</p></list-item></list>
<p>Although at first glance the <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> clauses in these examples may have the appearance of adverbial clauses of Comparison, similar to those in (1)–(3) above, they nevertheless fulfill a number of structural and semantic criteria that show that the complement analysis for the clauses at issue is preferable.</p>
<p>The most relevant of these criteria is the fact that, in contrast to the adverbial clauses in (1)–(4) above, the italicized clauses in (5)–(7) convey the argument of a semantic predicate (<italic>seem</italic>). The occurrence of these clauses therefore requires the presence of a predicate of a specific class “that licenses them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0075424211418976">Huddleston &amp; Pullum 2002</xref>:219). When occurring with the appropriate predicates, the <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> clauses are obligatory constituents in clause structure and cannot be omitted without affecting the grammaticality of the sequence, as shown in (5a). They thus show a higher degree of integration into the matrix than adverbial clauses, which can easily be left out, as illustrated in example (2a).</p>
<list id="list3-0075424211418976" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(5a) *and as time passed it seemed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(2a) The bird was careening from side to side.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The analysis of <italic>as if</italic>/<italic>as though</italic>/<italic>like</italic> clauses as complements thus heavily hinges on the occurrence of a particular licensing predicate and on whether the argument structure of this complement-taking predicate is already saturated or not. If the argument structure of the predicate is satisfied by another element in the clause, then the adverbial reading is triggered (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0075424211418976">Bender &amp; Flickinger 1999</xref>:13). This is what happens in example (8a), where the predicate <italic>look</italic> co-occurs with both an Adjective Phrase in predicative complement function, <italic>shrivel’d and old</italic>, and a comparative clause introduced by <italic>as though</italic>. Notice, however, that if <italic>shrivel’d and old</italic> is omitted, as in (8b), the argument structure of the predicate <italic>look</italic> would be completed by the <italic>as though</italic> clause, which would no longer qualify as an adverbial clause in the resulting sequence, but rather as a complement according to the criterion of obligatoriness.</p>
<list id="list4-0075424211418976" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(8a) Pregnant women addicted to this spirit often gave birth to weak, sickly children who looked “shrivel’d and old as though they had numbered many years.” (FLOB G16)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(8b) Pregnant women addicted to this spirit often gave birth to weak, sickly children who looked as though they had numbered many years.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Further support for the complement analysis of the clauses at issue comes from the fact that they can be replaced by unambiguous declarative complement clauses, either finite or non-finite. Thus, for example, the <italic>that</italic> clause in (5b) can substitute for the <italic>as if</italic> clause in our earlier instance (5), “without any perceptible change of meaning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0075424211418976">Huddleston &amp; Pullum 2002</xref>:962; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0075424211418976">Quirk et al. 1985</xref>:1175 note a, 1184 note b). Similarly, the infinitival construction in (7a) is an alternative for the <italic>as if</italic> clause in example (7). In other words, the clauses in (5)–(7) are semantically equivalent to declarative complements.</p>
<list id="list5-0075424211418976" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(5b) and as time passed it seemed that the strange little man had never been there.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(7a) ’cause some people seem to be older.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Additional evidence in this connection is found in examples like (9), where the <italic>as if</italic> clause, complement to the predicate <italic>look</italic>, is resumed by a <italic>that</italic> clause after the insertion of intervening material.</p>
<list id="list6-0075424211418976" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(9) “I tell you I can’t believe it. It’s—it’s not right. It looks as though you’ve, well, that you’ve forgotten Dad.” (FLOB N25)</p></list-item></list>
<p>Coordination with prototypical complements, either phrasal or clausal, may also be taken as indicative of the complement status of the clauses under analysis. Examples (10) and (11) show two clausal complements linked by means of coordination, an <italic>as if</italic> clause and a <italic>that</italic> clause in the former, and a <italic>like</italic> clause and a <italic>that</italic> clause in the latter.</p>
<list id="list7-0075424211418976" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(10) Now, driving the horse and sulky borrowed from Mynheer Schuyler, he felt as if every bone was topped by burning oil and that every muscle was ready to dissolve into jelly and leave his big body helpless and unable to move. (Brown K14)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(11) Do you feel like your neighbors care about you or that you have any sense of community that way? (TEA dbarrett)</p></list-item></list>
<p>In examples (12) and (13), coordination is established between an Adjective Phrase (<italic>nervous</italic> and <italic>grave</italic>, respectively) and an <italic>as if</italic> clause, both of them in predicative complement function. Struck through words in example (12) appear that way in the corpus.</p>
<list id="list8-0075424211418976" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(12) I think you’re doing fine. You’re not . . . seeming nervous or as if you need encouragement to me. Do you think you need encouragement? (DCPSE: DI-A16)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(13) Even Perry looked grave and as if he were to blame, stricken with compunction, possibly for the first time in a century. (FLOB K10)</p></list-item></list>
<p>Another possible criterion for distinguishing between adverbial clauses and complement clauses introduced by the subordinator <italic>as if</italic> is mobility, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0075424211418976">McCawley (1988</xref>:143) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0075424211418976">Bender and Flickinger (1999)</xref>. Thus, whereas the adverbial <italic>as if</italic> clause in example (14) can be placed in sentence-initial position, the fronting of the <italic>as if</italic> clause in our earlier example (5) yields an ungrammatical construction, as shown in (5c). Notice that the preverbal position of the subclause is here ruled out because the clause is a complement of the verb <italic>seem</italic> and complements of <italic>seem</italic> can only occur in extraposition. This is one more respect in which the <italic>as if</italic> clause in (5) clearly aligns with <italic>that</italic> complements, as shown in example (5d).</p>
<list id="list9-0075424211418976" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(14) As if he suddenly felt her studying him, he turned and looked down at her. (Frown SP10)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(5c) *As if the strange little man had never been there seemed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(5d) *That the strange little man had never been there seemed.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Finally, a further criterion for complementhood has been proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0075424211418976">McCawley (1988</xref>:143), namely pronominalization. Note that the <italic>as if</italic> clause in (5) would pronominalize as (5e), in exactly the same way as its <italic>that</italic> clause counterpart in (5b).</p>
<list id="list10-0075424211418976" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(5e) It seemed so.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The complementizer use of <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> just discussed has received very little attention in reference grammars of PDE and in the literature on complementation, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0075424211418976">Bender and Flickinger (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0075424211418976">Rooryck (2000)</xref> as notable exceptions. This neglect may be attributed, at least in part, to the strong association of these links with adverbial subordination. Passing mention to <italic>as if</italic> and <italic>as though</italic> in complement structures can nevertheless be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0075424211418976">Quirk et al. (1985</xref>:1175 note a), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0075424211418976">McCawley (1988</xref>:143), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0075424211418976">Dirven (1989</xref>:134), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0075424211418976">Huddleston and Pullum (2002</xref>:962, 1151-1152), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0075424211418976">Dancygier and Sweetser (2005</xref>:229-230), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0075424211418976">Taylor and Pang (2008</xref>:130). The use of <italic>like</italic> in complementation is also recognized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0075424211418976">Huddleston and Pullum (2002</xref>:608n1, 1158)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0075424211418976">4</xref></sup> and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0075424211418976">Quirk et al. (1985</xref>:1175 note a), where it is mentioned that after verbs such as <italic>seem, appear, look, sound, feel, smell</italic>, and <italic>taste</italic>, in addition to <italic>as if</italic> and <italic>as though</italic> clauses, “one also frequently hears clauses introduced by <italic>like</italic>, but these are often regarded as nonstandard: <italic>It seems like the weather is improving</italic>.”</p>
<p>Of the two uses of <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> discussed in the present section, the adverbial use is not only the basic one, but also the earliest to be recorded in the historical data. The combinations <italic>as if</italic> and <italic>as though</italic> date back to the thirteenth century (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0075424211418976">Visser 1963–73</xref>:923-924, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0075424211418976">López-Couso &amp; Méndez-Naya, forthcoming</xref>). The conjunctional use of <italic>like</italic> is first found in the fifteenth century in clauses of Similarity (<italic>Middle English Dictionary</italic> s.v. <italic>līk</italic>(e conj.), and the comparative meaning <italic>‘as if’</italic> is an Early Modern English development (see <italic>OED</italic> s.v. <italic>like</italic> a., adv. [conj.] and n.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0075424211418976">2</xref></sup>, B.6.e). Despite its long history, though, the conjunction <italic>like</italic> remained infrequent until the Late Modern English period. It was only in the nineteenth century that it started to be noticed and rebuked by prescriptive grammarians, a stigmatization that continues to the present day.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0075424211418976">5</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0075424211418976">Quirk et al. (1985</xref>:1110; also 558, 662, 998, 1033) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0075424211418976">Kortmann (1997</xref>:371n159) characterize conjunctive <italic>like</italic> as typical of informal style and as especially common in American English. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0075424211418976">Huddleston and Pullum (2002</xref>:1158) also refer to the “quite strong tradition of prescriptive opposition”: it is alleged that <italic>like</italic> requires a Noun Phrase complement and cannot take a finite clause. Nevertheless, it is also stated in this grammar, published some twenty years later than Quirk et al.’s, that speakers who avoid the use of <italic>like</italic> as a conjunction are “very much in the minority,” both in British and especially in American English. In the former variety, this use of <italic>like</italic> is mostly restricted to informal style; in American English, though closely associated with informality, <italic>like</italic> is trickling into more formal registers.</p>
<p>The complementizer use of the comparative links under analysis develops later than their use in adverbial subordination: <italic>as though</italic> is first found in the Late Middle English period, while we have been able to trace the first instances of complementizer <italic>as if</italic> to Early Modern English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0075424211418976">López-Couso &amp; Méndez-Naya, forthcoming</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0075424211418976">Bender &amp; Flickinger 1999</xref>:12 for <italic>as if</italic>). The complementizer use of <italic>like</italic> emerges much later: the earliest examples given in the <italic>OED</italic> entry for <italic>like</italic> (s.v. <italic>like</italic> a. adv. [conj.] and n<sup>2</sup>, B.6.e) are found in Faulkner’s writings and are dated 1940. Mark Davies’s Corpus of Historical American English (COHA), however, yields examples of the complementizer <italic>like</italic> from the first half of the nineteenth century onward.</p>

<p>In our analysis of the corpus material, we have considered only finite clauses introduced by the three comparative subordinators.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0075424211418976">7</xref></sup> For <italic>as if</italic> and <italic>as though</italic>, we have included in the count all their occurrences in the seven corpora, both in their comparative use and in their complementizer function. For <italic>like</italic>, we have analyzed all the examples in the DCPSE in which <italic>like</italic> was tagged as a conjunction. By contrast, and for practical purposes, in the remaining corpora we have considered only those instances in which the subclause depends on one of the following predicates as trigger words: <italic>appear, feel, look, seem</italic>, and <italic>sound</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0075424211418976">8</xref></sup></p>

<p>As the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0075424211418976">Table 2</xref> show, both <italic>as if</italic> and <italic>as though</italic> are attested in all the corpora in both of their uses, though their frequency of occurrence in the Canadian English material is very low; notice in particular the almost negligible figures we have obtained for <italic>as though</italic> in this variety. This can be accounted for by the prevalence of the conjunction <italic>like</italic> in the Canadian data, which is shown below. Overall, in our material <italic>as if</italic> is more common than <italic>as though</italic> in both functions (except in the DCPSE-LLC where the complementizer <italic>as though</italic> is somewhat more common than the complementizer <italic>as if</italic>). The figures in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0075424211418976">Table 2</xref> also indicate that instances where <italic>as if</italic> and <italic>as though</italic> introduce clauses that could be interpreted as complements rather than as adjuncts represent a secondary or subsidiary reading in the written corpora. It is worth noting, however, that in the British spoken material the proportions are clearly reversed, the complementizer function being found in the majority of cases.</p>

<title>Syntactic Patterns and Licensing Predicates</title>
<p>In what follows, the different syntactic functions in which clauses introduced by the comparative complementizers <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> occur in the corpus material are discussed individually in order of decreasing frequency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0075424211418976">9</xref></sup> Due to the extraction method used for the <italic>like</italic> examples, the figures provided correspond only to <italic>as if</italic> and <italic>as though</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section4-0075424211418976">
<title>Subject Function</title>
<p>In our material, comparative complementizers most commonly occur in clauses realizing the function of the subject of the sentence,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0075424211418976">10</xref></sup> with a total of 271 examples. Within this function three patterns can be distinguished: (a) <italic>(It) seems</italic> + comparative complementizer + subject clause (147 exx.), (b) <italic>It is</italic> + comparative complementizer + subject clause (105 exx.), and (c) absent matrix (19 exx.).</p>
<p>The list of complement-taking predicates (CTPs) occurring in the pattern <italic>(It) seems</italic> + comparative complementizer + subject clause in the corpora with the complementizers <italic>as if</italic> and <italic>as though</italic> includes <italic>appear</italic> (1 ex.), <italic>feel</italic> (7 exx.; see <italic>OED</italic> s.v. <italic>feel</italic> v. III.16), <italic>look</italic> (68 exx.)/<italic>not look</italic> (5 exx.), <italic>seem</italic> (40 exx.)/<italic>not seem</italic> (1 ex.), and <italic>sound</italic> (25 exx.).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0075424211418976">11</xref></sup> Illustrative examples of this pattern are given in (15) and (16).</p>
<list id="list12-0075424211418976" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(15) It looks as if the three of you will have a very cosy evening. (FLOB P29)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(16) It sounded as though she might ever again be alone with Mark. (LOB P06)</p></list-item></list>
<p>The complementizer <italic>like</italic> is also commonly attested in similar instances, as shown in (17).</p>
<list id="list13-0075424211418976" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(17) It seems like some people in Paris want to hear more from me than those fellers over at the conference house do. (Brown K27)</p></list-item></list>
<p>Particularly interesting in this pattern are instances with no anticipatory <italic>it</italic>, as in (18)–(20). Taking the three complementizers together, examples of this kind are recorded mostly, but not exclusively, in the spoken material: out of 41 examples of this type in the corpora (<italic>as if</italic> 6 exx., <italic>as though</italic> 2 exx., <italic>like</italic> 33 exx.), only 13 occur in the written sources. And it must be noted that these 13 examples from the Brown family of corpora are found without exception in fiction, mostly in fictional dialogues or monologues, as in example (20). The two predicates most commonly occurring in structures without <italic>it</italic> are <italic>look</italic> (19 exx.) and <italic>sound</italic> (16 exx.).</p>
<list id="list14-0075424211418976" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(18) Looks as if it might well have been doesn’t it? (DCPSE: DI-B19)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(19) Sounds as though he must be. (DCPSE: DL-B18)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(20) “Seems like we’re never going to see eye to eye, Lieutenant. Didn’t they tell you what I wanted the p&amp; a&amp; system for?” (Brown L12)</p></list-item></list>
<p>The fact that in all such instances the verb is inflected for the present tense, and that the most common link is <italic>like</italic> (in 33 out of 41 exx.) could be taken as an indication that the combinations <italic>looks like</italic> and <italic>sounds like</italic> are close to fossilization, maybe on their way to becoming evidential markers of some kind, as happened with the construction <italic>methinks</italic> in Earlier English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0075424211418976">López-Couso 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0075424211418976">Palander-Collin 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0075424211418976">Wischer 2000</xref>). Evidence for this development is found in the occurrence of such combinations in parenthetical use, as in (21), from Mark Davies’s Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA).</p>

<list-item><p>(21) Going to be a big one, looks like. (COCA, 2009 Bk: Reliable Wife)</p></list-item></list>
<p>Quite frequently, subject clauses introduced by <italic>as if</italic> or <italic>as though</italic> depend on a matrix containing the verb <italic>be</italic> (89 exx.)/<italic>not be</italic> (16 exx.), rather than a verb of seeming. Examples (22) and (23) illustrate the pattern <italic>It is</italic> + comparative complementizer + clause. The “<italic>it is as if</italic>-construction,” as it has been labeled, has been studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0075424211418976">Declerck (1992</xref>:222-223), who attributes to it a very specific discourse function, the expression of “what the speaker infers to be a possible interpretation of a given situation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0075424211418976">Declerck 1992</xref>:223).</p>

<p>In addition to the two patterns discussed so far, the corpora yield examples in which the complement clause occurs on its own but can be understood as depending on an elided matrix of the kind <italic>it is</italic>/<italic>seems</italic>/<italic>appears</italic>/<italic>looks</italic>, etc. A total of 19 examples of this kind are attested in our material, as illustrated in (25) and (26).</p>

<p>In 15 of them, the clause has the illocutionary force of an exclamation, as in (27) and (28). These exclamatory clauses are discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0075424211418976">Huddleston and Pullum (2002</xref>:1152) and also in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0075424211418976">Dancygier and Sweetser (2005</xref>:229), who refer to this structure as the “monoclausal use of <italic>as if</italic>,” where the clause typically expresses surprise, rejection, or regret.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0075424211418976">12</xref></sup> A similar instance with <italic>like</italic> is (29), from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0075424211418976">Dancygier and Sweetser (2005</xref>:230 ex. 79).</p>

<sec id="section5-0075424211418976">
<title>Predicative Function</title>
<p>The second most frequent group of examples in the corpus (107 exx.) corresponds to a structure of the type <italic>She seems as if</italic>/<italic>as though</italic>/<italic>like</italic> + complement clause in what appears to be a case of raising out of a finite clause. In the literature this has been labeled “pseudo-raising” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0075424211418976">Rooryck 2000</xref>:55-56) and “copy-raising” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0075424211418976">Asudeh &amp; Toivonen 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0075424211418976">2006</xref>). The range of CTPs found in this pattern is similar to that mentioned above in connection with subject clauses: <italic>appear</italic> (1 ex.), <italic>be</italic> (2 exx.), <italic>look</italic> (79 exx.)/<italic>not look</italic> (4 exx.), <italic>seem</italic> (7 exx.)/<italic>not seem</italic> (1 ex.), <italic>sound</italic> (11 exx.)/<italic>not sound</italic> (2 exx.). As shown in examples (30) and (31), the function of the clause is that of subjective predicative complement, and the subject of the matrix clause is a referential Noun Phrase, not the dummy subject <italic>it</italic>. Moreover, these Noun Phrase subjects are always definite and restricted to the second and third persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0075424211418976">Rooryck 2000</xref>:57). In most cases (93 exx. vs. 14 exx.) the subject of the matrix and that of the subclause are coreferential, as in (30), though this is not invariably so, as in example (31), where coreferentiality is established with a Noun Phrase other than the subject.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0075424211418976">13</xref></sup></p>

<p>The complementizer <italic>like</italic> also occurs in this pattern (77 exx.), mostly with the predicates <italic>look</italic> (52 exx.) and <italic>not look</italic> (3 exx.), and most commonly in TEA (59 exx.). Illustrations are given in (32) and (33) below. Only five instances of <italic>like</italic> are found in the British English corpora: one in LOB (in fictional dialogues, Cat.

In the American English material, most <italic>like</italic> examples occur in imaginative prose (a few in press and belles lettres), which contrasts with occurrences of <italic>as if</italic> and <italic>as though</italic> in this pattern, which are recorded in all kinds of registers.</p>

<title>Object Function</title>
<p>A third possible function for <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> complement clauses is that of object, as shown in (34).

<title>Semantic Predicates and Epistemicity</title>
<p>As the foregoing discussion shows, <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> clauses in the most common functions in our material (i.e., subject and predicative complement) co-occur, without exception, with copular or linking verbs: either the copular verb par excellence <italic>be</italic> or verbs of seeming (including sensory verbs; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0075424211418976">Quirk et al. 1985</xref>:1171-1174; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0075424211418976">Biber et al. 1999</xref>:436; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0075424211418976">Taylor &amp; Pang 2008</xref>:131). Interestingly, the idea of equation characteristic of copular structures entails similarity, which could go a long way toward explaining why adverbial links of comparison fit well in complement structures of this kind.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0075424211418976">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>From a semantic point of view, all the predicates selecting <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> complements in our data belong to the group of Propositional Attitude Predicates (PAPs) in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0075424211418976">Noonan’s (1985)</xref> taxonomy of CTPs. As such, they convey “an attitude regarding the truth of the proposition expressed as their complement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0075424211418976">Noonan 1985</xref>:113). More specifically, the predicates we have identified in the corpora could be characterized as expressing medium modality on a scale of strength of speaker commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0075424211418976">Huddleston &amp; Pullum 2002</xref>:175-177). Obviously, the copula <italic>be</italic> in examples (22)–(24) above cannot be ascribed to any of Noonan’s semantic classes. It should be noted, however, that in such cases it is the <italic>it is as if</italic> construction as a whole that conveys the speaker’s inferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0075424211418976">Declerck 1992</xref>:223). In other words, such cases involve epistemic modality, which by definition “qualifies the speaker’s commitment to the truth of the modalised proposition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0075424211418976">Huddleston &amp; Pullum 2002</xref>:52). It seems therefore that the use of the comparative complementizers in the structures at issue harmonizes either with the epistemic nature of the CTP in the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0075424211418976">Huddleston &amp; Pullum 2002</xref>:1152) or with the epistemic function of the whole construction. Put differently, comparative complementizers can be said to lessen the speaker’s endorsement of the embedded proposition, and complement clauses introduced by them are seen as inferences gained from evidence.</p>
<p>The close association of <italic>as if</italic>/<italic>as though</italic>/<italic>like</italic> complements with a particular type of CTP is in line with the constraints we have also observed in our work on other minor complementizers at different stages in the history of English. For example, the complementizer <italic>but</italic> normally occurs with predicates of negative import, especially those denoting doubt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0075424211418976">López-Couso &amp; Méndez-Naya 1998</xref>); the complementizer <italic>lest</italic> is confined to clauses dependent on predicates of fearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0075424211418976">López-Couso 2007</xref>); and the finite declarative complementizers <italic>if</italic> and <italic>though</italic> typically occur with commentative predicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0075424211418976">Noonan 1985</xref>:117), that is, those denoting an emotion or an evaluation on the part of the speaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0075424211418976">López-Couso &amp; Méndez-Naya 2001</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0075424211418976">Table 4</xref> provides a number of interesting insights into the variation of the three comparative complementizers. As already suggested by the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0075424211418976">Table 2</xref>, the figures in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0075424211418976">Table 4</xref> further support the idea that the minor declarative complementizers <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> are more closely associated with the spoken language than with the written medium. The normalized frequencies for the three links in the spoken British material (DCPSE) are much higher than those in the contemporary written corpora LOB and FLOB. Of the three complementizers, <italic>as if</italic> is the preferred choice in most of the corpora we have analyzed. The only exceptions correspond to spoken British English from the 1960s (DCPSE-LLC), where <italic>as though</italic> is the most common link, and to written American English from the 1990s (Frown) and Canadian English, which both show a clear predominance of the complementizer <italic>like</italic>. Notice that, in the latter variety, the complementizer <italic>as though</italic> is not recorded in our data and that the proportion of <italic>as if</italic> is negligible. In turn, in the British English written corpora the complementizer <italic>like</italic> is almost nonexistent. Moreover, it is not recorded in the spoken material from the 1960s, although it becomes quite popular in speech in the 1990s.</p>
<p>A look at the distribution of the three complementizers in the different text types of the British and American written corpora reveals a clear preference of these links to occur in imaginative prose (67.1 percent), particularly in fictional dialogue, rather than in informative prose (32.9 percent). This corroborates the close association of these minor complementizers with the spoken language mentioned earlier. Nevertheless, the data from the Brown family of corpora suggest the existence of a cline of formality for the three comparative complementizers in written Present-Day British and American English, with <italic>as if</italic> at the most formal end and <italic>like</italic> at the informal end of the continuum (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0075424211418976">Figure 1</xref>). For example, in the LOB corpus instances of <italic>like</italic> are restricted to fictional dialogue (three examples in Cat. N, Adventure and Western Fiction), <italic>as though</italic> occurs predominantly in imaginative prose (13 examples as opposed to three instances in informative prose), and the examples of <italic>as if</italic> are evenly distributed between informative and imaginative prose (17 examples in each group).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0075424211418976-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>It must also be noted that the already mentioned increase of <italic>like</italic> in American written English from the 1990s as represented in Frown is attested not only in imaginative prose but also in informative texts. This finding suggests that, in Present-Day American English, the complementizer <italic>like</italic> has expanded beyond the domain of informality and has lost its original stigmatized character, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0075424211418976">Huddleston and Pullum (2002</xref>:1158).</p>

<p>The most immediate insight to be gained from the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0075424211418976">Table 5</xref> is the clear predominance of the default complementizer <italic>that</italic> in all corpora. A closer look at the data indicates that the variation of <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> with the major complementizer <italic>that</italic> seems to be structurally restricted, since it is available only for those patterns in which the clause functions as subject or object. For the predicative function, by contrast, the variation is established with infinitival clauses instead.</p>
<p>Most significantly, besides being structurally restricted, the variation between the comparative complementizers and <italic>that</italic> also turns out to be lexically constrained. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0075424211418976">Table 6</xref> gives the breakdown of the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0075424211418976">Table 5</xref> according to individual predicates.</p>

<p>The data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0075424211418976">Table 6</xref> demonstrate that the selection of either the comparative complementizers under analysis or the major complementizer <italic>that</italic> is clearly lexically determined. The predicates <italic>look</italic> and <italic>sound</italic> categorically select the minor links <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic>. The only example of the complementizer <italic>that</italic> with one of these predicates in the corpora is (37). Example (9), repeated here as (38), also shows <italic>that</italic>, but it involves a reformulation. Here <italic>that</italic> resumes the link <italic>as though</italic> after the insertion of intervening material.</p>
<list id="list25-0075424211418976" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(37) It sounds that you’re wanting to take care of yourself physically as well (DCPSE: DI-A 11)</p></list-item>

</list>
<p>Our data for <italic>look</italic> and <italic>sound</italic> are therefore in line with the information provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0075424211418976">Huddleston and Pullum (2002</xref>:962n8), who report that <italic>that</italic> clauses are only “very occasionally found” with these two predicates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0075424211418976">15</xref></sup> The existence of predicates that exclude <italic>that</italic> and (virtually) obligatorily select comparative complementizers would indicate that <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> can be considered complementizers in their own right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0075424211418976">Rooryck 2000</xref>:56).</p>
<p>The opposite tendency is witnessed for the predicate <italic>appear</italic>, which almost categorically selects the complementizer <italic>that</italic>. The only two corpus instances with a comparative link are given as (39) and (40).</p>
<list id="list26-0075424211418976" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(39) You had to have convictions to lie down in the road in all those clothes and appear as though you might wish to turn yourself out of your own home. (Brown P08)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(40) When he noticed that he was being watched, Milt Saunders sank his head between his shoulders so that it appeared momentarily as if he had no neck. (Frown P26)</p></list-item></list>
<p>By contrast, the predicate <italic>seem</italic> shows true variation: though the major complementizer <italic>that</italic> clearly prevails in all corpora (229 exx.; 82.4 percent), <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> complement clauses also occur (49 exx.; 17.6 percent). In our opinion, complementizer selection with <italic>seem</italic> may reflect the degree of the speaker’s endorsement of the embedded proposition, which is higher in the case of <italic>that</italic>. This is suggested by the existence of an interesting difference between the two types of complementizers as regards the expression of an experiencer Noun Phrase in the sentence. In the case of <italic>seem</italic> + <italic>that</italic>, 36.7 percent of examples show an overt experiencer, mostly a first person one (70.5 percent of the cases where the experiencer is expressed). An illustration is given in (41), where <italic>it seems to me that</italic> indicates the speaker’s belief and his or her commitment to the truth of the proposition in the subclause, and could thus be considered a (less face-threatening) alternative to <italic>I think</italic> or <italic>I believe</italic>. In the case of <italic>seem</italic> + comparative complementizers the proportion of examples with an overt experiencer with <italic>seem</italic> drops to just 13.1 percent, eight examples in all, only three of which feature a first person experiencer. Example (42) illustrates <italic>seem as though</italic> with a third person experiencer.</p>

<p>Although the low number of examples does not warrant definite conclusions, this finding seems to point to a crucial difference between <italic>that</italic> and comparative complementizers both in terms of the evidential types in which they occur (belief vs. inference) and as regards the degree of speaker commitment (higher vs. lower) that they convey (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0075424211418976">Cornillie 2007</xref>:36, 41 for parallel Spanish examples).</p>
<p>The last predicate whose behavior we have analyzed is <italic>feel</italic>. Here the situation is somewhat more complex than with the other CTPs, since a distinction needs to be made between the two syntactic patterns available with this predicate. In the structure <italic>it feels</italic> + subject clause (nine examples, as in (43) below) only comparative complementizers are available. By contrast, in clauses in object function, as in (44), <italic>that</italic> clearly predominates in all corpora (89.9 percent).</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>In this article we have shown that, in addition to their primary use as adverbial subordinators of Comparison and Similarity, <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> also serve as complementizers in PDE, as counterparts of the major links <italic>that</italic> and zero. In their complementizer function, these minor links are particularly common in copular structures. Notice that the idea of equation entails similarity, so that original adverbial links of Comparison and Similarity, such as <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic>, fit the bill.</p>
<p>The variation between the comparative complementizers and the major link <italic>that</italic> is both structurally restricted (it is available only when the clause realizes the subject or the object function) and lexically determined. As is the case with other minor complementizers, <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> are constrained to occur with a specific type of CTP. In our data <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> complements prototypically depend on PAPs encoding a medium degree of commitment toward the truth of the embedded proposition (<italic>appear, look, seem</italic>, etc.). The selection of comparative complementizers is compatible with the idea of a hypothesis evoked by the matrix predicate; in other words, it harmonizes with the nature of the CTP in the matrix. However, the fact that some of our predicates favor <italic>that</italic> (e.g., <italic>appear</italic>), while others categorically select comparative links (e.g., <italic>feel</italic> with subject clauses or <italic>look</italic>), may indicate the existence of differences between the predicates at issue regarding the strength of the modality they convey.</p>
<p>The analysis of the corpus material here indicates that the minor declarative complementizers <italic>as if, as though</italic>, and <italic>like</italic> are more closely associated with the spoken language than with the written medium, where they are typically found in informal text types, particularly in fictional dialogue. Of the three comparative links, <italic>as if</italic> is the preferred choice in four of the corpora analyzed (LOB, FLOB, Brown, DCPSE-ICE-GB). The DCPSE-LLC material shows a predominance of <italic>as though</italic>, while in written American English from the 1990s (Brown) and, especially, spoken Canadian English (TEA) <italic>like</italic> is far more common. <italic>Like</italic> also shows a marked increase in spoken British English from the 1990s (DCPSE-ICE-GB). Moreover, the distribution of the three links across text types suggests the existence of a cline of formality, with the complementizer <italic>as if</italic> at the most formal end of the continuum and <italic>like</italic> at the informal end. However, evidence from Frown indicates that in Present-Day American English the complementizer <italic>like</italic> is starting to expand beyond the domain of informality.</p>
<p>Further corpus research is certainly needed on topics such as the Verb Phrase in the subclause (e.g., the occurrence of modally marked forms and of the interpretive progressive) and the presence of other epistemic markers (such as modal adverbs) in the construction. This may help us to discover whether the choice of different comparative links correlates with varying degrees of the speaker’s commitment toward the truth of the embedded proposition.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0075424211418976">Huddleston and Pullum (2002</xref>:1151) classify structures headed by <italic>as if</italic> and <italic>as though</italic> within nonscalar comparative constructions, which, unlike scalar comparative structures (such as <italic>Kim is as old as Pat</italic> or <italic>Kim is older than Pat</italic>), “are concerned not with grading but with such issues as identity and likeness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0075424211418976">2002</xref>:1099).

<p>We are aware that the complementizer <italic>like</italic> is potentially ambiguous with the pragmatic marker <italic>like</italic> in instances of the type illustrated in (7) above.
