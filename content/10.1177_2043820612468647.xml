(2012</xref>) are discussing the possible aesthetics of post-human worlds characterised by the tension between ‘bodily needs and desires … [as well as the] feeling that emerges from the exercise of judgement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612468647">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). In a somewhat polemic way, I would like to extend further this tension by looking at what can be referred to as the engineering aesthetics characterised by the desire and judgement of creation and control<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2043820612468647">1</xref></sup> – very different (if not opposite) to the aesthetics and motivations underlying the work of the artist Perdita Phillips, as discussed in the paper, but nevertheless another set of aesthetics that should be examined and scrutinized for a post-human world.</p><sec id="section1-2043820612468647"><title>The use of living materials as (aesthetic) devices</title><p>Life is increasingly seen as the new frontier for human centred exploitation: from industrial farming through in-vitro meat, and bio-prospecting to synthetic biology, life is extracted from its natural context into the realm of the engineered, designed and manufactured. Some may point out that as a result an interesting phenomenon is emerging: the further life is instrumentalised and becomes a product for human manipulation, matter, whether living, semi-living or non-living, is attributed with vitality and agency in what some refer to as ‘new materialism’ (e.g. Gilles Deleuze, Manuel de Landa, Jane Bennett). These phenomenon are complementary as much as contradictory; more than anything they further blur the perceptual (and technological) boundaries between what we consider living, semi-living and non-living, and their aesthetics – both in the sense of affect and judgement.</p><p>Although not new, in recent years we have witnessed a resurgence of the application of engineering logic in the fields of the life sciences, coupled with the treatment of life as a raw material for anthropocentric uses. As observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468647">Fox Keller (2009</xref>: 297), ‘the engineering standpoint houses multiple aims: two in particular stand out here: creation and efficiency.’ When the two principles of human creation coupled with the capitalist notion of efficiency are employed on living systems/matter there is a promise of control.</p><p>The application of engineering logic to life has historical precedents. In 1895, HG Wells reflected on a body as a malleable entity in his essay ‘The Limits of Individual Plasticity’, saying that, ‘[t]he generalisation of heredity may be pushed to extreme, to an almost fanatical fatalism,’ and adding: ‘we overlook only too often the fact that a living being may also be regarded as raw material, as something plastic, something that may be shaped and altered’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820612468647">Wells, 1975</xref>: 36). A year later, Wells demonstrated some of these ideas and their possible consequences in his novel <italic>The Island of Doctor Moreau</italic>. The plasticity of life processes, through human intervention not in the fictional realm, was demonstrated quite spectacularly only three years later in 1899 when Jacob Loeb developed what he called ‘artificial parthenogenesis … the artificial production of normal larvae (plutei) from the unfertilized eggs of the sea urchin’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612468647">Loeb, 1899</xref>). In other words, Loeb demonstrated the capacity for fertilisation (in a sea urchin) without the use of sperm. Loeb wrote, following his discovery, ‘it is in the end still possible that I find my dream realized, to see a constructive or engineering biology in place of a biology that is merely analytical’ Loeb, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612468647">Gilbert, 2000</xref><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2043820612468647">2</xref></sup>).</p><p>In 1890 Loeb wrote that ‘the idea is now hovering before me that man himself can act as a creator, even in living Nature, forming it eventually according to his will. Man can at least succuss in a technology of living substance’ (Loeb, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612468647">Pauly, 1987</xref>: 4). Loeb, like many of the engineers working with biology today, promoted the idea of science as manipulation in favour of what was practiced then – science of observation. </p><p>The hands on, experiential engagement with materials is also a characteristic of some of the contemporary artistic engagements with the life sciences. However, there are some fundamental differences: instead of efficiency and utility, some of the artistic engagement is purposely about exposing futility, failure and loss of control as an instrument for cultural discussions, reflections and observations. </p><p>The growing field of synthetic biology<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-2043820612468647">3</xref></sup> reinforces the pervasive influence of the engineering mindset and aesthetics within the life science laboratories, at the very same historical moment that the artistic interventions have also entered into these spaces. The scientific laboratory, in which artists (as well as engineers) are located, thus cannot be viewed in isolation but are positioned within larger cultural networks that are organised around the maximisation of utility, efficiency and profit.</p><p>In the 2011 exhibition <italic>Pigeon d’Or</italic>, the artist Tuur van Balen employed the strategy of irony to ponder on the desire of creation, efficiency and the illusion of control: </p><disp-quote><p>By modifying the metabolism of bacteria naturally occurring in the gut of pigeons, synthetic biology allows to add new functionality to animals commonly seen as vermin and ‘flying rats’, turning them into tools for urban disinfection. In collaboration with James Chappell, the artist has designed a special bacteria that, when fed to pigeons, turns their faeces into a biological window soap. It has been created using ‘biobricks’, standardized genetic building blocks collected in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts set up by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2003. One ‘biobrick’ lowers the pH level in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, the other makes it express lipase, a grease-digesting enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820612468647">van Balen, 2011</xref>).</p></disp-quote><p>The artist suggests using the technology and engineering aesthetic of synthetic biology to create and improve the pigeon to have a utility in our urban environment; faeces as cleaning agent – how ironically efficient. </p><p>However, by reducing a pigeon into a cleaning machine, a cascade of effects and affects happens to the pigeon’s body, environment as well as perception – either humans’ perception of the pigeon or the pigeon’s perception of its milieu. As stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612468647">Uexküll (1934)</xref>: ‘whoever wants to hold on to the conviction that all living things are only machines should abandon all hope of glimpsing their environments.’</p><p>The recent work <italic>Crude Matter</italic> by The Tissue Culture and Art Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2043820612468647">Catts and Zurr, 2012</xref>) is concerned with the importance of the substrate – the context – for life; the context is vital to life development and differentiation as much as, if not more than, the genetic code. There is a growing realisation that this differentiation depends very much on the extra cellular matrixes on which these cells are growing; even a subtle change in substrate morphology will have a fundamental effect on the cells plasticity and the lineage they will take. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612468647">Evans et al. (2009</xref>) demonstrated how mere changes in the substrate (PDMS) stiffness will change the differentiation of stem cells into different types of tissue, such as bone, fat etc.</p><p>Loosely based on the story of the Golem (literally meaning ‘crude’, ‘unshaped’) we are exploring the ‘alchemy like’ transformation of materials into substrates which have the ability to act as surrogates for life. The story of the Golem described the existence of life from inanimate matter (mud) – life that was forceful but brutal and could be shaped for different purposes and intentions. We are celebrating the aesthetics of the crude rather than the efficient, and the aesthetics of disappointment rather than the aesthetics of hype.</p><p>Our aim is to explore, in a poetic way, and bring back into the forefront, the materiality of life in context. Drawing on historical references taken from the middle ages, we would like to look at engineered life that is on the edges of what we consider animate or inanimate – and provide it with some sort of agency, even if symbolic. We will poetically recreate these experiments while touching on some of the important lessons of the Golem story: the creations of life from crude matter and human knowledge; to know when human hubris and life should not mixed.</p></sec><sec id="section2-2043820612468647"><title>Concluding notes</title><p>What kind of aesthetics strategies can be employed by artists for a post-human world is a very complex question; working with life as a material for artistic expression might be seen as a continuation of an anthropocentric humanistic activity which contradicts more post-human sensitivities. However, aesthetics which allow for planned utilitarian futility excess and relinquishing of control may function as a counter balance and deflective mode from the engineering aesthetics of efficiency and presumed control. </p><p>Post-human aesthetics of vibrancy and agency of matter are best utilised by artists in the form of presentation (rather than representation) in the form of the messy wet corporeal (rather than hard cold code) as that is what we are – mortal, humble, moist, leaking bodies, depending on our ecology and environment for survival and definition, and hanging tightly to the illusion of a defined, consistent self over time.</p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Notes</title><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-2043820612468647"><label>1.</label><p>This paper is an elaboration on a previous paper co-written with Oron Catts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2043820612468647">Catts O and Zurr I (2012)</xref> Life as a raw material: Illusions of control. <italic>Somatechnics</italic> 2(2): 250–262).</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-2043820612468647"><label>2.</label><p>Jacques Loeb to Ernst Mach, 28 December 1899.
