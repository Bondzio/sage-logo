<abstract>
<p>Nationally, 11,000 senior centers play a vital role in supporting community-dwelling older adults by offering a diverse array of recreational, nutritional, health, and social service programs. The purpose of this study was to identify innovative models of senior centers nationwide and evaluate their impact on the communities they serve. Applying a multiple-case study approach to a national survey sample, six innovative models were identified by members of the New Models Taskforce (NMTF), a project sponsored by the National Institute of Senior Centers (NISC). The NMTF hoped to document the innovative efforts of senior centers to reimagine and reposition themselves within the aging services field. This article will highlight the defining characteristics of each model and discuss their implications for the field. The potential impact of each model on the senior center field will be illustrated.</p>

<p>Senior centers play a critical role on the aging continuum of care by offering a diverse array of recreational, nutritional, health, and social service programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0733464810380545">Aday, 2003</xref>). Senior centers were designed to promote the health and well-being of older adults while effectively engaging them in their communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0733464810380545">Fitzpatrick, Gitelson, Andereck, &amp; Mesbur, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0733464810380545">Krout, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0733464810380545">Leanse &amp; Wagener, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464810380545">Linn &amp; Knapp, 1980</xref>). However, in the last few decades, administrators and funders have noted with concern the phenomenon of participants “aging in place” within their senior centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0733464810380545">Calsyn, Burger, &amp; Roades, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0733464810380545">Calsyn &amp; Winter, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0733464810380545">Krout, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0733464810380545">1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0733464810380545">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0733464810380545">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0733464810380545">New York City Department for the Aging, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0733464810380545">Pardasani, 2004c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0733464810380545">Strain, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0733464810380545">Turner, 2004</xref>). Faced with growing competition from other providers of older adult services and programs, as well as the increasing heterogeneity of the aging population, senior centers find themselves at unique crossroads in their evolution as organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0733464810380545">Krout, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0733464810380545">National Institute of Senior Centers [NISC], 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0733464810380545">Turner, 2004</xref>). Although a few senior centers have redesigned and reconceptualized their organizations to meet the challenges of the new millennium, there are limited data on new, promising, thriving, and innovative models of senior centers across the nation.</p>

<title>Purpose of the Study</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to identify new and emerging models of multipurpose senior centers (nutrition sites and senior clubs are excluded from this study) nationwide. Applying a multiple-case study approach to a national survey sample, six innovative models were identified by members of the New Models Taskforce (NMTF), a project sponsored by the NISC. This article will highlight the defining characteristics and structure of each of the six models and illustrate their impact on their target populations.</p>

<title>Significance of Senior Centers</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0733464810380545">The Older Americans Act (OAA) of 1965</xref> was the catalyst for the growth and spread of senior centers nationwide. One of the chief goals of OAA was to enhance the well-being of community-dwelling older adults and delay or prevent institutionalization. To this day, the OAA is the largest funding source for senior centers, and its allocations are supplemented at the local level by state, county, and municipal governments. In addition, many senior center budgets are supported and/or supplemented by private sources of funding. The OAA inspired the creation of multipurpose senior centers that were designed to offer a broad spectrum of services (recreational, health, nutritional, and social services). According to the OAA, senior centers are to be considered as “focal points” in the delivery of services to the elderly, thus, emphasizing the need for coordinated and comprehensive service-delivery models. Although all individuals above the age of 60 are eligible for senior center programs (there is no means-testing), the recent amendments call for an increased focus on addressing the needs of the most vulnerable constituents of their communities, that is, individuals with low incomes, multiple needs, and limited resources (National Council on the Aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0733464810380545">[NCOA], 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>The Expansion and Growth of Senior Centers</title>
<p>Programming in senior centers has gradually evolved in relation to changing needs and user characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0733464810380545">Calsyn &amp; Winter, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0733464810380545">Demko, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0733464810380545">Harris &amp; Associates, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0733464810380545">Lun, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0733464810380545">Miller, Campbell, Davis, Furner, &amp; Giachello, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0733464810380545">Mitchell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0733464810380545">Netzer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0733464810380545">Ralston, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0733464810380545">1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0733464810380545">1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0733464810380545">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0733464810380545">Tuckman, 1967</xref>). The major reason that senior centers are so diverse in their operating profiles is that they have proven to be quite responsive to the needs of their constituents. Senior centers, depending on their size, budget, and programmatic focus, may range in design from recreational clubs or nutrition sites to traditional community-based senior centers and large, multipurpose senior centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0733464810380545">Krout, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0733464810380545">Leanse &amp; Wagener, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0733464810380545">Ralston, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0733464810380545">Taietz, 1976</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0733464810380545">Taietz (1976)</xref> identified two basic types of senior center models: (a) the social agency model that primarily serves the poor and disengaged populations are in need of services to meet their basic survival needs and (b) the voluntary organization model that tends to attract relatively affluent, better educated, and socially active elders. The five most common categories of senior center programs are nutrition, health and fitness, recreation, volunteer opportunities, and social services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0733464810380545">Aday, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0733464810380545">Eaton &amp; Salari, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0733464810380545">Gavin &amp; Myers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0733464810380545">Gelfand, Bechil, &amp; Chester, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0733464810380545">Krout, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0733464810380545">Leanse &amp; Wagener, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0733464810380545">Pardasani, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0733464810380545">Skarupski &amp; Pelkowski, 2003</xref>). Regardless of the individual program designs, meal programs form the core service for the majority of senior centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0733464810380545">Krout, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>So Who Participates in Senior Centers?</title>
<p>Krout, a leading researcher of senior centers, has systematically demonstrated the “graying” of the senior center participant pool from the 1960s to the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0733464810380545">Krout, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0733464810380545">1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0733464810380545">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0733464810380545">1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0733464810380545">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0733464810380545">1998</xref>). Longitudinal studies lend credence to the belief among senior center administrators that their participants are “aging in place” and are not being replaced by their younger cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0733464810380545">Aday, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0733464810380545">Krout, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0733464810380545">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0733464810380545">Turner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0733464810380545">Walker, Bisbee, Porter, &amp; Flanders, 2004</xref>). Researchers have documented that senior center participants are most likely White, single or widowed, older women with medium to low incomes and minimal physical disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0733464810380545">Calsyn et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0733464810380545">Calsyn &amp; Winter, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0733464810380545">Krout, Cutler, &amp; Coward, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0733464810380545">Pardasani, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0733464810380545">Ralston &amp; Griggs, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0733464810380545">Turner, 2004</xref>). Participation trends resemble a bell curve. In other words, participation peaks among those in the 75 to 84 age category and then declines as the participants grow increasingly frail or develop limitations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0733464810380545">
<title>Rationale for Participation</title>
<p>Reasons offered generally for participation center around the theme of social interaction and companionship, whereby an increase in participation is linked to a greater need for companionship and enhanced quality of programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0733464810380545">Eaton &amp; Salari, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0733464810380545">Gitelson, McCabe, Fitzpatrick, &amp; Case, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0733464810380545">Krout, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0733464810380545">Pardasani, 2004c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0733464810380545">Turner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0733464810380545">Walker et al., 2004</xref>). Decreased involvement was found to be linked to health problems and lack of transportation to sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0733464810380545">Aday, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0733464810380545">New York City Department for the Aging, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0733464810380545">Pardasani, 2004c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0733464810380545">Strain, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0733464810380545">Walker et al., 2004</xref>). Men, older adults with higher levels of income and/or education, and those with an extensive social circle were found least likely to participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0733464810380545">Krout, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0733464810380545">Lun, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0733464810380545">Walker et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Benefits of Participation in Senior Centers</title>
<p>Some studies have found that senior center participants have better psychological well-being across several measures than nonparticipants, including perceived social and health benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0733464810380545">Gitelson et al., 2005</xref>), depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0733464810380545">Choi &amp; McDougall, 2007</xref>), friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0733464810380545">Aday, Kehoe, &amp; Farney, 2006</xref>), and stress levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0733464810380545">Farone, Fitzpatrick, &amp; Tran, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0733464810380545">Maton, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0733464810380545">Aday et al. (2006)</xref> found that women who lived alone were most likely to participate in senior centers, develop friendships, and expand their social networks outside of the senior center.

Other studies have evaluated the impact of specific health programs offered in senior centers on participants’ physical activity and functioning, including Tai Chi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0733464810380545">Li et al., 2008</xref>), physical activity and exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0733464810380545">Fitzpatrick et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0733464810380545">Wallace et al., 1998</xref>), nurse-managed wellness program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0733464810380545">Campbell &amp; Aday, 2001</xref>), falls and injury prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0733464810380545">Reinsch et al., 1992</xref>), walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0733464810380545">Sarkisian, Prohaska, Davis, &amp; Weiner, 2007</xref>), resistance training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0733464810380545">Manini et al., 2007</xref>), line dancing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0733464810380545">Hayes, 2006</xref>), increasing healthy eating habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0733464810380545">Hendrix et al., 2008b</xref>), and diabetes self-management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0733464810380545">Hendrix et al., 2008a</xref>).

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section10-0733464810380545">
<title>The NMTF</title>
<p>A taskforce comprised of 21 senior center directors and administrators from around the country was established in 2007 by the NISC, the nation’s premier advocacy and membership organization for senior centers. Eight members of the taskforce also served on the Delegate Council of NISC, while other taskforce members were recruited nationally by the chair of the taskforce, Peter Thompson. The non-NISC members of the taskforce comprised administrators of private and public, not-for-profit senior centers from around the country. The primary author of this study was invited to lead the research efforts of the taskforce. The taskforce was charged with identifying and defining the new, emerging models of senior centers in the country.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0733464810380545">
<title>Study Questionnaires</title>
<p>An initial 14-item questionnaire was developed by the taskforce. This questionnaire asked respondents to provide information on the demographic characteristics of participants, funding size and sources, and the philosophical mission of their senior centers, as well as to describe the process and product of innovation that they had undertaken. Additional questions attempted to assess the reaction to the innovation from funders, staff, and participants (stakeholders); the involvement of the stakeholders in the process; the resources utilized for the project; the potential for sustainability and replication; and the outcomes of its implementation.</p>
<p>A second questionnaire comprising 10 items was developed as a follow-up to the first questionnaire. Evaluating the responses to the first questionnaire, the members of the taskforce worked collaboratively to identify senior centers with the most impactful and sustainable innovations. Members of the taskforce then conducted phone interviews with the selected respondents. The second questionnaire was utilized for this follow-up interview. This questionnaire allowed for a more in-depth assessment of the innovative model, including the delineation of its chief characteristics, its overall impact, and implications for practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0733464810380545">
<title>Sampling</title>
<p>The first questionnaire was posted online at a website provided by Indiana University Northwest. An introductory letter was drafted by the taskforce. This letter explained the purpose of the study and directed interested respondents to the website. The letter was sent out as an e-mail to 751 members of the NISC. NISC members comprise a diverse range of senior centers with reference to location (urban/suburban/rural), characteristics of participants, and types of programs. Due to the limited resources available, the study could not be expanded to non-NISC members and may therefore have impacted the reliability/validity of the findings. This type of sampling could be best described as a nonrandom type of convenience sampling as it was limited to NISC members. A total of 187 respondents completed the online survey, yielding a 24.9% response rate.</p>
<p>Based on the selection criteria described in the next section, 35 respondents were selected to represent the most innovative senior centers. The second questionnaire was administered in person (interviews) by members of the taskforce.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0733464810380545">
<title>Data Collection and Analysis Process</title>
<p>Data collection and analysis occurred in two stages. The initial data were collected by an online questionnaire and then transferred to an Excel file. In the first stage, six critical concepts for assessment were determined—expansiveness of innovation, feasibility and sustainability, utilization of resources for implementation, potential for replication, impact on participation, and cooperation from stakeholders. After identifying the six critical concepts, the taskforce developed working definitions for each of them and a 3-point scoring system was created (as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0733464810380545">Table 1</xref>). The 187 responses were categorized by the authors of this study into five major foci of innovation—programmatic, fundraising, and resource development; marketing and outreach; facilities; volunteer and staff development; and community collaborations. Each of the 21 members was then assigned to one category (through self-selection). Each member of the taskforce then evaluated each entry in that particular category on a 3-point scale for every critical concept (six in all) and gave the entry an overall score (range 6-18). The individual evaluator scores for each category were then combined to create composite, mean scores. There was minimal variation in the mean scores among members. In the final step of the first stage, the entries with the highest scores were identified, which led to the final list of 35 senior centers.</p>

<p>In the second stage, the 35 finalists were interviewed (via telephone or in person) by members of the taskforce (through assignment by study authors). The responses of the finalists, as well as their interpretation by taskforce members, were purely subjective. Reviewing the interviews of the 35 finalists, the taskforce noticed common themes with respect to programming, operating philosophy, and service perspectives. Based on the common themes of innovation and programming that were found in the 35 short-listed senior centers, six models or categories of emerging senior centers were identified by members of the taskforce in two follow-up meetings (postinterviews). The members then decided (by consensus) to attach each of the 35 senior centers to a specific model. Using the multiple case study method of analysis, specific defining characteristics of the various emerging models, their service/program design, and impact on community were identified and highlighted.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Based on the initial and follow-up interviews with survey respondents, some broad patterns of models emerged. The taskforce identified six emerging models of senior centers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0733464810380545">Table 2</xref>). While some of the models identified are not entirely new, they have been reimagined and reconceptualized by the senior centers in this study. We also use the term <italic>models</italic> loosely in this study as we understand that there is limited empirical validation for them. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0733464810380545">Table 2</xref> provides a summary of the defining characteristics of the six models. The six models of emerging senior centers as highlighted by our nationwide study are as follows: community center (CC), wellness center (WC), lifelong learning/arts (LLA), continuum of care/transitions (CCT), entrepreneurial center (EC), and the café program (CP). In the following discussion, we compare the various models with reference to the characteristics of organizational mission, consumer profile, program design, operating profiles, funding sources, and impact.</p>

<sec id="section15-0733464810380545">
<title>Consumer Profile</title>
<p>The CC model differs significantly from all the other models in its focus on a multigenerational consumer base. In this model, various generations—children, adults, and older adults—are served under one roof. While specific programs are designed for each age cohort, several programs and services are available to all age groups. The other models (WC, LLA, EC, and CP) all focus on the relatively healthy and mobile older adult. Only the CCT model with its focus on a continuum of care concept allows for specific programming for older adults at various stages of aging. Although the CP model provides a restaurant-style experience for all members of the community (regardless of age), most recreational and educational programs are limited to older adults only. An important aim of all the models (with perhaps the exception of the CCT model) is to attract the “younger” older adults or the baby boomers that are in short supply in traditional senior centers as noted earlier in the review of literature.</p>
<p>With reference to race and ethnicity, the consumer profile is highly dependent on the location of the senior center models. While the CC, EC, and WC models tend to be located in suburban areas or new developments, the LLA and the CP have been located in both suburban and urban areas. The latter two models attract a diverse clientele, although Hispanic older adults are the least likely to attend, even when present in the community. The CCT model also tends to attract a diverse consumer base but is highly dependent on the location of these programs. Programs located in the southern United States report a significantly higher African American participation rate than those in the northern United States.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0733464810380545">
<title>Organizational Mission and Philosophical Focus</title>
<p>The names assigned to each model underscore their organizational missions. As with a traditional senior center, all models provide an environment for socialization, social support, resource information, and interpersonal engagement. The organizational mission of the CC model is to be a focal point of services and programs within a community regardless of age. The proponents of this model believe that providing multigenerational programming achieves two outcomes—it prevents age segregation (thereby reducing stigma) and addresses the needs of older adults who want to engage in activities with other generations. However, the mission of the WC, LLA, CCT, EC, and CP models is to cater only to the needs of the older adult population. While the WC’s mission is to focus on improving the health and well-being of older adults, the LLA and CP models focus on intellectual stimulation and creative pursuits for older adults. The CCT model also focuses on the health and well-being of older adults, but its mission is to serve older adults at every stage in their aging process. Proponents of this model believe in an incremental, gradually expanding service that meets the increasing needs (health, support, and social service) of older adults as they age. The EC model focuses on civic engagement, volunteerism, and resource generation through the utilization of the skills and expertise of the older adult population. Another focus of the EC model is to create programs that generate income through various entrepreneurial ventures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0733464810380545">
<title>Program Design and Offerings</title>
<p>Of all the models, the CP model has the most limited range of programs. In addition to the meal service (in a café-style environment), a few recreational and educational programs are provided in the afternoons and early evenings. Most of these programs are restricted to older adults (55+) and focus on intellectual stimulation, limited exercise, performing arts, or health literacy. The CC, WC, EC, and LLA models offer a range of recreational programs such as arts and crafts, cards, board games, trips, performances, cultural programs, and meals. All the models also offer some level of health education and screenings, information and referral services to other community-based programs, and varying degrees of exercise programs. However, the CC model specifically provides non-age-segregated programs to a greater extent than those offered by other models. As with the WC model, the CC model is built around a state-of-the art recreational facility that includes a gym, indoor and outdoor sports courts, pools, and sports leagues. In many cases, the intergenerational mingling occurs organically in the CC model rather than having to be scheduled as in some traditional senior centers.</p>
<p>The WC model has the most structured and well-defined slate of programs/services geared toward health and fitness. At the core of the WC model is a state-of-the-art fitness facility that may include a fitness center, basketball and tennis courts, indoor running tracks, personal training and fitness classes, saunas, and swimming pools. While traditional recreational and information/referrals programs are also offered in the WC, a concerted effort is made to provide evidence-based and professional (supported by licensed health care and fitness professionals) health-based programs such as workshops, screenings, testing, and interventions that enhance the well-being of their participants.</p>
<p>The LLA model focuses on continuing education and caters to the knowledge acquisition needs of their members. Programs (for-credit and noncredit courses), workshops (e.g., culinary, pottery, arts), and travel are geared specifically to meet the learning needs of the older adults. While all models provide for a diverse range of volunteer opportunities, the EC model creates the most structured program that provides training, placement, and coordination services for volunteers/older workers in the community.</p>
<p>The CCT model, in addition to providing the recreational, educational, and health literacy programs mentioned above, also focus on the needs of the frail and disabled older adult. In this model, similar to the assisted living facility model, services are provided at a central location as well as at the residence of the older adult. In other words, along with home-delivered meals (that are offered directly by or through contract by many traditional senior centers), the CCT model also provides for home health care, chore assistance, nursing, medical, physical therapy, and any other services that allow the individual to remain safely and comfortably in their own homes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0733464810380545">
<title>Hours of Operation</title>
<p>The issue of hours of operation has been a thorny one for most senior centers. Due to limited funding and resources, most traditional senior centers open in the early morning and close around 5:00 p.m. or even earlier. Traditional senior centers also remain closed on weekends and holidays. Most of the models cited here have expanded hours and days of service. While the CC and WC models open early and remain open until late in the evenings (as well as weekends), the CP model operates around the breakfast and lunch program. Therefore, the CP model closes early (by 4:00 p.m.) except on a rare occasion when there are artistic performances or lectures, which is similar to the EC model that also has traditional hours of service—early morning to early evenings (4:00 or 5:00 p.m.). However, due to their fitness centers and recreational facilities, the CC and WC models need to remain open for longer hours and on weekends/holidays to cater to the paying customer (members or nonmembers).</p>
<p>The LLA model may operate on a flexible schedule as many classes and travel are scheduled in the evenings or weekends to accommodate the younger older adult with work or family responsibilities. The hours of operation of the CCT model depends on where the services are being provided. On-site hours of operation are the same as other models—early morning to early afternoon. But in this model, there may be a dedicated phone service or professional available after hours to coordinate home-based and medical needs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0733464810380545">
<title>Service Sites and Location</title>
<p>Many proponents of change have called for the “senior center without walls” concept where programs and services are offered at multiple sites in partnerships with various community providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0733464810380545">Pardasani, 2004c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0733464810380545">Ryzin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0733464810380545">Young, 2006</xref>). The benefits of this concept are threefold: it increases the range of programs/services available to a consumer, avoids duplication and waste of resources, and allows for an integrated system of community-based care. However, nervousness about losing consumers to “rival” agencies, funding policies, and traditional turf battles pose a challenge to this idea. Researchers have already demonstrated that most senior centers work with diverse providers through structured and informal collaborations, but the scope of such partnerships could be expanded further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0733464810380545">Krout, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0733464810380545">Pardasani, 2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0733464810380545">2004c</xref>).</p>
<p>The CC, WC, EC, and CP models all operate primarily from one main site. In the CC, WC, and EC models, there is usually one large facility with extensive resources and functional spaces. In the CP model, all programs are centered on a café that is centrally located in a downtown area. All four models may offer referrals to services at other facilities and sites, but the central focus of programming is their own facility. The LLA is one model that is least connected to the one-site policy. Because of the nature of programming—educational courses, performing arts, cultural events, and connections with educational institutions—multiple sites may be more relevant to their needs.</p>
<p>In the case of the CCT model, services may be provided at one main site, but then home-based services are also provided for the frail or homebound older adult. Also, medical and social work staff may be available at one site during the day but may be connected through a professional service after hours. In this model, it is entirely possible that the main site only offers traditional programs during daytime hours like meals, recreational programs, assessments, and information and referrals, but all other services are provided through linkages and coordination with other providers. However, case coordination still takes place at the main site.</p>
<p>One critical factor in the location of service sites is access. While most of these models tend to be located primarily in urban or suburban regions, they may be less frequent in rural regions due to the reasons cited above. The CP model also locates cafés in urban, downtown areas to be more accessible to the community rather than only to older adults. In the LLA model, transportation may be provided for a fee. The CCT model may also utilize public transportation services such as para-transit, but its clients’ needs are significantly different and in many cases maybe more critical.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0733464810380545">
<title>Main Sources of Funding</title>
<p>Most of these models, except the LLA and CP models, depend on public sources of funding. Furthermore, OAA, state, and county allocations remain stagnant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0733464810380545">Ryzin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0733464810380545">Young, 2006</xref>), senior centers have to devise strategies to supplement their incomes. One of the chief hurdles for resource generation is that public funders may have stipulations on the type and scope of additional (external) funding sought by the senior center. For instance, if a senior center receives funding to provide meals to older adults, they cannot charge them for the meals. However, they are allowed (with certain restrictions) to accept voluntary contributions from consumers.</p>
<p>While the extensive facilities operated by CC’s are usually publicly funded (e.g., parks and recreation departments, taxes, special bonds/levies, etc.), some funds may be generated through the charging of nominal fees. These subsidized fees could be charged for use of the recreational facilities (depending on the policies of the public funder), specific programs, or for space rentals. If the CC model receives OAA funding or has contracts with the department of aging in their counties, then the meals and some other programs are provided at no cost to the older adults.</p>
<p>The LLA and WC models may operate a traditional senior center program with public funding, but the fitness and educational programs are sustained through consumer fees. The CCT model may receive traditional funding support for their onsite programs but are also able to access public or private health care funds (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) for specific home care, case management, and health care services.</p>
<p>The CP model has been created entirely through private funding support. While the consumers (both older adults and nonolder adults) are charged for their meals and participation in some programs designed for older adults only, this income is supplemented by support from the sponsoring organization. There has been an attempt to explore public funding for such a program, especially in regions where there are no senior centers.</p>

<title>Identification as “Senior Center”</title>
<p>It should be noted that many of the emerging models (CC, WC, LLA, CCT, and CP) shy away from the use of the term <italic>senior centers</italic> to identify themselves. They all report the rationale for their choice to be the negative image of senior centers. Frequently, these models use nondistinguishing names to identify themselves.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0733464810380545">
<title>Impact</title>
<p>The impact of these models can be delineated on multiple levels.</p>
<sec id="section23-0733464810380545">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>With reference to consumers, the WC, LLA, and CC models all report an increase in the number of overall participants but especially from the “younger” cohort. They tend to attract the middle- to upper-income older adults (55-75) who would like to focus on their health and mental well-being. The EC model tends to attract more men (usually a minority in traditional senior centers), newly retired individuals, and active adults with an emphasis on civic engagement, volunteering, or vocational opportunities than do the other models. The CP model attracts a broad range of older adults as they are usually centrally located on a main street. They also tend to attract older adults who may not attend a senior center but are more open to a community dining and café experience offered by this model. The CCT model has seen a greater increase in adults over the age of 75, especially frail or home-bound older adults who may not be served by traditional senior centers (due to limited programming and access). However, some senior centers utilizing this model report a decline or no increase in the “younger” older adult cohort and complaints from this cohort about the senior center resembling a nursing home.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0733464810380545">
<title>Community</title>
<p>All models report having a positive impact on the communities they serve. The CC model, however, with its outreach to all age groups, has had the most far-reaching impact. The CC model serves as a community focal point for all constituents. The WC, LLA, and EC models have had a greater impact on other providers and organizations within their communities due to their focus on collaborations, linkages, and coordinated programming (especially LLA and EC). The CCT, with its comprehensive service model, has had the most coordinated and structured system of linkages to provide a continuum of services for community-dwelling older adults. However, assisted-living facilities and retirement communities with specialized care programs have come to see this model as potential competition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0733464810380545">
<title>Funding</title>
<p>All models have reported an increase in funding, both in size and nature. All the models report active mechanisms for fundraising—grants, fees for services, planned giving ventures, and targeted fundraisers. Program fees, membership dues, sponsorships from for-profit entities, income-generating businesses, and Medicare/Medicaid have been utilized to supplement senior center budgets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0733464810380545">
<title>Public image</title>
<p>One of the by-products of these models is the changing image of senior centers among older adults as well as in the larger community. All the models, except for the CCT model, have developed the image that they cater to the energetic, mobile, educated, and informed older adult. Traditional senior centers have focused (justifiably) their attention on meeting the needs of those who are most vulnerable. As a result, senior centers may have developed the image that they are here to serve older adults with low incomes and significant needs that may dissuade the middle- and upper-income older adults who have greater resources and more choices at their disposal. Yet to supplement their budgets, senior centers do need these relatively affluent older adults who are able to subsidize their programs/services. The proponents of all the models state that they are serving a broader cross-section of older adults and meeting diverse needs, including those of the low-income, vulnerable consumers. The physical facilities created by the CC, WC, and CP models are exciting, expansive, and modern. In defense of traditional publicly funded senior centers, the support for maintenance or upgrading of facilities has been nonexistent in the last few decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0733464810380545">Gross, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0733464810380545">Pardasani, 2004c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0733464810380545">Ryzin, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>This study has several limitations. The low response rate (24.9%) to our study may influence the generalizability and validity of our findings. As there are approximately 11,000 senior centers nationally, the responses represent a relatively small pool. However, there is no single, reliable database of senior centers. Area Agencies of Aging (AAA), state offices of aging, parks and recreation departments, and state associations of senior centers all maintain separate lists. The wide array of databases and the limited resources available for this study curtailed our sample selection process.</p>
<p>Some of the models identified, such as the community center, are not entirely new. In fact, readers may recognize their similarity to the Jewish Community Center (JCC) model of service (funded mainly through private, Jewish philanthropies). But these models have not been widely applied to publicly funded senior centers until recently as in our case studies. Another limitation is the level of overlap between some of the models. The authors believe that many innovative senior centers may reflect the characteristics of several models (model overlap).</p>
<p>One critical limitation is the lack of examples of innovations in rural senior centers in our study. The characteristics and needs of rural centers and their participants may be different than their counterparts in urban or suburban regions. Our methodology, as well as our sampling frame, may have inadvertently limited the participation of rural senior centers. More focus needs to be paid to these regions in any future studies. Similarly, traditional senior centers that serve low-income individuals may be underrepresented in our study. Given their limited resources and the significant demand for social services, their ability to redesign may be curtailed, although innovative practices may have been initiated in these centers and need to be evaluated.</p>
<p>Finally, the definition of innovation as applied to the senior centers and the specific models identified was a subjective exercise. Although every effort was made to make the membership of the taskforce diverse and representative of the senior center field, the personal experiences and preferences of the taskforce members may have influenced the decisions and findings of this study.</p>

<sec id="section28-0733464810380545">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>One of the major strengths of senior centers across the country is their ability to adapt to the environments in which they function to respond to the needs of their constituents. We believe that the core strength of these emerging models is that they are adaptable and responsive to the changing needs of the aging cohort.</p>
<p>A critical challenge for the adoption of these new models is the limited resources available to senior centers. A majority of senior centers still rely on public funding for a significant portion of their budgets. Given the limited allocations and growing needs, it is very hard for stakeholders to engage in a reimagining or redesigning of senior centers when they are struggling daily to survive. On the one hand, if we do not engage in dialogue and strategic planning, then we may risk the continued relevance and sustainability of senior centers as a whole. On the other hand, how do we engage in this dialogue if we know there is no potential for public support for such endeavors? Another challenge for senior centers is to define their target audience. Since there is no means-testing for senior centers, everyone above the age of 60 is eligible for services. However, if senior centers are here to serve the needs of vulnerable older adults and those most in need, then their programs, services, and outreach should be planned accordingly. Instead of trying to attract seniors from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, senior centers could focus on this specific segment of the population. The only concern with this approach is that the vulnerable cohort has limited means and would be unable to supplement the operating budgets of the senior centers, which in turn would entail greater support from public and private sources.</p>
<p>Finally, a significant challenge for senior centers is the lack of a standard, consistent system of data collection about effectiveness and impact. Most senior centers maintain data on services provided and the characteristics of users. However, very little data (except anecdotal) are collected on the impact of participation. We believe that this information is vital to establishing the relevance of senior centers to a community at large. These data would also be critical for grant applications and obtaining support from private foundations, funders, and individuals. A multistate project to develop standardized processes could be initiated and coordinated by national organizations such as NISC.</p>
<p>The debate over the design and future models of senior centers has implications for public policy. In the past, senior centers thrived due to OAA and local public support, but these legislations were enacted in a different era. The older adult world is now vastly different and rapidly changing. If senior centers are to be responsive to the changing needs of the older adult population, policy makers and legislators need to examine the current funding levels available to senior centers. The current allocations are inadequate to provide “quality” service. In addition to funding, attention also needs to be paid to new and alternative models of service such as the continuum of care, café, entrepreneurial, and wellness models. There might be aspects of these models that are beneficial to the well-being of all older adults and should be supported in all senior centers.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Senior centers have a long, illustrious record of service to older adults and communities across the nation. However, as the aging cohort becomes increasingly diverse, their needs and interests are bound to expand exponentially. Traditional senior center programs and services will always be in demand by a specific segment of the aging population—low-income seniors with social service needs. We believe that these traditional models provide a critical service and will remain relevant in many communities. However, with overall decreasing attendance among “younger” elders and reduced public support, senior centers have to modernize their facilities, create new programs and services for varied interests/needs, combat stereotypical negative images of senior centers, and reposition senior centers as community focal points of service delivery. The innovative models are broadening the conceptual continuum of social service agency and voluntary organization. We hope that the framework provided in this study to evaluate senior center models can be used by senior centers nationally to assess their functioning and operating philosophies. In concert with comprehensive needs assessments, we believe that such a critical self-examination (involving administrators, staff, consumers, nonconsumers, and policy makers) will strengthen senior centers and clarify their position on the aging continuum of care.</p>
