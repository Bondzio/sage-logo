      <p>Total auricular reconstruction represents one of the greatest challenges for the plastic and reconstructive surgeon.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X12472902">1</xref>
         </sup> The ability to construct a fully satisfactory, complete external ear has been an elusive goal for centuries.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X12472902">2</xref>
         </sup> Because a suitable and reliable substitute for auricular cartilage has yet to be engineered, hand-carved autologous costal cartilage grafts and ear-shaped porous polyethylene implants are the current treatment modalities for auricular reconstruction. However, over the past decade, significant advances have been made in the field of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. A variety of scaffolds and innovative approaches have been investigated as alternatives using autologous carved costal cartilage or porous polyethylene implants.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12472902">3</xref>
         </sup> Although investigators have demonstrated that neocartilage can be constituted in a predetermined shape and in complex 3-dimensional (3D) structures such as a human ear by using cell transplantation on polymer constructs, many unsolved problems still remain. The crucial issues for auricular tissue engineering consist of optimal cell culture environment, choice of polymers, behavior of chondrocytes, study of cell-polymer constructs in an acceptable immunocompetent animal model (“real test model”), and long-term structural integrity.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12472902">4</xref>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X12472902"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X12472902">6</xref>
         </sup> One approach to functional tissue engineering of cartilage involves the in vitro cultivation of tissue constructs by using chondrogenic cells that can be selected, expanded, and implanted in ear-shaped scaffolds that provide a defined 3D structure for tissue development and are biodegrade at a controlled rate.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X12472902">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X12472902">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X12472902">8</xref>
         </sup> Although a number of investigators have been able to produce neocartilage in predetermined shapes, no study has been done in a “real test” immunocompetent animal model.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X12472902">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X12472902">9</xref>

      </p>
      <p>In this study, we evaluated a novel, 3D cell-copolymer construct resembling an ear model, made of mesenchymal progenitor (stem) cells (MSCs) seeded in alginate and silk fibroin, which was subsequently implanted in an immonocompetent rabbit model.</p>

            <title>Copy of the Human Auricle With 3D Computer-Aided Design</title>
            <p>To calculate a geometric model of the auricle construct, the following image-processing steps were necessary: (1) segmenting the image structure of the model, (2) calculating the surface model, (3) making a mirror image of the geometric model, and (4) exporting the geometric data in the stereolithography data format. After importing the computed tomography (CT) data in the DICOM file format, the isotropic image data volume was calculated by linear interpolation.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X12472902">12</xref>
               </sup> This was the basis for a 3D image segmentation of the auricle model, which was performed by automatic thresholding.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X12472902">13</xref>
               </sup> This process produced a binary image data volume, and the surface data could be approximated by geometric primitives such as triangles. After making a mirror image of these geometric data, the 3D visualization process could be initiated as well as the export of the data in the STL format.</p>

            <title>Fabrication of the 3D Human Ear Mold</title>
            <p>The production of the mold for the creation of the auricular cartilage construct was carried through fast prototyping, from a human ear image. The 3D image of the ear was sent to the 3D impression, where the initial mold, called “first positive,” was produced by laser impression, overlapping layer by layer in cuts of 1 micron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X12472902">Figure 1A</xref>). In recent years, laser technology has proven to be a more reliable method for mold engraving (impression), as many traditional engraving methods have failed to meet the continually growing standards for precision, depth, and quality. This first “positive” scaffold allowed the preparation of a second scaffold, the so-called negative, in silicone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X12472902">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

            <p>Auricular cartilage was dissected from the ears of 12-week-old New Zealand White rabbits. A square-shaped composite tissue of the whole layer of the auricle, 1 × 1 cm in size, was harvested. Each sample was placed in normal saline and processed within 6 to 12 hours postsurgery. Cartilage was washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The sample was then minced into small fragments and digested with 2 mg/mL collagenase in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) at 37°C for 3 hours, for MSC isolation. Deactivation of collagenase action was done by adding DMEM and FBS. The resulting cell suspension was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 minutes. The supernatant was decanted and the cell pellet was washed to remove the remaining enzyme. After final centrifugation, the cell pellet was analyzed for total cell count with a hemocytometer. Cell viability was determined using the trypan blue dye exclusion test. Cells were expanded in low-glucose DMEM, containing 20% fetal bovine serum (CULTILAB, Campinas-SP, Brazil), penicillin, and streptomycin.<sup>

         <p>Tissue engineering using MSCs continues to be a challenging problem. Cartilage tissue engineering has an important role to play in the generation of graft material for head and neck reconstruction and specifically for auricular cartilage reconstruction.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090820X12472902">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X12472902">16</xref>
            </sup> Although this work serves as a preliminary investigation for fabricating a human ear model, the results are important for the research of tissue-engineered cartilage. Successful tissue engineering is based on acquiring the appropriate cells, proliferating them, and accurately predicting their response in vivo. We have found that the MSCs acquired from perichondrium and chondrium of the rabbit ear cartilage have expressed markers for chondrogenesis. Although it has been shown in earlier studies that the yield for chondrocytes and extracellular matrix from MSCs has not been sufficient to support 3D auricular scaffolds, in our study, the rate yield was sufficient for constructing an ear 3D model.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X12472902">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X12472902">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090820X12472902">17</xref>
            </sup> Comparing and testing the different possible sources of cells for construction of this specific auricular model, the combination of MSCs from perichondrium and chondrium seemed to be the most appropriate. A recently published study has confirmed also that MSCs are excellent candidates for tissue engineering, and when obtained from the perichondrium and chondrium, they have a high chondrogenic potential.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X12472902">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090820X12472902">18</xref>

         <p>Biomaterials are used to guide the organization, growth, and differentiation of cells in the process of forming functional tissue and can provide both physical and chemical cues.<sup>

            </sup> They need to be tissue inductive to induce the proliferation of cells and tissue conductive to guide the migration of the cells. Alginate is a polyanionic polymer found in brown algae and can be cross-linked with bivalent cations to form stable ionically cross-linked gels. Alginate beads and hydrogels have been used to expand chondrocytes and induce stem cell differentiation.<sup>

            </sup> The silk is mainly composed of a filament core protein, fibroin, which can be made in various formats and has been shown to support stem cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation in vitro and promote tissue repair in vivo. A recent study has shown that seeding fibrous silk scaffolds with MSC guides MSC morphology and orientation, demonstrating the impact of scaffold topography on the engineering of oriented tissues.<sup>

         </p>
         <p>Biomolecules are biological materials that contribute to the structural integrity of tissue-engineered constructs and, at the same time, regulate their components. Growth factors, differentiation factors, angiogenic factors, and gene-modulated factors are the main components of the biomolecules. For in vitro culture, the addition of TGF-β3 and BMP-2 has stimulated enhanced chondrogenesis, regardless of the culture method chosen or scaffold composition; however, the degree of chondrogenesis is scaffold dependent.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090820X12472902">23</xref>
            </sup> Chondrogenic induction assays in the presence of TGF-β growth factor and BMP-2 were used in this study, as both factors have well-documented roles in chondrocyte maturation.<sup>

            </sup> Localization of long-term DNA label-retaining cells (LRC) is restricted to the perichondrium layer, and these putative stem/progenitor cells possess clonogenicity and chondrogenic capability in vitro. In a recently published study, no LRC were observed in the chondrium but LRC were observed in the perichondrium. These LRC, observed only in the perichondrial layer, seemed dormant, which is characteristic of putative stem cells.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090820X12472902">26</xref>
            </sup> Distortion and shrinkage of ear-shaped constructs during scaffold degradation and neocartilage maturation in vivo have been reported. Scaffolds made of synthetic polymers often generate degradation products that cause an inflammatory reaction and negatively affect neocartilage formation in vivo.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1090820X12472902">27</xref>
            </sup> This could possibly be the reason that the size dimensions of the cartilage were diminished slightly by the silk alginate scaffolds, although they maintained their shape and flexibility.</p>
         <p>This is a pilot study, which is a small experiment designed to test logistics and gather information prior to a larger study, to improve the latter’s quality and efficiency. Future studies need to be conducted with a bigger sample size, in which the engineered ear construct is followed for a longer period. Although we are reporting preliminary results of fabricating an ear model in an immunocompetent animal, we believe that these observations could serve as guidance for future experiments to produce “off-the-shelf” engineered auricular cartilage constructs.</p>

         <p>This study demonstrates for the first time that it is possible to engineer an ear cartilage construct that resembles the human ear not only in shape but also in size and flexibility in a real test model. This study also confirms that the association of silk, alginate, and MSC is a reliable method to produce an engineered auricular cartilage construct. Further long-term research needs to be done to confirm these observations.</p>
