<abstract>
<p>This article considers the interplay between Aboriginal people’s remembrances about race relations in rural mid-twentieth-century Australia and the frames of remembrance provided by the American Civil rights movement. It takes as its focus two key Australian sites of racial segregation – country town cinemas and public swimming pools – to explore the ways in which since, and in no small part due to, the desegregationist politics of the 1960s they have become prominent sites of public memory. Drawing on three examples from a range of media – art, film and published memoirs – the article traces the ways in which different ways of narrating and remembering these ‘twisted spaces’ contributes to and makes possible alternative and at times unsettling interpretations of experiences and histories of relations between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people during what is commonly referred to as the ‘assimilation era’.</p>

<p>This extract from an oral history interview recalls racial segregation in a country town cinema in New South Wales (NSW) during the middle part of the twentieth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750698013482863">Byrne and Nugent, 2004</xref>: 161–163). It belongs to a diverse and expanding array of remembrances by Aboriginal people – ‘a shifting, heterogeneous, partial and repetitive assemblage of acts, utterances and artefacts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750698013482863">Healy, 2008</xref>: 9) – that cohere around particular sites of segregation or racial discrimination. Memory and space merge here. Not only does this remembering accrue around certain places, making them ‘heavy with the accretions of memory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1750698013482863">Schwarz, 2011</xref>: 142). What is remembered are the spatial dimensions of those relations – the ways in which, for instance, the front section of the local cinema was demarcated by a rope or a low wall within which Aboriginal people’s presence was contained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750698013482863">Nugent, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This article considers sites of segregation, which in the recent past have become prominent sites of memory. My focus here is a series of examples of Aboriginal people’s remembrances, mainly autobiographical, around two particular ‘sites’ strongly associated with practices of racial segregation: local cinemas and public swimming pools. Reasons for this concentration of remembrance will become clear. However, my argument is also about what the study of corpuses of material, across a range of media and across different times and places, makes possible. The article is interested in the ways in which assorted acts of remembering about and through a collection of ‘sites’ – constituting a landscape of memory – rework and remake histories and spaces of race relations. What I aim to show is the ways in which these assemblages of remembrances contribute to alternative ways of knowing and interpreting complex and contradictory histories of entanglements and interactions between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people during what is commonly called the ‘assimilation era’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750698013482863">Haebich, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750698013482863">McGregor, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1750698013482863">Rowse, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>I begin with the memory and politics of the NSW Freedom Ride in 1965, because, as many have argued, it was instrumental in making publicly visible the sites of segregation that have since become the sites of memory that interest me here. Making those places recognizable depended in no small measure on evoking memories from somewhere else, but what eventually emerged was a parochial cartography of race relations that continues to resonate.</p>

<title>Spaces of politics: exposing hidden injuries of race</title>
<p>Australia’s mid-twentieth-century landscape of racial segregation was not widely known or publicly acknowledged until the political event known as the NSW Freedom Ride in the mid-1960s. A student protest outside the US Consul in Sydney in May 1964 against America’s race relations record, which turned ugly, provoked some calls in the Australian media for young activists to concentrate their attention on race relations closer to home. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698013482863">Clark (2008)</xref> cites a correspondent to the <italic>Sydney Morning Herald</italic>, who claimed that ‘In the midst of their righteous indignations these students seem to have completely forgotten the plight of the Australian aboriginal’ (p. 158; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750698013482863">Read, 1990</xref>: 97). Provoked into action, in February 1965, a busload of students from the University of Sydney embarked on a 2-week tour of rural NSW with the aim of drawing public attention to racism against Aboriginal people. This was a mode of politics, as has been noted many times, that drew directly on the Civil Rights movement in the United States in the same period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698013482863">Clark, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750698013482863">Curthoys, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1750698013482863">Perkins, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750698013482863">Read, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750698013482863">Scalmer, 2002</xref>). As its name suggests, the students borrowed from the US freedom rides, and they were also inspired by Martin Luther King’s manifesto, ‘Letter from Birmingham Jail’, in which he advocated non-violent action aimed at producing creative tension and ‘dramatizing’ race relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750698013482863">Read, 1990</xref>: 100). This is what the students sought to do in the towns they chose for their itinerary. They embarked with advice from Bill Ford, an economics lecturer at the university who had participated in a freedom ride to Jackson, Missouri (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750698013482863">Read, 1990</xref>: 98) to target particular sites of racial segregation and to make sure their protests were photographed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750698013482863">Read, 1990</xref>: 101).</p>
<p>The NSW Freedom Ride visited country towns that were known to have a poor record in race relations. The students targeted places where they could use non-violent action to expose clear examples of racial discrimination and where they might have been able to force desegregation. As the focus in the American Civil Rights struggle, that strategy was something a wider Australian public could recognize. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698013482863">Clark (2008)</xref> explains, ‘the bloody images of desegregation were well known in Australia. Although foreign and far away, the images were made both immediate and intimate through television’ (p. 152). Not surprisingly, the Australian media coverage of the Freedom Ride constantly evoked the American Civil Rights struggle. Journalists repeatedly drew correspondences between towns in America that had become shorthand for racial segregation with ones that the Freedom Riders visited in country NSW. In this way, ‘complicated and detailed descriptions were unnecessary to suggest links or comparisons with overseas events; merely the mention of an American placename was enough to conjure a vivid picture …’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698013482863">Clark, 2008</xref>: 154). For instance, an article in the <italic>Sydney Morning Herald</italic> explained,<disp-quote>
<p>Hattiesburg, Mississippi and Bowraville, N.S.W., have at least one thing in common: a picture theatre with a separate entrance, and separate seating, for coloured people. (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698013482863">Clark, 2008</xref>: 155)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By the end of a catalogue of comparisons, the writer concluded that ‘despite the picture theatre, Bowraville is not Hattiesburg’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698013482863">Clark, 2008</xref>: 155). No matter, the Civil Rights struggle was a device by which to make sense of the local situation.</p>
<p>While the Civil Rights movement provided a frame, the NSW Freedom Ride’s own narrative ultimately derived from the various encounters and confrontations it had in the towns it visited. Constant documentation, both by participants and the media, contributed to the Freedom Ride’s own symbolic lexicon of sites and issues. This was not simply the story of its politics; it <italic>was</italic> its politics. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1750698013482863">Bill Schwarz (2011)</xref> notes in relation to the ‘visual rhetorics’ of the American Civil Rights struggle, ‘at every point media representations were constitutive of the larger struggle’ (p. 148).</p>
<p>By the time the Freedom Ride returned to Sydney, it had achieved what it had set out to do: it had made publicly visible the ‘hidden injuries of race’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750698013482863">Cowlishaw, 2004a</xref>). It had, to this end, produced a recognizable cartography of race relations. On this new map were the string of towns where the most heated protests and confrontations had occurred. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698013482863">Clark (2008)</xref> writes, ‘Bowraville, Kempsey, Walgett and Moree constituted Australia’s geography of confrontation’ (p. 155). Also included was a typology of places in which practices of racial discrimination against Aboriginal people were most obvious and ‘concrete’. These included municipal swimming pools, war veterans’ clubs, hotels and cinemas – all semi-public sites of leisure and recreation in country towns. From these places, Aboriginal people were either completely excluded, or within them their presence was contained.</p>
<p>In her account, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750698013482863">Curthoys (2002)</xref> described the Freedom Ride as ‘both a local and international event’ (p. 292). Something she considered distinctly Australian about it was ‘the students’ focus on swimming pools … and picture theatres and hotels … [which] bespoke an interest in the democratic egalitarianism of public leisure spaces, and a genuine immersion in the easy enjoyment of life that such spaces promised’ (p. 293). No doubt the students’ interests influenced which places were targeted, but it is also true that there were only a handful of places in the towns visited that lent themselves to the dramatization of race relations and the photo opportunities that the leaders of the Freedom Ride used to expose discrimination and racism. Swimming pools, hotels and cinemas were the main contenders (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1750698013482863">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1750698013482863">2</xref>).</p>

<p>At local cinemas, Aboriginal people were routinely confined to the first rows of seats, closest to the screen, which were marked off from the rest of the cinema by a rope or low wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750698013482863">Calley, 1956/1957</xref>: 196). They had no choice but to sit in the cheap seats. If there was a balcony section, they were prohibited from sitting up there. Typically, Aboriginal people were required to enter a cinema by a side door and only after the lights had gone down. At hotels, Aboriginal people were generally barred from the front or public bars, although they might have been served in a back bar. Hotels and cinemas were privately owned and operated establishments, and the practices observed in them were by ‘convention’ rather than imposed by legislative prohibitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750698013482863">Byrne, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698013482863">Edmonds, 2012</xref>). Proprietors claimed that they had no choice but to segregate Aboriginal people for fear of losing their non-Aboriginal clientele. At some municipal swimming pools, which were operated by local council authorities, Aboriginal people were excluded altogether. Such exclusions had been written into council ordinances, which was the case at Moree, where the Freedom Ride staged a protest that met considerable opposition. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698013482863">Clark (2008)</xref> notes, ‘The segregated pool presented an ideal opportunity for direct action. The case was unambiguous and well known’ (p. 173).</p>
<p>It is worth remembering that many forms of discrimination that Aboriginal people experienced, including some of the most resented, were not so easily or directly exposed via the Freedom Ride’s mode of politics targeting spatial segregation. As Isabel Flick explained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750698013482863">Flick and Goodall, 2004</xref>) in her memoir, ‘I suppose being roped off in the picture theatre was one thing, but the police intimidation was the worst thing – just being hounded by the cops’ (p. 69). Within the context of the Freedom Ride, however, it was symbolically loaded instances of racial discrimination, like being ‘roped off’ at the cinema or barred from the swimming pool, which could conjure a more complex history. That symbolic weight resonates within later remembrances.</p>

<title>Spaces of memory: remembering sites of segregation</title>
<p>Sites of segregation strongly associated with the Freedom Ride constitute a landscape of memory in Aboriginal autobiographies and biographies, oral histories, visual art and films produced since the 1970s. These remembrances evoke personal experiences of segregation, at the same time as they remake the meanings of spaces in which segregation was practiced. As the examples discussed here show, through various acts of remembrance, these sites of segregation are reframed as contact zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750698013482863">Pratt, 1992</xref>), becoming microcosms in which histories of race relations are played out.</p>
<p>A series of paintings by Ngaku artist Robert Campbell Jnr created during the 1980s are a striking example of this. Just prior to the 1988 national bicentenary of European occupation, Campbell painted the swimming pool (<italic>Barred from Baths</italic>) and the picture theatre (<italic>Roped Off at the Picture Show I &amp; II</italic>) of his youth during the 1940s and 1950s in Kempsey, a town on the north coast of NSW through which the Freedom Ride had passed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1750698013482863">1</xref></sup> As Campbell himself puts it, ‘I am painting to show people – Aboriginal people, and even the whites – what truths took place in my lifetime: for example, being fenced off at the pictures …’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750698013482863">Foley and Mundine, 1992</xref>: 14).</p>
<p>In his paintings, the space of segregation, which is also the space of memory and ‘truth’, takes up the entire frame. This composition draws the viewer into these spaces. The figures, which Campbell paints in a distinctive style, all decorated with body paint and wearing red ties, distinguished from each other by their genitals, their hairstyles and the colour of their skin, all look out from the frame towards the viewer. Disconcertingly, some wave as though trying to attract attention and as though saying, ‘look at us, look at this!’ The viewer becomes implicated in the scene portrayed. What one begins to see is both the ways in which these spaces are occupied by black, white and ‘grey’ skinned figures, and that within them are barriers separating the white figures from the black and grey ones. The barrier illustrated in Campbell’s painting of the picture theatre is a thick, coiled rope separating the seats occupied by Aboriginal patrons from the remainder of the cinema exclusively occupied by white figures. White patrons alone occupy the balcony. At the swimming pool, it is a cyclone fence. The black figures stand outside it, looking in at the white figures in the pool. Each painting captures an uneasy mix of proximity and distance by portraying the almost claustrophobic space of race relations in twentieth-century Australia as simultaneously shared and segregated. There’s an awkward intimacy on display here.</p>
<p>In her discussion of <italic>Roped Off at the Picture Show II</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1750698013482863">Meaghan Morris (2006)</xref> described the painting as a ‘remarkably twisted space’ (p. 119) for the way in which perspectives are mixed, so that the cinema audience is simultaneously oriented towards the screen while facing sideways to look out (and to wave again) towards the viewer. A sidewall of the cinema has been removed so that one looks into the space of the cinema as though watching a drama play out on a stage. ‘Twisted space’ is a perfect description, not least because it is a metaphor that can be easily extended to the broader landscape and history of which these segregated cinemas were a part. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750698013482863">Denis Byrne (2003)</xref> has described the spatial dimensions of race relations as ‘nervous landscapes’, a description that captures the tensions within the intercultural zones in which Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people’s lives constantly overlap and intersect. They are ‘nervous’ also because they are always open to being subverted, their ‘numerous finely drawn boundaries’ able to be transgressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750698013482863">Byrne, 2003</xref>: 170).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750698013482863">Darlene Johnson’s (1996)</xref> short film <italic>Two Bob Mermaid</italic> captures beautifully the nervous tension inherent within these spaces. The story, which is based on Johnson’s mother’s memories, largely takes place at the local swimming pool, although the film also includes a scene set in the local cinema. The year is 1957. The swimming pool and the cinema are segregated, but Koorine, the adolescent Aboriginal girl whose story it is, gains access to these places by using the fairness of her skin to ‘pass’ as white. She hangs out in these places with her white friends, but her Aboriginal cousins and friends are always present as well, either standing behind the cyclone fence at the pool looking in, or sitting in the front rows at the cinema and being told by the usherette to ‘keep it down’ while Koorine watches with her white friends from further back.</p>
<p>The short film is a coming of age story infused with desire and longing and foreboding. Koorine dreams of become a swimming star, in the mode of Esther Williams whose film <italic>Million Dollar Mermaid</italic> is playing yet again at the cinema. Her Aboriginal mother queries her enthusiasm, saying, ‘Swimming – that’s for whitefellas. Ever seen a black swimming champion walking around?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750698013482863">Johnson, 1996</xref>). To block out the noise of her mother carousing with her boyfriend, lying in bed at night Koorine conjures up romantic images of her absent white father. And then there’s competition for her attention and affection from a white boy and an Aboriginal boy, which spills over into a fight at the pool triggering the point at which Koorine is impelled to make a decision about ‘racial loyalty’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750698013482863">Cowlishaw, 2004a</xref>: 114), about who she is and where she belongs. The drama’s denouement is enacted through a politics of recognition, when Koorine sees her mother looking at her through the pool fence.</p>
<p>Johnson has written movingly and powerfully about hearing her mother’s memories (the film’s inspiration) of playing at ‘passing’, trembling as she ‘speaks this “unspeakable” story’:<disp-quote>
<p>This story is told in an untranslatable language of memory, inflected with the pain of separation and the pleasure of successful ‘passing’. I listen for my mother’s breathing as she speaks to me in this mother tongue. Masquerading. Raging behind her own blackness. Wanting to not be seen and recognized as different. Passing for white. Playing the codes of exemption. Refusing the permanent boundaries of a fixed identity. But only grandma knew she was there, visible within the frame of whiteness, raging to death inside herself – ‘you are the kin of my skin you are’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750698013482863">Johnson, 1993</xref>: 22–23)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750698013482863">Johnson (1993)</xref> has inherited her mother’s memories, describing them as ‘the thread tracing through my body to the past’ (p. 23). In this powerful short film, the first she made, she remediates them, making them available to a new audience. Through these memories, the ordinary, everyday, municipal swimming pool becomes a stage for a different performance of race relations in assimilationist Australia. It is a space more mixed up, more twisted, more nervous, than ever. Not only are boundaries between ‘races’ shown as unstable but also racial identities themselves. ‘Passing’, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750698013482863">Johnson (1993)</xref> conceptualizes as itself a construction of identity, can ‘be understood as a refusal to adopt either a hybrid identity or a strict dichotomy between a white identity or an Aboriginal one. The concept of “passing” is more open, more complex and inherently unstable’ (p. 21). Johnson’s film, then, is an example of ‘deliberately subvert[ing] biologism in challenging and creative ways while affirming the significance of racial identities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698013482863">Cowlishaw, 2004b</xref>: 256).</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the assimilation era was a period in which Aboriginal people were constantly pressured to abandon their identity as Aboriginal in order to qualify for the privileges of citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750698013482863">McGregor, 2011</xref>). It is a difficult past to recall, tinged with tension and trauma, which Johnson hears in her mother’s remembrances – her fears of being exposed and shamed, her divided loyalties, the absence of her white father, her desires ridiculed. It is difficult to recall also because Aboriginal people who had chosen exemption, or played the codes of exemption, found themselves censured by the new young leaders of an Aboriginal politics built, from the 1970s onwards, around cultural nationalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750698013482863">McGregor, 2009</xref>: 351–352). In some ways, this history has been overshadowed by the public prominence of the Stolen Generations – of the history of Aboriginal children removed by government authorities from their families. However, it is part of the same past. Children not taken away were left to negotiate the nervous and hostile landscape of race relations. Johnson’s film makes it clear that much of the burden of living in these twisted spaces was borne by children and young people.</p>
<p>Similar memories and stories about the instability of racial identities in these twisted spaces have also emerged in remembrance about the Freedom Ride itself. Earlier in the 1990s, Rachel Perkins, the daughter of Charlie Perkins, the Aboriginal man who became the leader of the Freedom Ride, made a documentary film about it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750698013482863">Perkins, 1993</xref>). The documentary takes the form of a road trip, in which Charlie Perkins returns to some of the Freedom Ride’s sites of confrontation. At the Moree public baths, which had been the site of one of the most bitter protests, Perkins meets with a local man, Bob Brown, who had supported the students’ efforts in 1965 to desegregate the pool. Brown shares a memory about that protest, in which a young Aboriginal girl had been hauled away, like the others who were protesting that day, but it was her non-Aboriginal uncle who ejected her:<disp-quote>
<p>Yet he was her uncle […] he wouldn’t let her into the whites’ pool […] [that’s] the whole stupidity of the thing […] it was never as clear cut as black and white, a huge number of people in Moree are related. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750698013482863">Perkins, 1993</xref>)</p>

<p>These were not the stories that circulated in the media at the time the Freedom Ride passed through town, because the lines had to be drawn more starkly. However, they are part of later remembrances, both of the Freedom Ride itself and around the sites of segregation that made up the cartography of race relations it had revealed.</p>
<p>If playing at ‘passing’ is remembered as one way to resist exclusionary practices at the local swimming pool and cinema, then taking a defiant stand against them represents another. Examples of direct challenge – of taking the proprietor to task – are quite common in Aboriginal women’s autobiographical texts, especially of women who lived in rural NSW during the middle part of the twentieth century. An example appears in one of the earliest Aboriginal autobiographical texts, Ella Simon’s <italic>Through My Eyes</italic>, which was published in 1978. A similar memory is included in Isabel Flick’s collaboratively authored autobiographical text, <italic>Isabel Flick: The Many Lives of an Extraordinary Aboriginal Woman</italic>, published in 2004. Other examples have been published in between, including in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750698013482863">Patricia Davis-Hurst’s (1996)</xref> book <italic>Sunrise Station</italic>. These remembrances are told by women, and by women who were born in the early part of the twentieth century. Ella Simon was born in 1902, and Isabel Flick in 1928. They belong to the generation before Robert Campbell Jnr. who was born in 1944, or the girl depicted in Darlene Johnson’s film, who is about 13 years old or so in 1957. These women are adults, not children, in the past they are remembering.</p>
<p>While the locations are not the same, and different protagonists and players are involved, these autobiographical memory texts have some common features. Ella Simon’s memory relates how she and her husband Joe were given tickets to the movies at Forster by some white people they had worked for during the summer. They were, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1750698013482863">Simon (1995 [1978]</xref>), ‘a couple of the best tickets in the house’ (p. 182). However, when they took their seats, ‘the next thing we knew was the usher telling us we’d have to move because we weren’t allowed to sit there!’ There were seats at the front for Aboriginal people. Simon recalls challenging this, demanding the right to sit in the seats paid for. Not caring ‘what fuss she made’, Simon explains,<disp-quote>
<p>I refused to move and demanded to see the manager. But he wouldn’t come out and see me, oh no; I had to go out to his office. So I did, and I asked him for an explanation. You know, he told us the same thing; the roped off area was for us.</p>
<p>Well, that was just too much. I told him what I thought of him. He tried to wriggle out of it by saying that he didn’t want to lose other customers, but it was just all so weak. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1750698013482863">Simon, 1995 [1978]</xref>: 182)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Later in the book, she recounts that she had occasion to meet the proprietor again. He told her ‘that afterwards he had given instructions that Aboriginal people could sit where they liked and hang the regular customers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1750698013482863">Simon, 1995 [1978]</xref>: 187). In this way, Simon presents her action to refuse to give up her seat, and to confront the management about segregating Aboriginal people, as leading indirectly to the desegregation of the cinema.</p>
<p>Isabel Flick’s dramatic, somewhat cinematic, remembrance about racial segregation at the (misnamed) Liberty Theatre in Collarenebri, like Ella Simon’s, involves a face-to-face confrontation with the owner. And as in Ella Simon’s account, she too has to go to the manager to voice her complaint. However, it is a ‘confrontation’ that brings more immediate results. She is prompted to action by feeling hurt on behalf of her young sister and niece:<disp-quote>
<p>Now those girls wanted to go and watch <italic>Ben Hur</italic>, but they knew they were going to get pushed into the seats under the screen. And sure enough, the usher came up to them when they tried to sit in proper seats and said: ‘Come on you’ve got to move on. You’ve got to get in your black seats, where the ropes are’.</p>
<p>Now I was there and I felt hurt for their sake. I think that’s what prompted me to question that. I said to the usher: ‘Hang on, you bring your manager down here. Bring the boss down’. And he wasn’t able to do that, so I went up to the boss, Mark Cutler. And I stood in front of the ticket office and he said: ‘Look, I’ll talk to you in a minute’. For a while they didn’t want to react. So I kept standing there in front to the ticket office, and by then my sister-in-law Isobelle was there too. The two of us, making trouble!</p>
<p>And I said to this old fella at the ticket box: ‘I want you to come and fix this. Take these ropes off! What do you think we are? Our money is as good as anyone’s and we want to sit where we want to sit’. I was terrified when I stood up there, but I said: ‘Look, my sister and my niece go to the same church as you and we should be treated the same as everybody else’. And my poor little heart, I don’t know how it stayed in my chest, but it did. Even though I said it as calmly as I could, I was so sick in myself.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>And then old Mark Cutler could see I was just going to stand there and keep standing there. Sometimes I think if he’d waited just a little bit longer I’d have gone away. But then he said: ‘Oh, all right, you can sit anywhere then!’ And that’s what happened. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750698013482863">Flick and Goodall, 2004</xref>: 90–91)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This story occupies a pivotal place within the narrative arc of Isabel Flick’s life story, an instance in which she finds her ‘political’ voice, even as she fears censure from her peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750698013482863">Goodall, 2005</xref>: 77). In this remembrance, as in Ella Simon’s, the local cinema is a space through which to recall the ways in which Aboriginal women acted to bring about change to existing structures or situations – to attempt to rework the terms of inter-racial relations. These remembrances are not (just) accounts of past events. They are public performances of Aboriginal selves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750698013482863">Cowlishaw, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1750698013482863">Rowse, 2006</xref>). Within these particular autobiographical remembrances, it is difficult not to hear strains of the performative politics, the ‘dramatizing’ of race relations, that the Freedom Ride had used so effectively in these same towns, or nearby ones, to confront racial discrimination and inequality so that it could no longer be ignored.</p>
<p>Equally, these memory texts work to put one in mind of other images, ‘evoked rather than directly recruited’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1750698013482863">Schwarz, 2011</xref>: 140), of black women insisting on the right to sit wherever they choose. It is an example of transnational memory localized. Obliquely registered within these autobiographical texts are memories, incidents and figures associated with the Civil Rights struggle, but it would be a mistake to interpret them as direct translations. It is clear that these remembrances bear witness to the particularities – the awkward intimacies, the twisted spaces, the nervous landscapes – of race relations in small-town Australia even as they evoke other memories from other places.</p>
<p>Such autobiographical memories talk back to wider public forgetfulness or ‘wilful amnesia’ about the places and practices of racial segregation. The proliferation of Aboriginal people’s memories about racial segregation contrasts with the claim that it is something non-Aboriginal people have trouble recalling or facing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698013482863">Penelope Edmonds (2012)</xref>, for example, has recently asserted that ‘There has been a wilfully pervasive amnesia in Australia regarding the contested and racialized nature of cities and towns that persists well into the present’ (p. 167). Such ‘amnesia’ has been noted in Australian heritage landscapes, which barely register histories of racial segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750698013482863">Byrne, 2003</xref>). While cinemas or municipal swimming pools might be preserved for their heritage architectural values, historical interpretations are unlikely to reference earlier practices of racial segregation within them. Yet, for many Aboriginal people, as these remembrances witness, this is the primary association these places hold.</p>
<p>These places are, then, not simply former sites of segregation that are of historical interest only. They are sites of memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750698013482863">Nora, 1989</xref>) that encapsulate the dynamics of remembering and forgetting that Chris Healy has recently discussed in <italic>Forgetting Aborigines</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750698013482863">Healy (2008)</xref> is ‘concerned with the ways in which in the recent past, Aboriginal people and things have been remembered and forgotten in Australia’ (p. 9). This is a cross-cultural, inter-subjective social process in which shifting patterns of remembering and forgetting ‘work to produce indigenous and non-indigenous people in relation to each other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750698013482863">Healy, 2008</xref>: 4–5). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750698013482863">Marcia Langton (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750698013482863">Healy (2008)</xref> glosses this as the ‘intercultural space of “Aboriginality”’ (p. 5). He suggests that it might best be conceptualized in spatial terms as ‘a zone in the concrete sense of describing places and moments in which indigenous and non-indigenous people observe, interact and experiment in ways that make each other in relation to each other’ (p. 7). Sites of segregation are contact zones in both senses. They are places of actual relations and interactions, and of remembering and forgetting. This is what makes the study of sites of segregation/sites of memory so compelling.</p>
<p>What this all points towards is the complex and compacted relations between ‘the practices of memory and the practices of politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1750698013482863">Radstone and Schwarz, 2010</xref>: 3). Part of the Freedom Ride’s political achievement is, as I have suggested, what it contributed to enabling new modes of cultural production that rewrote and reinterpreted Australia’s history of race relations and Aboriginal dispossession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1750698013482863">McKenna, 2002</xref>: 157). Included in this is the powerful art, film and literature ‘emerging from the domain of Aboriginality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750698013482863">Healy, 2008</xref>: 22) that re-members the spaces of segregation that the Freedom Ride had originally traced. These remembrances are, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750698013482863">Gillian Cowlishaw (2004a)</xref> notes in another context, ‘cultural productions [that can] be conceived as a kind of political work. Aboriginal people have to labour hard to produce an alternative account of themselves and the world’ (pp. 85–86). This perhaps helps to explain why Isabel Flick was so insistent that a photograph of the Liberty Theatre appeared in her autobiography:<disp-quote>
<p>I said to my grandkids the other day: ‘Well, I won’t have much to leave you, but at least I’ll be able to leave you some part of my life’. In this book I want to make sure I’ve got a photo of the Liberty Theatre, because it’s one of the things that figured in changing my life, you know. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750698013482863">Flick and Goodall, 2004</xref>: 92)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A grainy photograph of the Liberty Theatre appears in the book – a witness both to the politics of the confrontation at the cinema and of its later remembrance as a dramatic story to make public and to hand on.</p>
