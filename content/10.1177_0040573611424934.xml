<p>In April 2011, Princeton Theological Seminary hosted the Fifth Annual Association of Charismatic and Theological Students Symposium. For the past five years, this organization has gathered major voices in Pentecostal studies for ecumenical discussions and scholarly exchange. The theme chosen for the 2011 symposium was “Woman-tology and the Future Face of Pentecostalism: History, Ministry, and Vocation for Pentecostal Woman.” Three essays in this edition, by Dr Kim Alexander, Rev. Andrew Hudson, and Dr David Roebuck, are proceeds from this event. Other conference participants included: Drs Cheryl Bridges Johns (Pentecostal Theological Seminary); Estrelda Alexander (Regent University); Edwin Aponte (New York Theological Seminary); Daniela Augustine (Lee University); Yolanda Pierce (Princeton Theological Seminary); Daniel Ramirez (University of Michigan); and Rev. Eric Williams (Ashland Theological Seminary). This time of deep conversation focused on three key issues: reclaiming the history of women’s participation in Pentecostalism; discussing the role of theology for women in the Pentecostal tradition; and thinking forward about the future of women’s leadership in global Pentecostalism.</p>
<p>Classical Pentecostalism, a global outpouring from the 1906 Azusa Street Revival, owes a debt to the leadership of women in ministry. This movement was a multi-racial and multi-generational mixture of men and women, largely from poor and working-class communities. Before the founding of distinct Pentecostal denominations, women were intimately involved in every aspect of this revival movement, serving as pastors, missionaries, lay leaders, and editors of early Pentecostal newspapers. Despite the only 100 years or so since Azusa Street, many of the important contributions of women to this movement’s success have been forgotten or lost to the historical record. This symposium was an opportunity to talk about current research efforts and scholarship devoted to telling the story of these courageous women, who helped to launch a movement that now represents half a billion Christian believers.</p>
<p>Many of these believers in the United States belong to one of several denominations with strong theological positions on women in ministry, the largest of which are the Assemblies of God, Church of God in Christ, and Church of God (Cleveland, TN). Like many of the mainline denominations, Pentecostal churches represent the full spectrum of theological positions, with some churches ordaining women for the pastoral role, others refusing to ordain women, and still others allowing for ordination at some, but not all, hierarchical ministry levels. Given the number of Pentecostal denominations founded by women, and their active involvement in Azusa Street and beyond, it was important to note that there is now a smaller percentage of ordained women in Pentecostal denominations than there was 50 years ago. Crucial to this conversation was a discussion about whether a feminist/womanist ethos is possible or necessary in Pentecostal theology.</p>
<p>The symposium concluded with thoughts about the future of women in Pentecostal churches, the status of current seminary and doctoral students called to vocations within a Pentecostal context, and the larger work of the Holy Spirit in Christendom. With this conversation taking place at a seminary of the Presbyterian Church (USA), it was crucial to discuss the role of pneumatology for all Christian believers, irrespective of denominational affiliation. Questions were raised about the work of the Holy Spirit in calling and shaping all Christians, and whether one can begin to grasp the fullness of the Triune God with sustained conversations about the Holy Spirit. And while these weighty questions were being explicitly discussed with specific reference to women, the implications were much broader.</p>
<p>Pentecostalism has shifted from a revival movement to a brick and mortar institution within the United States. Women have been an essential part of this ministry work beginning with the tent meetings in the Appalachian Mountains, to the multi-million dollar sanctuaries in almost every suburban American city. As we look to the future place of women in Pentecostalism, we must look to the Charismatic/Pentecostal movement in places like Africa, Asia, and South America. The next 100 years of historical and theological insight that will emerge from a non-Western context promises to be both a continuation and a critique of the first 100 years of Pentecostalism in America. Paying more attention to the lives and experiences of women scholars, pastors, and lay-leaders in Pentecostalism, especially those in the developing world, will paint a fuller picture of the changing Christian experience.</p>
