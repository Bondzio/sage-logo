<abstract>
<p>The Tea Parties are a right-wing populist movement echoing earlier episodes of white nationalism in the USA. Power elites have encouraged similar counter-subversion panics using populist rhetoric and producerist narratives to enlist a mass base to defend their unfair power, privilege, and wealth. Typically, a large, middle-class white constituency sides with organized wealth as a way to defend their relative and precarious position in society. The blame for economic, political, and social tensions is transferred away from free market capitalism to mythical conspiracies of collectivists, communists, labor bosses, and other scapegoated subversives and traitors. At the same time, defense of unequal racial and gender hierarchies can be mobilized as part of these counter-subversion efforts. Patriots, economic libertarians, Christian dominionists, militia activists, nativists, and ethnic nationalists fit under the Tea Party umbrella in an uneasy coalition ostensibly built around reversing the ‘big government’ policies of the Obama administration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The US Tea Party Movement began as an elite conservative campaign designed as ‘astroturfing’, which is a propaganda model that creates the false impression of an actual grassroots movement. The idea, however, gained momentum and swept across the country. The Tea Parties became an actual social movement, and by the autumn of 2009 were beginning to build social movement organizations in most states, and negotiate with the Republican Party over policy matters.</p>
<p>There are six major Tea Party national organizational factions: 1776 Tea Party, FreedomWorks Tea Party, ResistNet / Patriot Action Network, Tea Party Express, Tea Party Nation, and Tea Party Patriots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0896920511434750">Burghart and Zeskind, 2010</xref>). A large amount of early funding for Tea Party training and promotion came from Americans for Prosperity, run by the billionaire Koch brothers, David and Charles. The founder of the watchdog group Center for Public Integrity, Charles Lewis, told the <italic>New Yorker</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>The Kochs are on a whole different level. There’s no one else who has spent this much money. The sheer dimension of it is what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking, political manipulation, and obfuscation. I’ve been in Washington since Watergate, and I’ve never seen anything like it. They are the Standard Oil of our times. (Cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0896920511434750">Mayer, 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At first much of the energy for organizing the grassroots portion of the Tea Party movement came from libertarians and supporters of Ron Paul. Over time, participants in the pre-existing Christian Right and Patriot Movements emerged as playing an increasingly significant role in local units and chapters of the Tea Party movement. They brought into the Tea Parties racial antipathies towards people of color, and opposition to gay rights and reproductive rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0896920511434750">Clement and Green, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0896920511434750">Gardner and Thompson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0896920511434750">Keil and Keil, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-0896920511434750">Parker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-0896920511434750">Parker and Barreto, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>They also brought in a broader range of conspiracy theories than those promulgated by Ron Paul supporters. The Christian Right involvement in the Tea Party campaign to gain political power is related to the role of dominionism, a broad theological tendency of Christian nationalism that began growing in the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920511434750">Barron, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920511434750">Berlet and Quigley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0896920511434750">Clarkson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0896920511434750">Diamond, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0896920511434750">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0896920511434750">Goldberg, 2006</xref>). According to Diamond, ‘the concept that Christians are Biblically mandated to “occupy” all secular institutions has become the <italic>central unifying ideology</italic> for the Christian Right’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0896920511434750">1989</xref>: 138, italics in the original). For some Christians who embrace conspiracism, the devil is in the details, working behind the scenes like a fire-breathing chimera (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0896920511434750">Noebel, 1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-0896920511434750">1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-0896920511434750">1977</xref>) and especially his notable <italic>Communism, Hypnotism and the Beatles</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0896920511434750">1965</xref>).</p>
<p>Within several subcultures of the political right in the USA, such claims are common sense and received wisdom from a long line of authors whose books sit on the shelves of conservatives, economic libertarians, and right-wing Christian evangelicals. These tomes warn of the dangers of collectivists, banksters, the Federal Reserve, and organized labor bosses. For an example of this form of social Darwinism, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0896920511434750">Larson (2000)</xref>. For a critique, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0896920511434750">Hofstadter (1992 [1955])</xref>. At meetings the debate over dinner centers on who is really behind this awful conspiracy to destroy our nation. Is it the Bilderberg banking group, the Trilateral Commission, the Rockefeller family, the Freemasons and their Illuminati handlers, or the Jews? The debate generates many factoids and footnotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920511434750">Barkun, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0896920511434750">Goldberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0896920511434750">Hofstadter, 1965</xref>).</p>
<p>Conspiracy theories shift the blame away from the day-to-day actions of organized wealth defending its self-interest. In the USA using critical concepts such as capitalism or ruling class generally gets the critic labeled a pariah across much of the population. The spin doctors for organized wealth utilize the legacies of anti-communism to depreciate the value of collective efforts and a social safety net. This insulates the 1 percent from the 99 percent, except when movements such as Occupy Wall Street reframe the popular narrative about power.</p>
<p>When threats to organized wealth gain strength, one way to redirect the anger is to promote a counter-subversion panic targeting scapegoats accused of subversive conspiracies. When feeling confident of the protection of state power, organized wealth targets opponents of the status quo and critics of elected officials. When it wants domestic regime change, organized wealth targets the current political administration as part of the subversive plot. During the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR), a sector of organized wealth even attempted to mobilize right-wing veterans and other allies to assist an elite putsch to depose the President and replace him with the popular Marine General Smedley D Butler. Butler refused and went public, but a Congressional Committee buried a full probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920511434750">Archer, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr164-0896920511434750">Seldes, 1947</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr165-0896920511434750">Seldes and Seldes, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr172-0896920511434750">Spivak, 1935</xref>).</p>
<p>Reporting on the contemporary Tea Party movement has mentioned the largesse of the right-wing billionaire Koch brothers. The role of the ultra-conservative American Legislative Exchange Council in attempts to crush unions in Wisconsin and Ohio has been reported. The historic record shows this is standard operating procedure for organized wealth, yet this aspect of class continuity is seldom discussed outside the alternative media. In addition, contemporary liberal allies of organized wealth are attempting to redirect radical anger and calls for systemic change into the Democratic Party apparatus through funding mechanisms such as the Democracy Alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920511434750">Berlet, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0896920511434750">Flanders, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Tea Parties</title>
<p>When Tea Party activists hold government spending hostage they see themselves as patriots protecting America from financial ruin at the hands of tax-and-spend liberals in the Democratic Party. Congressional Town Halls ring with polemics charging that President Barack Obama is greasing a slippery slope of big government collectivism that will slurry the nation into an immoral cesspit of totalitarian tyranny. Signs appear at rallies comparing Obama to both Hitler and Stalin.</p>
<p>Socialism and National Socialism (Nazism) are portrayed by the Tea Party patriots and Town Hall criers as two sides of the same collectivist and totalitarian coin. This is the argument found in the best-selling book by Jonah <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0896920511434750">Goldberg (2007)</xref>, <italic>Liberal Fascism</italic>. According to Goldberg:<disp-quote>
<p>Today we still live under the fundamentally fascistic economic system established by Wilson and FDR. We do live in an ‘unconscious civilization’ of fascism, albeit of a friendly sort infinitely more benign that that of Hitler’s Germany, Mussolini’s Italy, or FDR’s America. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0896920511434750">2007</xref>: 330)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This idea traces back to Austrian School economist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr176-0896920511434750">Friedrich A Hayek (1944)</xref> in <italic>The Road to Serfdom</italic>. The Tea Parties accept this argument, and it is therefore logical for them to view destroying ‘big government’ as the first step in freeing the nation from the web of collectivism by that great agent of fascism, President Franklin D Roosevelt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511434750">Berlet, 2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511434750">2009c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920511434750">2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920511434750">2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>For the Tea Party Caucus in Congress the budget showdown in the summer of 2011 represented not only rolling back the ‘collectivist’ economic policies of FDR, but also ‘starving the beast’ of the federal government which is enforcing political correctness and multiculturalism. Specific Tea Party activists can use the economic argument to mask their anger at politicians who tolerate gay marriage, feminists, abortionists, black Presidents, and the wave of dark-skinned immigrants polluting our nation.</p>
<p>Grassroots Tea Party activists pick up bits and pieces of right-wing conspiracy theories and anti-immigrant xenophobia from a variety of sources, including xenophobic white nationalists and white supremacists attempting to recruit members from the Tea Parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0896920511434750">Burghart and Zeskind, 2010</xref>). Prejudice toward blacks and Latinos is significantly higher among Tea Party supporters than among the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-0896920511434750">Parker, 2010</xref>). When asked if ‘racism [is] still a major problem in America’, about 75 percent of those polled agreed, but that shrinks to about 58 percent among Tea Party supporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0896920511434750">Gardner and Thompson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In their study of the 2010 election races, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0896920511434750">Keil and Keil (2011)</xref> found that the candidates backed by the Tea Partiers ‘frequently used the code words long associated with negative evaluations and treatment of blacks – words such as school choice, states’ rights, personal responsibility, etc.’ The researchers speculated that ‘in some sense, then, the 2010 election was a racial referendum – a reaction by whites who wanted to take back their country from the usurpers who had won the 2008 election’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0896920511434750">2011</xref>: 12).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0896920511434750">Clement and Green (2011)</xref> found that Tea Party supporters ‘tend to have conservative opinions not just about economic matters, but also about social issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage’. Some 42 percent ‘said they agree with the conservative Christian movement’, and they are ‘much more likely than registered voters as a whole to say that their religion is the most important factor in determining their opinions on these social issues’.</p>
<p>After reviewing the websites of 137 ‘Tea Party backed candidates’ who in 2010 sought election to the House of Representatives, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0896920511434750">Keil and Keil (2011)</xref> found that ‘one of the most common themes … among the Tea Party candidates was that they were overwhelmingly pro-life’. They opposed abortion and most also supported the ‘traditional family’ and ‘traditional marriage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0896920511434750">2011</xref>: 3).</p>

<sec id="section3-0896920511434750">
<title>Populism and Producerism</title>
<p>In reviewing scores of Tea Party websites it becomes clear that the movement is built around populist rhetorical framing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0896920511434750">Canovan (1981)</xref> writes that all forms of populism ‘involve some kind of exaltation of and appeal to “the people,” and all are in one sense or another anti-elitist’. While some forms of populism are progressive, others are right-wing.</p>
<p>In our book <italic>Right-Wing Populism in America</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511434750">2000</xref>) Matthew N Lyons and I traced the roots of the right-wing populist frame back to 1676 and Bacon’s Rebellion in the Virginia Colony. We argued that the 1990s ‘Christian Right, the Buchananites, and the militias, were the heirs to this legacy that included the Jacksonian period of the mid-1800s, anti-Chinese crusades of the 1880s, Father Coughlin’s movement in the 1930s which turned antisemitic, and various eras of Ku Klux Klan activism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511434750">2000</xref>: 2). We suggested these and other right-wing populist movements often borrowed:<disp-quote>
<p>political slogans, tactics, and forms of organization from the Left, but harness them to rightist goals. They attract people who often have genuine grievances against elites, but channel such resentments in ways that reinforce social, cultural, political, or economic power and privilege. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511434750">2000</xref>: 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Right-wing populist movements throughout US history ‘have reflected the interests of two different kinds of social groups’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511434750">2000</xref>: 2) that can combine in creative ways that resonate with mass constituencies:<disp-quote>
<p>middle-level groups in the social hierarchy, notably middle- and working-class Whites, who have a stake in traditional social privilege but resent the power of upper-class elites over them, and, ‘Outsider’ factions of the elite itself, who sometimes use distorted forms of antielitism as part of their own bid for greater power. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511434750">2000</xref>: 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Tea Party movement also uses the classic ‘producerist’ narrative of right-wing populism. The producerist storyline claims that heroic ‘productive’ middle-class stalwarts are defending themselves against the squeezing vise grip of corrupt parasitic elites above and lazy, sinful and subversive parasites below. Producerism starts as an agrarian economic narrative in the 1800s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr173-0896920511434750">Stock, 1996</xref>). Now it sweeps up people from cities and suburbs as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511434750">Berlet and Lyons, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0896920511434750">Kazin, 1995</xref>). Marxist analysis of political economy analyzes systems, structures, and institutions of power through the lens of class. So do other forms of power structure analysis. Producerist populism individualizes societal problems – converting angry energy into a misdirected hunt for the dread menace of conspirators and parasites.</p>
<p>To understand why the Tea Party agenda is common sense when viewed from inside the movement, we have to revisit the framing of right-wing conspiracy theories searching out subversion in the land of the free and the home of the brave.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0896920511434750">
<title>Framing the Conspiracy</title>
<p>Many of the negative claims about Obama flowing out of the Tea Parties are based on historic conspiracy theories about subversion and betrayal by political liberals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920511434750">Berlet, 2010b</xref>). Some of these conspiracy theories are recycled from the militia and Patriot movements of the 1990s. Others were originally aimed at George W Bush from the right, including claims of eroding sovereignty made by right-wing ideologues including Jerome Corsi, Phyllis Schlafly, and Pat Buchanan. For a time, these conspiracy theories were repeated and amplified by Lou Dobbs on CNN before he was terminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511434750">Berlet, 2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920511434750">2010b</xref>). Fox News helps encourage the growth of the Tea Parties while heaping abuse on critics of the movement. When Glenn Beck was on Fox News, his program frequently sported conspiracy theories that previously had been circulated by the conspiracist John Birch Society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr182-0896920511434750">Zaitchik, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The idea that ‘cultural Marxism’ is behind the grand conspiracy has spread across a range of right-wing constituencies. There is even a video, <italic>Cultural Marxism: The Corruption of America</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0896920511434750">2011</xref>), featuring right-wing libertarian Ron Paul, paleoconservative xenophobe Pat Buchanan, conspiracy icon G Edward Griffin, Christian media critic Ted Baehr, and gold-manipulation monetary conspiracist Edwin Vieira. The theory primarily was popularized by the Christian Right Free Congress Foundation (FCF), especially by William <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0896920511434750">Lind (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0896920511434750">2007)</xref> and FCF’s leader, Paul Weyrich. Lind’s version of the conspiracy theory veered into racism and anti-Semitism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0896920511434750">Lind, 2003 [1999]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0896920511434750">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0896920511434750">2007</xref>), as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511434750">Berkowitz (2003)</xref>.</p>
<p>Right-wing media trickster Andrew Breitbart promoted the idea that ‘Cultural Marxism is political correctness, it’s multiculturalism, and it’s a war on Judeo-Christianity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0896920511434750">Media Matters, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0896920511434750">Neiwert, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0896920511434750">Lembke (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0896920511434750">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0896920511434750">2010)</xref> has documented the common historic frame picturing liberals as subversives and traitors, as detailed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-0896920511434750">Philion (2004)</xref>. Some on the political left (including some Pacifica Radio stations and Project Censored) have picked up these conspiracy theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920511434750">Barkun, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920511434750">Berlet, 1994 [1990]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511434750">2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511434750">2009c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0896920511434750">Goldberg, 2001</xref>) especially from Fletcher Prouty’s <italic>The Secret Team</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-0896920511434750">1973</xref>), and the <italic>American Free Press</italic> newspaper.</p>
<p>From the colonial Salem witch hunts, to the anti-Catholic nativism of the 1800s, to the Palmer raids of 1919–20, to the 1950s McCarthy-era Red Scare, to the Tea Parties of today, the hunt for subversion is built around conspiracy theories. Those seeking to expose the conspiracy build movements to counter the alleged subversion.

<p>Blaming hard times as being the result of the secret conspiracy is a time-honored tradition, and conspiracy theories function as a narrative form of scapegoating. Today, most right-wing conspiracy theories can be traced to two main sources published in the late 1700s. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr154-0896920511434750">Robison (1967 [1798])</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511434750">Barruel (1995 [1797–8])</xref> blamed revolutionary ardor to establish civil equality and to separate church and state on a secret conspiracy working inside the Freemasons. The core cadre were said to be the mysterious Illuminati which was an actual pro-Enlightenment study group that functioned for several years in Bavaria. The John Birch society still promotes this version of the conspiracy. This is the generic conspiracist narrative.</p>
<p>The other main conspiracist narrative is based on anti-Semitic allegations. In the 1800s blaming economic problems on the Jews was relatively common and considered appropriate text for major newspapers and magazines in the USA. When the People’s Party, composed primarily of progressive populists, began to devolve, some factions adopted conspiracy theory analysis dividing their scapegoated targets between the oil trusts and Jewish bankers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0896920511434750">Davis, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0896920511434750">Hofstadter, 1965</xref>). During this same period, August Bebel called anti-Semitic conspiracy theories the ‘socialism of fools’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0896920511434750">1</xref></sup> Bebel, a social democrat, was trying to get German workers to pay attention to the structural inequalities of the economic system rather than scapegoating Jewish financiers and bankers. As David Hirsh observes, the formal study of sociology emerged at a time in the 1800s when it was common to believe that a nation’s economy was manipulated by ‘the Jews’ and some intellectuals began to articulate more accurate and useful analytical models (2009, personal communication).</p>

<title>Counter-Subversion Panics</title>
<p>The fear of the Red Menace in some ultraconservative Protestant circles was fueled by apocalyptic biblical prophecy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920511434750">Boyer, 1992</xref>). The term ‘apocalypse’ simply means the idea that there is an approaching confrontation of epic proportions after which the world will be changed forever and hidden truths will be revealed. A number of Protestant evangelicals and fundamentalists have historically connected apocalyptic prophecies in the Bible’s book of Revelation to current political and social events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920511434750">Boyer, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511434750">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0896920511434750">Fuller, 1995</xref>). For example the evil antichrist is prophesied as the sidekick of Satan in Revelation. Fuller notes that naming the antichrist by pointing at real life political figures became something of a historic American ‘obsession’ in certain Christian circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0896920511434750">1995</xref>: 13).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0896920511434750">Donner (1980)</xref> helped develop the concept of right-wing populist movements built around a counter-subversive impulse. According to Donner, the ‘anti-subversive impulse’ popularized the concept of the Red Menace, acquiring a ‘folkish’ aspect. Some in the Christian Right from the 1920s forward saw this in terms of apocalyptic prophecy about the End Times. Therefore ‘God-fearing Americans’ saw Marxism as the ideology that would be used by the ‘Antichrist come to do eschatological battle with the children of light.’ A more secular variant emerged in ‘rural and small-town America’ in which ‘decent upright folk’ would need to confront ‘radicalism – alien, satanic, immorality incarnate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0896920511434750">1980</xref>: 47–48).

<p>In the late 1800s, fear of communist subversion ‘was being developed as a weapon to isolate labor organizations and control the untamed urban masses’, writes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0896920511434750">Heale (1990</xref>: 27).

<p>After a major 1877 railway strike, the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher warned against the importation of communist ideas from Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0896920511434750">2</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0896920511434750">Heale (1990)</xref> notes the popular preacher thought ‘“un-American” the idea that government should provide for the welfare of its citizens’.

<p>Up until the Roosevelt administration, laissez-faire economic policies were the ‘conventional wisdom’ being taught at Harvard and other universities where theorists ‘insisted that workers benefited from the free enterprise of the capitalist, that trade unions were potential monopolies that disrupted the free market, and that labor actions like strikes were offenses against society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0896920511434750">1990</xref>: 28).</p>
<p>Just before the Great Depression, the presidential campaign focused on whether or not the government should directly develop policies and programs promoting economic fairness and social justice. Unions and most working people backed this concept and thus supported the candidacy of Democrat Franklin D Roosevelt. FDR faced the incumbent President, Herbert Hoover, whose 1928 Republican campaign speech on ‘rugged individualism’ left no doubt where he stood on the question.</p>
<p>Hoover claimed that during World War I, in order to ensure the ‘preservation of the State the Government became a centralized despotism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0896920511434750">Hoover, 1928</xref>). After the war the nation was faced with the choice of the American system – ‘rugged individualism’ – or the choice of a European system of diametrically opposed doctrines – doctrines of paternalism and state socialism. The acceptance of these ideas meant the destruction of self-government through centralization of government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0896920511434750">Hoover, 1928</xref>). Hoover argued that the proposals of FDR would ‘wreck our democracy’ and weaken the ‘foundations of social and spiritual progress in America’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0896920511434750">Hoover, 1928</xref>).</p>
<p>After his inauguration in 1933, FDR slapped laissez-faire elites in the face with his visible hand when he launched a number of massive and controversial federal government programs to restore the economy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0896920511434750">3</xref></sup> Over the next two decades, the conservative elites and their ideologues slapped back, handing out millions of dollars in pamphlets, advertisements, movies, and books equating the defense of democracy and the ‘American Way of Life’ with restoring ‘Free Market’ government policies. Ringleaders included the US Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), but they were hardly alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-0896920511434750">Phillips-Fein, 2009</xref>). In Europe, conservative ideologues also bemoaned creeping socialism (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr177-0896920511434750">Von Hayek et al., 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr178-0896920511434750">Von Mises, 1936</xref>). These ideas were exchanged with their colleagues in the USA, and both Von Hayek and Von Mises came to the USA and helped forge the ‘Chicago School’ of economics later favored by President Reagan.</p>
<p>The anti-socialist crusade built to oppose the policies of FDR forged an alliance between the ideological Free Marketeers and the theologues of the Christian Right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511434750">Berlet and Lyons, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-0896920511434750">Ricca, 2002</xref>). The latter worried that big government and big labor union ‘collectivism’ threatened the social contract, the radical individualism of unrefined Calvinism, and the proper relationship between the godly individual and both church and state. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr180-0896920511434750">Weber (2000 [1905])</xref> analyzed this tendency.</p>
<p>While publicly praising civic participation, many of these same conservative and libertarian ideologues tried to curtail or crush labor unions as a form of ‘collectivism’ just as detrimental to democracy as those ‘European’ collectivist schemes: socialism and National Socialism. Thus, today President Obama is said to be both a socialist and a fascist – both Hitler and Stalin. Back in the 1930s FDR was also tarred by conservatives for bringing socialist and fascist ideas into the political economy of the USA. Some critics were even more histrionic.</p>
<p>Among the many critics of the Roosevelt administration are those conspiracists who scapegoat it as the puppet of secret liberal collectivists, or Reds, or Jews, or all three (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511434750">Berlet and Lyons, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0896920511434750">Davis, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920511434750">Dinnerstein, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0896920511434750">Kazin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0896920511434750">Kovel, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr152-0896920511434750">Ribuffo, 1983</xref>).

<title>Rollback Using the Right to Work Frame</title>
<p>In July of 1935 Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act, which is also called the Wagner Act to honor Senator Robert R Wagner of New York. The Act sought to ensure that working people had the right ‘to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid and protection’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr175-0896920511434750">US Congress, 1935</xref>).</p>
<p>In part to avoid another negative ruling from the US Supreme Court, the Act specifically applied only to employees working for companies involved in interstate commerce. Those working for the government, airlines, and railroads were exempted from coverage, as were agricultural workers. ‘In order to enforce and maintain those rights, the act included provision for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to arbitrate deadlocked labor-management disputes, guarantee democratic union elections, and penalize unfair labor practices by employers’ (Beschloss and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0896920511434750">National Archives, 2006</xref>: 162).</p>
<p>Immediately upon passage of the National Labor Relations Act, ‘business and political conservatives’ sought legislation to undercut union organizing, especially in the period 1938–41 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0896920511434750">Gall, 1988</xref>: 14). Gall writes:<disp-quote>
<p>Lobbyists of the National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce argued that Congress should change the law to prohibit ‘coercion from any source.’ They obviously hoped that such a clause would function as a mandatory open shop provision under statutory interpretation, making it impossible for unions to obtain union security through bargaining. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0896920511434750">1988</xref>: 14–15)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Opposition to these proposed restrictive laws that were aimed at weakening unions and worker’s rights came from both Republicans and Democrats, and it became a campaign issue in 1936. Presidential candidates from both major political parties offered support for the concept of the union shop as authorized in the National Labor Relations Act.</p>
<p>‘Open shop’ campaigns are sometimes based on arguments for states’ rights – an idea that comes with some historic baggage. The primary source of states’ rights philosophy in US politics is the antebellum south of the early- to mid-1800s. John C Calhoun formulated the main arguments, and delivered them in flamboyant oratory during a historic debate with fellow US Senator Daniel Webster over the issue of states’ rights and their relationship to slavery. The philosophical battle over states’ rights fueled southern succession and helped pave the road to the Civil War.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, appeals to white supremacy and white racial solidarity were hardly marginal. In an editorial highlighting a speech by NAM president John E Edgerton, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0896920511434750"><italic>New York Times</italic> (1930)</xref> editorialized, ‘To aid him and his associates in their effort to maintain the open shop he has the racial and language unity of [employees] and employers in the South, and the pressure of long custom.’</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0896920511434750">Edgerton (1930)</xref> claimed, in the South, ‘The wage-earners, like the employers of this section, are almost wholly of one blood, one God, and one language … No people on earth love individual liberty, or will make greater sacrifices for it, than … those proud Anglo-Saxon elements who constitute the working army of this homogeneous section of the nation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0896920511434750">Edgerton, 1930</xref>: 6). Edgerton was outlining NAM’s proposed ‘Labor Policy for The South’, which was based on ‘The open shop – the unabridged and unrestricted freedom of contract, and complete individual liberty within the law’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0896920511434750">1930</xref>: 11).</p>
<p>In some portions of the hard right the problems posed by labor unions, communism, and integration were discussed as a single topic. In part this derived from the fact that the Roosevelt Administration designed government programs that selected African Americans and other people of color for training and jobs.</p>
<p>During the war years, right-to-work legislation went nowhere on the federal level, and the focus shifted to the state level where a variety of legislative battles were waged. In the ‘period from 1938 to 1944, numerous states passed harsh and sometimes punitive laws restricting union behavior’ and ‘some of the laws simply aimed to harass unions’, says <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0896920511434750">Gall (1988</xref>: 19).There was a major emphasis on restricting union security arrangements, and regulations concerning picketing or strikes, although ‘much of this state anti-union legislation proved unconstitutional in those areas affecting interstate commerce’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0896920511434750">Gall, 1988</xref>: 19).</p>
<p>After the end of World War II and the death of President Franklin D Roosevelt, however, the ultraconservatives developed plans to ‘roll back’ the economic fairness and social justice policies of the Roosevelt Administration. Along with this strategy for unweaving the government social safety net were parallel plans to discourage workers from joining labor unions. ‘Right-to-work’ legislation returned on the federal level and headed to Congress.</p>
<p>Ultraconservatives remained undaunted. On Labor Day 1941, with the US entry into World War II seeming to be increasingly inevitable and just weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor would plunge the nation into war, an editorial appeared in the <italic>Dallas Morning News</italic>. ‘The greatest crisis that confronts the nation today,’ wrote editor William B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-0896920511434750">Ruggles (1975 [1941])</xref>, ‘is the domestic issue of the right to work as a member of a labor union, if the individual so elects ... or without membership in an organized union’.

The drive to pass federal legislation, however, was put on hold until the end of World War II, and it coincided with the turmoil created in the shift from a wartime economy and the return of veterans to peacetime work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0896920511434750">Lichtenstein, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0896920511434750">2003 [1982]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0896920511434750">Nicholson, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The Taft-Hartley Act was primarily a series of pro-management amendments to the National Labor Relations Act. The National Association of Manufacturers still considers the passage of Taft-Hartley one of its crowning achievements. In its written history, the group brags that ‘NAM played a leading role in the 1947 enactment, overriding President Harry Truman’s veto, of the Taft-Hartley Act, which served to level the playing field in labor relations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0896920511434750">National Association of Manufacturers, circa 2005</xref>; for details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0896920511434750">Burch, 1973</xref>).

<p>Throughout the period after World War II the anti-New Deal rollback campaign flourished.

<p>The attack on labor unions as subversive had its supporter inside the US Congress. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920511434750">Bennett (1995 [1988])</xref> explains that the House Committee on Un-American Activities under Chairman Martin Dies in the early 1940s became a vehicle for an ‘anti-communist, anti-union, and anti-New Deal’ campaign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920511434750">1995 [1988]</xref>: 286).</p>
<p>The National Association of Evangelicals, founded in 1942, also ‘assailed the revolutionary activities of the New Deal and the infiltration of government, the unions, and churches by reds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0896920511434750">Fuller, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0896920511434750">Heale, 1990</xref>: 139). This type of attack lasted well into the 1950s. For Catholics, anti-Red fear mongering took the form of warnings from church leaders such as Francis Cardinal Spellman and Bishop Fulton J Sheen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920511434750">Bennett, 1995 [1988]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0896920511434750">Heale, 1990</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0896920511434750">Diamond (1995)</xref>, the ‘internal subversion thesis and the view of liberalism as merely a soft form of communism provided the logic for Christian Rightists’ attacks on reputable Church bodies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0896920511434750">1995</xref>: 102). This was incorporated into what is called ‘spiritual warfare,’ which provided a justification for Christian Right participation in the New Right coalition beginning in the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0896920511434750">Diamond, 1989</xref>).</p>

<title>McCarthyism and the New Red Scare</title>
<p>Business Nationalists can package states’ rights as ‘Americanism’. In 1950 Claude A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr150-0896920511434750">Putnam (1950)</xref>, president of the National Association of Manufacturers wrote:<disp-quote>

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr150-0896920511434750">1950</xref>: iv)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Putnam wanted to ‘restore the historic balance of power between central and state governments’ by ‘transferring back to the states various service responsibilities which they can and should assume’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr150-0896920511434750">1950</xref>: iv). Putnam wrote this in his foreword to the NAM book <italic>Bring Government Back Home! A Program for the Re-Allocation of Tax Resources and Service Responsibilities Between Federal and State Governments</italic>, by Harely L <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0896920511434750">Lutz (1950)</xref>. ‘Bring Government Back Home’ is a slogan used today by various right-wing groups concerned with the size of government.</p>
<p>The most visible figure of the 1950s Red Scare was Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0896920511434750">Navasky, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr161-0896920511434750">Schrecker, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr162-0896920511434750">1998</xref>). McCarthy targeted the State Department, with a goal of weeding out ‘the whole group of twisted-thinking New Dealers’ who he claimed had ‘led America to near ruin at home and abroad’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0896920511434750">Goldman, 1960 [1956]</xref>: 144). McCarthy also worried about communist influence in the labor movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-0896920511434750">Oshinsky, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>In the broadest sense, the post-war Red Scare and the McCarthy period ran from 1946 to 1954 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0896920511434750">Goldstein, 1978</xref>). During this period, the unions, the mainstream churches, and agencies of the federal government itself were all under attack. The New Deal, unions, Social Security, government regulations, groups of people who did not know their ‘proper place’ in society – all were framed by ultraconservatives as part of a collectivist conspiracy to weaken America.</p>
<p>The National Association of Manufacturers, US Chamber of Commerce, and US Business and Industry Council had helped create the Red Scare of the McCarthy period. As they backed away from the racist and hyperbolic Christian American Association, another outfit emerged to play a coordinating role in the anti-union network: the DeMille Foundation for Political Freedom, founded in 1945.</p>
<p>The DeMille Foundation was not as shrill as the Christian American Association, but it too became enmeshed in the Red Scare and supplied names to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0896920511434750">Navasky, 1980</xref>). Cecil B DeMille tied himself to the fortunes of the witch hunts when in 1950 he tried, and failed, to impose a loyalty oath on members of the Screen Directors Guild in Hollywood, in part in response to the publication of blacklisting guides such as <italic>Red Channels</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511434750">Archerd, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920511434750">Brady, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0896920511434750">Mitchell, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of private groups were set up to monitor communist influences in the media, with special attention to theatre, film, radio, and television. Some fraternal organizations and veterans’ organizations issued educational materials on subversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0896920511434750">Heale, 1990</xref>). There were also ‘patriotic’ women’s groups such as the Minutewomen that sought to warn of subversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr160-0896920511434750">Scher, 1995</xref>). The ultraconservative Church League of America attacked mainline Protestant denominations, but also kept a huge collection of files on subversives. For a fee, employers could have the files searched to see if a prospective employee had ‘subversive’ sympathies or would be a ‘troublemaker’ or ‘radical’ in the workplace. The more secular American Security Council originally offered a similar blacklisting service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0896920511434750">Donner, 1980</xref>). That this search was meant to ferret out union sympathizers seems obvious.</p>
<p>Although many events of the Red Scare received widespread publicity, McCarthyism was not a large grassroots populist movement. It was primarily a power struggle within ‘the nation’s governing elites’, involving ‘a concerted campaign by a loosely structured, but surprisingly self-conscious, network of political activists who had been working for years’ to rid America of what they saw as communist subversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr162-0896920511434750">Schrecker, 1998</xref>: xiii). As we have seen, this ultraconservative network overlapped substantially with the anti-union alliance.</p>
<p>McCarthy finally went too far in attacks on the US Army, and in 1954 McCarthy was condemned in a Senate vote and quickly vanished from the political limelight. Hyperbolic anti-communism rapidly lost much of its public appeal. In order to carry on the campaign against collectivism of any sort, ultraconservative groups such as the American Security Council and the Foreign Policy Research Institute were established the next year – along with the National Right to Work Committee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0896920511434750">McCune et al., 1962</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0896920511434750">1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr158-0896920511434750">Sanders, 1962</xref>).</p>
<p>Ultraconservatives, especially elitist libertarians, still denounce the National Labor Relations Act. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-0896920511434750">Sennholz (1975)</xref> writes that by passing the Act, ‘the U.S. thereby abandoned a great achievement of Western civilization, equality under the law’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-0896920511434750">1975</xref>: 212–213 ). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr151-0896920511434750">Reed (1998)</xref> and other conservatives still cite Sennholz and contend that Roosevelt’s handling of the Depression made it worse, not better.</p>

<title>Communism, Collectivism, and Culture Wars</title>
<p>After World War II, right-wing movements split into two forms of anti-communism: generic and anti-Semitic.</p>
<p>In the generic mode were groups including the Christian Right group the Christian Freedom Foundation (CFF), established in 1950. In CFF propaganda, social security was described as ‘the older generation stealing from the younger’, the income tax is branded as ‘communist doctrine’, labor unions are described as ‘stemming from Socialism’, and foreign aid is pilloried as subsidization of ‘Socialistic schemes and experiments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0896920511434750">Forster and Epstein, 1964</xref>: 267). The primary funders of CFF were the Pew family of Sun Oil wealth. CFF leaders served on the board of the National Right to Work Committee (NRTWC), founded in 1955. Fred A Hartley – the same Hartley who co-sponsored the anti-union Taft-Hartley Act in 1947 – became the first president of the NRTWC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0896920511434750">Forster and Epstein, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0896920511434750">Gall, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr157-0896920511434750">Saloma, 1984</xref>: 53–54).</p>
<p>The John Birch society (founded in 1958 and functioning by 1959) warned of creeping collectivism as a form of communist subversion being peddled in America by political liberals who are either witting or unwitting agents of Marxist totalitarianism with the assistance of the Illuminati (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0896920511434750">Mintz, 1985</xref>). Oil magnate Fred Koch, father to David and Charles who fund Tea Party training, was a founding member of the John Birch Socety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0896920511434750">Mayer, 2010</xref>). Corporations ‘were spending an estimated $25 million per year on anti-communist literature’ by 1963, with some circulating ‘print and audio-visual materials produced by the John Birch Society’ writes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0896920511434750">Diamond (1995</xref>: 52). John Birch Society founder Robert Welch first served on the board of the National Association of Manufacturers.</p>
<p>The Liberty Lobby, founded by Willis Carto, promoted the anti-Semitic version of the subversive conspiracy but often cloaked their bigotry in obscure coded rhetoric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0896920511434750">Mintz, 1985</xref>). A classic purveyor of the anti-Semitic genre is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511434750">Beaty (1951)</xref>, who in <italic>The Iron Curtain over America</italic> blamed a ‘Khazar’ conspiracy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511434750">Bendersky (2000)</xref> notes that anti-Semitism found a safe base inside sectors of the US military officer corps. For example Marine Corps General Pedro del Valle ‘believed that an "invisible government" of international Jews controlled America and worked in conjunction with their co-conspirators in Russia. As late as 1962, the General still touted <italic>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511434750">2000</xref>: from caption on illustration page preceding page 367).</p>
<p><italic>Fourth Reich of the Rich</italic> by Des Griffin (1978) is another book that implicated the Jews in the conspiracy of secret elites. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr168-0896920511434750">Singerman (1982)</xref> summarizes the theme of the Griffin book as alleging that ‘<italic>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</italic> are a Satan-inspired, Illuminist blueprint for the systematic destruction of civilization, all government and religion, and the establishment of a One-World totalitarian dictatorship’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr168-0896920511434750">1982</xref>: 317–318).</p>
<p>The struggle against the demonized enemy can be cast as a plot in which political leftists and liberals take their marching orders from nefarious secret elites or communist cadres, or from communist cadres in league with nefarious secret elites on behalf of Satan. Add to this an additional dimension of conspiracist thinking in which race, religion, and gender issues are woven into the fabric of the conspiracy theory in different combinations.</p>

<title>The Culture War as a Leftist Conspiracy</title>
<p>Within the broad projects of the Christian Right, Christian cultural conservatives are allied with Christian economic conservatives who base their view of proper political economy on the Austrian school of economics, especially on Friedrich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr176-0896920511434750">von Hayek (1944)</xref> and Ludwig <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr178-0896920511434750">von Mises (1936</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr179-0896920511434750">1960)</xref>, and their contemporaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr177-0896920511434750">Von Hayek et al., 1935</xref>).</p>
<p>By the late 1970s the social traditionalists in the Christian Right had shifted to a broader cultural analysis that blamed the rise of secular humanism for the erosion of America as a Christian nation. Marsden traced the shift in focus from communism to a more generic secular humanist demon, writing that it ‘revitalized fundamentalist conspiracy theory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0896920511434750">1991</xref>: 109).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The actions of the power elites of organized wealth can be traced from FDR’s New Deal, through the McCarthy Period, to the creation of the New Right in the 1970s, to the election of President Reagan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511434750">Burch, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0896920511434750">1997a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0896920511434750">1997b</xref>). At various times, sectors of the power elite assist mass movements they see as helping solidify their power.</p>
<p>Research has shown that a person’s actual status of employment or income does not inevitably lead to participation in mass movements, ethno-nationalist groups or ethno-violence. Yet actual or feared job loss or a decline in economic status is often found in studies of ethno-nationalist group membership and those who participate in ethno-violence. Something more complicated is involved here and needs more scholarship. Studies since the 1990s have teased out a role for economic competition and anxiety coupled with other factors in prompting ethnic conflict promoted by the political right, but until the work of Rory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0896920511434750">McVeigh (2009)</xref>, no over-arching coherent explanation for this emerged from within sociology.</p>
<p>McVeigh’s ‘power devaluation model’ is a useful tool to understand why right-wing movements behave differently from left-wing movements in certain respects. McVeigh argues that it is shifts in power dynamics and hierarchies in economic, political, and social spheres that launch the processes in which right-wing groups attract members and sometimes a mass base large enough to intrude into the larger society. According to McVeigh, the resource mobilization and political process models work better with left-wing movements and movements in which relatively oppressed groups are seeking equality or liberation. Using as his analytical example the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), McVeigh demonstrates that the right-wing KKK in the 1920s was composed of white people attempting to defend their relatively more privileged position in the social, political, and economic life of their communities. Some analysts refer to this middle-class constituency as the ‘precariat’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0896920511434750">Disch, 2010</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0896920511434750">Ehrenreich, 1989</xref>).</p>

<p>The genius of conservative leadership was that they were able to take all this anger about sexual freedom and desegregation and put the blame on two enemies: Democrats and the federal government. Democrats were blamed for society getting ‘out of control’ and the federal government’s role in enforcing women’s rights and desegregation made them an easy target. Once these villains were established, all this right-wing populist anger could be pointed towards generic goals of big business Republicans. If you hate the federal government for enforcing the Civil Rights Act, it’s easy enough to start hating them for levying taxes, especially if you can be convinced those taxes are going to welfare to pay for what you believe is immoral behavior, such as single motherhood. If you hate the Supreme Court for Roe v. Wade, it’s easy to get you to support putting more conservative justices up there who will routinely vote for business interests.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Tea Partiers are part of a long series of right-wing populist movements that mobilize the white middle class and working class in the USA. When they fade away, the power elites will flex the muscles of organized wealth. Some of them will promote a new mass movement to defend their class interests. Whatever that mass right-wing movement is called, it will be mobilized by demonizing selected scapegoats and fomenting a counter-subversion panic pitting heroic patriotic producers against nefarious subversive parasites.</p>

<p>August Bebel is said to have used the phrase ‘<italic>Der Antisemitismus ist der Sozialismus der dummen Kerle</italic>.’ It can be translated as ‘antisemitism is the socialism of fools’ or of the ‘dumb’ or ‘stupid’. See Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0896920511434750">Fulford (2005)</xref>. The concept and perhaps the phrase itself circulated before Bebel’s use.
