<abstract>
<p><italic>Aim:</italic> The aim of the study was to evaluate the pharmacological treatment of migraine patients by general practitioners before referral to a neurologist. First, was the pharmacological treatment in accordance with the Dutch College of General Practitioners headache guideline? Second, which migraine characteristics were associated with receiving migraine-specific medication?</p>
<p><italic>Methods:</italic> Migraine patients (age ≥18 years) who visited the neurology outpatient clinic for the first time were included. Migraine characteristics and pharmacological status were collected retrospectively for each patient from the general practitioner’s referral letter, hospital record and a headache characteristics questionnaire.</p>
<p><italic>Results:</italic> A total of 420 migraine patients were included. Only 18.3% of the patients with two or more migraine attacks per month were using prophylactic medication. Furthermore, only 11.7% of patients with symptoms of nausea and/or vomiting were using anti-emetic medication. More than half of patients (51.7%) were using triptans and were likely to have typical migraine symptoms and a long history of migraine.</p>
<p><italic>Conclusions:</italic> Migraine prophylactic medication and anti-emetics are underutilized in the primary care setting for migraine patients in the Netherlands, when compared to the general practitioners guideline. It is important to enhance the knowledge of general practitioners regarding the diagnosis of migraine, and to increase awareness of the headache guideline.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0333102412454944" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Migraine is a common, chronic, neurovascular disorder characterized by headache attacks with or without aura (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0333102412454944">1</xref>). The burden of migraine is high, associated with deteriorated quality of life, lost productivity and great impact on family and social life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0333102412454944">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102412454944">3</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite advances in both acute and prophylactic treatment, community-based studies in several countries have demonstrated that a minority of migraine patients use specific anti-migraine drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0333102412454944">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0333102412454944">5</xref>). There are several reasons why migraine patients do not receive adequate treatment; these can be both patient- and physician-related.</p>
<p>The general practitioner plays an important role in the management of migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0333102412454944">6</xref>). A satisfactory consultation with the general practitioner is important to ensure subsequent effective treatment of migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0333102412454944">7</xref>). However, little is known about how general practitioners actually treat their migraine patients and if the pharmacological treatment is adequate. Studies comparing anti-migraine medication prescription by general practitioners and neurologists demonstrated an increase in the use of triptans and prophylactic treatment after patient consultation with a neurologist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0333102412454944">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0333102412454944">9</xref>). However, these studies do not tell us how many migraine patients really do need medical treatment.</p>
<p>Various guidelines concerning the treatment of migraine have been established in order to improve the care of migraine patients. In the Netherlands, the Dutch College of General Practitioners provides a clear diagnostic and therapeutic standard for the care of migraine patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0333102412454944">10</xref>). To our knowledge, no evaluations have been published on the extent to which guidelines for treatment of migraine are actually used.</p>
<p>The overall aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacological treatment of migraine patients by general practitioners, before referral to a neurologist. More specifically, the following questions were addressed: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0333102412454944">1</xref>) to what extent is the pharmacological treatment of migraine patients in accordance with the Dutch College of General Practitioners headache guideline and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0333102412454944">2</xref>) are there certain migraine or patient characteristics associated with receiving migraine-specific medication from a general practitioner?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0333102412454944" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-0333102412454944"><title>Study setting and patient selection</title>
<p>This study was conducted at a general hospital in the Netherlands. We selected all patients who were registered as having a headache diagnosis according to the DTC-registration (diagnostic-treatment-combination) database in a period of 1.5 years. The DTC was introduced in the Netherlands in 2003, and it functions as a defrayment system for intramural curative and somatic health care. All patients with headache were referred by a general practitioner to the outpatient clinic.</p>
<p>Screening of the hospital records was conducted to identify patients who met the following criteria:
<list id="list1-0333102412454944" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Patients had to be naive patients who visited the neurology outpatient clinic for the first time because of headache.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Consultation took place at the outpatient clinic, excluding patients who were seen on the emergency ward or admitted to the hospital for migraine or another reason.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Patients had to have a migraine diagnosis according to the criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders, second edition (ICHD-II) (i.e. ICHD-II 1.1, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.6, 1.6).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Patients had to be 18 years of age or older at the time of consultation.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0333102412454944"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>Data were collected retrospectively. The hospital records of all patients who met the previously described criteria were examined. Data concerning patient pharmacological status were retrieved from the hospital record and the general practitioner’s referral letter. Data collection was performed by RZ. The type of migraine, according to the ICHD-II criteria, was recorded and checked by a neurologist (JSPB) specializing in headache disorders. Patients visiting the specialized headache outpatient clinic had completed a self-administered questionnaire that included questions about headache characteristics, accompanying symptoms such as photo- and phonophobia, nausea, vomiting, presence of aura symptoms and demographic characteristics. In order to obtain information from patients visiting the regular neurology outpatient clinic, a shortened questionnaire was send to patients who had visited the regular neurology outpatient clinic with migraine. To reach the remaining non-responders, at least two attempts were made by telephone to obtain the missing information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0333102412454944"><title>Definitions/classifications</title>
<p>Migraine diagnosis was made according to the ICHD-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0333102412454944">11</xref>). Besides migraine, other types of primary headaches were recorded. If patients had more than one type of headache besides migraine headache, migraine was considered their primary headache if this was the main reason for consultation with a neurologist. To determine if medication overuse was present, the revised criteria for medication overuse (ICHD-II 8.2) were used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0333102412454944"><title>Dutch College of General Practitioners headache guideline</title>
<p>In the Netherlands, the Dutch College of General Practitioners provides general practitioners with clear diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for different diseases and disorders. In 2004, the most recent headache guideline was published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0333102412454944">10</xref>). The headache guideline provides diagnostic criteria based on the ICHD-II and therapeutic guidelines for the different primary headache disorders. Migraine treatment is divided into acute treatment of migraine headache and prophylactic treatment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102412454944">Figure 1</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-0333102412454944" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the pharmacological treatment of migraine patients as recommended in the Dutch College of General Practitioners headache guideline.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0333102412454944-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Acute headache treatment is based on stepped care. In step 1, a simple analgesic is recommended; in step 2, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID); and in step 3, a triptan. Anti-emetic medication is advised when nausea and/or vomiting is reported by the patient. Migraine prophylactic treatment is indicated when a patient has two or more migraine attacks per month (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102412454944">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0333102412454944"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Baseline characteristics were reported as mean ± SD (standard deviation) or absolute numbers with percentages. In order to assess which patient and headache characteristics were associated with migraine-specific treatment at the time of consultation, we compared patient and headache characteristic between groups with and without triptan use, with and without prophylactic medication use and with and without anti-emetic medication use. Differences in means were tested with independent samples t-tests. Differences in proportions were tested using χ<sup>2</sup>-tests. Data analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., IBM, USA). <italic>P</italic> values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0333102412454944"><title>Study population</title>
<p>A total of 909 patients had a DTC registration of headache in the 1.5-year period; of these patients, 420 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A total of 489 patients were excluded because they failed to meet all the inclusion criteria. In 55 patients, the data reported in the hospital record was insufficient to establish a reliable diagnosis according to ICHD-II criteria; 111 patients were not naive patients; in 20 patients, the consultation did not take place in the outpatient clinic; 195 patients did not have a migraine diagnosis according to ICHD-II criteria; and 108 patients were excluded because they were younger than 18 years of age. Demographic characteristics, headache diagnosis and migraine characteristic are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0333102412454944">Table 1</xref>. The majority of the patients were female (<italic>n</italic> = 329; 78.3%); the mean age was 39.6 years (±12.04). Approximately 65% of the patients had a job or were attending school. The most frequent migraine diagnosis was migraine without aura (<italic>n</italic> = 247; 58.8%), followed by migraine with aura (<italic>n</italic> = 137; 32.6%). Additional headaches were present in 19.2% of the patients, of which tension-type headache was the most prevalent (<italic>n</italic> = 58; 13.8%). Triptan overuse was present in 14 patients (3.3%), and analgesic overuse in 29 patients (6.9%). The majority of patients referred to the neurologist had an attack frequency of two or more migraine headaches per month (<italic>n</italic> = 295; 70.2%). Most patients had unilateral headache (<italic>n</italic> = 310; 73.8%), with aggravation of headache by routine physical activity (<italic>n</italic> = 264; 63%). In most patients, the headache quality was throbbing and/or stabbing (<italic>n</italic> = 311; 74.1%). In approximately three-quarters of the patients, the headache was accompanied by nausea and/or vomiting and photo- and/or phonophobia. Migraine with aura was present in 148 patients (35.2%); the most prevalent aura symptom was visual aura (<italic>n</italic> = 130; 87.8% of patients with aura symptoms).

<p>Over-the-counter analgesic use was not well documented in the referral letter or the hospital record in 68 cases. At least 92.3% of patients had at any time used non-opioid analgesics to treat their migraine attack. Only a few patients reported the use of opioids (<italic>n</italic> = 27; 6.4%), of which the majority were combination preparations like acetaminophen with codeine (<italic>n</italic> = 19; 4,5%) with only a small number of single opioids (<italic>n</italic> = 4; 1.0%). Ergotamines are hardly prescribed anymore in the Netherlands; only one patient had recently used ergotamines to treat a migraine attack, whereas 20 patients (4.8%) had used ergotamines at any time in their medical history.</p>
<p>A small number of patients had at any time in their medical history used anti-emetic medication (<italic>n</italic> = 58), and an even smaller number of patients still used anti-emetic medication at the moment of consultation with a neurologist (<italic>n</italic> = 38).</p>
<p>The majority of patients (<italic>n</italic> = 309) reported nausea or vomiting during the migraine attacks; of these patients, 36 were using anti-emetic treatment. An additional 18 patients with nausea or vomiting had been using anti-emetics in the past.</p>
<p>Seventy-seven patients were using migraine prophylactic medication at the time of consultation. A large number of patients (<italic>n</italic> = 81) previously used prophylactic medication but stopped using them. Of the patients still using prophylactic medication at the time of consultation, 27.3% had previously tried another prophylactic drug. A frequency of two or more migraine attacks per month was reported by 295 patients; 54 of these patients were using prophylactic treatment at the time of consultation with a neurologist.</p>

<sec id="sec11-0333102412454944"><title>Migraine characteristics and association with medication use</title>
<p>The association between migraine characteristics and the medication status at the time of referral to a neurologist is reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0333102412454944">Table 3</xref>. Patients who used a triptan were slightly older than non-triptan users. Patients with the diagnosis of probable migraine were less likely to receive a triptan than patients with migraine with or without aura. The number of years a migraineur has experienced migraine headaches was strongly associated with triptan use. Several migraine-specific headache characteristics were also associated with triptan use, such as aggravation of headache by physical activity, unilateral headache, nausea and/or vomiting, and photo and/or photophobia. Headache frequency, on the other hand, did not seem to be associated with prescription of a triptan, prophylactic, or anti-emetic medication by a general practitioner. The subgroup of triptan users more frequently used migraine prophylactic medication when compared to the group of non-triptan users (<italic>n</italic> = 52; 39.8% vs. <italic>n</italic> = 25, 12.3%, respectively; χ<sup>2 </sup>= 9.504; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005). There was no difference in migraine frequency between these groups.

<p>Prophylactic medication was less likely to be prescribed to patients with probable migraine. The number of migraine years was associated with prophylactic medication use; patients with a long migraine history were more likely to use prophylactic medication. No other specific migraine characteristics, not even migraine frequency, were associated with prescription of prophylactic medication by a general practitioner.</p>
<p>Prescription of anti-emetic medication was only associated with nausea and/or vomiting and not with any other migraine characteristics.</p>

<sec id="sec12-0333102412454944" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current retrospective study reports on the pharmacological treatment by general practitioners of 420 patients with migraine. We compared the pharmacological status of these patients to the advice given in the general practitioners guideline for headache diagnosis and treatment. Evident from our study is an underuse of prophylactic and anti-emetic treatment when compared with the general practitioners headache guideline.</p>
<p>The proportion of patients who were using preventive therapy at the moment of consultation with a neurologist was 18.3%. In the general practitioners headache guideline, a frequency of two or more migraine attacks per month is considered an indication for migraine prophylactic treatment. At the time of consultation, 73.6% of patients met the criteria for starting migraine prophylactic medication. However, only 18.3% of these patients were actually using prophylactic medication. These strict criteria are admittedly somewhat arbitrary, because in practice the decision to prescribe preventive medication depends on many factors other than migraine frequency alone. There are several explanations as to why patients with a migraine frequency of two or more attacks did not use prophylactic treatment after visiting the general practitioner; it could be that the patients were afraid of the side effects or that the migraine did not influence the daily activities of the patient because of very effective acute treatment. However, prophylactic drugs were more frequently prescribed to the subgroup of triptan users, indicating that a triptan alone possibly was not effective enough in a subgroup of migraine patients. Unfortunately, we have no information about patient satisfaction or treatment efficacy.</p>
<p>Use of preventive treatment clearly varies per country. In a French-population-based study, only 6% of migraine patients with a migraine frequency of two or more attacks per month were using prophylactic treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0333102412454944">12</xref>). In the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention (AMPP) study, a panel of experts advised or would consider preventive treatment in 38.8% of studied patients. However, in the AMPP only 12% of the patients actually used preventive medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0333102412454944">2</xref>). Patients in our clinically based study had, on average, a higher frequency of migraine attacks compared to those in the AMPP, which may explain the higher rate of prophylactic users in our study. In the AMPP, patients using preventive treatment were more likely to be female, older in age, have unilateral and extremely severe pain, associated symptoms (e.g. phonophobia), migraine with aura, a high frequency of attacks and a lower quality of life (high disability) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0333102412454944">13</xref>). In our population, the use of prophylactic treatment was only associated with having migraines for many years and migraine with or without aura.</p>
<p>A study on migraine prophylactic treatment in the Netherlands between 1994 and 1998 found that the overall incidence of initiation of migraine prophylactic therapy following the use of abortive migraine drugs was 6.0% per year and fell considerably during the five-year study period. Only 12% of the study population had commenced prophylactic therapy during the five-year observation period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0333102412454944">14</xref>). In another publication from this same study, the investigators demonstrated that patients commencing migraine prophylactic treatment for the first time had used these drugs for a relatively short period of time. More than half of the study population had discontinued migraine prophylaxis within three months after commencing this form of treatment. Approximately 15% had continued treatment for more than two years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0333102412454944">15</xref>). This phenomenon is also seen in our study: more than half of the patients who had used prophylactic medications stopped using them.</p>
<p>Anti-emetic drugs can relieve complaints of nausea or vomiting and can also provide significant reduction in migraine pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0333102412454944">16</xref>). Anti-emetic treatment was used in only 17% of the 309 patients with nausea or vomiting. Patients using anti-emetic treatment were, as to be expected, more likely to have nausea or vomiting. In a Canadian study, 606 migraine patients referred to neurologists specializing in headache showed that only 7.6% used anti-emetic drugs before referral, and almost 19% after consultation. However, the study did not clearly state which patients had an indication for treatment with anti-emetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0333102412454944">8</xref>). It seems that nausea and vomiting in migraine patients are undertreated phenomena, although guidelines recommend the prescription of anti-emetics.</p>
<p>In contrast to the underprescription of anti-emetics, triptans were prescribed in 51.7% of the patients by the general practitioner, which is a rather high percentage when compared to similar studies in other countries. An Italian study reported that only 9.1% of patients were using triptans prescribed by their general practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0333102412454944">9</xref>), and a population-based survey in France revealed that 8% of migraine patients treated their attacks with triptans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0333102412454944">12</xref>). A Dutch study collecting data from community pharmacy records on triptan and ergotamine use found that 13% of migraine patients were treated with migraine-specific medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0333102412454944">4</xref>). A possible explanation for the large number of patients using triptans in our study are that triptans are covered by health insurance in the Netherlands, and that patients in our clinic-based cohort had a higher frequency of migraine.</p>
<p>A number of factors may explain why migraine patients do not receive adequate preventive and anti-emetic treatment. It is well established that lack of consultation for headache is a major contributing factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0333102412454944">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0333102412454944">7</xref>). But even if migraineurs seek medical care, they often do not receive the appropriate diagnosis by a physician (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0333102412454944">17</xref>). It may be that it is difficult for a general practitioner to diagnose migraine; especially if the patients are lacking some of the typical migraine symptoms, for example, unilateral headache, or if there is a concomitant headache disorder present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0333102412454944">18</xref>). In our study, concomitant headache disorders had no direct influence on the patient’s getting migraine-specific treatment. However, our study showed that patients with the typical migraine symptoms were more likely to receive migraine-specific treatment. Another physician-related explanation may be that the general practitioners have no knowledge of the existence of the headache guideline. Our study shows that only half of the patients reach the last step of recommended stepwise care for acute migraine treatment and a small number of patients with an indication for prophylactic or anti-emetic treatment are receiving such treatment.</p>
<p>Some limitations of our study have to be addressed. The patients studied were from a selected population of migraine patients who were referred to the neurology outpatient clinic. These patients are more likely to have moderate-to-severe migraine with a high migraine frequency, and may be difficult to treat for general practitioners. Furthermore, due to the retrospective study design, information may be incomplete—in particular, analgesic medication bought over the counter is likely to be underreported. In our study, we only investigated the Dutch general practitioners headache guideline; the guidelines for treating migraine can differ from country to country.</p>
<p>To summarize, our study shows that the general practitioners headache guideline is not well implemented as regards migraine care, especially regarding the prescription of anti-emetic and prophylactic treatment. To improve the treatment of migraine by general practitioners, it is important to enhance their knowledge regarding diagnosing migraine and to emphasize that patients with migraine, but lacking typical migraine symptoms, also deserve adequate treatment. Episodic migraine, and even moreso, chronic migraine, are associated with a decreased quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0333102412454944">19</xref>). Therefore, increasing awareness of the existence of headache guideline among general practitioners is essential for adequate treatment. This will enhance the quality of life of migraine patients, and will, we would hope, reduce unnecessary burden of illness of migraine patients who are currently undertreated.</p>
