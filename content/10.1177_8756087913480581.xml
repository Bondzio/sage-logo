<p>8,025,757 <bold>Liang</bold>; Hsiehyueh Wang (Castro Valley, CA). Method for manufacturing tube mesh bag. Abstract: The invention teaches a new way to make mesh bags using adhesive labels and continuous mesh tubing. Using adhesive labels on continuous mesh tubing is made possible by guiding the mesh tubing both on the outside of the tubing and the inside of the tubing so that an adhesive label does not stick to the mesh surface on the other side of the mesh tubing. As a result, the invention also teaches a new type of mesh bag made with this process and a new machine used for making mesh bags. Filed: January 15, 2011.</p>

<p>8,025,932 <bold>Wolden</bold>; Colin (Denver, CO), Seman; Michael T. (Golden, CO). Assignee: <bold>Colorado School of Mines</bold> (Golden, CO). Self-limiting <bold>thin film synthesis</bold> achieved by <bold>pulsed plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition.</bold> Abstract: Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> thin films were fabricated by pulsed plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) with simultaneous delivery of O<sub>2</sub> and the metal precursor. By appropriately controlling the gas-phase environment, self-limiting deposition at controllable rates (∼1.ANG./pulse) was obtained. The process was insensitive to substrate temperature, with a constant deposition rate observed from 90 to 350 °C. As-deposited Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> films under these conditions displayed good dielectric properties. Performance improvements correlate strongly with film density and composition as measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Pulsed PECVD eliminates the need for gas actuation and inert purge steps required by atomic layer deposition. Filed: February 5, 2008.</p>

Abstract: Dispersible <bold>surface-modified carbon black</bold> that is surface-modified by causing a functional group on the surface of the carbon black to be bonded to a diol-modified end-containing polymer through a triisocyanate compound exhibits excellent dispersibility in a non-polar solvent, a low-polar solvent, and a resin. The dispersible surface-modified carbon black is characterized in that a surface functional group of the carbon black is bonded to one isocyanate end group of a triisocyanate compound having three isocyanate end groups, and the remaining two isocyanate end groups are respectively bonded to hydroxyl groups of a diol-modified end-containing polymer.

Abstract: Ethylene propylene copolymers, substantially free of diene, are described. The copolymers will have a uniform distribution of both tacticity and comonomer between copolymer chains. Further, the copolymers will exhibit a statistically insignificant intramolecular difference of tacticity. The copolymers are made in the presence of a metallocene catalyst.

Co-polymerization of an <bold>isoolefin with a halogenated co-monomer.</bold> Abstract: A co-polymer of isobutene and 4-bromo-3-methyl-1-butene formed by direct co-polymerization in a single-step process. A continuous process for forming the co-polymer preferably comprises periodic or semi-continuous addition of catalyst to a mixed monomer solution. Semi-continuous reverse addition of the mixed monomer solution to a pre-provided catalyst solution may also be employed. The co-polymer exhibits allylic bromide functionality and is advantageously curable by either ZnO curing systems or sulfur-based curing systems. Filed: July 31, 2007.</p>

Production of a <bold>functionalized polytriazole polymer.</bold> Abstract: A method for the production of a functionalized polytriazole polymer, particularly a poly(1,2,4-triazole)-polymer, includes the steps of (a) mixing a hydrazine salt, particularly hydrazine sulfate, with at least an aromatic and/or heteroaromatic dicarboxylic acid and/or at least a dicarboxylic acid derivate in polyphosphoric acid and if necessary further components for obtaining a solution; (b) heating the solution in a protective gas atmosphere for obtaining polyhydrazides and adding aromatic and/or heteroaromatic primary amines to the solution; and (c) precipitating a polymer. If necessary, neutralization in a basic solution may be carried out. Filed: March 11, 2010.</p>

Method for <bold>producing polyimide film.</bold> Abstract: A method for producing a polyimide film comprises the steps of: preparing a polar organic solvent solution of a polyimide precursor obtained by mixing a tetracarboxylic acid dianhydride compound and a diamine compound; adding a dehydrating agent and an imidization catalyst to the polar organic solvent solution so as to prepare a resin solution composition; and drying the resin solution composition by heating so as to imidize the resin solution composition after flowing the resin solution composition onto a support in a casting manner, wherein diethyl pyridine is used as the imidization catalyst. According to the production method, it is possible to obtain a polyimide film which is highly productive and is excellent in the film quality such as the mechanical property, the adhesive strength, and the like.

(Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do, KR). <bold>Polysulfone, electrolyte membrane using</bold> the same, and fuel cell using the electrolyte membrane. Abstract: A polysulfone is provided with a nitrogen-containing functional group having an affinity to an acid, an electrolyte membrane using the polysulfone, and a fuel cell including the electrolyte membrane. In particular, the polysulfone includes a nitrogen-containing functional group that has an affinity to an acid, such as a phosphoric acid, thereby having an excellent acid retaining ability. In an electrolyte membrane including the polysulfone and an acid, the amount of the retained acid can be controlled. Therefore, the electrolyte membrane has a high ionic conductivity and a high mechanical strength. A polysulfone blend of polysulfone and a thermoplastic resin prevents the dissolution of polysulfone by phosphoric acid, so that an electrolyte membrane using the polysulfone blend has an improved durability. A cross-linked reaction product of polysulfone, a cross-linking agent and a polymerization product of polysulfone, a thermoplastic resin, and a cross-linking agent strongly resist a phosphoric acid. Thus, a fuel cell using these polymerization products has a long lifetime and can operate at a high temperature and at a high efficiency. Filed: June 1, 2007.</p>
