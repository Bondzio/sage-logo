<sec id="section1-1941738113482673">
<title>Context:</title>
<p>The ability to return to elite pitching, performance, and clinical outcomes of shoulder surgery in elite baseball pitchers are not definitively established.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1941738113482673">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>To determine (1) the rate of return to sport (RTS) in elite pitchers following shoulder surgery, (2) postoperative clinical outcomes upon RTS, and (3) performance upon RTS and to compare RTS rates in different types of shoulder surgery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1941738113482673">
<title>Data Sources:</title>
<p>Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and checklist, Medline, SciVerse Scopus, SportDiscus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1941738113482673">
<title>Study Selection:</title>
<p>Levels I-IV evidence were eligible for inclusion if performance-based (eg, RTS) and/or clinical outcome–based reporting of outcomes were reported following surgical treatment of shoulder pathology in elite pitchers (major or minor league or collegiate).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1941738113482673">
<title>Data Extraction:</title>
<p>Subject, shoulder, and pre- and postoperative performance-based variables of interest were extracted. All shoulder surgery types were potentially inclusive (eg, open, arthroscopic, rotator cuff, labrum, biceps, acromioclavicular joint, fracture). Study methodological quality was analyzed using the Modified Coleman Methodology Score (MCMS).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1941738113482673">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Six studies were analyzed (287 elite male pitchers [mean age, 27 years] who underwent shoulder surgery, with 99% on the dominant, throwing shoulder). MCMS was 38 (poor). Most pitchers were professional, with a mean career length of 6.58 years and postoperative clinical follow-up of 3.62 years. In 5 of 6 studies, multiple diagnoses were addressed concomitantly at surgery. Rate of RTS was 68% at mean 12 months following surgery. Twenty-two percent of Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers never RTS in MLB. Overall performance did improve following surgery; however, this did not improve to pre-injury levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1941738113482673">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>In this systematic review, the rate of return to elite baseball pitching following surgery was established. Performance tended to decrease prior to surgery and gradually improve postoperatively, though not reaching pre-injury levels of pitching.</p>

<p>The shoulder is an integral part of the kinetic chain in the throwing motion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941738113482673">22</xref></sup> Elite pitchers throw a baseball in excess of 95 mph, with the generation of over 7250 degrees of motion in internal rotation per second.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941738113482673">13</xref></sup> The kinematics of the throwing motion progresses through several distinct phases, with potential functional and/or pathologic adjustments occurring at each stage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1941738113482673">23</xref></sup> Although the entire throwing motion takes less than 2 seconds, repetitive microtrauma over the course of a career may lead to several osseous and/or soft tissue adaptations of the thrower’s shoulder (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1941738113482673">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941738113482673">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941738113482673">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941738113482673">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941738113482673">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941738113482673">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941738113482673">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1941738113482673">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1941738113482673">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1941738113482673">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1941738113482673">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1941738113482673"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1941738113482673">51</xref></sup> The resultant changes demonstrate significant differences from the general population, baseball position (nonpitcher) players,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941738113482673">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1941738113482673">29</xref></sup> and even the nonthrowing contralateral shoulder of pitchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941738113482673">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1941738113482673">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1941738113482673">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1941738113482673">51</xref></sup> The thrower’s shoulder is a remarkable example of the balance of stability and motion to generate great velocity and control.

<p>Objective assessment by a physician may demonstrate excellent outcomes following shoulder surgery in pitchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941738113482673">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941738113482673">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1941738113482673">35</xref></sup> However, even minor changes in accuracy, velocity, and endurance are often undetectable by physical examination, clinical outcome score, or imaging study and can dramatically affect the success of a pitcher’s career. The primary purpose of this article is to systematically review the entire orthopaedic and sports medicine literature to determine the rate of return to sport (RTS) in elite pitchers following shoulder surgery. Secondary purposes include the determination of postoperative clinical outcomes upon RTS, performance upon RTS, and comparison of RTS rates in different types of shoulder surgery. The authors hypothesize that the rate of RTS following shoulder surgery is low (&lt;75%<sup>2</sup>). Further, the authors hypothesize that postoperative clinical outcomes are excellent, with decreased performance, and without a significant difference in outcome between different types of shoulder surgery.</p>
<sec id="section9-1941738113482673" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A systematic review of the available literature was performed with use of PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and checklist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1941738113482673">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1941738113482673">31</xref></sup> Three physicians independently completed the search and agreed on the search criteria. The search was completed on October 1, 2012, using an explicit search algorithm,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1941738113482673">a</xref></sup> in the following databases: Medline (1950-October 1, 2012), SciVerse Scopus (1960-October 1, 2012), SportDiscus (1975-October 1, 2012), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1994-second quarter, 2012). Levels I, II, III, and IV evidence (according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine used by the American version of the <italic>Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1941738113482673">37</xref></sup>) English-language studies were eligible for inclusion in this review. Both print journal and electronically published articles were eligible for inclusion. Medical conference abstracts were not eligible for inclusion. All references within included studies were cross-reference assessed for potential inclusion if missed by the initial search. Duplicate subject publications within separate unique studies were not reported twice. The study with longer duration follow-up, higher level of evidence, or greater number of subjects was retained for inclusion in this event.</p>

</fig>
<p>The primary outcome measure of interest determining inclusion in this review was a pitcher’s rate of RTS (pitching) at the same level as pre-injury. Additionally, rates of RTS (regardless of level), performance upon RTS, and clinical outcome scores were secondary outcomes of interest. Study inclusion criteria were: clinical outcome study reporting results of shoulder surgery in elite pitchers. “Elite” was defined as throwing in at least one Major League Baseball (MLB), minor league (A, AA, or AAA), or collegiate (all divisions, Divisions I, II, and III, NAIA) game. Only English-language studies with a performance-based (eg, return to pitching) and/or clinical outcome–based reporting of outcomes were included. Subject, shoulder, and pre- and postoperative performance-based variables of interest were extracted from all included studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1941738113482673">Table 2</xref>). All shoulder surgery types were potentially inclusive (eg, open, arthroscopic, rotator cuff, labrum, biceps, acromioclavicular joint, fracture). Exclusion criteria were: non-English-language studies, basic science, biomechanical, surgical technique (surgical technique description without clinical outcomes reported), letters to the editor, conference abstract/proceedings, and other systematic reviews/meta-analyses.</p>

<p>Study methodological quality and bias were evaluated using the Modified Coleman Methodology Score (MCMS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941738113482673">7</xref></sup>. Two separate authors independently reviewed the studies using MCMS. Disagreements were settled via discussion and resolution with the senior author. This study quality checklist has been used in prior orthopaedic and sports medicine research and is applicable to both randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941738113482673">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1941738113482673">16</xref></sup> The MCMS is a 15-item instrument with a scaled potential score ranging from 0 to 100, with scores 85 to 100 (excellent), 70 to 84 (good), 55 to 69 (fair), and less than 55 (poor). Descriptive statistics were calculated for each parameter/variable. Continuous variable data were reported as mean ± standard deviation (weighted means where applicable). Categorical data were reported as frequencies with percentages. For all statistical analyses, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. All statistical analyses reported were extracted directly from the studies included and analyzed.

Only 1 study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1941738113482673">28</xref></sup> reported the duration of prior symptoms (35 months), duration of prior nonoperative treatment (17 months), and previous surgeries (superior labrum anterior to posterior [SLAP], rotator cuff, thermal capsulorrhaphy, subacromial decompression, lysis of adhesions). Overlapping concomitant diagnoses were frequent among the subjects analyzed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1941738113482673">Table 4</xref>). However, surgical treatment of rotator cuff tears (43%), internal impingement (30%), and labral tears (27%) were the most common primary diagnoses indicating operative intervention. The most common surgeries performed were for labral tears (46%; 61% debridement and 39% repair), rotator cuff tears (35%; 85% debridement and 15% repair), and thermal capsulorrhaphy (11%).</p>

<p>The rate of RTS at pre-injury level of pitching following shoulder surgery in elite pitchers was 68% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1941738113482673">Table 5</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The primary purpose of this systematic review was to determine the rate of RTS in elite pitchers following shoulder surgery. The authors hypothesized that the rate of RTS following shoulder surgery was low (&lt;75%). This hypothesis was confirmed, as the rate of RTS was 68% with a postoperative mean clinical follow-up of 3.6 years. RTS occurred at a mean of 12 months following surgery. Secondary purposes include the determination of postoperative clinical outcomes upon RTS, performance upon RTS, and comparison of RTS rates in different types of shoulder surgery. The authors hypothesized that postoperative clinical outcomes were excellent, with decreased performance, and without a significant difference in outcome between different types of shoulder surgery. Heterogeneity in clinical outcome measurement tools (KJOC, ASES, ASORS) precluded a definitive answer regarding success. Performance (IP, ERA, WHIP, K/9, velocity, and control) tended to decrease prior to surgery and gradually improve postoperatively, though not reaching pre-injury levels of pitching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1941738113482673">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1941738113482673">39</xref></sup> Only 1 study reported on subjects with an isolated shoulder diagnosis (labral tear).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1941738113482673">40</xref></sup> Thus, no comparison was able to be made regarding rate of RTS between different types of shoulder surgery.</p>
<p>Baseball pitching demands a balance between mobility and stability. It is not surprising that generation of greater amounts of torque during cocking and early acceleration leads to greater velocity and angular rotation during acceleration and ball release. The ability to pitch at an elite level requires several years of training. The repetitive microtrauma induced from throwing over a career (~3000 to 5000 innings pitched in competition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941738113482673">11</xref></sup>) may lead to several osseous and soft tissue adaptations, both functional and pathologic.

Accordingly, treatment often takes place over several months to years, with many different nonoperative and operative options utilized. This was true in the current systematic review, with subjects symptomatic for nearly 3 years and having undergone treatment over 1½ years. Surgical treatment has the potential to dramatically affect the kinematics of throwing and the ability to RTS, the performance upon RTS, and the postoperative clinical outcome. Many pitchers have even undergone more than 1 shoulder surgery in attempts to return to pitching. This was also true in the current systematic review, with 1 study reporting 92% of subjects having a previous surgery on the index shoulder (rotator cuff, labrum, and capsule) prior to repair of a full-thickness rotator cuff tear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1941738113482673">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>There were 3 primary diagnoses treated within this systematic review (rotator cuff tear, glenoid labral tear, and internal impingement). Despite the primary diagnosis being the indication for surgery, many subjects had greater than 1 source of pathology within the shoulder consistent with the thrower’s shoulder. In fact, only 1 study analyzed in this review reported outcomes following surgical intervention for an isolated diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1941738113482673">40</xref></sup> However, the latter study did not report the type of labral tear or the type of repair performed. Given this constellation of pathology, it is believed that repetitive throwing leads to tensile stretching of the anterior capsuloligamentous complex, a so-called pseudolaxity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941738113482673">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1941738113482673">19</xref></sup> Thus, a diagnosis of “microinstability” may be applied with an instability-type surgery performed as a treatment and omission of treatment of the most common cause of the dead arm syndrome, SLAP tear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941738113482673">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941738113482673">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1941738113482673">32</xref></sup> The reason subjects did not RTP in this review was generally not reported. However, if a diagnosis of microinstability was made (and subsequent surgical treatment such as thermal capsulorrhaphy and anterior capsulolabroligamentous tightening), then this may fail to address the true underlying cause of symptoms leading to surgery, the SLAP lesion (although no high-level evidence studies exist to support this theory and the studies did not mention other comorbid patient factors such as tissue quality, physical deficits, etc). Further, if RTP was attempted, then performance is expected to be inferior, which was also confirmed in this review in all but 1 study in at least 1 performance variable per study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1941738113482673">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1941738113482673">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1941738113482673">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1941738113482673">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1941738113482673">39</xref></sup> In addition to the anterior structural changes, the posteroinferior capsule has been shown to become pathologically tight. Although varying degrees of internal impingement occur in all shoulders, repetitive throwing may lead to tightening of the posteroinferior capsule, posterosuperior migration of humeral head on glenoid, and subsequent impingement of the humerus on the articular side of the rotator cuff and posterosuperior labrum in the abducted and externally rotated position.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1941738113482673">46</xref></sup> There has been disagreement and controversy on whether anterior laxity contributed to worsening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941738113482673">17</xref></sup> or lessening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941738113482673">14</xref></sup> of internal impingement.</p>
<p>The primary process that likely occurs during the pathologic throwing shoulder is the loss of internal rotation in the abducted arm (glenohumeral internal rotation deficit [GIRD]).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941738113482673">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1941738113482673">33</xref></sup> The loss of internal rotation often exceeds the gain in external rotation with a reduction in the total arc of motion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1941738113482673">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1941738113482673">48</xref></sup> This reduced total arc in combination with GIRD has been associated with twice the risk of shoulder injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1941738113482673">48</xref></sup> The lack of internal rotation is caused by a contracted posteroinferior capsule with subsequent increase in external rotation (or hyperexternal rotation) in abduction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1941738113482673">33</xref></sup> bony retrotorsion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1941738113482673">51</xref></sup> and posterior muscle tightness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1941738113482673">33</xref></sup> A tight posteroinferior capsule (posterior inferior glenohumeral ligament) creates an obligatory posterosuperior translation of the humeral head in the cocked position and further stresses the “peel-back” mechanism on the superior labrum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1941738113482673">24</xref></sup> Several studies have identified significant relationships between GIRD and development of type II SLAP tears.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941738113482673">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1941738113482673">45</xref></sup> Further, scapular dyskinesis may worsen internal impingement secondary to scapular internal rotation and glenoid antetilting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941738113482673">22</xref></sup> Most pitchers can be successfully managed nonsurgically with posteroinferior capsular stretching, preventing symptomatic type II SLAP tears and the incidence of surgical labral treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941738113482673">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941738113482673">20</xref></sup> However, a small proportion of throwers fail nonoperative treatment, with a long duration of symptoms and nonoperative treatment course. These pitchers may undergo surgical treatment of the SLAP tear and the contracted posteroinferior capsule. However, following type II SLAP repair in this patient group, the rate of RTP at pre-injury level is significantly worse than that of nonoverhead throwing athletes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1941738113482673">42</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section18-1941738113482673">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The potential sources of bias limiting the conclusions of this systematic review are related to the studies it analyzes. The authors intended to minimize selection bias by inclusion of only a very exclusive subject group: elite pitchers. However, most pitchers had greater than 1 source of pathology within the surgically treated shoulder. Further selection bias was unavoidable due to the retrospective nature of all studies analyzed. Performance bias was present in that the subjects were extracted from publically available sources without detailed descriptions of diagnoses, operative findings, and surgical techniques performed. For example, terms such as <italic>labral tear</italic> and <italic>rotator cuff tear</italic> were applied to the primary diagnosis indicating surgery, and <italic>labral treatment (debridement or repair)</italic> and <italic>rotator cuff surgery</italic> were applied to the techniques utilized. Transfer bias was present secondary to the different lengths of clinical and professional (MLB pitching) follow-up.</p>
<p>Detection bias was present due to the different methods of postoperative evaluation (precludes meta-analysis) and lack of consistent use of the same validated, reliable, and responsive measures. Self-reported outcome scores are important in the postoperative evaluation of shoulder surgery. However, the psychometric properties of athletic-based outcome scores are limited. Further, most shoulder scores are intended to evaluate subjective and objective results relative to activities of daily living and are limited in scope in the evaluation of high-level sports. The subtle differences of shoulder function that are exhibited by a slight decrease in fastball velocity, pitch accuracy, or innings pitched per game are difficult to assess with traditional shoulder outcome scores. These scores are just not sensitive enough to elucidate these changes and therefore may show falsely elevated scores. The ASORS was the first athlete-specific shoulder outcome score with both objective (10%) and subjective (90%) components intended to address these limitations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1941738113482673">44</xref></sup> The subjective portion evaluated pain, power, intensity, stability, and endurance. Despite the intent to evaluate the athlete’s shoulder, its psychometric properties were not formally evaluated in the assessment of this unique patient population. The KJOC score was recently developed to address similar parameters, evaluating the function and performance of overhead throwing athletes’ shoulders and elbows.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1941738113482673">35</xref></sup> Although it has been validated (comparison with Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score) for use in evaluation of overhead position athletes, the validation was for elite athletes undergoing elbow collateral ligament reconstruction, not shoulder pathology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941738113482673">10</xref></sup> Further, proper development, reliability, responsiveness, and allocation of the weighting of items on the KJOC score have not been formally evaluated and were arbitrarily chosen without justification. The KJOC, however, does discriminate outcomes much more rigorously, evidenced in 2 recent studies that demonstrated significant differences in ASES versus KJOC (96% excellent ASES vs 39% excellent KJOC following type II SLAP repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1941738113482673">35</xref></sup> and ASES score of 89 vs KJOC score of 73<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1941738113482673">36</xref></sup>). Further, for every 1 point decrease in KJOC score, the ASES score decreases by 0.21 points.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1941738113482673">35</xref></sup> Additionally, the KJOC has demonstrated better accuracy (85%) than the ASES (70%) in the assessment of pain-free RTS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1941738113482673">35</xref></sup> Therefore, despite not having proper psychometric property testing, the KJOC is still likely the best true assessment of the outcome of overhead position athletes’ shoulders. In the current systematic review, only 3 studies utilized any formal clinical outcome score, and only 1 of those utilized the KJOC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1941738113482673">35</xref></sup> The limitations within the analyzed studies and utilized study designs are further evident in the poor study methodological quality measured via MCMS. Nevertheless, this study is strong in that it represents the entire orthopaedic and sports medicine literature with a highly specific and unique subject population undergoing an intervention that has the potential to dramatically affect the career of an elite pitcher. Overall, this review has established a return to pitching rate in MLB of 78%, with 68% returning by 1 year following surgery. Twenty-two percent of pitchers, however, were never able to pitch another game in MLB. Therefore, in the future, all efforts should be made by the pitcher, pitching coaches, athletic trainers, and team physicians to maintain excellent shoulder health with appropriate shoulder and kinetic chain mechanics, avoid loss of motion with appropriate stretching, and avoid excessive pitch counts or pitching on reduced rest between outings. These efforts may help reduce shoulder pain and pathology that leads to failed nonoperative treatment and subsequent surgery. Further, future studies should attempt to identify RTP rates and performance upon RTP based on which specific type of shoulder surgery was performed.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this systematic review, the rate of return to elite baseball pitching following surgery was 68% at a mean of 12 months postoperatively. Twenty-two percent of MLB pitchers never pitched again in MLB following shoulder surgery. Performance tended to decrease prior to surgery and gradually improve postoperatively, though not reaching pre-injury levels of pitching.</p>
