<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Many patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) fail to attend cardiac rehabilitation following acute coronary events because they lack motivation to exercise. Theory-based approaches to promote physical activity among non-participants in cardiac rehabilitation are required.</p>
<p><bold>Design:</bold> A randomized trial comparing physical activity levels at baseline, 6, and 12 months between a motivational counselling (MC) intervention group and a usual care (UC) control group.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> One hundred and forty-one participants hospitalized with acute coronary syndromes not planning to attend cardiac rehabilitation were recruited at a single centre and randomized to either MC (<italic>n</italic> = 69) or UC (<italic>n</italic> = 72). The MC intervention, designed from an ecological perspective, included one face-to-face contact and eight telephone contacts with a trained physiotherapist over a 52-week period. The UC group received written information about starting a walking programme and brief physical activity advice from their attending cardiologist. Physical activity was measured by: 7-day physical activity recall interview; self-report questionnaire; and pedometer at baseline, 6, and 12 months after randomization.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Latent growth curve analyses, which combined all three outcome measures into a single latent construct, showed that physical activity increased more over time in the MC versus the UC group (µ<sub>add</sub> = 0.69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Patients with CAD not participating in cardiac rehabilitation receiving a theory-based motivational counselling intervention were more physically active at follow-up than those receiving usual care. This intervention may extend the reach of cardiac rehabilitation by increasing physical activity in those disinclined to participate in structured programmes.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1741826711400519" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Physical activity moderates the impact of coronary artery disease (CAD); patients with CAD who are regularly physical active have a mortality rate one-third lower than those who are inactive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711400519">1</xref></sup> Physical activity counselling and exercise training are core components of cardiac rehabilitation; however, most patients with CAD (70–85%) do not participate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711400519">2</xref></sup> Lack of motivation to exercise is as a key barrier to participating in cardiac rehabilitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711400519">3</xref></sup> New interventions to increase physical activity among non-participants are needed.</p>
<p>A recent review identified nine studies of behavioural interventions for physical activity in CAD patients not attending cardiac rehabilitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711400519">4</xref></sup> Interventions involved counselling for 8–12 weeks and employed various behaviour-change techniques (e.g. goal setting, self-monitoring, and physical activity prescription). Most follow-ups lasted less than 12 weeks, adequate to address adoption of physical activity but too brief to assess maintenance. Only one intervention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711400519">5</xref></sup> was theory-based (i.e., self-efficacy). Most studies relied on self-reported physical activity. Physical activity interventions examining adoption and maintenance of physical activity (i.e. ≥ 1 year), that are theoretically-guided, and use both self-reported and objective physical activity outcome measures are required.</p>
<p>We report findings of a randomized controlled trial comparing long-term physical activity levels between a theoretically guided motivational counselling (MC) intervention group and a usual care (UC) control group. We hypothesized the MC group would show greater increases in physical activity over 1 year compared to the UC group.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1741826711400519" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-1741826711400519"><title>Settings and participants</title>
<p>Participants were identified by a research coordinator during an index hospitalization at a single cardiac centre in Ottawa, Canada (University of Ottawa Heart Institute) between September 2005 and November 2008. Patients with acute coronary syndromes who underwent successful percutaneous coronary revascularization and were not planning on enrolling in cardiac rehabilitation (after having options explained by the research coordinator) were eligible. Patients were excluded if they: underwent bypass surgery; had Class III or IV heart failure; had contraindications to physical activity; did not speak and read English; or were unable to provide informed consent. The protocol was approved by the institutional Research Ethics Committee and all participants provided written consent.</p>
<p>All acute coronary syndrome patients treated at the centre received a Cardiology Discharge Book which included information on how to initiate a walking programme. Each patient engaged in a discussion with the attending cardiologist concerning heart disease and its treatment. Advice about the importance of physical activity was provided (Supplementary Appendix A).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711400519" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711400519"><title>Baseline assessment</title>
<p>The research coordinator extracted information from the patient chart regarding cardiac history, medications, smoking status, and body mass index. Participants completed questionnaires regarding comorbidities and physical activity levels prior to hospitalization. They were fitted with a pedometer which they wore for a 9-day period; a logbook was provided to record the distance in kilometres measured by the pedometer each day.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711400519"><title>Randomization and blinding</title>
<p>Before randomization, participants were placed into strata based on physical activity level before hospitalization measured by the Godin Leisure Score Index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711400519">6</xref></sup> (&lt;20 or ≥20). Participants were randomized to MC or UC using a random sequence generated by a statistician. Sequences were concealed until after baseline assessment. The research coordinator then allocated the next available number and notified participants of their intervention immediately. Research assistants, blinded to treatment assignment, conducted follow-up assessments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741826711400519"><title>Interventions</title>
<p>The motivational counselling intervention consisted of nine contacts between the participant and one of three specially trained physiotherapists over a 52-week intervention period (Supplementary Appendix A). The first contact was face-to-face (time 0) and the remaining contacts were via telephone (at weeks 2, 4, 8, 14, 20, 24, 40, and 52). The intervention was designed from an ecological perspective, i.e. it assumed that there are ‘individual’ (e.g. motivation, self-efficacy, self-monitoring, and action planning skills), ‘social-environmental’ (e.g. family and social networks), and ‘physical-environmental (e.g. access to home exercise equipment, walking routes, community facilities, and programmes; weather) factors that influence physical activity behaviour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711400519">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711400519">8</xref></sup> The behavioural objective was to have the patient engage in ≥30 minutes of physical activity at a moderate or vigorous intensity 5 or more days per week. Intervention elements included gaining commitment, identifying valued outcomes, setting goals, making choices, action planning, self-monitoring, identifying opportunities for physical activity at home, in the neighbourhood, and in the community, problem solving to overcome barriers, feedback and encouragement, symptoms and intensity management, and links to medical care. Physiotherapists providing the intervention received 2 days of training and had regular case discussions to maintain skills over time. They used scripts/checklists to ensure intervention fidelity.</p>
<p>The usual care group received no additional intervention concerning physical activity following hospital discharge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1741826711400519"><title>Follow-up assessments</title>
<p>Participants returned to the centre at 26 and 52 weeks to complete: an interview about physical activity over the past week; a questionnaire concerning physical activity over the past 6 months; and to be fitted with a pedometer they wore for a 9-day period. A logbook was provided to record the distance measured by the pedometer each day.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1741826711400519"><title>Measures</title>
<sec id="sec10-1741826711400519"><title>Seven-day physical activity recall interview</title>
<p>A structured physical activity recall interview<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711400519">9</xref></sup> ascertained estimates of time spent in activities of moderate (3.0–4.9 metabolic equivalents, METS), hard (5.0–6.9 METS), and very hard intensity (≥7.0 METS) over the past 7 days. Minutes of physical activity were summed across the three intensities to create a 7-day total.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1741826711400519"><title>Self-reported physical activity questionnaire</title>
<p>A modified and validated version<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711400519">10</xref></sup> of the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711400519">6</xref></sup> was used to gather data concerning average weekly physical activity. Participants were asked ‘How many days in a typical week in the past 6 months did you do moderate (e.g., fast walking, easy bicycling, easy swimming, dancing) physical activity for at least 10 minutes at a time?’ and, ‘On the days when you did moderate physical activity, how many minutes on average did you spend per day doing this activity?’ The same two questions assessed the frequency and duration of vigorous (e.g., running, jogging) activities. Minutes of moderate and vigorous physical activity per week were summed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1741826711400519"><title>Pedometer-measured physical activity</title>
<p>Daily physical activity was measured using the Yamax DIGI-WALKERTM (Yamasa Tokei Keiki, Tokyo, Japan) pedometer. This pedometer has accuracy within 1% at walking speeds of 80 m/min.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711400519">11</xref></sup> The pedometer was worn for a 9-day period and data from the first and last days were discarded.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1741826711400519"><title>Analytical plan</title>
<p>Baseline characteristics were compared between groups using ANOVAs and χ<sup>2</sup> analyses. The pattern of missing physical activity data was assessed and missing data were imputed using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. Descriptive statistics were generated and standardized effect sizes were calculated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711400519">12</xref></sup> Since physical activity was measured in three different ways (i.e., self-reported minutes over the past week, ‘typical’ minutes per week over the past 6 months, and pedometer-measured distance travelled over a 7-day period), a second-order latent growth curve analysis was conducted in LISREL 8.8 using maximum-likelihood estimation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711400519">13</xref></sup> Activity measures were aggregated into one second-order construct at each time point. A multi-group analysis strategy was used,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711400519">14</xref></sup> whereby the second-order intercept (i.e. baseline physical activity) and slope (i.e. change in physical activity) were constrained to be equal between groups in terms of the means, variances, and co-variances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711400519">Figure 1</xref>). The mean for the treatment slope (i.e. the change in physical activity across time for the MC group above and beyond the UC change) was freely estimated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711400519">14</xref></sup> whereas its associated variance was fixed to 0 to reflect group change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711400519">15</xref></sup> In terms of the first-order physical activity constructs, the factor loadings for baseline physical activity were constrained to be equal with their associated factor loadings at 6 and 12 months to ensure a comparable definition of physical activity across time. Secondary sensitivity analyses were conducted with complete cases.

<p>A total of 868 patients were screened, of which 355 (40.8%) met study eligibility criteria and 141 (39.7% of those eligible) agreed to participate (Supplementary Appendix B). Among consenting participants, 69 were randomized to MC and 72 to UC with a total of 141, 110, and 96 completing the baseline, 6-month, and 12-month assessments, respectively. Outcome data were missing at random after controlling for age and employment status and missing values were imputed using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.

<p>Sensitivity analyses conducted with complete cases showed similar effects of the intervention on self-reported and pedometer-measured physical activity at 6 months, and only slightly weaker effects of the intervention at 12 months (Supplementary Appendix C); data imputation had little impact on the effects seen in the primary analysis.</p>

<p>Patients with CAD not participating in cardiac rehabilitation who received a theory-based motivational counselling intervention were more physically active at follow-up compared to usual care. The long-term impact of the motivational counselling intervention was superior to that observed in the only other theory-based intervention study in this population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711400519">5</xref></sup> We used a different theoretical approach (ecological versus self-efficacy), a longer intervention period (52 versus 12 weeks), more contacts (nine versus six), and combined face-to-face and telephone contacts (versus telephone contacts alone). Our results are consistent with a recent review of behavioural interventions to increase physical activity in cardiac patients;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711400519">4</xref></sup> home-based interventions are effective for increasing physical activity in those not attending cardiac rehabilitation if they included follow-up prompts, encouragement, specific goals set by care providers, and self-monitoring. These behaviour change techniques were key elements of the MC intervention.</p>
<p>Participants in the MC group reported engaging in moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity 86 and 67 minutes more per week at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Increases of this magnitude are clinically important because higher levels of leisure time energy expenditure are associated with improvements in survival, cardio-respiratory fitness, attenuation of symptoms, and less disease progression in patients with known CAD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711400519">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711400519">17</xref></sup> The effect sizes for the self-reported physical activity measures ranged from 0.27 to 0.44, which are consistent with the 0.35 effect size recently reported in a meta-analysis of physical activity interventions in heart disease patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711400519">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Strengths and limitations of this study are evident. Stratification by prior physical activity level and randomization produced groups well balanced on potentially confounding factors. The motivational counselling intervention was planned using a robust framework (ecological theory) and delivered by trained physiotherapists with extensive experience with CAD patients. MC participants completed a high percentage of counselling sessions. Limitations relate to the complexity of measuring physical activity and potential effects of attrition. There are known limitations to self-report and pedometer measures of activity (e.g. social desirability bias causing over-reporting; participant versus investigator understanding of ambiguous terms like ‘physical activity’, ‘moderate intensity’, and ‘leisure time’; inability to capture all forms of activity; alterations of behaviour during observation periods).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711400519">19</xref></sup> However, our latent growth curve analysis approach, which combined objective measures and self-report into a single construct, helped capture the complexity of the physical activity construct. Loss-to-follow-up was higher than anticipated and required the imputation of 22% and 33% of outcome data at 6 and 12 months, respectively. However, sensitivity analysis using only complete cases showed similar effects of the intervention on self-reported and pedometer-measured physical activity at 6 months, and only slightly weaker effects of the intervention at 12 months. The use of imputed data in our primary analysis did not materially alter our conclusions about the efficacy of the intervention. The trial consisted primarily of male Caucasian patients, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.</p>
<p>Overall, CAD patients receiving a behavioural counselling intervention were more physically active than usual care patients 6 and 12 months after hospitalization. This intervention may extend the reach of physical-activity directed rehabilitation and secondary prevention services to patients who are not able or unwilling to attend supervised programmes.</p>
