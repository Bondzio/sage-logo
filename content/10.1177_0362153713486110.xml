<body>
<p>There has long been debate about the benefits and efficacy of counseling and psychotherapy. Some of this debate is about the model of therapy used and some is about the duration of treatment. In this article I will focus on the latter. In Australia, where I live, our current federal government has introduced a mental health plan that supports short-term interventions, usually six to eight sessions. On the other hand, we have advocates for long-term psychotherapy lasting from several to many years. While long-term treatment may be the ideal for many practitioners, it is often not the reality of the lived experience of therapy. Clients may not have access to long-term therapy, and/or they may not want it.</p>
<p>In this article, I discuss some of the research findings about the duration of treatment and introduce several key concepts from transactional analysis that assist in short-term counseling. I begin by inviting you to take the following quiz, which is designed to present some information on brief therapy and to stimulate your thinking (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0362153713486110">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>It may surprise readers to find that brief therapy is far from a new concept. From the beginning of psychoanalysis, practitioners have attempted to identify the most time-efficient treatment. Across all modalities, the average number of client sessions is six to eight. The percentage of clients who only come once to therapy is between 20-55% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0362153713486110">Cooper, 1995</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-0362153713486110">
<title>Definitions of Counseling</title>
<p>There is often confusion and differences of opinion about how to define counseling.</p>
<p>Within our transactional analysis community, counseling is defined as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>
<bold>The Counselling Field of Specialisation:</bold> TA counselling is a professional activity within a contractual relationship. The counselling process enables clients or client systems to develop awareness, options and skills for problem management and personal development in daily life through the enhancement of their strengths, resources and functioning. Its aim is to increase autonomy in relation to their social, professional and cultural environment. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0362153713486110">Training &amp; Certification Council of Transactional Analysis, 2009</xref>, Section 5, p. 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In Australia, the counseling field is presided over by the Psychotherapy and Counselling Federation of Australia (PACFA). As in many other parts of the world, psychotherapists and counselors come together to present a united front to governments and the community and at the same time struggle to define the differences between psychotherapy and counseling.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0362153713486110">Psychotherapy and Counselling Federation of Australia (2013)</xref> offers the following definition:
<disp-quote>
<p>Psychotherapy and Counselling are professional activities that utilise an interpersonal relationship to enable people to develop self understanding and to make changes in their lives. Professional counsellors and psychotherapists work within a clearly contracted, principled relationship that enables individuals to obtain assistance in exploring and resolving issues of an interpersonal, intrapsychic, or personal nature. Professional Counselling and Psychotherapy are explicitly contracted and require in-depth training to utilise a range of therapeutic interventions, and should be differentiated from the use of counselling skills by other professionals.…Although Counselling and Psychotherapy overlap considerably, there are also recognised differences. While the work of Counsellors and Psychotherapists with clients may be of considerable depth, the focus of Counselling is more likely to be on specific problems, changes in life adjustments and fostering clients’ well-being. Psychotherapy is more concerned with the restructuring of the personality or self and the development of insight. (¶ 1, 6)</p>
</disp-quote>Both definitions are highly compatible and stress a contractual relationship, developing an understanding and options, skills for problem management, assisting clients to change, and enhancing existing strengths. The transactional analysis definition states as its aim to increase autonomy and speaks of “problem management” and “personal development” whereas the PACFA definition refers to “specific problems” and “life adjustment.” Clients typically are “the worried well.” In PACFA’s definition, this would mean people suitable for counseling and not requiring psychotherapy or the restructuring of the self. In this article, I use the words <italic>counseling, therapy,</italic> and <italic>treatment </italic>interchangeably.</p>

<sec id="section3-0362153713486110">
<title>Who Needs Treatment?</title>
<p>The notion of who needs treatment and who does not is an important one. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0362153713486110">Amis (2011</xref>) wrote, “The use of the word ‘need’ here can be questioned, as surely entering such an invasive and involved relationship is a personal decision and, if we are to value autonomy of the individual, this decision cannot be made on another’s behalf, so perhaps ‘want’ would be more appropriate” (p. 51). I think it is a big decision for most people to enter into treatment, and it is important for practitioners to remember this. Sam Neill, a well-known New Zealand actor, was quoted as saying, “I think it’s best to leave dreams alone don’t you? I don’t invade my own subconscious and I certainly would never let a professional invade it. It’s in a therapist’s interest to make you think there’s something wrong with you, isn’t it?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0362153713486110">Fontaine, 2009</xref>, p. 12). For some people treatment is not an option that they consider.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0362153713486110">
<title>What Sort of Treatment and for How Long?</title>
<p>The next important question is what sort of treatment clients may want. Part of this decision involves whether to seek short-term or long-term treatment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0362153713486110">Mothersole (2002</xref>) wrote that while short-term treatment is often associated with budget constraints and legal rulings, in fact, the vast majority of therapy contact is short term. He quoted research that indicates that the most common format of therapy is three to eight sessions. Even in long-term therapeutic settings, over half the patients had less than 13 sessions and only a third had more than 26. There also seems to be strong research evidence that up to 75% of those who benefit from therapy do so in the first 6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0362153713486110">Lambert &amp; Barley, 2002</xref>). Studies that compare long-term and short-term treatment arrive at equivalent outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0362153713486110">Koss &amp; Butcher, 1986</xref>). Most outcome studies that report positive outcomes document therapy of 20 sessions or less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0362153713486110">Budman &amp; Gurman, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>In my own counseling practice, I work with many couples, which is traditionally short term, and in my recent training in imago couples therapy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0362153713486110">Hendrix (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0362153713486110">2004</xref>) discussed the magic of 12 sessions when working with couples. I also see clients for Carers NSW, a government program to assist families in which a family member has a mental health or health issue. These clients are given six sessions, with the possibility of a further six on request.</p>
<p>However, I do not want to suggest that short-term work is my only way of working. I also have several current clients whom I have seen for over 5 years and one that I have seen on and off for 15 years. My guess is that other practitioners would share a similar profile.</p>

<sec id="section6-0362153713486110">
<title>Holding the Possibility of a One-Session Cure</title>
<p>Transactional analysis is used for both short-term and long-term work. “Transactional analysis is an approach to brief therapy, rather than a brief therapy in itself” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0362153713486110">Tudor, 2002</xref>, p. 10). Some of the core tenets of transactional analysis are that everyone is OK, that people can think, and that people can change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0362153713486110">Stewart &amp; Joines, 1987</xref>). In my experience, holding these core tenets, as a practitioner, is crucial in short-term work.</p>
<p>Eric Berne originally trained to become a psychoanalyst. He became frustrated with the length of analysis and strove to find quicker ways to cure his patients. He sometimes referred to the ideal of the one-session cure. He told the story of a patient who was talking about a dream in which he was carrying a sack with a heavy load of pebbles. Rather than dealing with the sack by examining and discarding one pebble at a time, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0362153713486110">Berne (1972</xref>) said, “Script analysis attempts to cut the straps so that the patient can drop the whole load at once and feel free as quickly as possible” (p. 377).</p>
<p>Breaking free of parental programming and deciding what we want for ourselves is a goal of transactional analysis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0362153713486110">Berne (1972</xref>) put it like this: “At a certain point, with the help of the therapist and his own Adult, he is capable of breaking out of his script entirely and putting his own show on the road” (p. 362). Later, he wrote, “Get well first, and we’ll analyze it later if you still want” (p. 377). Here he was having an indirect jibe at psychoanalysis, with its emphasis on insight but not on behavior change. This he referred to as “Making-Progress Therapy,” the slogan for which, he said, is, “You can’t get better until you are fully analyzed” (p. 377). In an earlier work, Berne wrote, “We treat them, but it is God who cures them. Hence, in practice, ‘curing the patient’ means ‘getting the patient ready for the cure to happen today’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0362153713486110">Berne, 1966</xref>, p. 63).</p>
<p>In a recent review of earlier research into planned single-session therapy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0362153713486110">Talmon (2012</xref>) summarized the three main findings of studies that he conducted with Hoyt and Rosenbaum between 1986 and 1990.
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Single sessions were the most common length of psychotherapy, regardless of therapist orientation.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The first session is potentially the most therapeutic and often has the greatest influence on the outcome of therapy, regardless of the total duration of therapy.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Evidence-based research consistently demonstrates that less is often better than more in therapy.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Talmon went on to say that ideologically, he believes in maximizing the therapeutic effect of each session, whether or not the client has agreed to short-term or long-term work. He recommends that the therapist go into each session with curiosity and the intention of being present for the client. His position is amazingly similar to Berne’s.</p>
<sec id="section7-0362153713486110">
<title>Case Example</title>
<p>Some years ago a woman came to see me whose 18-year-old daughter had been pulled off the street into a car by three youths. The woman told me that she did not believe in counseling, but she was so concerned about her daughter that she had gone against her normal instincts and decided to consult me. Her concern was that her daughter would not talk to her about what had happened. When we discussed the incident further, what came out was that the young woman had shown incredible courage. When the car slowed down, she jumped out of the moving vehicle and ran for her life, hiding in the entrance to a block of flats. The youths stopped, pursued but did not find her, and eventually left. She got herself home safely.</p>
<p>Rather than continuing to focus on her daughter’s unwillingness to talk about the traumatic incident, I helped my client focus on her daughter’s smart thinking and courage to act. In this instance, I helped the mother to recognize the strengths that her daughter had demonstrated. This fits with the counseling core competency of focusing on resources, which “identifies existing resources in the client and the client’s system and integrates them into the counseling process” (Training &amp; Certification Council, 2009, Section 5, p. 5). I suggested that she tell her daughter that if she did want to talk about the incident at some point, her mum would be willing to listen but would leave the timing to her.</p>
<p>I never saw this client again, and I like to think that my intervention helped. However, I do not really know what happened. For practitioners, this kind of lack of closure and lack of knowing the outcome can be uncomfortable. I still think about this case, so it clearly had an impact on me. I sometimes think about the young woman and wonder if she ever did decide to talk to her mother about that traumatic incident. I wonder about the mother and if she still views counseling in the same way.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section8-0362153713486110">
<title>Establishing a Relationship</title>
<p>I believe that in short-term work it is essential to establish a relationship with the client from the beginning. Most, if not all, therapies stress the importance of the therapeutic alliance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0362153713486110">Shorrock (2011</xref>) wrote, “I have grown to cherish the inherent value of the therapeutic relationship as a change agent in and of itself” (p. 64). Later, he added, “All counseling and psychotherapy approaches are relational” (p. 68). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0362153713486110">Lambert and Barley (2002</xref>) found that 30% of therapeutic change could be accounted for by relational factors.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0362153713486110">Talmon (2012</xref>) suggested that any effective psychotherapy involves three factors:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>“Establishing a positive therapeutic relationship, often helped by the therapist’s caring, empathy, acceptance, affirmation, and encouragement.” (p. 10)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>“Mutually identifying a pivot-chord.” (p. 11) This requires offering an understanding of the client’s problem and identifying the potential for a solution, which offers hope to the client. For transactional analysts this is the equivalent of a clear contract.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Mobilizing the client’s strengths and supporting elements in the environment.</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0362153713486110">Rogers (1967</xref>) posed this question: “How can I provide a relationship which this person may use for their own personal growth?” (p. 32). I find Rogers’s three core conditions—genuineness, unconditional positive regard, and empathy—extremely helpful as guiding principles. Genuineness is important because “the more that I can be genuine in the relationship, the more helpful it will be” (p. 33). Unconditional positive regard involves acceptance, respect, and liking for the client. As the counselor tunes into the client, listening respectfully to his or her story, the hope is that the client can relax into the setting and be open to going deeper into himself or herself. On the counselor’s part, this requires “a continuing desire to understand—a sensitive empathy with each of the client’s feelings and communications as they seem to him at that moment” (p. 34). The counselor, likewise, needs to be able to tune into himself or herself and be present with the client.</p>
<p>Transactional analysis strongly emphasizes open communication, so these core tenets from person-centered therapy fit comfortably with TA. Berne also talked about “the therapeutic attitude” whereby the therapist approaches each session with “a fresh frame of mind” after taking time to be composed and centered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0362153713486110">Berne, 1966</xref>, p. 61).</p>
<p>Other modes of counseling also recognize the importance of the therapeutic alliance. Within a cognitive therapeutic framework, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0362153713486110">Nelson-Jones (2011</xref>) wrote, “The quality of the therapist-client relationship is an important medium for improvement” (p. 143).</p>
<sec id="section9-0362153713486110">
<title>Case Example</title>
<p>Bill, 65 years old and retired, presented for depression and lack of motivation. He was frustrated with himself that he accomplished so little in a day. In our first session, I found it hard to feel a connection with him because he offered an incredible amount of detail as he listed the things that he should have done but had not. He kept the conversation at a content level, and I felt distant from him. Having reflected on this, in the second session I began by saying that I had thought about our first meeting and had the sense that he was very hard on himself and I wondered where that came from. This enabled him to go to a deeper level. He looked sad and talked about his demanding father, for whom nothing was ever good enough. By helping Bill to access his story at a feeling level, he was able to connect with his emotions and I felt closer to him.</p>
<p>My use of an empathic transaction, or, in Egan’s (2010) terms, a response of advanced empathy or “the message behind the message” (p. 227), showed Bill that I wanted to understand his inner world. I was able to intuit what might be behind his style of presentation. My understanding of what happened between us was that my advanced empathy allowed him to feel safe enough to contact his feelings and remember some painful material from his childhood. When he was able to express his feelings about this, I felt more warmth and compassion toward him. He became more real for me by expressing his thoughts and feelings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0362153713486110">Talmon (2012</xref>) wrote about transference and countertransference in the therapeutic relationship as a gift that often shows up in the first session. If the therapist can be present and embrace the gift of how the client presents, both verbally and physically, then together they can build a positive therapeutic relationship. By reflecting on my countertransference reaction to Bill’s initial presentation, I was able to use this information to change my response to him and thereby change the interaction between us.</p>

<title>Contracting</title>
<p>One of the cornerstones of transactional analysis is its emphasis on contracting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0362153713486110">Stewart &amp; Joines, 1987</xref>): “The practice of TA involves the use of contracts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0362153713486110">Lapworth, Sills, &amp; Fish, 1994</xref>, p. 7). The contract requires a clear statement from the client about what changes he or she wants to achieve. It needs to make sense to the counselor and to be doable in the time frame available.</p>
<p>For his part, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0362153713486110">Berne (1966</xref>) defined a contract as “an explicit bilateral commitment to a well-defined course of action” (p. 362). He described four possible goals for therapy: “These may be stated in conventional language as (1) symptomatic control (2) symptomatic relief (3) transference cure (4) psychoanalytic cure” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0362153713486110">Berne, 1961</xref>, p. 160). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0362153713486110">Tudor (2002</xref>) wrote, “Berne’s four definitions of cure—social control, symptomatic relief, transference cure and script cure—may be taken as describing a continuum of cure and, for some TA therapists…as thus offering a framework for understanding what may be ‘cured’ in brief or time-limited therapy—and equally, what may not” (p. 13).</p>
<p>I believe that short-term therapy aims at the first and second of Berne’s four goals. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0362153713486110">Muller and Tudor (2002</xref>), symptomatic control is “the control of dysfunctional behaviours”; symptomatic relief is “relief from the subjective discomfort of the dysfunction such as anxiety, panic, depression, etc.” (p. 27). I think that the third and fourth of Berne’s goals would usually be left to long-term treatment. Transference cure occurs “when the client stays out of script only by substituting the therapist for the original parent,” and script cure occurs “when the person’s own Adult takes over the intrapsychic role of the therapist” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0362153713486110">Stewart, 1996</xref>, p. 18).</p>
<sec id="section11-0362153713486110">
<title>Case Example</title>
<p>Going back to my client Bill, his goals were initially quite broad, for example, to be proactive in his life and to feel positive. One of the most powerful interventions with him was to comment on how many times he used the word <italic>should. </italic>Our first contract around this was for him to observe how frequently he used that word, next was to notice how he felt when he used it, and then we contracted ways he could change what he was saying to himself to eradicate that word. Gradually, through doing this, he began to feel more positive and to be proactive. In terms of Berne’s four possible goals for therapy, these changes are equivalent to symptomatic control and symptomatic relief.</p>

<title>Being a Keen Observer</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0362153713486110">Berne (1966</xref>) stressed the importance of observation: “Observation is the basis of all good clinical work, and takes precedence even over techniques.… The real skill lies in collecting and evaluating data” (pp. 65-66). He was a master of picking up nuances in clients’ behavior. To be a good observer, one must be present, focused, and also intuitive. In transactional analysis terms, this means having a well-functioning Adult and also a switched-on Little Professor. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0362153713486110">Berne (1961</xref>) wrote, “The diagnosis of ego states is a matter of acuteness of observation plus intuitive sensitivity” (p. 58). He described the need to use all our senses when observing and listening: “Like any good clinician, the group therapist should ideally use all five senses in making a diagnosis, assessing the situation, and planning the treatment: sight, hearing, smell, touch and taste” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0362153713486110">Berne, 1966</xref>, p. 65).</p>
<sec id="section13-0362153713486110">
<title>Case Example</title>
<p>A 38-year-old woman, in the first session, described herself as independent, sociable, fit, and hard working. She had come to see me because she felt tired from doing everything on her own and was yearning to be in an intimate relationship and to have a family. I listened to her story and attempted to tune in empathically to what she was experiencing, but it was not until the end of the session that I summarized what I was hearing as the key issues and asked my client if she remembered the very first thing that she had said about herself. She looked surprised and said no. I then gently challenged her, feeding back that the first thing she had said about herself was that she was independent. I wondered if that might be having an impact on her difficulty in forming intimate relationships, which, of course, require some form of trust and surrender. At this point my client became tearful, and I knew that my observation of her affect and recollection of her early words in the session were important.</p>
<p>I believe that my intervention was a mixture of confrontation and explanation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0362153713486110">Berne (1966</xref>, pp. 233-247) described eight therapeutic operations: interrogation, specification, confrontation, explanation, illustration, confirmation, interpretation, and crystallization. He defined confrontation as using “information previously elicited and specified, in order to disconcert the patient’s Parent, Child or contaminated Adult by pointing out an inconsistency” (p. 235) and explanation as “an attempt on the part of the therapist to strengthen (recathect), decontaminate, or reorient the patient’s Adult” (p. 236). By remembering what my client had said right at the beginning of the session, I was able to use that information to confront her belief system that she had to be independent. By explaining my understanding that intimate relationships require some form of trust and surrender, I aimed to decontaminate and reorient her Adult ego state.</p>

<title>Leverage</title>
<p>Berne told the story of an engineer being called to fix a boiler. The engineer found a stuck valve, rapped it sharply, and service was restored. He produced his bill for $100 and left. The customer complained at the cost of the bill and requested an itemized account. The engineer gave it as follows: $1 for tapping, $99 for knowing where to tap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0362153713486110">Berne, 1963</xref>, p. 3). Leverage is about knowing where to tap. Clearly, Berne used this story as a metaphor for the therapist’s skill in being able to cut to the core issue a client may be facing.</p>
<p>The concept of leverage is also used in Egan’s skilled-helper model. Egan acknowledges the profound influence that Rogers had on his early development of the model and the impact of person-centered values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0362153713486110">Egan, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0362153713486110">2010</xref>). Most recently, Egan has described his model as an “integrating framework” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0362153713486110">Shorrock, 2011</xref>, p. 67) because it brings together elements from the person-centered approach, the cognitive-behavioral approach, and positive psychology. In my opinion, it is this integration that makes Egan’s counseling model compatible with a transactional analysis framework, the latter of which emphasizes inherent OKness, potential for change, and possibility of cure.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0362153713486110">Egan (2007</xref>, pp. 35-39) provided a three-stage model for change: the current picture, the preferred picture, and the way forward. Each stage has three components.
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<underline>Stage 1</underline>: The current picture—what’s going on?<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Task 1: Help clients tell their stories</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Task 2: Help clients develop new perspectives that allow them to reframe their stories</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Task 3: Help clients achieve leverage by working on issues that make a difference</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<underline>Stage 2</underline>: The preferred picture—what do I want?<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Task 1: Help clients use their imagination to spell out possibilities for a better future</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Task 2: Help clients choose realistic and challenging goals</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Task 3: Help clients find the incentives that will allow them to commit to their change agenda</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<underline>Stage 3</underline>: The way forward—How do I get what I need or want?<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Task 1: Help clients review possible strategies to achieve goals</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Task 2: Help clients choose the strategies that best fit their resources</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Task 3: Help clients pull chosen strategies together into a viable plan</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
</list-item>
</list>Leverage is the third step in the first stage. I think of leverage as an engineering term that represents knowing where to dig. Clearly, in short-term counseling, knowing where to tap or where to dig is crucial. In the 2010 edition of his book <italic>The Skilled Helper, </italic>Egan referred to value rather than leverage. Value is about “helping clients work on the problems and opportunities that will make a life-enhancing difference” (p. 261).</p>
<sec id="section15-0362153713486110">
<title>Case Example</title>
<p>Recently, a highly conflicted couple sought my services as a last resort for their marriage. Both were attractive, bright people. They had been together for 6 years and had two young children. They each blamed the other for what was going wrong in their relationship and had an arsenal of examples to prove their point of view. They were stuck in a highly negative communication pattern. At one point, when one partner was moving into critical mode against the other, I interrupted and said that we had some sound research on what made couple relationships thrive or die and that there were “Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse”: criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0362153713486110">Gottman &amp; Silver, 1999</xref>, pp. 27-34). I then asked them to each identify which ones they used the most against the other. There was a moment of intense silence in the room as each identified his or her contribution to the negative pattern. This was a moment of leverage.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article emphasizes the skills necessary to work effectively in a time-limited manner. The counselor needs to be able to establish a positive therapeutic relationship, identify the client’s goals, help the person achieve them, and be willing to say good-bye, all in a short period of time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0362153713486110">Mothersole (2002</xref>) expressed it beautifully:
<disp-quote>
<p>Practising effective short-term psychotherapy requires an ability to distil the stories that we hear and to extract the essence. We need to be able to develop a quick focus, conceptualize a goal or goals and provide the structure and direction required to help the client achieve them. Simultaneously, we are required to manage the relationship, both in terms of attachment and separation. Looked at in this way it can be seen that, far from a second-rate therapy, good short-term work is the highest test of a clinician’s skills. (p. 79)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I end this article with some challenging questions that I am continually asking myself when working short term with clients:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Am I working in a manner that honors Berne’s belief in the possibility of a one-session cure?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Am I taking time before each session to prepare myself to be really present with my clients?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Am I honing my observational skills and using my Adult awareness and Little Professor intuition?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Am I remaining open to recognizing the strengths and resources inherent in my clients?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Am I holding the realization that every session could be our last?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Am I respecting my client’s autonomy by working in a timely fashion?</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
