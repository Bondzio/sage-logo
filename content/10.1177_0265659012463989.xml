<p><italic>Child Language Teaching and Therapy</italic> is an international peer reviewed journal which aims to be the leading inter-disciplinary journal in the field of children’s spoken and written language needs. The journal publishes original research and review articles of high practical relevance and which emphasise inter-disciplinary collaboration. <italic>Child Language Teaching and Therapy</italic> publishes regular special issues on specific subject areas and commissions keynote reviews of significant topics. The readership of the journal consists of academics and practitioners across the disciplines of education, speech and language therapy, psychology and linguistics.</p>
<p>This special issue of <italic>Child Language Teaching and Therapy</italic> will be published in 2014 to celebrate the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the journal. It will explore the use of social media and digital technology* with children and young people with a range of speech, language and communication needs (SLCN). There is little published research documenting how social media and digital technology is used with children and young people with SLCN, and the use made by children and young people themselves in their everyday lives. This special issue will focus on how advances in social media and digital technology have influenced our understanding of, and support offered to, children and young people with SLCN across heath, education and social contexts.</p>
<p>For this special issue, the editors invite papers on the following topics:</p>
