<p>This collection of 15 essays displays a remarkable range: from the Enlightenment images of the Orient (and how some of them are incorporated in Mozart’s <italic>Zaide</italic> and <italic>Die Entführung aus dem Serail</italic>) to the functions of the reformed censorship in the police state of Joseph II; from Mozart’s unarticulated political worldview to the mystical dimensions of the composer’s creativity; from the figure of the ‘old philosopher’ in <italic>Così fan tutte</italic> to the ways in which the alliance between Enlightenment and sacrament is expressed in Mozart’s operas; from transparency as the hallmark of Mozart’s symphonies to the syncretism of myths in <italic>Idomeneo</italic>; from the impulses coming from the <italic>Sturm und Drang</italic> to the composer’s changing views about the specificity of <italic>dramma per musica</italic>. With Otto Jahn’s biography of Mozart (1856) starts the <italic>Mozartforschung</italic>. With Hermann Albert’s revised version of this classical work begins the debate on the influence of the late Enlightenment (in particular, Josephinism) on Mozart’s work. In re-evaluating the tradition of Mozart studies the editor of this collection confronts in his introductory statement not only the diversity of historical reconstructions but also the task of contextualizing the composer’s work in a new way. In this review I shall focus largely on the ambivalences established by the authors in studying Mozart’s attitude towards the late European Enlightenment.</p>
<p>The volume brings together the contributions of eminent scholars in musicology, history of philosophy, social theory, political history, theory of cultural memory, religious studies, art history and German studies. Many of the essays approach the complexity of Mozart’s relationship to the hidden myths and utopias of the late Enlightenment with all aspects of that task in mind. In <italic>Dialectic of Enlightenment</italic> Adorno and Horkheimer argue that when the kind of mythical utopia that provided the French Revolution with content and hope entered German and Austrian music, the concept of reason (as a purposeless purposiveness) became attachable to all cultural ends. For Ralph Köhnen this claim is a source of inspiration for unfolding social-utopian elements in Mozart’s creativity that are developed in <italic>Bildungsroman</italic> and other literary genres as well as in the tradition of the social contract theories. Some of the ambivalences in Mozart’s attitude towards the Enlightenment are informed by the heterogeneity of national traditions in that epoch. Mozart’s work integrates motifs not only of the Catholic <italic>Wiener Aufklärung</italic> but also of the French <italic>lumières</italic> and the Italian <italic>illuminismo</italic>. In this regard Martin Fontius successfully takes issue with the one-sidedness of the readings that place emphasis either on Mozart’s sympathy for the enlightened mores of Paris in 1778, thereby stressing his antipathy to the official Enlightenment of the Habsburg territories (the view expressed in <italic>The Cambridge Mozart Encyclopaedia</italic>, 2006), or on the impact of the Austrian ideas for achieving an enlightened social order (the basic claim in <italic>Mozart-Lexikon</italic>, 2006). Vis-à-vis the deep differences between the French <italic>philosophes</italic> of the second half of the eighteen century and the German philosophical upholders of Enlightenment, it is extremely difficult to circumscribe Mozart’s attitude in terms of the history of ideas.</p>
<p>Several contributors set out to redress the theoretical neglect of the issues related to the role of censorship in shaping Mozart’s work. With essays on the political reality of Josephinism, Helmut Reinalter, Wolfgang Proß and Laurenz Lütteken bring the complexity of contextualizing Mozart’s work to the verge of the theory of the Enlightenment political project. In developing further motifs from Georgi Tschitscherin’s and Volkmar Braunbehrens’s interpretations of Mozart’s political engagements, Michael Stegemann tries to recast the composer’s portrait as <italic>Homo politicus</italic>. Jan Assmann explains the sacramental layer in <italic>Die Zauberflöte</italic> in terms of the distinction between exoteric and esoteric religion – a distinction that also plays a paramount role in the Enlightenment philosophical-political discourse. Kurt Bayertz addresses the moral message of <italic>Don Giovanni</italic> in the framework of a social ethics that gives an account of how da Ponte and Mozart implement themes of the Spanish Counter-Reformation for criticizing the morality of the nobility.</p>
<p>The endeavour to contextualize Mozart’s work cannot overlook the issue of the composer’s encounter with the late Enlightenment via his experience of freemasonry as a member of ‘New Crowned Hope’. What the volume offers is a complex and ramified discussion of this experience placed in the context of the Masonic lodges’ significance in the formation of that secular ideological consciousness that promotes the conviction of people’s capability to construct not only a rational social order but the plan of rational historical development as well. In this contextualization the ‘dialectic of Enlightenment’ becomes most evident in Mozart’s work.</p>
<p>On the various approaches to Mozart’s religiosity, the one that has perhaps gained the strongest hold on contemporary studies is the view of the conventional relationship to Catholicism that correlates with a kind of ‘distant Christianity’. Yet again this view hides rather than reveals interesting ambiguities in Mozart’s suspicious devoutness. Wilhelm Otto Deutsch has good reasons to draw the readers’ attention to (what Hans Küng once called) ‘traces of transcendence’ in works like <italic>Die Zauberflöte</italic>, <italic>La clemenza di Tito</italic> and the <italic>Requiem</italic>. The best way to analyse the meaning of these traces amounts to contextualizing them in Mozart’s imagery of human existence as a being towards death. One finds a spontaneous adumbration of handling the ‘death issue’ in two famous letters to his father and the librettist da Ponte.</p>
<p>Тhe book belongs to the emerging trends in Mozart studies. Its only genuine predecessor is Norbert Elias’s marvellous study on Mozart published in 1993.</p>
