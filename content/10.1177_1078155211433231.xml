<abstract>
<p>Methylene blue has been used not only as a diagnostic agent, but also as an agent in the treatment of ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy (IIE) for several years. Recently, several cases of suspected serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients who received methylene blue in combination with serotonin active agents. Rodent models have revealed that methylene blue is a potent, reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A. It is well known that serotonin active drugs, in combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors can produce profound serotonin syndrome. To date, cases of serotonin syndrome, which resulted from concurrent methylene blue and serotonin active agents, have been published in the anesthesia literature. We report the first known case of serotonin syndrome in a patient receiving methylene blue for IIE.</p>

<p>Methylene blue has been used for years as an antidote for ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy (IIE). In recent years, several cases of suspected serotonin syndrome have been reported when methylene blue was used in combination with serotonin active agents in non-oncology patients. Additionally, rodent models have revealed that methylene blue is a potent reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (MAO A). We report a suspected case of serotonin syndrome in a patient, who was being treated for ifosfamide neurotoxicity with methylene blue.</p>

<p>Methylene blue trihydrate (Urolene Blue®) has a wide range of clinical indications. This agent is commonly used as a dye in therapeutic and diagnostic applications including parathyroidectomy, vasoplegic syndrome, and cyanide poisoning. It has the approval of the Food and Drug Administration for the management of drug-induced methemoglobinemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155211433231">1</xref></sup> It and is also used for the management of IIE. Several case reports and case series have been published on the benefit of using methylene blue in patients experiencing IIE with moderate efficacy reported in patient outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155211433231">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155211433231">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Encephalopathy is a clinically relevant neurotoxicity associated with the use of ifosfamide. The encephalopathic symptoms often occur during, or shortly after, ifosfamide administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155211433231">6</xref></sup> The presentation of IIE varies from patient to patient, but confusion and hallucination are the most common manifestations of IIE. Other symptoms of IIE include incontinence, muscle twitching, extrapyramidal symptoms, cranial nerve abnormalities, seizures, mutism, dysarthria, and asterixis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155211433231">6</xref></sup> This ifosfamide-induced adverse effect is a dose-related toxicity and it has a potential for fatal outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155211433231">3</xref></sup> Low serum albumin, elevated serum creatinine, pre-treatment with cisplatin, and prior central nervous system (CNS) diseases have been identified as risk factors associated with IIE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155211433231">6</xref></sup> The exact mechanism explaining the development of IIE is still unknown. However, the accumulation of the ifosfamide metabolites, chloroacetaldehyde, and S-carboxymethylcysteine is believed to be involved in ifosfamide neurotoxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155211433231">3</xref></sup> Chloroacetaldehyde is thought to be the primary ifosfamide metabolite responsible for encephalopathy due to its ability to cross the blood–brain barrier. It poses a direct neurotoxic effect, depletes CNS glutathione stores and impairs fatty acid metabolism by inhibiting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155211433231">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are many proposed rationales for using methylene blue for the treatment of IIE. It may act as an electron transfer flavoprotein and indirectly restore the essential metabolic pathways of the liver. Methylene blue also decreases the accumulation of the toxic metabolite chloroacetaldehyde, by inhibiting MAO, which is responsible for producing this neurotoxic metabolite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155211433231">6</xref></sup> Of note, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are a known cause of serotonin syndrome when used with concomitant serotonin-active agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155211433231">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Serotonin syndrome is a potential life-threatening complication which often results from drug–drug interactions, but can happen when drugs are taken at usual therapeutic dosing or from intentional overdose. Early recognition of the clinical manifestations of serotonin syndrome is critical in diagnosing patients with this toxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155211433231">7</xref></sup> The presentation of serotonin syndrome varies from patient to patient. Presentations may include neuromuscular abnormalities, autonomic hyperactivities and altered mental-status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155211433231">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155211433231">8</xref></sup> The Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria is a tool with high sensitivity and specificity (89% and 97%, respectively) which can be utilized in the diagnosis of serotonin syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155211433231">9</xref></sup> Unfortunately, serotonin syndrome still remains under-diagnosed due to a lack of knowledge and recognition of serotonin syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155211433231">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155211433231">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many commercially available medications can act as 5-hydroxytryptaminergic agents or possess monoamine oxidase inhibition activities and not be recognized for their potential serotonergic properties. Linezolid, sibutramine, tramadol, and dextromethorphan are some examples of medications which are capable of causing serotonin toxicity, especially when combined with other serotonin active agents. Tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), when combined with MAOIs, may precipitate this drug-induced toxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155211433231">7</xref></sup> Using <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, methylene blue was noted to be a potent reversible inhibitor of MAO A, but it can also inhibit MAO B. Interactions of methylene blue with the active site of MAO A were confirmed by its action as an oxidizing substrate and as a one-electron reductant in rat models. Inhibiting MAO A would be expected to cause perturbations of 5-hydroxytryptamine metabolism and account for serotonin syndrome when administered to a patient on SSRI therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155211433231">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>We performed literature search using the PubMed electronic database with the search terms methylene blue AND serotonin syndrome OR serotonin toxicity. We limited our search to the humans and English language publications for the dates January 1965 to October 2011. Additionally, we retrieved the references from review papers and included them in our literature analysis.</p>
<p>Two retrospective reports describing patients undergoing parathyroidectomy that experienced neurologic sequelae after the administration of methylene blue have been published. In total, these papers identified 17 patients out of 325 who experienced a neurologic event after methylene blue administration. All of the patients with neurological events were known to be taking an SSRI. At the time of their respective publications, serotonin syndrome had not been identified as the likely cause.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155211433231">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078155211433231">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>We also identified 14 published cases and one review article,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078155211433231">12</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078155211433231">26</xref></sup> which describe possible serotonin syndrome due to concomitant use of methylene blue with other serotonin active agents. In these cases, the majority of patients received methylene blue while undergoing parathyroidectomy. All patients were taking at least one serotonergic agent. These agents included paroxetine (<italic>n</italic> = 6), citalopram (<italic>n</italic> = 3), fluoxetine (<italic>n</italic> = 1), clomipramine (<italic>n</italic> = 2), duloxetine (<italic>n</italic> = 1), and venlafaxine (<italic>n</italic> = 1). Wide ranges of diagnoses were considered due to varying degrees of duration and severity of psychiatric and neurological symptoms. Several patients had received doses of methylene blue greater than 5 mg/kg. The lowest methylene blue dose reported was 1 mg/kg at the time of writing this case report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078155211433231">12</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078155211433231">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>We report a case of serotonin syndrome precipitated by 0.7 mg/kg of methylene blue in a 66-year-old female oncology patient who was treated for ifosfamide encephalopathy. This is the first case reported to our knowledge that describes serotonin syndrome with a methylene blue dose lower than 1 mg/kg and in an oncology patient.</p>
<p>Our patient was diagnosed with anaplastic large cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) in 2007, for which she received six cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy. Follow-up re-staging found no evidence of disease. However, in February 2009, she was found to have cutaneous spread of anaplastic large cell lymphoma, for which she received electron beam therapy. In May 2009, work-up of a single persistent lymph node was positive for anaplastic large cell NHL on biopsy. Later that summer, she developed a faint erythema that was diffusely distributed over her torso and upper and lower extremities. The soles of her feet became thickened and fissured. Symptoms were similar, but to a lesser extent, on her hands. Blood work, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, CT scan (computerized axial tomography), and skin biopsy were performed. The skin biopsy showed chronic eczematous process with CD3 mild lymphocytic infiltrate and scattered CD20 positive B-cells. PET scan revealed four lung lesions in both lungs. Biopsy confirmed recurrent anaplastic NHL. At that time, she was admitted to our institution for ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide chemotherapy. Concurrent medications on day 1 of chemotherapy included paroxetine, bupropion, dexamethasone, and aprepitant.</p>
<p>The patient began chemotherapy on the evening of day 1. On day 1, her creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and total bilirubin were within normal limits. Estimated creatinine clearance was 86.9 mL/min, calculated by the Cockroft–Gault formula. Abnormal laboratory functions included albumin (2.7 g/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Of note, her only known risk factor for IIE was a low albumin level. On the morning of day 2, she was noted to be somewhat lethargic. The team was concerned for ifosfamide neurotoxicity. In addition, she had notable increases from day 1 to day 2 in her AST and ALT from 101 and 61 units/L, and to 4191 and 2360 units/L, Day 2 chemotherapy was held and methylene blue 50 mg (0.7 mg/kg) IV every 4 h was initiated. Shortly after administering the first dose of methylene blue, the patient was non-directable, agitated, and non-verbal. Additionally, she was noted to have mydriasis, occasional jerks, and hyperreflexia. A second dose of methylene blue was also administered 5 h later. The patient became increasingly unresponsive, tachypneic, tachycardic, and acidotic prompting intubation and intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, late on day 2. In the ICU, all paroxetine, aprepitant, bupropion, and methylene blue were discontinued, due to concern for serotonin syndrome. The patient’s mental status was slow to improve and complicated by possible ICU delirium.</p>
<p>The patient remained in the ICU until hospital day 14. Her creatinine and BUN peaked on hospital day 4 (2.48 and 93 mg/dL, respectively) but returned to normal limits by hospital days 8 and 11. AST and ALT also returned to baseline by hospital day 11. Complications during this ICU stay included infection, deep vein thrombosis, and recurrent aspiration events after extubation.</p>
<p>On hospital day 18, the patient was transferred back to the ICU after episodes of tachypnea prompted intubation. She was stabilized and transferred to the medical floor on day 27 with a tracheotomy and PEG tube due to aspiration risk. However, on day 33, became hypoxic in the setting of pleural effusions and pulmonary edema and she was transferred to the ICU. The patient was transferred back to the oncology floor on hospital day 48 and was subsequently discharged to a rehabilitation facility, on hospital day 64. At that time, her mental status had returned to baseline.</p>
<p>We believe that the combination of methylene blue and paroxetine may have precipitated serotonin syndrome in this patient. Using the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria Decision Rules, our patient, has a high probability of serotonin syndrome. Most notably, her initial response to methylene blue was consistent with serotonin syndrome. Of note, the dexamethasone, which was used as an antiemetic, may have blunted her fever response. To our knowledge, this is the first case of serotonin syndrome in an oncology patient, who was being treated for ifosfamide-induced neurotoxicity with methylene blue. Additionally, it is the lowest dose of methylene blue (0.7 mg/kg) known to elucidate serotonin syndrome in the literature to date.</p>
