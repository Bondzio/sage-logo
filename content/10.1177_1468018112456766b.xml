<p>The Swedish pension reform, conceived in the early 1990s and enacted in 1998, is often presented as an example of an interesting new pension system. This essay is a description of the Notional Defined Contribution (NDC) part of this new system and how it reacted to the 2008 financial crisis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1468018112456766">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Automatic stabilizers</title>
<p>A number of reformed pension systems include automatic stabilizers that aim to mitigate financial strains on pay-as-you-go (PAYG) defined benefit (DB) schemes. They can be classified into three broad groups, each with different characteristics:</p>
<list id="list1-1468018112456766" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Automation of the first order – whereby benefits depend on changes in factors external to the pension system, such as demography and economy, which otherwise tend to disturb the financial balance of the system.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>NDC principles – whereby benefits depend on contributions paid in on an individual basis.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Automation of the second order – whereby benefits depend on contributions and the financial balance itself, whereby the latter is guaranteed under all circumstances.</p></list-item>
</list>
<sec id="section2-1468018112456766">
<title>Automation of the first order</title>
<p>Germany is one example of this kind of scheme. The ‘sustainability factor’ contains an adjustment to the indexation of pensions in payment. The latter is dependent on the relation between contributor and pensioner numbers. This does not, in itself, guarantee financial sustainability, nor does it hinder adjustments to contribution rates. Instead, there is a commitment for the government to take action and make proposals to parliament, should it appear there is a risk that either replacement rate or contribution rate target might fail to be met. In the Canada Pension Plan there is a similar provision.</p>
<p>There are a range of other examples, each with different designs, which base scheme parameters on factors external to the pension system, such as life expectancy, among those Finland, Norway and Japan.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1468018112456766">
<title>NDC principles</title>
<p>Some countries have taken reforms a step further and introduced NDC schemes. These include Italy, Latvia and Poland, as well as Sweden. In addition to having elements of automation of the first order, these schemes contain one additional component, contributions that are the basis for accumulation of pension rights, and one political pledge, contributions that are intended to be unchanged into the indefinite future. In such a scheme, the situation is radically changed, because pension rights depend on <italic>contributions</italic>, not on <italic>earnings</italic>. This means that NDC schemes respond differently to financial stress than schemes based upon ‘automation of the first order’.</p>
<p>In the international discussion, it is sometimes argued that ‘life time earnings’ are equivalent to contributions as the basis for pension rights accumulation under an NDC scheme. However, this is true only when, faced with demographic or economic changes, the steering parameters (the indexation rules, etc.) built into an NDC scheme are sufficient to keep it in financial balance without any increase in contribution rates necessary. Under such circumstances, when it comes to accumulation of pension rights and pensions in payment, a traditional PAYG DB (point) scheme can function like an NDC scheme. The difference between the two becomes apparent only when the system comes under financial stress.</p>
<p>When under financial stress, every traditional PAYG DB scheme becomes subject to review, regardless of any feature of the type described under the heading ‘automation of the first order’ that it might contain. Benefit levels, pension age and contributions are all discussed. Basically, what happens is a political process that aims to recalibrate these parameters. Such a reaction is not feasible in an NDC scheme, where contributions, themselves, are the basis for the accumulation of pension rights. Consequently, under an NDC scheme, it is not appropriate to try to solve current financial problems by increasing the contribution rate. Such an increase would create new pension rights and, hence, would risk creating further financial problems in the future.</p>
<p>With the introduction of an NDC scheme, the desire to stabilize contributions becomes a basic principle; contribution rates are to remain unchanged into the indefinite future. Under such schemes, all adjustments must be made on the benefit side, either of the benefits that are being accumulated and/or of the benefits that are being paid out.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1468018112456766">
<title>Automation of the second order</title>
<p>Only the Swedish NDC scheme contains a component that automatically ensures that the changes needed to guarantee financial stability occur while the contribution rate is held constant. This component is the automatic balancing mechanism (ABM) that operates directly in relation to the financial balance.</p>
<p>New methods were established to estimate the assets and liabilities of the scheme. If the liabilities of the scheme exceed its assets, the yearly revaluation of pension rights and pensions in payment are reduced as much as is needed to restore the balance. Obviously, such a mechanism makes the scheme financially stable. Whatever happens, it reduces current and future pensions by whatever is needed to restore financial equilibrium. This is the component that is required to transform a PAYG DB scheme into a ‘contribution defined’ scheme. Once it is inserted, politicians can, technically speaking, leave the scheme to its own devices.</p>

<title>Earnings-related pensions 2009–2015</title>
<p>In one of their regular forecasts (that of July 2011), the Pensions Authority showed how earnings-related pensions had developed and would develop in the coming years. The ‘typical public pension’ – SEK 12,000 per month in 2009 – would fall to SEK 11,300 in 2011 and would only climb back to SEK 12,000 in 2014. A salary that was SEK 12,000 per month in 2009 could be expected to be SEK 14,000 per month by 2014, making the working person around SEK 2000 per month better off than the pensioner.</p>
<p>An important reason for the pension level declining, and for the gap between the retiree and the active worker increasing, was that the ABM was activated. It reduced the monthly pension by SEK 200 in 2010, and an additional SEK 500 in 2011. The ABM was expected to continue to be applied in 2015. Indeed, according to recent forecasts, it will continue to affect pension levels until at least 2020.</p>
<p>The ABM allows for a nominal decrease in pension amounts – a drastic effect indeed. This is how an NDC scheme, consistent with basic requirements for such a scheme to deserve the label ‘contribution defined’ functions when it comes under financial stress. And this way of functioning is fully automatic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1468018112456766">
<title>Quo vadis?</title>
<p>A crucial question arises: Is the Swedish system sustainable? Financially – yes. Politically – this is less clear. Will the broad alliance behind the original reform hold?</p>
<p>Food for thought is what happened in late 2008. At the time, it was realized that if nothing were done, the ABM would reduce both new pensions and pensions in payment by about 4% in 2010. That was the year when a general election was to take place. Representatives of the alliance behind the reform responded by altering the way in which some details in the formulas function, thereby postponing most of the reduction for one year – i.e. until after the election. But, to compensate for this, the reduction the following year was increased.</p>
<p>This raises the question of what will happen in the long run. What about pension adequacy? What will be the reaction from the general public when this system develops further? So far, no one knows. Political troubles have not yet arisen and the broad political agreement behind the 1990s reform is still in force.</p>
