<p>When scanning popular descriptions of stepmothers, adjectives such as “evil,” “wicked,” and “cruel” commonly appear, providing hardly any positive aspirations for new stepmothers. Deal and Petherbridge take a more positive and encouraging stance by focusing on those qualities of “smart” stepmoms. The cover of the book claims that the content offers “practical steps to help you THRIVE.” The 14 chapters are written in a clear, easy-to-read style and cover topics such as understanding misconceptions of stepmothering, dealing with the husband’s children, the stepparent team, relating to the ex-wife and other relevant topics. The book seems written for the specific population of stepmothers and as a guide for clinicians who wish to be successful in their work with stepmothers. Each chapter concludes with discussion questions which could provide a framework either for psycho-educational or clinical services. While the content seems relevant, the materials are not referenced nor are outcome studies provided, so the source of the material, apart from citations of previous clients and authors' viewpoints, may be questioned. Nevertheless, if a basic handbook is sought, in the opinion of this reviewer, the content does cover issues of relevance to stepmothers.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the authors include examples of prayer and scripture throughout chapters and at the end of each chapter. Their introduction does not explain their rationale or objectives for doing so. For some readers and clinicians, this inclusion may be welcomed. For others, it may be irrelevant while some may find it offensive as there are no other religious or spiritual writings included other than those selected from the Bible.</p>
<p>In summary, <italic>The Smart Stepmom</italic> may be a basic reference for clinicians and stepmothers alike. If members of either group seek a “practical” book, then this publication may be worthy of consideration.</p>
