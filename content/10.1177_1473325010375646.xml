<abstract>
<p>The growing presence and visibility of mixed race persons in the US demands that social workers critically examine and understand the complexity of multiracial identity. This qualitative investigation examined the narratives of ten multiracial adults about their identity experiences living as multiracial persons. Utilizing paradigmatic analysis of narratives, five major themes emerged. Four of these themes correspond to categories found in existing multiracial scholarship, and include: (1) Shifting racial/ethnic expressions; (2) Racial/ethnic ambiguity; (3) Feeling like an outsider; and (4) Seeking community. The final theme, (5) Racial resistance, contributes new knowledge to our understanding of how multiracial individuals respond to societal pressures to conform to traditional means of categorizing others by race. Findings from this study confirm a collective multiracial experience; one with direct ties to the social and environmental pressures associated with having a multifaceted identity in a color-conscious society. Practice implications and directions for future research are offered.</p>

<p>On 21 January 2009, Barack H. Obama, an African and European American Senator from Illinois was sworn in as the 44th President of the United States. The multiracial identity of President Obama is representative of a growing population of persons who identify with more than one race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473325010375646">Hendricks, 2008</xref>). According to the US census, approximately 7 million Americans or 2.4% of the total population identify with more than one race (US Census, 2000). This population has steadily increased since the abolishment of anti-miscegenation laws in 1967 (<italic>Loving v. Virginia)</italic> and it is estimated that by the year 2050, as many as 1 in 5 Americans could claim a multiracial background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473325010375646">Lee and Bean, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1473325010375646">Smith and Edmonston, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Due to the significant population growth and increasing visibility of multiracial persons in the US, social workers are likely to see an increase in the number of clients who identify as multiracial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473325010375646">Fong, Spickard and Ewalt, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473325010375646">Hall, 2001</xref>). This emergent population heightens the need for social workers to understand how growing up in a complex society that continues to construct race biologically, may be challenging for mixed race persons. For instance, due to stressors linked to navigating a multifaceted identity in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473325010375646">Choi, Harachi, Gillmore and Catalano, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1473325010375646">Samuels, 2009</xref>), there is growing research evidence that multiracial persons may be at greater risk to experience discrimination, use drugs and alcohol, engage in violent behaviors, and/or struggle with mental health problems, when compared to their non-multiracial peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325010375646">Bolland, Bryant, Lian, McCallum, Vazsonyi and Barth, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473325010375646">Choi, Harachi, Gillmore and Catalano, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473325010375646">Jackson and LeCroy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1473325010375646">Sanchez and Garcia, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1473325010375646">Udry, Li and Hendrickson-Smith, 2003</xref>). In contradiction to these findings, multiracial scholarship has also uncovered that not all multiracial people struggle with their identity, and are generally satisfied, happy and comfortable with their multiraciality (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473325010375646">Binnings, Unzueta, Huo and Molina, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1473325010375646">Shih and Sanchez, 2005</xref>). This discredits historical theoretical notions of multiracial persons adopting a ‘marginal’ status and struggling psychologically with their identity (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1473325010375646">Stonequist, 1937</xref>).</p>
<p>The research remains inconsistent and limited in its ability to capture some of the more dynamic and fluid processes that represent the multiracial experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473325010375646">Choi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1473325010375646">Shih and Sanchez, 2005</xref>). In addition, most multiracial research has focused on only one group of persons (i.e. Black/White), or is conducted in areas of the country with higher proportions of interracial mixing (i.e. California, Hawaii, Washington, etc.). This can constrict our understanding of the multiracial experience and the role and impact the environment has on multiracial identity. Such knowledge is critical to our field’s development of culturally sensitive practice models with multiracial individuals and interracial families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325010375646">Beneditto and Olisky, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473325010375646">Gibbs, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1473325010375646">Morrison and Bordere, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1473325010375646">Nishimura, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1473325010375646">Wardle, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>This current study aimed to build upon existing multiracial scholarship by exploring the life experiences of diverse multiracial adults who reside in a less racially and ethnically diverse US city. Their perspectives offer insight into both the challenges and strengths of claiming a multiracial identity today in a society that remains very color-conscious. The author uses the term <italic>multiracial</italic> to describe persons whose parents are of two or more different racial/ethnic groups (White, Black, Asian, Native, Hispanic), and is inclusive of derivative terms including: biracial (persons who identify with two races), mixed-race and mixed-heritage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1473325010375646">Root &amp; Kelley, 2003</xref>).</p>

<p>Even though the US Census now allows multiracial persons to check more than one racial category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1473325010375646">Office of Management and Budget, 1997</xref>), this does not amount to societal acceptance, and there continues to be much opposition to multiracial persons and families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1473325010375646">Miranda, 2004</xref>). Historically, US society has not been eager to understand and accommodate individuals who are mixed race. This often blatant disregard may be related to the concern that multiracial identification challenges the false notion of race and the belief in the existence of separate races (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325010375646">Edwards and Pedrotti, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>For the most part, the social sciences have depicted the experience of multiracial persons as one of ‘betweenness’ and ‘marginality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1473325010375646">Rockquemore and Brunsma, 2002</xref>: 335). This perspective was mostly shaped by false biological claims of the existence of a racial hierarchy, placing Whites above groups of color, both on a genetic and a societal level. Around the same time, biological and sociological arguments began to arise portraying multiracial Black/White individuals as maladjusted and dangerous degenerates due to their dual polarized heritage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473325010375646">Brown, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1473325010375646">Wilson, 1987</xref>). This transformed society’s view of multiracial people and introduced literature in the early 1900’s that emphasized the social and emotional problems related to mixed-race status (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473325010375646">Embree, 1931</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1473325010375646">Park, 1928</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1473325010375646">Sommers, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1473325010375646">Stonequist, 1937</xref>). This perspective mirrored the social and political atmosphere of the US at the time (i.e. Jim Crow segregation), and subsequently shaped the modern sociological view of the identity of multiracial individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473325010375646">Brown, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>With the rise in interracial partnerships and the ‘biracial baby boom’ following the legalization of interracial marriage in 1967 (<italic>Loving v. Virginia</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1473325010375646">Root, 1992a</xref>), social scientists revisited the identity development of the growing multiracial population. Numerous theories were proposed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, attempting to shed light on the racial identity options available specifically to multiracial (Black/White) persons (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473325010375646">Gibbs, 1987</xref>, <italic>Model of Biracial Identity Conflicts</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1473325010375646">Poston, 1990</xref>, <italic>The Biracial Identity Development Model</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1473325010375646">Jacobs, 1992</xref>, <italic>The Identity Development Model of Biracial Children</italic>). Many of these emerging theories followed the psychoanalytic stage models of early identity development theorists (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473325010375646">Cross, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325010375646">Erikson, 1963</xref>), and thus posited that multiracial identity followed a similar linear path through certain developmental stages leading to the adoption of either a multiracial or minority identity. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1473325010375646">Poston (1990)</xref> posited that mixed Black/White persons transcend through five developmental stages, three of which include: denial, appreciation and integration. Unfortunately some of the early multiracial models ignored the contributing ecological factors impacting identity development, and consequently pathologized the multiracial experience (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473325010375646">Gibbs, 1987</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473325010375646">Hall, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1473325010375646">Miller, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1473325010375646">Poston, 1990</xref>). In addition, the majority of these models focused exclusively on the Black/White multiracial experience, and thus were unable to account for the experiences of other mixed-race persons.</p>
<p>Due to the growing number of persons who claim membership in more than one racial group and the increased visibility of multiracial persons in the media in the late 1990s and early 2000s (i.e. Tiger Woods, President Barack Obama), multiracial identity has received increased attention in social science research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1473325010375646">Rockquemore et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1473325010375646">Shih and Sanchez, 2009</xref>). Recent reviews have discovered a slow but substantial increase in multiracial research in the social sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325010375646">Edwards and Pedrotti, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1473325010375646">Shih and Sanchez, 2009</xref>). For instance a review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1473325010375646">Shih and Sanchez (2005)</xref> identified 53 empirical studies (28 qualitative) examining multiracial identity conducted in the US between 1976–2004. Researchers are beginning to recognize that the experiences of multiracial individuals are complex and not accurately captured by past linear models of racial identity. Instead researchers are developing more fluid, ecological models to examine the multiracial experience (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473325010375646">Hall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1473325010375646">Rockquemore and Brunsma, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1473325010375646">Root, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1473325010375646">Wijeyesinghe, 2001</xref>). In contrast to some of the linear and less contextual multiracial identity models of the past, newer models provide a more fluid conceptualization of the interconnected effect, individual (i.e. phenotype, self-esteem), interpersonal (relationships with peers and family), and environmental factors (homogeneity of community and school) have on a multiracial person’s identity development. In addition, newer multiracial identity models, in particular those grounded in research, emphasize that the racial identity of multiracial persons are not static, but instead can vary throughout their lifetimes. Utilizing newer models, recent multiracial research has uncovered some of the challenges and opportunities embedded within the multiracial experience. For instance, (a) experiencing racism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473325010375646">Brackett et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473325010375646">Buckley and Carter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325010375646">Collins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1473325010375646">Jackson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1473325010375646">Jolivette &amp; Gutierrez-Mock, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1473325010375646">Miville et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1473325010375646">Samuels, 2009</xref>), (b) shifting racial identification over time and in different contexts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473325010375646">Doyle and Kao, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1473325010375646">Harris and Sim, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473325010375646">Herman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473325010375646">Hitlin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1473325010375646">Renn, 2003</xref>), (c) feeling comfortable in multiple racial/ethnic communities and social relationships (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473325010375646">Doyle and Kao, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473325010375646">Guevarra, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1473325010375646">Miville et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1473325010375646">Roberts-Clarke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1473325010375646">Shih et al., 2007</xref>), and (d) <italic>not</italic> struggling psychologically with their identity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473325010375646">Binning et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325010375646">Campbell and Eggerling-Boeck, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473325010375646">Cooney and Radina, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1473325010375646">Phinney and Alipuria, 1996</xref>), are themes to emerge in recent multiracial research.</p>
<p>In addition, research on the multiracial experience has been and continues to be conducted in other countries, especially the UK (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325010375646">Aspinall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473325010375646">Christian, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1473325010375646">Wilson, 1987</xref>). International scholarship on multiracial identity offers insight into how constructs of race and ethnicity hold different meaning in different countries throughout the world, and how this impacts the identity development of persons of mixed heritage. For example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473325010375646">Keddell (2009)</xref>, in a small qualitative study of persons with one Samoan and one White parent in New Zealand, discovered that such individuals were often subject to overt racism, questions of authenticity related to their phenotype and cultural practices, and assumptions of difference, which then restricted these biracial individuals to one racial status. International scholarship such as this can shape our understanding of how the social and political context of one’s environment influences the identity experiences of multiracial persons living both within and outside the US. This contributes to our overall understanding of the complexity of context, and how social perceptions of multiracial identity significantly shape one’s experience of being multiracial in their communities.</p>
<p>This study aimed to add to existing scholarship by identifying the shared experiences of multiracial persons who live in a region of the US (Northeast) where fewer mixed race persons reside, and who are from various racial and ethnic backgrounds. The purpose of this research study was two-fold: (1) to identify the common themes of experience associated with the racial identity development of multiracial persons; and (2) to determine if these themes are similar to, or different from, existing conceptualizations of the multiracial experience.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1473325010375646" sec-type="methods"><title>METHOD</title>
<p>Qualitative methods are hailed for their ability to explicate our understanding of the diverse experiences of multiracial individuals, including their ability to simultaneously exist in two or more cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1473325010375646">Root, 1992b</xref>). This study employed a narrative, person-centered interview approach that allowed participants to share their experiences of identity. Narrative research involves obtaining a story from someone who is identified as having some knowledge or expertise with the topic at-hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1473325010375646">Stuhlmiller, 2001</xref>). This method was selected for its capacity to explore social phenomena and recognize individual strengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473325010375646">Fraser, 2004</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec4-1473325010375646"><title>Participant Recruitment</title>
<p>This study was approved by the University’s Social and Behavioral Sciences Institutional Review Board (SBSIRB) in 2007. According to the 2000 Census, approximately 18% of the multiracial population was distributed in the Northeast region of the US, as compared to 40% in the West. In order to counteract sampling difficulties associated with the non-random distribution of multiracial people in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1473325010375646">Root, 2002</xref>), convenience sampling methods were used to recruit a sample of 10 multiracial persons. Specifically, individuals who were over the age of 21, and whose biological parents represented two or more different racial/ethnic groups (White, Black, Asian, Native, Hispanic) were eligible to participate in this study. This criterion was used to keep the potential sampling frame broad in order to account for the diverse perspectives and experiences of multiracial persons. Though most persons in the US are <italic>multiethnic</italic> and identify with two or more different ethnic groups (i.e. Polish-German-Irish) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473325010375646">Lee and Bean, 2004</xref>), these individuals were not included in this study unless they also met the requirements for multiracial (i.e. Polish-German-Irish-Native American). An exception was made for multiethnic individuals who had a parent who was Hispanic (i.e. Mexican, Spanish, Puerto Rican) and a parent who was non-Hispanic. Hispanic is currently the only tracked ethnic group in the US. This study also sought those individuals who were over the age of 21 in order to accurately capture more of the influential developmental milestones associated with identity formation over time.</p>
<p>The following means were used to recruit participants: (1) ads were placed in local newspapers; (2) fliers were posted in local area coffee shops, Laundromats, and displayed on college and University campuses; finally (3) snowball techniques (i.e. word of mouth) were employed to identify potential respondents who met the above criteria. Efforts were made to place ads in newspapers that were accessible to urban, rural, and suburban residents to increase variability associated with geographic location.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1473325010375646"><title>Interview Procedure</title>
<p>Interviews were conducted in an office situated on a local University campus. This study used a multiracial interviewer, also the researcher, who was trained in, and has significant experience in qualitative methods. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1473325010375646">Root (2002)</xref> recommends the use of multiracial interviewers in research studies because such individuals can increase the comfort level of participants in the interview process, allowing them to share more personal and relevant information. Participants received a cash incentive of $25.00 for participating in this research study. Each interview took approximately 1.5 to 2.5 hours. Interviews were tape-recorded in order to ensure accuracy for transcription purposes.</p>
<p>An interview script was developed to guide the narrative interview process. This consisted of three phases: (1) <italic>the warm-up phase</italic>; (2) <italic>the life-event interview phase</italic>; (3) and <italic>the wrap-up phase</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1473325010375646">Stuhlmiller, 2001</xref>). The warm-up phase consisted of general introductions and an overview of the research goals, purpose and objectives. During the second phase, the researcher conducted a life-event interview, a modified version of the ‘life-stage interview’ as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1473325010375646">Lieblich, Tuval-Mashiach and Zilber, 1998</xref>. For this particular study, the researcher asked the participants to write/draw on paper those meaningful events that shaped their multiracial identity over time. This process was very person-centered offering very minimal directives: ‘construct a timeline of significant events that impacted your identity’. These timelines served as a visual representation of participant stories of experience, and also served as a guide for organizing the structure of questions and probes used throughout the interview. For example, this researcher prompted a discussion about a particular event by pointing to it and asking the narrator to describe the experience and how it relates to their multiracial identity. During the wrap-up phase, the researcher attempted to address any participant concerns, thoughts, or questions regarding any aspect of the research study. The life-event interview was piloted with a biracial, African American and German, Irish, English male (age 28) who found the approach very helpful in organizing his thoughts prior to responding to interview questions.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1473325010375646"><title>Paradigmatic Analysis of Narratives</title>
<p>This study used paradigmatic analysis of narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1473325010375646">Polkinghorne, 1995</xref>) to identify the common themes of experience within the stories told by the multiracial participants. The purpose of paradigmatic analysis is to identify, define, and provide boundaries for themes (or categories) discovered within narrative stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1473325010375646">MacMath, 2009</xref>). Similar to other qualitative methods of inquiry, paradigmatic analysis attempts to bring order to qualitative data by viewing information as belonging to a concept or category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1473325010375646">Polkinghorne, 1995</xref>). This study used an inductive approach to paradigmatic analysis, meaning concepts and categories were derived from the data rather than pre-imposed from a certain theoretical framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1473325010375646">Polkinghorne, 1995</xref>). Utilizing paradigmatic analysis of narratives, segments of text data (i.e. a participant story of an event) was labeled with a term. These terms were then placed into categories based on similar thematic content related to the purpose of the study: <italic>to identify the common themes of experience associated with the racial identity development of multiracial persons</italic>.</p>
<p>Scientific computer software, atlas.ti was used to organize and analyze transcript data. In order to enhance the rigor of this study, preliminary categories were reviewed by a qualified researcher in a different field (Educational Psychology) who specializes in research with multiracial individuals and who identifies as biracial. Triangulation methods, like the interdisciplinary triangulation employed in this study, can help reduce subjectivity and bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1473325010375646">Root, 1992b</xref>).</p></sec></sec>

<p>Five categories emerged from the line-by-line analysis of ten narrative interview transcripts. These five categories represent themes of a shared multiracial identity experience, and include: (1) shifting racial/ethnic expressions; (2) racial/ethnic ambiguity; (3) racial resistance; (4) feeling like an outsider; and (5) seeking community.</p>
<sec id="sec8-1473325010375646"><title>Shifting Racial/Ethnic Expressions</title>
<p>All of the participants in this study described shifting how they expressed their racial identity during different periods of their lives and/or in diverse social and environmental contexts. Expressions varied from checking a particular ethnic or racial box on a form, to dressing and/or talking in an ethnically or racially stereotypical way in certain social situations. Five of the participants described changing their racial identity expressions around certain friends and/or family members affiliated with a particular culture. Interestingly, participants described shifting their expressions of identity often in an attempt to align more closely to their interpretation of the other person’s racial identity (often a stereotypical interpretation) and make the other person or group feel more comfortable.<disp-quote>
<p>I did have a Black friend and I can remember every time I would go to her house, I’d wear that stupid ‘Jackson Five’ t-shirt’ cause I thought it was cool (Laughing) because she was Black and [her family] was Black, and when she got older she said: ‘I’m so glad you don’t wear that shirt anymore’. (Laughing.) ‘Well, you don’t understand, I was doing it for you, really’, you know? I was trying to be more Black (Laughing). (Peace)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Other participants like Joe and Hanna described shifting their identity expressions in certain settings with family members from different cultural backgrounds. For instance, Hanna described how she often had to change her appearance and perform more traditional female roles when in the homes of her Arab family members; while Joe described reserving his Italian verbal expressiveness when around Korean extended family members. Changing one’s expression of racial identity was also associated with environmental pressure to claim membership in a certain monoracial group. For example Zee, a woman of Hispanic, White and Black descent, was pressured by her middle school principal to check the Hispanic box on a school form in order to be eligible for an exclusive magnet school.</p>
<p>As participants described getting older and more comfortable with their multiracial identity they share fewer instances of shifting identity. For example, Miles, who often felt pressured by her mother’s African American family to assume a Black identity, described <italic>holding onto</italic> her multiple race and ethnic associations, and learning to feel less guilty and more comfortable with how she expressed her multiracial identity.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1473325010375646"><title>Racial/Ethnic Ambiguity</title>
<p>One of the major similarities shared by all of the participants was the experience of having their racial identity questioned by others (‘What are you?’). Racial ambiguity or having indistinguishable ethnic or racial features (i.e. eye color, hair texture, skin complexion, etc.) was usually the precursor to questions about their racial background. These questions often made participants feel strange or different.<disp-quote>
<p>I decided to call myself ethnically ambiguous because all throughout my life people have not been able to figure out what I am just by looking at me, unless I am standing next to one of my parents. But if I’m ever just by myself, people have no idea what I am, and so people always guess. So, I don’t remember how it even came up, but the idea occurred to me, ‘Oh, I’m ethnically ambiguous’. (Lee)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>All of the participants described feeling uncomfortable when approached by strangers about their racial background. For example, Jack described a common scenario of getting stared at by others who are confused about his racial heritage: ‘This guy asked me if I was bi-racial. At first I thought he was gay or something, you know, because he was looking at me funny’. They described periods of uncertainty often due to getting questioned all the time by their peers and not knowing an appropriate response, which in different contexts could incite a fight, create a friendship, or risk making an enemy.</p>
<p>All of the participants described at least one incident where someone incorrectly guessed their racial/ethnic background. This further puzzled participants, who were already unsure of the intention of the onlooker. Commonalities regarding the assumptions made by White and ethnic minority inquirers did exist across participant accounts. For instance, four participants reported that when their identity was questioned by either a White individual or person of color, both assumed the multiracial person was a ‘full’ member of the questioner’s ethnic or racial group. For instance, Hanna and Peace both described being approached by White people who assumed they were Italian, even after the participant explained their mixed heritage. This may be associated with participants’ phenotypic appearance as well as the ethnic/racial make-up of the community.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1473325010375646"><title>Racial Resistance</title>
<p>All of the participants made various efforts in their daily lives to resist some of the more traditional ways the US has reinforced racial categorization and racial/ethnic difference. This defiance was not associated with participants’ questioning their own identity, but more with questioning why they had to subscribe with answering a question about their racial or ethnic background. In a sense, they defied the practice of racially categorizing others in general. The most common manner in which participants resisted social racial conventions was by ‘messing with people’ (i.e. answering the question ‘what are you?’ in a condescending manner), or purposefully evading giving a correct response about their racial or ethnic background. For example, several participants who possessed what society may consider obvious phenotypic features of a specific ethnic minority group (i.e. African American: dark skin; Asian American: almond shaped eyes), would condescendingly deny their racial heritage when asked by a discourteous person.<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes if I can read the person, then I kinda play’ em. So sometimes somebody will ask and I’ll say, ‘Oh, I’m French Canadian and Dutch’, and they’ll kind of walk away thinking, ‘Wow!’. [It’s] just to mess with’ em. It might give’ em something to think about! (Laughing). (Peace)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It is important to note that racial resistance appeared to be synonymous with seeking political and academic awareness on race issues, as well as the evolving development and acceptance of their multiracial identity. For example, all of the participants described educating themselves, either formally in an academic setting or informally on their own about race relations in North America and around the globe. An outcome of this intellectual pursuit was that participants often felt inclined to use this information to debunk some of the more stereotypical myths held by others about different racial groups. Similar to how the participants approached ‘messing with’ an individual who asks them about their racial or ethnic background, some multiracial participants felt a natural inclination to use both their personal experiences and discovered knowledge to ‘educate’ (often in a patronizing way) prejudiced individuals about certain racial or ethnic groups. Racial defiance in this scenario was both possessing and socially expressing to others a more in-depth understanding of how race is a social construction and not a biological reality.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I really haven’t met too many people that have the same kind of views on racism and ethnicity and cultural background, you know, ancestry that I have. I’m a big history buff, and I love ticking off people, just for the amusement of, like, messing with people, because I’m so tired of people talking about what they are and what they aren’t. (Apollo)</p></disp-quote></p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1473325010375646"><title>Feeling Like An Outsider</title>
<p>All of the participants in this study described at one point or another feeling like an outsider in their communities, or disconnected from their mainstream peers. As Jack said, ‘I knew I couldn’t assimilate into the Black world. I knew I couldn’t fit in. I was more and more uncomfortable about it.’ This disconnect was usually felt socially due to having a different appearance, culture, and/or beliefs than their peers. These experiences usually surfaced in middle school where youth began to recognize race and stereotypical differences across groups. Being an outsider was often prompted by environmental factors such as the racial composition of the neighborhoods they lived in and/or the schools they attended. ‘One of the biggest things that was reinforced in my experiences was the sense of being an outsider of dominant cultures and groups’ (Devon).</p>
<p>For the participants in this study, feeling like an outsider usually equated to having either no or a small number of close friends, getting stared at and/or criticized by others for looking different, and/or having little in common culturally with the mainstream majority group. Participants in general felt marginalized from the majority of their peers who were culturally different from them, and who treated them differently based on their appearance and mixed racial background.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-1473325010375646"><title>Seeking Community</title>
<p>The multiracial participants in this study expressed a collective desire to connect to a community of peers who shared similar experiences and values as themselves. They sought friendships with others who could relate to their experiences as a mixed-race person. For participants, the person did not necessarily have to be mixed-race, just able to relate to some of their experiences of being different. The participants described efforts or ways that they were actively seeking such a community in their current lives and future plans. Some of the seeking mechanisms of the participants included traveling and joining different racial or cultural groups on the internet. Two of the participants had spent time in other countries. As Joe states: ‘I’ve GONE to other countries, I’ve gone to Brazil, I’ve gone to a lot of places, and I probably wouldn’t have a respect for other cultures or probably wouldn’t have traveled as much if my family didn’t live all over the world.’ Both domestic and international travel was a priority for the multiracial participants who all expressed a strong desire to expose themselves to diverse others. For those who had spent the majority of their lives in a homogeneous community, the desire to travel was even more heightened.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’m more confident in who I am and where I fit into, but it’s still been a little difficult to find and connect with other people who are of the like-mindset. So, I feel a little disconnected. I don’t have a strong sense of community or cultural identity. I have it in myself, but I haven’t met enough like-minded people to really feel connected with that culture. I know it’s out there somewhere. I just haven’t found them yet. (Lee)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Two participants (Jack, Devon) took advantage of the internet as a tool to connect themselves to mixed-race others and/or those who had similar beliefs and values, and another participant (Peace) described seeking friendships with others who, like herself had experienced discrimination and oppression for being different in society. Finally, all the participants shared a collective ideal to be surrounded by others who valued and appreciated who they are as multiracial persons.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec13-1473325010375646" sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Five major themes emerged in this study’s preliminary investigation into a collective multiracial experience. These themes, when viewed in detail, both separately and as a whole, provide us with a more in-depth understanding of some of the challenges and strengths of claiming a multiracial identity today in society. To address the second purpose of this research study, the shared experiences of participants were compared to findings in existing multiracial scholarship. Four of the five categories were synonymous with recent multiracial scholarship on the multiracial experience (shifting expressions of racial/ethnic identity, racial/ethnic ambiguity, feeling like an outsider, and seeking community). One category unique to this investigation is the shared multiracial experience of demonstrating <italic>racial resistance</italic>.</p>
<p>Participants interviewed in this study expressed a racially resistant mind-frame expressed by daily efforts to defy some of the more traditional ways the US perpetuates racial distinctions. Though many scholars identify multiracial persons as having a heightened sense of awareness of race as a social construct (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325010375646">Gaskins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1473325010375646">Harris and Sim, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1473325010375646">Rockquemore and Brunsma, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1473325010375646">Shih et al., 2007</xref>), this study expands this knowledge by providing important information as to how some multiracial persons feel about and respond, in both defiant (‘messin’ with people) and resilient ways (education), to situations where their multiracial identity and ethnic membership is disrespectfully questioned and/or compartmentalized.</p>
<p>Though numerous strategies were employed to enhance the rigor of this study (i.e. broad sampling, pilot testing, interdisciplinary triangulation, and racial/ethnic interview matching), several limitations apply. Despite this study’s efforts to recruit a heterogeneous sample of multiracial persons, the participants in this study are not representative of all multiracial persons. For example, one group that was not well represented in this study was mixed minority persons, or multiracial persons whose ethnic backgrounds are not comprised of White ancestry. This may be particularly associated with the ethnic make-up of the community (predominately White) from which this study took place. In addition, the participants represented in this study are of a young adult cohort and are not representative of those persons over the age of 30 who may have more life experiences or an enhanced view of how such experiences relate to their mixed racial identity. Finally, this study may have benefitted from additional member-checking strategies, such as an evaluation of initial categories by the participants themselves.</p>
<p>This study provides a foundation of numerous avenues for social work researchers to take in their pursuit of understanding the complex identity experiences of multiracial individuals. Future studies should continue to understand the complex individual, interpersonal, and contextual factors that interact to shape a multiracial individual’s identity by further examining the interconnected effect individual (i.e. phenotype, self-esteem), interpersonal (relationships with peers and family), and environmental factors (homogeneity of community and school) have on a multiracial person’s salient identity experiences. For instance, is the phenomenon ‘racial resistance’ perhaps a defensive outcome of growing up in a more homogeneous and less tolerant community? Future research should also make a concerted effort to include adult multiracial participants from diverse backgrounds (including mixed minority persons) and numerous environmental settings (both ethnically heterogeneous and homogeneous communities) in order to more accurately account for the breadth of experiences associated with living as a multiracial person in the US. For example, are the experiences of mixed minority persons different from the experiences of mixed majority persons in different communities? Finally, this study appeared to find success using a multiracial interviewer. Though the researcher did not formally assess participant comfort level, most of the interviewees reported at the end of the interview that they felt very comfortable sharing their personal stories with another multiracial person. Researchers should weigh the potential benefits and costs (i.e. interviewer matching could potentially bias participant responses toward expressing a more synchronized multiracial identity) of employing a multiracial interviewer in their future investigations of multiracial identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473325010375646">Jackson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The shared themes of experience expressed by the multiracial participants in this study offer important social work practice implications. Specifically, this study found that some multiracial persons feel like outsiders and have a common desire to connect to a community of like others. Forging connections may be an important aspect of treatment for some multiracial people, particularly those who live in less tolerant, racially homogeneous communities, and clinicians should encourage these clients to connect with other multiracial people through local and national multiracial organizations (i.e. MAVIN, SWIRL, Blur, IPride, etc.). These outlets can potentially offer helpful information, chat and support groups, and celebrations related to the mixed experience (Jackson and Samuels, in press; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1473325010375646">Samuels, 2009</xref>). In addition, this study found that multiracial persons are often frustrated by having to explain and/or justify their identity either verbally in conversation with others or on written forms. Social workers should take initial steps to change their intake/assessment forms to allow their multiracial clients the flexibility to racially and culturally identify in multiple ways (i.e. ‘describe your identity’). Finally, this study utilized a narrative approach to elicit stories of the multiracial experience. Though this study did not test the effectiveness of a narrative intervention, it did find this approach favorable in allowing the multiracial participants to share their unique stories of experience (see: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473325010375646">Edwards and Pedrotti, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473325010375646">Keddell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1473325010375646">McDowell, Ingoglia, Serizawa, Holland, Dashiell, Jr. and Stevens, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1473325010375646">Rockquemore and Laszloffy, 2003</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-1473325010375646" sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title>
<p>The growing presence and visibility of mixed race persons in the US demands that social workers critically examine and understand the complexity of multiracial identity. This study contributed new insight into the phenomenon of a shared multiracial experience among a diverse group of multiracial persons. The information reported in this study can help guide future social work research and practice with multiracial persons.</p></sec>
