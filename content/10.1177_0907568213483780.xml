<abstract>
<p>Drawing on a comparison with the supermax (solitary confinement) prison in the United States, this article explores the meaning and social circulation of narratives of childhood trauma at HMP Grendon, a therapeutic community prison in Britain. Grendon prisoners incorporate the haunting effects of abuse and neglect into practices of group therapy and communal solidarity, in contrast to the persecution and repression characteristic of interactions in supermax. These differences are discussed in relation to historical changes in the framing of incarcerated personhood and the ‘death of the rehabilitative ideal’ in the United States.</p>

<p>In 2008 the British press was full of stories about Haut de la Garenne, a former children’s home on the Isle of Jersey where a police investigation had turned up what appeared to be evidence of grave crimes against children.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0907568213483780">1</xref></sup> The story unfolded over the course of a year, with reports that police had found skull fragments and what appeared to be restraints. Adults began to come forward with dream-like tales of abuse at the hands of the institution’s staff. When news of ‘potential remains of a child’ came out in March I was conducting a month of focused ethnographic research at HMP Grendon, a therapeutic community prison near Oxford. In their small group sessions prisoners talked with one another about the troubling effect the dramatic television coverage of the case was having on them. ‘It brings up a lot of memories,’ one man told me.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0907568213483780">2</xref></sup> For men at Grendon, Haut de la Garenne seemed doubly haunted – by dead children who had been abandoned to their fate and by the memory of the abuse these children had seemingly suffered. Living in an atmosphere that encouraged them to express painful feelings to one another, some spoke of the beatings, neglect, and sexual abuse they themselves had suffered.</p>
<p>Readers familiar with US prisons will recognize that I am describing an unusual prison setting. Prisoners at Grendon readily acknowledged not only that they had been abused as children but also that they were still suffering the effects. Further, they spoke about this to one another, in public settings. Even more unusual was that these conversations could unfold in an environment in which some inmates had committed sex crimes. Founded in 1962 and part of the British Prison Service, HMP Grendon is a small, all-male prison centered on the rehabilitative potential of residential group and community therapy. In some respects a remnant from an earlier time, Grendon is at the same time the vibrant, contemporary site of a long-running experiment in an alternative approach to violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0907568213483780">Genders and Player, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0907568213483780">Morris, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article I explore how the figure of the injured child enters into circulation at Grendon as a haunting token of shared suffering, ultimately becoming a component of the social solidarity fundamental to the practice of therapeutic community. I contrast this way of working with injury and memory with the situation in the US supermax prisons where I have done most of my research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0907568213483780">Rhodes, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0907568213483780">2005</xref>). Unlike general population settings in which prisoners live in groups, supermax prisons have as their sole purpose the isolation and separation of inmates. Nevertheless, the figure of the child circulates in these prisons as well, suggesting that traumatic memory emerges in distorted ways even in an environment expressly constituted to prevent sociality. Thus, although Grendon and the supermax vary radically in the social environment they produce and, ultimately, in the ethical universe they reference and enable, both illustrate the formation of social or public space through investment in the image of the vulnerable child.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0907568213483780">3</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section1-0907568213483780">
<title>Haunting</title>
<p>The connection between trauma in childhood and later violence – sometimes described as the ‘cycle of violence’ – is well documented. Dorothy Lewis, for example, found that death row inmates had experienced severe trauma in childhood and that maltreatment exacerbates susceptibilities to irritability and impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0907568213483780">1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0907568213483780">1998</xref>). Forensic psychiatrist James Gilligan writes of his many years of work in maximum security settings that ‘the violent criminals I have known have been objects of violence from early childhood,’ describing the effects of such violence as ‘soul murder’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568213483780">1996</xref>: 15). Similarly, but from a more developmental perspective, criminologist Lonnie Athens describes ‘brutalization’ in childhood – the enduring or witnessing of physical or psychological abuse – as a necessary but not sufficient condition for later violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0907568213483780">1992</xref>). The issue I address here is not whether accounts of abuse are evidence of causation, nor will I consider in-depth narratives of abuse. Rather, I want to ask how the figure of the abused child becomes charged with social meaning in settings where social interaction is deliberately managed. The meaning of abuse is rooted in painful personal experience for many but not all prisoners; however, as a figure of vulnerability and victimization the child circulates in public space shared by all prisoners, contributing to both social conflict and affiliation.</p>
<p>Sociologist Avery Gordon suggests ‘haunting’ as one way to conceptualize the effects of past violence and trauma on public space. The present moment, she argues, can be inhabited and animated by the ghostly presence of events that leave ‘a shape defined by [an] absence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0907568213483780">1997</xref>: 6). The impact of haunting on daily life occurs at the intersection of the historical, the personal, and the social; it ‘confounds social separations themselves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0907568213483780">1997</xref>: 19).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0907568213483780">4</xref></sup> ‘What is it,’ Gordon asks, ‘to identify haunting and follow its trajectory?’ I transpose this question here into a somewhat different sphere than those she examines. Haunting quite easily evokes the idea that individual trauma exerts continuing psychological effects; Karr-Morse and Wiley draw on precisely this image in the title of their <italic>Ghosts from the Nursery: Tracing the Roots of Violence</italic>, an exhaustive account of the connections between infant trauma and later criminal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0907568213483780">1997</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0907568213483780">Herman, 1992</xref>: 33). But how do these individual experiences become part of social space and what can differences in the navigation of such experience tell us about the sorts of social spaces we create? At Grendon, the story of Haut de la Garenne was just a small instance of the way in which children – abandoned, neglected, injured, and later ‘excavated’ – stood for the larger project of remedial sociality that engaged its residents. Contrasting this project with the disengagement of the US supermax illustrates how the suppression or activation of traumatic childhood experience affects sociality and, ultimately, the formation of relationship – positive or negative – with the larger public sphere.</p>

<sec id="section2-0907568213483780">
<title>Supermax: Social isolation</title>
<p>Supermax or control prisons are designed for intense and often long-term isolation. Prisoners are held alone in small, featureless cells 23 or more hours a day. They are escorted, cuffed and sometimes shackled, for showers and for brief periods of solitary exercise. With the exception of the officers who deliver meals and provide escort, a prisoner may go months or years without seeing another person’s face.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0907568213483780">5</xref></sup> Thus the supermax creates an asocial or antisocial environment, one in which contact is prohibited and elaborate security rituals keep each prisoner in a bubble of indifference. I have written elsewhere about the negative effects of this form of imprisonment in the form of mental breakdown, obsessive preoccupations, and inability to rejoin human company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0907568213483780">Rhodes, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0907568213483780">2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Four aspects of the supermax prison stand in direct contrast to Grendon. First, only some supermax prisoners have been convicted of violent crimes, and of these only some have committed the sort of extreme violence that we think of when we hear ‘the worst of worst’ to justify the necessity of this form of incarceration. Some prisoners in supermax are mentally ill; others are under protective custody, have committed numerous relatively minor infractions, or are accused of gang affiliation. Second, these prisons – often called ‘warehouses’ – are specifically oriented away from any notion that the goal of incarceration is re-inclusion into society. Rather, supermax prisoners effectively wither as social beings – often developing pathologies of isolation well documented by psychiatrists and human rights organizations. In the US those prisoners considered to fall within the quasi-diagnostic category of ‘psychopathy’ – a designation to which I return later in this article – are believed to be especially suited for isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0907568213483780">Rhodes, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0907568213483780">2004</xref>). And finally, despite the appearance of absolute isolation the supermax can become a strange and distorted social environment. Sound is muffled inside concrete-walled cells with heavy steel doors. Nevertheless conversation with a next-door neighbor is possible, as well as group discussion among those on the same tier if they are willing to shout. Because these exchanges are possible, supermax is not always a domain of absolute isolation; rather, as I have suggested in more detail elsewhere, it can act as a ‘hidden and problematic outpost of the public sphere’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0907568213483780">Rhodes, 2005</xref>: 389).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0907568213483780">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Crimes against children are an especially charged topic of conversation in this context. Many, perhaps most, prisoners (in the US and Britain) express hatred for sex offenders – in fact, distress at the mere hint of contact with what are called in the US ‘baby rapers’ is a socially approved way to gain respect in general population settings. In the emotionally saturated environment of ‘solitary’ confinement some prisoners become intensely preoccupied with the detection and persecution of such offenders, suffusing what serves for ‘interpersonal’ contact in these units with persecution – either fantasized or outright – and fear. One prisoner described the basis for this:<disp-quote>
<p>We are the pieces of shit of society. People don’t like us, [but] it’s hard for [us] to accept that. I mean, you try to find something good about yourself … well, one of the things is child molesters. Once you’ve been in prison for a while, you hate child molesters … We try to express a lot of compassion for children in society … It’s just one way that we try to make up for what we’ve done. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0907568213483780">Rhodes, 2005</xref>: 398)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Expressing compassion for ‘children in society’ and aggressively targeting those who harm them allows prisoners to locate themselves as participants in the public space – the politics – of the larger society, as members of the ‘we’ that makes up the vast majority repelled by crimes against children. The difference between vigilante violence and legal action is blurred by a conflation of emotion and legitimacy in the one area where a prisoner (so long as he himself is not a sex offender) can remain a righteous person and a citizen. At the same time, individual vulnerabilities are suppressed as much as possible, becoming the ‘unsaid’ of these encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568213483780">Billig, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0907568213483780">Masters, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0907568213483780">Rhodes, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Supermax prisons are one aspect of a massive expansion of incarceration that has occurred over the past 40 years, beginning in the US and expanding globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0907568213483780">Ross, 2013</xref>). Over these years the ‘decline of the rehabilitative ideal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0907568213483780">Allen, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0907568213483780">Garland, 2001</xref>: 8) – justified by a conservative argument that ‘nothing works’ to change the ‘criminal mind’ – occurred in tandem with a punitive individualism centered on accountability and risk. Britain saw similar though less pervasive changes. Thus, in both Britain and the US, crowded, non-rehabilitative prisons punctuated by isolation units and other punitive practices represent in acute form what John Clarke calls the ‘anti-social character of neoliberalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0907568213483780">Clarke, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>HMP Grendon: Social on purpose</title>
<p>Grendon is an exception in both the British and American contexts. The 250-bed prison is divided into smaller units (‘wings’) of 45 prisoners; each wing is constituted as a quasi-democratic therapeutic community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0907568213483780">7</xref></sup> These communities center on group therapy and activities, with much of everyday life governed by the prisoners themselves. Residents and staff vote together on allocation of jobs and other privileges; prisoners who violate the primary rules of the institution (no violence, no drugs, no sex) are ejected from their communities and sent back to other prisons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0907568213483780">8</xref></sup> Each wing is staffed by psychodynamically trained therapists, psychologists, and security (uniformed) officers, all of whom participate in and facilitate groups. Residents have an unusual degree of access to staff, but there is no individual therapy. In addition to the three main rules against misconduct, Grendon also imposes ‘no confidentiality.’ This means that nothing that happens on a wing is to be kept private – criminal and family history, conversations among prisoners and between prisoners and staff, many staff issues – all are expected to be part of the public space. Prisoners apply for entry into Grendon from medium and maximum prisons throughout Britain and are screened (including for mental illness) before being admitted.</p>
<p>Grendon stands in sharp contrast to supermax in almost every respect, but above all in its imposition of an intense sociality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0907568213483780">9</xref></sup> What makes comparison meaningful, however, is that prisoners at Grendon have committed serious violent crimes (as have many, but not all, supermax prisoners) and some have histories of violence while incarcerated as well. At Grendon, in other words, a rehabilitative ethos is brought to bear on men similar to those in US supermax prisons. The result is a remarkable record of safety within the prison. More striking is that at 20%, Grendon’s recidivism rate stands in sharp contrast to that of the US prison complex as a whole, which is approximately 60% (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0907568213483780">Cullen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0907568213483780">Marshall, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0907568213483780">Taylor, 2000</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0907568213483780">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The rehabilitative ethos at Grendon has roots in the history of British psychoanalysis, with its emphasis on relationship; in the development of the therapeutic community in the 1950s; and in the antipsychiatry movement of the 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0907568213483780">Healey, 2000</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0907568213483780">11</xref></sup> This history converges on the assumption, fundamental to Grendon’s operation, that individuals cannot be understood in isolation from one another. Resisting the evacuation of the social that has occurred elsewhere during its 50-year history, Grendon’s regime insists on democratic practice deployed as an opportunity to reflect on the social being of self and others. At the same time, Grendon remains a total institution with ultimate power in the hands of the staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0907568213483780">Rhodes, 2010b</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0907568213483780">Jefferson, 2003</xref>) and a strong emphasis on risk-reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0907568213483780">Rhodes, 2010a</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0907568213483780">
<title>The dynamics of the group</title>
<p>Prisoners and staff at Grendon spend three mornings a week meeting in small therapy groups, each facilitated by a therapist and a member of the security staff. The other two mornings are spent in community (‘wing’) meetings attended by prisoners, therapists, and security staff, with the remaining time devoted to work and other activities. The schedule is precise and attendance is required. In the intensely focused mutual attention of these groups prisoners are encouraged to revisit their childhoods and their criminal histories in the context of their everyday experiences of living with others in their communities. As one therapist described the work:<disp-quote>
<p>Therapeutic work is about transformation, and we’re seeking to understand what is transmitted from one phase of life and how childhood trauma can still dominate a man’s life. [Trauma] becomes more fixed in place and more complicated as they get more mature … [and] the nature of how some men resolve it [through violence] … reflects something of the extreme primary experiences they’ve had.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Prisoners describe this retrieval of the past as an often frightening process in which the details and emotional texture of their lives gradually come into focus.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[Being here] is very hard work, very hard work. Scary at times, having to look at things in meself that I’ve anesthetized myself to … you start remembering things that happened to you … it’s really painful … I have had flashbacks … especially because I was abused as a kid in children’s homes. And obviously I remember being abused, but now I can remember things like the lock on the bathroom door and the color of the room and … things like that is weird to remember.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast to the orderly round of therapy, daily life on Grendon’s wings can appear chaotic – men congregate at the dining tables whenever they like, sit on officers’ desks, shake hands with visitors, and move freely between their cells and the common areas carrying cups of tea. This atmosphere arises from a deliberate exposure of residents to the everyday friction of living with 45 other men. Thus, residents are, on the one hand, living in the ‘heat’ of emotionally charged interactions around the details of daily living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0907568213483780">Rapoport, 1960</xref>) and on the other, in the words of one prisoner, ‘continuously talking on your group about your offending behavior, about your relationships with the past.’ As this prisoner continued, ‘something happens in the community that’s negative, but then the person digs in a little bit about why he felt that way on that particular day.’ ‘Digging in,’ framed in specifically psychodynamic terms by Grendon’s staff, has among its goals ‘re-integrating aspects of mind that have become fragmented and separated’ and ‘clarifying the “internal crime scene” ’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0907568213483780">Morris, 2004</xref>: 138). In this practice of interactive introspection, as one therapist described it, the prisoner who has been able to ‘suspend’ moral responsibility is ‘put back into the moral dilemma of living with others.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0907568213483780">
<title>A brave experiment</title>
<p>The term ‘psychopath’ refers to a virulent form of antisocial personality considered distinct from mental illness as such. It does not constitute a category separate from Antisocial Personality Disorder in the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (DSM IV-TR), but has been elaborated alongside it as part clinical diagnosis and part popular depiction of the ‘dangerous individual.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0907568213483780">12</xref></sup> The definition of psychopathy is in wide circulation in popular fiction; psychopaths are described as having no conscience, no empathy, and as pathological liars who enjoy manipulating others. In the United States prisoners diagnosed with psychopathy are, by definition, untreatable – an assumption underwritten by a test called the Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-R) developed by Canadian psychologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0907568213483780">Robert Hare (1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0907568213483780">Rhodes, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0907568213483780">2004</xref>). The psychopath is framed – both within and outside prison systems – as ‘naturally’ fit for solitary confinement. Thus supermax comes to be seen as a soulless space for the soulless person, an antisocial place for the antisocial, and a site without treatment for the untreatable. Prisoners who are represented as simply evil do not have histories; in the popular imagination they seem to spring up fully formed at the moment of their crimes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0907568213483780">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Writing in 1961 about the trial of Adolph Eichmann, Hannah Arendt commented, ‘In rootless evil there is no person left whom one could ever forgive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0907568213483780">Arendt, 1994</xref>: 95). Although she wrote in the very different context of state-sponsored murder, this sets out the core issue in psychopathy. An evil act for which no ‘root’ can be found – or is allowed to be sought – has the effect of evacuating the personhood of the perpetrator. In the US long sentences for petty criminals, ‘rational choice’ theories of crime, and a superficial emphasis on ‘accountability’ obscure the difficult nature of this point. As Gilligan comments, simplifying, sensationalizing, or trivializing violent crime makes it impossible to address ‘root causes of violent behavior’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568213483780">1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Staff at Grendon rely on the same definitions and tests for psychopathy used in US prisons. But as former Grendon therapist Mark Morris notes, the therapeutic prison is a ‘brave experiment’ in whether individuals carrying the diagnosis can learn empathy in a group setting that deliberately surfaces early trauma over a prolonged period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0907568213483780">Morris, 2004</xref>). This approach challenges the most fundamental aspect of psychopathy, which is the question of what relationship we – individuals who are not dangerous – should have with such persons. In other words, as British psychotherapist Gwen Adshead writes, do we become like them if we have no empathy for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568213483780">1999</xref>)? What Joseph Dumit calls ‘objective self-fashioning’ is made possible at Grendon by highlighting the very features that make psychopathy untreatable elsewhere and using them as a route ‘back’ into ‘thought’ and personhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0907568213483780">Downie, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0907568213483780">Dumit, 2004</xref>). The excavation of the lost and injured child, so preoccupying to Grendon residents in the story of Haut de la Garenne, is one aspect of this project.</p>

<title>Traumatic memory</title>
<p>Jarvis Jay Masters is on death row at San Quentin and the author of <italic>Finding Freedom</italic>, a reflection on his life in prison. Well aware from years of introspection that he had been abused and neglected in childhood, he wondered whether other prisoners were able to acknowledge their own histories. He writes of approaching a group of fellow inmates whom he had known for many years and asking one man about the obvious scars on his body:<disp-quote>
<p>Most of us had seen this [man’s most noticeable] scar [in the prison yard] but had never had the nerve to ask about it … Avoiding our eyes, he mumbled a few words before showing us his many other scars. He could remember every detail surrounding the violent events that had produced them. I realized that these experiences haunted him. Yet as he went on talking … he projected [an] almost boastful smile. He wanted nothing of what he shared with us to be interpreted, even remotely, as child abuse. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0907568213483780">Masters, 1997</xref>: 69)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This anecdote reflects the reluctance of most prisoners, living in an environment perceived as threatening and accustomed to projecting strength and indifference, to reveal any signs of vulnerability to their peers. Pressed, Masters’ friend insisted that the beatings he’d received from his father were a sign of love and contributed to his ability to withstand prison.</p>
<p>Grendon residents, on the other hand, learn to tell difficult stories in which they come to recognize their own histories of abuse and eventually see themselves connected to others through multiple tragedies of violence. The brief quotes that follow, taken from interviews with prisoners at various stages of the therapeutic process, suggest the extent to which speaking of abuse comes to be seen as desirable:<disp-quote>
<p>My childhood was a violent one, I used to get beaten up. I didn’t just used to get chastised, I used to get beaten, like physically beaten, like with fists and hit with things.</p>
<p>I knew what I needed to work on. I needed to stop using weapons. I needed to stop hurting. I needed to stop using drugs and drink. And I knew it was probably best if I spoke about my abuse.</p>
<p>In my household there was constant fear of being physically harmed from friends of the family, from just the violence … [Here you] relive those emotional periods that had a detrimental effect on the way that you later interacted with the world to get a grip of what’s actually making you who you are.</p>
<p>You go back, and everything really links back to your childhood.</p>
<p>Inside the house [I was] abused and hurt, but you know it’s just never discussed. It’s kept there in secret, things under the carpet. You know, because it’s deemed disrespectful.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Residents’ willingness to speak in these ways to me occurred in the context of group and individual interactions designed to develop or restore ‘the sense of a meaningful world’ built on social connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0907568213483780">Herman, 1992</xref>: 71). Further, as Morris points out, telling stories to outsiders is an integral aspect of Grendon’s culture, a means of conveying to the outside world that even ‘senseless’ violence is in fact saturated with meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0907568213483780">Morris, 2004</xref>: 39; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0907568213483780">Gilligan, 1996</xref>). These accounts are not presented as a simple uncovering of the reason for adult criminality; rather, prisoners are demonstrating, through language, that they can publicly navigate the emotional landscape thus revealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0907568213483780">Rhodes, n.d.</xref>). My impression was that ‘repressed’ memory was rarely at issue. But by freeing what Adshead calls the ‘frozen voice’ (lecture, University of Washington, 13 April 2012), Grendon prisoners learn to put the events of childhood into narrative relationship with their subsequent lives.</p>
<p>This is of course a familiar cultural narrative. Eva Illouz notes that ‘Therapeutic culture – the primary vocation of which is to heal – must generate a narrative structure in which suffering and victimhood … define the self … suffering is the central “knot” of the narrative, what initiates and motivates it, helps it unfold, makes it work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0907568213483780">2008</xref>: 173). Stories that locate abuse in childhood as the source of suffering follow what she calls, citing Nahi and Omer, a ‘demonic narrative.’ ‘Evil is inside a person and is basically hidden from observers and even from the subject’s own view … the identity of the person is taken over and transformed by the evil principle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0907568213483780">Illouz, 2008</xref>: 177). The retrieval of the person at Grendon starts with an ‘evil’ that was once outside the (unformed) self, has subsequently moved to the ‘inside’ of the adult self, and can be released and integrated through language. Engagement with this narrative is not, in itself, what makes Grendon unusual – if anything this perspective has become more widely accepted and less the property of professionals during the decades of Grendon’s existence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0907568213483780">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The point at Grendon is that suffering in childhood is understood as the root of a violence that cannot be addressed individually but must be connected to others through experiences of social friction and bonding. The therapeutic communities at Grendon thus allow for a certain amount of what prisoners called ‘delinquency’ – interpersonal bad behavior and carelessness toward the community. Difficult, conflictual but often minor events – for example, an argument over who has neglected to pick up trash – bring to the surface the emotional terrain that preceded acts of violence and expose the fear, anger, and contempt that lie at their ‘root.’ Here an officer describes how this works:<disp-quote>
<p>Can he just be around people giving him abuse or being short tempered with him [and not] react? He’s in for a violent murder … So as staff, that’s what we would look at when we recommend him for parole. Has he actually opened up on the group about his issues? … So that he understands why he’s violent, so he doesn’t need to be violent.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus social testing or, in the words of a therapist, the ‘deciphering of offenses’ – carried out in considerable part by peers – is the process through which prisoners are able to connect their current behavior, however seemingly trivial, with childhood experiences and with the feelings and events that directly preceded their crimes. It was because of this ongoing, stressful, and highly public process that residents were so involved with, and able to speak publicly of, the Haut de la Garenne reports – they saw themselves similarly digging up past suffering without whose acknowledgment they could be extinguished as persons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0907568213483780">
<title>The recognition of others</title>
<p>The separation and conflict made apparent by ‘delinquency’ is complemented by a social process Grendon prisoners call ‘linking.’ Here stories of past abuse enter into social circulation and actively connect the words and behavior of one person to another’s experience:<disp-quote>
<p>A bloke on my group [talked about] what his dad used to do to him. His father used to make him choose a weapon to hit him with. And I had the same thing with my father. He would lay out three implements and say, ‘Which one do you want me to beat you with?’ I explained that to him, and me and him started crying … Something that has happened to every single person in this building has happened to me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Prisoners who refuse to discuss what has happened to them are pressed to do so; one man, questioned in a community meeting about how his angry behavior connected to his early life, resisted by insisting that his childhood was just ‘blank, all dark.’ In contrast, prisoners who ‘share’ find themselves rewarded with a sense of solidarity and safety:<disp-quote>
<p>If you share them thoughts with people, you’ll get a lot that feel the same as you and know exactly what you’re seeing and feeling. And you know them people will kind of come to your rescue so to speak. A lot of us weren’t rescued when we should have been.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The eventual purpose of linking is to replace aggression, anger, and contempt with recognition and empathy – and often, an appreciation for Grendon itself as a kind of haven. This prisoner had been at Grendon for four years and was leaving the day after I spoke with him:<disp-quote>
<p>I’m part of a community, something that I want to protect because I want to feel safe. I want to protect it because it’s helping me, and I feel lots of things like forgiveness and you know support and love and care, so I want to protect all them things.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The goal, then, is for men to recognize – not only a ‘person’ in themselves – but that there is someone ‘home’ in others. Violence has meaning not reducible to ‘having no conscience’ or ‘malignant narcissism’ because it emerges highly charged from situations whose full impact is not clear to the perpetrator. To reframe this in terms provided by Athens, the violent person is guided by a violent, partially unconscious ‘phantom community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0907568213483780">1992</xref>). Grendon replaces this phantom community with a real, though of course carefully shaped, community in which violent acting out is always at issue but almost never actually committed.</p>

<title>Grendon and supermax on the dimension of the social</title>
<p>In the United States many men with childhood and criminal histories similar to those at Grendon are confined to supermax and assumed to be beyond the scope of rehabilitation. And what happens to them, as I have documented, is that their experiences of harming and being harmed simply fester in a tightly controlled environment designed to maximize order and reduce the unexpected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0907568213483780">Rhodes, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0907568213483780">2005</xref>). And because supermax is also an unnatural speaking environment in which one cannot see the faces of one’s interlocutors and turn-taking becomes distorted, the memory of the abused child – which cannot be spoken of as one’s own – becomes a shared obsession with persecution and violence. Not only are such prisons inherently counter to public safety – as most prisoners are eventually released – they also rest on an assumption that the non- or antisocial ought to be the active ingredient in imprisonment. In other words, here the ‘antisocial character of neoliberalism’ is pushed to its limit.</p>
<p>At Grendon the circulating image of the damaged child has been recruited in service to the social. Although by no means the only thing that contributes to the complex social world of the therapeutic community, both prisoners and staff value acts of public retrieval. Unexcavated, the injured child haunts the perpetrator of violence and prevents him from identifying with his victim. But when the ghosts of the past become an active presence in public space prisoners are better able to ‘think’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0907568213483780">Downie, 2004</xref>) and less likely to repeat. The ability to tolerate the presence of those who have committed ‘unacceptable’ crimes is seen as a sign of this social rehabilitation. Prisoners become able to say that ‘all crimes are the same’ or ‘all crimes create a victim’ – feeling better about oneself on the backs of other criminals is seen as a threat to the community and brought into public examination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0907568213483780">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>We might ask here about issues of truthfulness. Are the memories of abuse real? Are the prisoners lying? The story of Haut de la Garenne faded a few months after I left England; the reports of physical evidence turned out to be false and the cases of abuse, while painful, were not as spectacular as initially reported. I am inclined to take this as a warning not to over-simplify what happens at Grendon. An important aspect of the psychopathy diagnosis is that the words of ‘psychopathic’ prisoners are believed to have no referent. In US prisons this can result in absolute indifference to suffering, since the expression of pain can make no claim on a response. Grendon’s approach to psychopathy is to immerse its residents in emotionally charged relationships with themselves and others, with peers often probing for honesty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0907568213483780">16</xref></sup> Arendt wrote of Isak Dineson that ‘The story reveals the meaning of what otherwise would remain an unbearable sequence of sheer happenings’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0907568213483780">Young-Bruehl, 2004</xref>: 377). The therapeutic community integrates sheer happenings in an attempt to forestall further, more harmful sheer happenings. This process of retrieval does not depend upon whether memories are precisely true or false but upon their re-enlivenment with social meaning.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>I want to end by turning briefly to the larger context informing the contrast I have drawn here. In the late 1970s and especially after 1980 the rehabilitative ideal was attacked from two directions. On one hand, conservatives promoted a punitive individualism with the view that ‘nothing works’ to rehabilitate criminals – and in a familiar story, supported draconian legislation and a culture of mass incarceration that promotes the idea that any attention to prisoners betrays their victims. What the US has discovered in the ‘psychopath’ is a way to disconnect violence from the traditional psychodynamic narrative that made it possible to imagine individual personhood as shaped by the specific contexts of family and social history. Regardless of how one might critique the contemporary cultural narrativization of self, it allows those who have harmed others the possibility of self-shaping in light of malign influence – the possibility, in other words, that they are persons who <italic>can</italic> be influenced and thus perhaps re-included, eventually, in society.</p>
<p>On the other hand, critics of the prison – following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0907568213483780">Foucault (1979)</xref> – point out that efforts at reform seem to be built into and fundamentally in service to the prison as a ‘rehabilitative’ institution. Reform of prisons and reform of individuals – often through various forms of confession – have always gone hand in glove, beginning with Bentham’s design of the panopticon and the early 19th-century assumption that social isolation led to redemption. This perspective has been taken up by the contemporary prison abolition movement, which eloquently argues that a rehabilitative ethos simply perpetuates the carceral regime.</p>
<p>HMP Grendon does not offer an answer to this conflict. Rather, I think of it as what Raymond Williams called the ‘residual’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0907568213483780">1977</xref>) – a place bypassed by the main trend of history but still present, still offering a glimpse of a lost world. Can we retrieve some part of this world, in which the injuries of those children who grow up to harm others are revisited through the practices of democratic community?</p>

<p>During my month at Grendon I formally interviewed 17 prisoners with stays ranging from under a year to five years, as well as seven staff members; quotes from prisoners and staff are from taped and transcribed interviews and have been edited and shortened. Research methods were reviewed for ethics and approved by the University of Washington Human Subjects Division as well as by HMP Grendon’s Research Advisory Group. Research in Washington State prisons was conducted between 1995 and 2002, included interviews with approximately 100 supermax prisoners, and was approved by the University of Washington Human Subjects Division.

<p>‘Therapeutic communities’ in North American prisons tend to be narrowly focused on drug use or sexual offenses and lack Grendon’s psychodynamic orientation and democratic tradition. James Waldram’s recent account of a sex offender treatment program in a Canadian prison offers a telling critique of its cognitive behavioral approach, which discourages inmates from discussing their own past abuse. Waldram suggests the term ‘habilitation’ as reflecting more accurately than rehabilitation the primary goal of risk reduction that informs most ‘therapeutic’ or treatment-oriented penality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0907568213483780">2012</xref>).</p>
