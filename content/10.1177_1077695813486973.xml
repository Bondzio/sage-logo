<p>Arguments about journalism and mass communication education have droned on for years. Whether colleges, schools, and departments should even have “mass communication” as part of their titles is a relevant topic, given the segmentation of the mass media market and the specific tailoring of media to the individual user. That, too, is an age-old discussion. And even the question of whether drones are useful in journalism programs is debatable. The University of Nebraska–Lincoln and the Missouri School of Journalism (and perhaps other schools) are offering courses that use drones as newsgathering tools in journalism.</p>
<p>A few colleagues are excited about the possibility of using unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) in our curriculum. But when I asked a group of students for their advice on drones, they said they did not regard drones as necessary. What they need, they said, is more video, more coding, and a media management course or module. I should point out that many of the students with whom I spoke were not solely journalism majors but were double majoring or minoring in journalism and political science or journalism and a language.</p>
<p>Although these students may not know it, their preferences reflect the sort of preparation and attitudinal disposition that Thomas Friedman espoused in his <italic>New York Times</italic> column on January 29, “It’s P.Q. and C.Q. as Much as I.Q” when he wrote that it will be necessary “to develop skills that are complementary to technology rather than ones that can be easily replaced by it.” It is essential to have not only IQ but also PQ (passion quotient) and CQ (curiosity quotient), he wrote. People will need to leverage digital tools not just to find a job but to invent or reinvent one, and not just to learn but to relearn for a lifetime.</p>
<p>As one of the latest newsgathering tools, drones are becoming a topic of conversation. The GEN (Global Editors Network) News Summer 2013: Hack the Newsroom! that will take place in Paris from June 19 to 21 will feature a session on drones. “Journalistic Experiments of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: Three Case Studies” promises to look at covering a demonstration from the air, and mapping a conflict or a catastrophe-hit area. “Reinventing Storytelling,” “The Rise of the Data Movement: Visual Storytelling,” “Design Is How It Works: Agile Systems and Responsive Design,” and “Will Newsgaming Become Part of the Strategy of Media Groups?” are just some of the other interesting topics.</p>
<p>Two other gatherings this summer are sure to include questions about the components and value of journalism and mass communication education in international contexts. Shortly after the GEN News Summit, from June 25 to 29, the conference of the International Association for Media and Communication Research will take place in Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland, and from July 3 to 5, the third World Journalism Education Congress, hosted by the European Journalism Training Association and the Flemish/Dutch Network of Journalism Institutes, will take place in Mechelen, Belgium.</p>
<p>I hope to report on some of these events in a future Editor’s Note.</p>
<p>In other news, “The State of the News Media 2013: An Annual Report on American Journalism,” by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism, points to two realities in its first three sentences—one, the power of social media, and two, the shrinkage of jobs in journalism.</p>
<p>“In 2012, a continued erosion of news reporting resources converged with growing opportunities for those in politics, government agencies, companies and others to take their messages directly to the public,” the report notes.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Signs of the shrinking reporting power are documented throughout this year’s report. Estimates for newspaper newsroom cutbacks in 2012 put the industry down 30 percent since its peak in 2000 and below 40,0000 full-time professional employees for the first time since 1978.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And yet there are occasional anomalies in this mediascape: Warren Buffett, for one, is buying up newspapers and seems confident that there is a future for them, especially for midsized and smaller papers.</p>
<p>The report reiterates what is already known—that social and mobile media will continue to grow and evolve, that there is no monetization of advertising content of the sort the legacy media have enjoyed, and that evolution thus far is slow. The report notes that it took one hundred years for Gutenberg’s printing press to make its effects pervasive. Of course, the pace of change has accelerated, and current changes are palpable far faster than those of Gutenberg’s day.</p>
<p>The most concerning statement in the report is, “This adds up to a news industry that is more undermanned and unprepared to uncover stories, dig deep into emerging ones or to question information put into its hands.” Although “understaffed” or “under-resourced” would have represented more inclusive word choice, the statement is alarming in that it raises issues about the inability of the so-called news media to report “news” accurately and truthfully, to uncover malfeasance, and even to distinguish between what is news and persuasion. Further concern is the fact that almost one-third of the respondents who provided data for the report have deserted a news outlet because it no longer provides the news and information they had been accustomed to. The report identifies six trends this year:</p>
<list id="list1-1077695813486973" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Newsroom cutbacks over the past decade have had serious consequences in eroding newsgathering and in alienating readers from traditional media;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The news industry continues to lose out on the bulk of new digital advertising;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is growth in the long-dormant sponsorship ad category;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The growth of paid digital content experiments may have a significant impact on both news revenue and content;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Local TV finds itself increasingly vulnerable although newspapers still command the spotlight as the first and hardest-hit industry; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Deeper news consumption is the result of people’s hearing about things in the news from friends and family, whether via social media or word of mouth.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>What we do know—from this report and others—is that there still is space for the traditional media, but they are not as powerful institutionally or politically as they once were. Mobile media and social media are growing in strength and number, but they do not have the sort of institutional power that the traditional media have occupied. So we occupy a sort of middle ground between the two. This puts enormous stress on journalism (and mass communication) education: educators in the journalism discipline are walking the high wire between the two, unable to concentrate all their efforts in media that are shedding real jobs and increasingly losing ground, yet challenged to prepare for ever-evolving new platforms. In a November 2012 report, “Post-Industrial Journalism: Adapting to the Present,” C. W. Anderson, College of Staten Island (City University of New York [CUNY]); Emily Bell, Columbia Journalism professor and director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism; and Clay Shirky, New York University professor, argue that journalism graduates need to have “soft skills” such as the ability to engage with persistent change, create and maintain a network, add value to information for an audience, demonstrate knowledge, link to sources, explain methodologies, and be entrepreneurial. They also should have “hard skills,” the authors say, including specialist knowledge, data literacy, an understanding of metrics and audiences, an ability to code, to manage projects, and to tell stories using various technologies.</p>
<p>Journalism educators face the challenges not only of changing media environments but also the challenges of changing educational milieus. Universities themselves are confronted with a tidal wave of change: Some of the elite universities are offering massive open online courses (MOOCs), and many public institutions are experimenting with MOOCs. Faculties are being challenged to deliver more and more online courses, facilitating the students’ individual control and convenience but often, and ironically, cannibalizing the faculties’ own in-class courses. Disciplinary change and changes to the delivery of higher education are converging to produce uncharted terrain. On a structural level, journalism and mass communication programs that have solid institutional support appear to do well. Take Arizona State’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, the School of Journalism at the University of Missouri, or the School of Communications at Elon University as just a few examples of apparently successful programs—successful, that is, in terms of innovation, student enrollment, faculty recruitment, productivity, resources, and so forth.</p>
<p>Not all programs, however, have major institutional or even donor support.</p>
<p>Even programs with massive student enrollment sometimes do not have the number of regular faculty or the operational budgets that they merit. Other programs, in states with changing demographics such as decreasing numbers of high school graduates, are facing enrollment declines. Some schools, such as the Indiana University School of Journalism, are being merged with other units, in the case of Indiana, with communications, telecommunications, and film studies into a single school. And yet others, such as the journalism school at the University of Colorado, have been phased out. In the case of Colorado, the school has been replaced by the journalism and mass communication program, listed on the university’s website as Journalism and Mass Communication (part of the Division of Academic Affairs), and as the Faculty of Journalism and Mass Communication in the handbook of the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications (ACEJMC).</p>
<p>All of these changes raise questions about the future of journalism education; about whether journalism units will continue to stand alone as colleges, schools, and departments; about the endowments of journalism schools and how they will transfer to or be incorporated into merged units; and about the very nature of journalism education—whether it centers around mostly training for employment and/or entrepreneurship or whether it truly is a broad-based liberal “education” that will prepare students for graduate or professional school, lifelong learning, or a myriad other paths.</p>
<p>Finally, I expressed my hope in my initial note that I would be able to attract some provocative editorial commentaries. When I received a note from Melvin Mencher, professor emeritus at Columbia University, about the end of his monthly <italic>Update</italic>, I invited him to submit a commentary about <italic>Update</italic> and his thoughts on journalism education. I am pleased to include Professor Mencher’s article in this edition.</p>
