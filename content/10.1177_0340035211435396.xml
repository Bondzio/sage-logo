<abstract>
<p>The aim of this paper is to present and analyse some examples of public libraries which have been especially designed for babies and toddlers in Portugal, termed <italic>bebetecas</italic> in Portuguese, highlighting the role the promotion of reading from a very young age plays in the reader’s development. Some projects implemented in these areas, particularly those which target the family as an audience, but which in some cases are also intended for day care centres and nurseries, create an increased awareness of the role of the library in the dissemination of children's books, as well as creating dynamic reading habits at an early age. This strengthens family ties and promotes healthier and more balanced child development. Taking family and school as two important contexts for the development of the readers, the library becomes a privileged space and vehicle to promote good reading practices from a very young age, and where books can act as the backdrop for interaction between young children, their families and care givers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Practices to promote reading in pre-readers – including very young readers from birth up to the age of 6 – are now established in a number of countries and incorporate official politics and programmes. These measures, some of which have been implemented for decades in pioneering countries and include the Bookstart project in the UK (1992), stem from the widespread consensus about the individual and social relevance of reading and the possibilities it provides individuals with, as well as awakening public and political awareness to early promotion of reading practices.</p>
<p>The development of reading occurs mainly in two contexts, family and school, which are crucial in the construction of the readers’ first perceptions of reading. These perceptions are largely determined by their first book experiences, in that the positive ones stimulate reading whereas the negative experiences have a tendency to put up barriers between the readers and books.</p>
<p>Research has shown that learning to read starts well before its formal introduction at school and is a process of lifelong learning. As a result, an awareness of reading should be started as early as possible within the family. Reading is the result of a highly motivating learning process and consists of steady progress, which demands, among other things, effort and attention. This is the case in the development of oral discourse, and includes not only a wide range of rich vocabulary and the knowledge of complex structures, but also the prior construction of concrete representations about the usefulness of reading. In this way, early contact with diverse written material, even if not exclusively literary material, plays a crucial role in making literature more appealing to the child, and providing them with meaningful experiences about the use of literature in a wide range of contexts. It is also important that the first reading experiences within the family unit be associated with pleasure, well-being and affection and constitute routines which in turn become habits. The aim is for external reading stimuli (attention from adults, playing games and reinforcement of parental affection) to become internalized (reading for pleasure), contributing to the development of autonomous readers. Besides the sheer pleasure of listening to a story, doing so on a repetitive basis has a positive effect on the language development of children and provides relevant experiences about language structures and the narratives themselves, thus establishing significant relationships between oral and written discourse. The discovery of symbolic language values and the aesthetic features which stem from language use within a literary context are other assets associated with these experiences. In cognitive terms, the relationship established between language development and organized narrative thinking is very relevant. The narrative structure for example, favours the acquisition of notions of temporal order and cause and effect. Many narratives for early childhood enable the reproduction of familiar scenarios, establishing relationships between them and their surroundings or clarifying abstract concepts through specific examples.</p>

<title>Parents and libraries</title>
<p>Parents should act as role models and the presence of books and reading habits should be natural within the household and associated to the family gathering around books to create moments of pleasure and affection. Generating daily routines which revolve around books and reading from birth can be complemented with the support of the librarian, the educator or from autonomous learning, particularly when it comes to choosing the most appropriate books or obtaining information about how best to exploit the materials available. Public libraries have always played a crucial role in the development of reading and have as their mission the establishment of specific areas and contexts for various target audiences, thus creating a connection between families and books. In the case of very young children, including babies and toddlers, this becomes even with more apparent with the development of <italic>bebetecas</italic>, specialized sections in libraries whose aim is to create an increased awareness of the importance of early promotion reading habits in families, in particular parents. By carrying out activities which involve handling books and developing oral discourse, the aim is to bring together a ludic dimension associated with entertainment, affection and socialization. Generally speaking, there are various relevant competences which are a focus for more or less specific ‘work' in this context, with a special emphasis on linguistics and narration as well as social and artistic areas. Even more generally, it is important to mention a relevant Portuguese reading project <italic>O meu brinquedo é um livro</italic> (My toy is a book) developed in partnership with the Association of Portuguese Language Teachers and the Association of Nursery School Teachers, together with various public and private institutions whose aim is to increase society’s awareness of the promotion of books and reading, particularly reading aloud to the child since birth. This scheme, which began in 2005, takes into account a large number of activities, including the training of parents and nursery school teachers, but also the publication of a range of support materials. This is the case with the brochure available online called <italic>Porquê ler ao meu bebé?</italic> (Why read to my baby?)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0340035211435396">1</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p>This initiative, among others, supports the main conclusions of this essay in relation to the development of reading competences, highlighting the importance of emerging behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0340035211435396">Sulby and Teale1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0340035211435396">Pressley 1999</xref>), and the role of the family in establishing a relationship of proximity and personal identification with books. In this way, this brief presentation about the situation in Portugal is supported by relevant studies from different areas, with special prominence given to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0340035211435396">Bamberger (1986</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0340035211435396">Goméz del Manzano (1986</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0340035211435396">Spiegel (2001</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0340035211435396">Poslaniec (2004</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0340035211435396">2006</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0340035211435396">Rigolet (1997</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0340035211435396">2009</xref>), among many others.</p>

<title>Portuguese <italic>Bebetecas</italic>
</title>
<p>The Portuguese public libraries service has been growing rapidly in the past two decades, as a consequence of a governmental rule which in April 1986 established a national reading policy determining an increasing role and functions for Portuguese public libraries. As a result, we have been witnessing the emergence of a strong public library network all over the country, through the creation and recreation, at a very good pace, of many libraries in almost every city. The library catalogues have also been completed and the offer in terms of activities has become more diverse. Statistics report that there were only 89 public libraries in Portugal in 1960, as against 1018 in 2003. Although there is no formal data on this aspect after that date, the number of libraries is still growing nowadays. Correspondingly, the number of readers also increased eight times between 1960 and 2003.</p>
<p>Following the IFLA <italic>Guidelines for Library Services to Babies and Toddlers</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0340035211435396">IFLA. Section of Libraries Serving the General Public 2007</xref>), the establishment of<italic> bebetecas</italic> in Portugal came into being through the creation of specific sections within public libraries, namely the children’s sections, or the reorganization of existing areas which underwent (re)decoration. The choice of alternative bookshelves, which are accessed more easily because they are almost at floor levels, the painting of the walls and the use of throw cushions and other objects which create comfort are strategies which are common in all existing <italic>Bebetecas</italic>. The use of specific and/or adapted furniture is also frequent and <italic>Bebetecas </italic>are very often enhanced with support material, as is the case with educational toys, games (such as puzzles, building blocks and other construction games), puppet stages, string puppets or musical instruments. <italic>Bebetecas</italic> stand out particularly in the way they organize numerous activities with relatively limited space and scarce catalogues, which put the imagination and creativity of the librarians and educators of the libraries to the test. Subsequently, the services on offer, which are increasingly more popular, generally include specific storytelling time (for babies and toddlers), ludic activities in which contact with books is involved, workshops for parents and ongoing clubs and projects. In some cases, in an attempt to meet the demands of parents and families, the libraries ‘publish’ and distribute short homemade publications which include reading suggestions (for parents and for babies and toddlers), advice and tips on how to promote reading and books in the family and at home and short thematic catalogues. In the case of some projects which have had external sponsorship, it is possible to access more materials which have been specifically created for use in the <italic>Bebeteca</italic>, such as reading passports (or reading identity cards) and reading ledgers for example. Telling and listening to stories, leafing through books, naming objects in them, playing with words through the listening and repetition of rhymes, chants, tongue twisters and hand clapping games are some of the most popular activities.</p>

<title>Best reading practices</title>
<p>In this section we look at some concrete examples of best practices developed in Portugal in this area. The selection process is random and took into account the diversity of proposals as well the extent to which these activities are distributed throughout continental Portugal. Whenever possible, cases which had external sponsorship and evaluation were chosen, making the analysis and the recognition of the project as an example of best practice more independent. Naturally, many other examples which are worthy of mention were not included, however, it is commendable that in recent years, after some pioneering examples, such as the Public Library in Beja, the opening of <italic>Bebetecas</italic> as well as the activities organized there have become widespread in Portugal.</p>
<p>With considerable experience in the early promotion of reading habits and of parental involvement in the development of reading skills, the Public Library in Beja has offered over the last few years various activities in the <italic>Bebeteca</italic>. This is the case of <italic>Rodas de Colo</italic> (Lullaby Circles), a project which focuses on enhancing the communication between mother and baby, targeted at mothers and babies up to one year of age. Examples include <italic>Patáti Patáta</italic> (One for Me, One for You), whose objective is to increase parents’ awareness of the importance of language development through playing with books and oral literature (chants, rhymes and other types of poems) aimed at parents and children between the ages of 18 and 36 months; and <italic>Histórias de Colo e Embalo </italic>(Lullaby Storytime), which tells stories to a group of parents and their children, who are aged between 3 and 5 years.</p>
<p>In Odivelas, a laboratory was opened which studies the results of early reading and is part of the Gulbenkian – Casa da Leitura (Gulbenkian – Reading Home) project. Called <italic>Dois braços para embalar, uma voz para contar</italic> (Two arms for rocking, one voice for storytelling), it promotes the sharing of books between adults and children between the ages of 9 months and 3 years. The groups, which cannot have more than 10 babies and toddlers, meet regularly in the <italic>Bebeteca</italic>, where different activities which promote reading are organized. The aim is to stimulate language development and children’s levels of attention and concentration, but more importantly to establish and strengthen long lasting bonds among children, parents and books. This study gave rise to a Masters in Library Studies directed by Susana Silvestre in Évora University and its findings can be found in various publications<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0340035211435396">2</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p>Some projects have had external sponsorship, namely by the prestigious Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, and are notable in the systematization of both the practical and theoretical activities which are organized at the <italic>Bebetecas</italic>. This is the case with the projects <italic>(A)Braços com a leitura</italic> (Embracing reading) at the Public Library in Chamusca, <italic>Cantinho do Embalo</italic> (Lullaby Corner) at the Afonso Lopes Vieira Public Library in Leiria or <italic>Nascido para ler</italic> (Born to read) at the Public Library in Santa Maria da Feira. What they all have in common besides the establishment of sections and specific catalogues is that these projects, given by professionals, revolve around regular activities based on specifically chosen themes and books.

<p>Other examples chosen include weekly activities which take place at the Public Library in Ílhavo on Saturdays, when it is easier for families to attend. In addition to story time, activities which provide interaction among the children, language development and motor coordination practice are organized, which take into account the competences of the young readers.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the libraries have created sections for babies and toddlers which are not limited to general use by the library goers but have also organized activities, thus creating routines and habits in both children and parents. These activities vary in terms of frequency, but are generally monthly gatherings which share the desire to promote regular contact with books, associating that contact with well-being and pleasure and demystifying many preconceived ideas about the relationship between the child on the one hand and books and reading on the other. This is the case with the <italic>Bebetecas</italic> in Vila Nova de Famalicão, Arouca, Seixal, Paços de Ferreira and many others. The fact that these activities, which were sporadic only a decade ago, have now become commonplace, shows an awareness of the individual and social importance of reading and the need to promote it from a very early age within the family. In Portugal, the clear shift in official discourses and practices may be due to the work carried out by the network of public libraries and the network of school libraries in recent years, which has resulted in the opening or renovation of many of these sections.</p>

<title>
<italic>Bebeteca </italic>catalogues</title>
<p>In terms of the creation of adequate catalogues for this group of readers, both in terms of toy books and literary works, in Portugal there is a clear imbalance of publications, since there are many translations, some of works by classic writers, as opposed to a lack of original Portuguese publications for pre-readers. As regards the board book – or even the reduced size book, which includes cloth, sponge, bath, pop-up and toy books, the only collection to highlight is the one by André Letria, a renowned illustrator in Portugal. Despite the fact that since the 1970s, the picture book has become an object of interest to some prominent writers, such as Maria Keil or Leonor Praça, only in the 1990s did the genre attract some local attention with Manuela Bacelar. In the last 10 years however, particularly as a result of the sudden international increase in the genre, there has been widespread interest, drawing the attention of publishers and writers alike. It is possible to bring together the translations of classic works by such names as Maurice Sendak, Leo Lionni, Eric Carle, Bruno Munari, Iela Mari and Tomi Ungerer, contemporary foreign literature by David McKee, Jutta Bauer, Anthony Browne and Lucy Cousins and Portuguese works which have seen some international acclaim, as is the case with works from the publishing company Planeta Tangerina. This is particularly evident in the publications created by Isabel Minhós Martins in partnership with the illustrators Bernardo Carvalho and Madalena Matoso. This publishing genre has been responsible for the most salient development in recent years in the area of Portuguese children’s literature, shedding light on a set of highly significant acclaimed works and writers.</p>

<sec id="section6-0340035211435396">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In response to the goals set by the <italic>Objetivos do Milénio</italic> (Millennium Development Goals), in particular the development of education and the promotion of reading, in relation to the service provided by public libraries and the guidelines set out by IFLA, it is clearly stated that these institutions “have a special responsibility to support the process of learning to read, and to promote books and other media for children. The library must provide special events for children, such as storytelling and activities related to the library’s services and resources. Children should be encouraged to use the library from an early age as this will make them more likely to remain users in future years” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0340035211435396">IFLA. Section of Public Libraries 2001</xref>: 26). In fact, as stated in the IFLA Guidelines, the first missions of public libraries highlight the importance of this target audience, stating that the library’s responsibilities include “creating and strengthening reading habits in children from an early age” (p. 88), highlighting in point four the importance of “stimulating the imagination and creativity of children and young people” (idem).</p>
<p>The projects presented here, as with other similar ones, provide a number of positive outcomes, particularly in relation to the way they involve the families in the process of training readers from an early age. The more or less implicit awareness that early reading practices are fundamental for the formal development of reading itself results from the work carried out by librarians, who provide parents with ongoing training. In practical terms, the opening of <italic>Bebetecas</italic> and the activities which are organized there enable the enhancement of library catalogues and collections, thus diversifying the publications on offer to this target audience, namely through the use of toy books for example, but also picture, interactive (lift-the-flap or pull-the-tag, etc), board and pop-up books. The same occurs in relation to the range of diversity in the strategies and activities organized in libraries, which clearly attract new publics. They are in essence, projects which are relatively simple to implement and economically feasible in the current economic climate, since they require comparatively low investment in terms of materials, reduced space (with some simple transformations to decoration and layout) and a fairly limited need for books. From a human resources perspective, the demands are greater, with the need for specific staff training and the importance of keeping group size small so that more personalized attention can be given to the children and their parents, who should continue stimulating long term reading experiences at home. Besides increasing libraries’ target audience to babies and toddlers, the production of supplementary material for the activities for parents, book selection, reading guidelines and reading tips and advice, in particular how to create stimulating reading routines and practices at home and within the family are fundamental in the library due to impact they are likely to have in the future. These materials, which can be homemade or of a more professional nature, especially with regard to graphic design, play an essential role in enhancing awareness and increasing family training. They are simple and appealing, resorting to images and photographs<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0340035211435396">3</xref>
</sup> and generally contain suggestions on the books which are most appropriate for babies, toddlers and young children (for example nursery rhymes, simple short stories, pop-up books, picture books and fairy and folk tales, among others) as well as clear guidelines saying when, where and how to read to children, listing examples of activities which are easy to carry out.</p>
<p>There are some important steps which need to be taken, such as the creation of a national database of<italic> Bebetecas </italic>and projects implemented in Portugal, and the analysis and publication of the evaluation of these practices so that conclusions can be drawn for the future. This was the case in Spain, with the publication of a book<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0340035211435396">4</xref>
</sup> called <italic>Primeros contactos con la lectura. Leer sin saber leer. </italic>(‘The first contact with reading. Reading without knowing how to’) published by the Germán Sánchez Ruipérez Foundation, which carries out an exhaustive description of the evaluation of reading promotion activities for children from birth up to the age of 6. Although they are slightly fragmented and isolated, the Portuguese projects need a common conceptual framework and appropriate theoretical and methodological support stemming from official policies to clearly and unequivocally promote reading in order to guarantee unity and sustainability and enable its development, both by its reach and by the enhancement and expansion of the activities which are organized. Examples of national programmes in other countries which have the abovementioned features and have had a strong impact include Bookstart<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0340035211435396">5</xref>
</sup> (The United Kingdom), Born to read<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0340035211435396">6</xref>
</sup> (USA) and Nati per leggere<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0340035211435396">7</xref>
</sup> (Born to read, Italy).</p>
<p>As has already been mentioned, the qualitative jump which took place in Portugal in the last decade is more related to the generalization of practices than the creation of infrastructures. These play an important role in the initial phase, bringing books closer to the reader but it was the increase in the dynamics of these library sections, through the effort and determination of the library staff, which had visible effects on the profile of the library members and their awareness of and training within the library itself. In the case of <italic>Bebetecas</italic>, they are places (and moments) where reading takes place and positive experiences are shared among the children and their families, with the library becoming a meeting place and a constant source of interest. The favouring of a sensory experience with books and reading through storytelling and song, looking at books and images, body movement, the handling of books and objects, particularly if the surroundings are simultaneously ludic and pleasurable is essential when the objective is to promote reading with very young age groups. <italic>Bebetecas</italic> are increasingly versatile, also open to disabled children, or those with special educational needs, to ethnic groups or those who are culturally marginalized and to immigrants, and are often the door through which the children and their parents enter the world of reading, and family literacy and socialization is promoted.</p>
