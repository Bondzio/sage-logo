<p>The heel stick, lancing the newborn’s foot with a narrow tube to collect blood, is most often performed immediately after the baby is born. However, in the typical birth story, there seems less discussion of the heel stick than the method of delivery, the baby’s first cry, or the APGAR scores (a test to determine the newborn’s physical condition). Heel sticks are taken for granted, perhaps invisible medical interventions that possibly register only when the parents notice the band-aid at the bottom of their baby’s tiny foot. Sociologist and health advocate, Rachel Grob’s grounded theory of newborn screening (NBS) programs in the United States reveals the monumental social, cultural, medical, and biological significance of the heel stick. This practice, a state mandated public health screening, is the most widely-used form of genetic testing in the United States. Grob explains that since the mid-1960s, when the phenylketonuria (PKU) test was developed, there has been a tremendous increase in testing of babies’ blood samples from one disease to over eighty genetic disorders—and counting.</p>
<p>Beginning her research in 2005, Grob was able to track NBS as its prevalence increased, rapidly spreading throughout the country. The vastly simplified media reports of NBS for the general population mislead most into thinking allopathic progress is universally good for babies. But as Grob consistently points out, “Nobody knows how many asymptomatic and mildly-affected children will be identified via NBS over time, since the epidemiological data now being collected for the entire infant population has never before been available” (p. 13).</p>
<p>Grob was literally a sociologist in real time witnessing the integration of a cutting-edge technological and political change as it was happening to families. As a result of the rapid growth of NBS over her study period, Grob had access to comparative groups of families who had certain screening options available to them and those who did not—a pre- and post-NBS comparison. Her snowball sample of over 50 parents of children with genetic disorders, overwhelmingly non-Hispanic white mothers, focuses specifically on cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder where the average life expectancy is 37 years. Her data collection and analysis includes parents with both symptomatic and asymptomatic children with genetic disorders that were revealed through the NBS, as well as parents who find out about genetic disorders when their babies become toddlers and older children.</p>
<p>The quality of the data and Grob’s presentation of informants’ stories are a testament to her skill as a situated and empathetic listener. Gripping, tragic, cogent, emotional, and haunting, reading through these narrative accounts and Grob’s interpretation of them achieves the effect of great sociological monographs—a lasting transformation of our affective comprehension of our social world. Her own concept of “parental knowledge” privileges the often-overlooked expertise of parents in confronting the integration of new surveillance technologies into everyday life. Furthermore, <italic>Testing Baby</italic> is critical of the ways certain parental voices have been used in policy promotion wherein the most dynamic and traumatized parents are deployed to establish screening protocols. The “urgency narrative,” as Grob calls it, of parental pro-screening advocates use the “save babies” strategy, which in effect drowns out any of the ambivalence or nuance of NBS as policy and practice. Commendable for her ability to keep the true urgency of some babies’ and families’ experience of NBS balanced with the dangers of a totalizing narrative of unequivocal benefits of mandatory screening, Grob navigates some dicey and challenging positions with aplomb.</p>
<p>NBS programs billed as procedures that always promote the benefit of the child and their family is challenged by Grob’s data. While this massive screening program accumulates data about species mutations or abnormalities, the high rate of false positives—and the uncertainty that the positive test will lead to manifestation of disease—creates untold suffering in the lives of many families. As Grob points out, the stages of NBS are in and of themselves a gauntlet, where the laboring parents are quickly thrown into the excruciating waiting period for confirmatory tests after initial blood screening. In the event of a positive genetic screening, families face the anxiety of disclosure outside of the nuclear family. Additionally, the book engages with rich substantive and theoretical themes such as the growth of risk discourse and the specter of the pre-symptomatic child. Grob’s study is a compelling example of William Ogburn’s cultural lag whereby NBS is introduced before our cultural norms, personal values, and interactive practices can accommodate such changes.</p>
<p>While there is much to recommend this book, particularly to medical sociologists and anthropologists, health policy advocates, and science and technology studies scholars, there does seem to be one missed opportunity. It would have been valuable for Grob to further analyze the way NBS changes the cultural investment and social definition of the infant. How has this pre-social creature of the baby been transformed through the ways we come to know about it and its vulnerabilities? While Grob does a fine job of talking about parents’ hypervigilance in caring for children with genetic disorders, it would be a major contribution to theorize through her data on the ways that infants and children have come to mean different things for parents through the advent of knowing more and more about them before we meet them.</p>
