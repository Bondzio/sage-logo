<p>As the subtitle indicates, this book examines how political entities constituted by multiple group identities reconcile pluralism with the imperatives of defining and constructing national identities. The primary focus of the book is Canada during the 1990s. Winter characterizes this period as constituting a ‘multicultural transformation of national identity’. During that decade, multiculturalism emerged as a legitimate discourse through social processes whereby it ‘acquired a different meaning, from a seemingly group-rights based approach to a much stronger and openly acknowledged emphasis on individual choice’ (p. 7). The larger aim of the book is to offer an analysis of a reconstituted multiculturalism in the 1990s through a focus on how the image of Quebecois nationalism facilitated the multicultural inclusion of ethnically diverse immigrants into a Canadian national identity. Winter investigates this shift through an empirical focus on how the national, English-speaking majority in central Canada came to conceive and represent itself as normatively pluralist during this time. Drawing on two Toronto-based English-language newspapers, Winter proposes a neo-Weberian framework of ethnic-pluralist group formation that situates ethnic identities in unequal power relations and foregrounds how diversity is normatively incorporated within the representations of the nation. However, Winter is adamant that pluralism cannot be reduced to a strategic tool employed by strong majorities to contain weak minorities. Instead, pluralism is conceptualized as ‘a negotiated compromise between admittedly unequal groups’ (p. 8). This negotiation produces a ‘multicultural we’ and emerges through a triangular relation in which two dominant unequal national groups are confronted with a third group that poses a real or imaginary threat, thereby effecting a compromise.</p>
<p>The book is divided into four parts that are organized along introductory considerations, theoretical considerations, empirical analysis, and concluding analysis. In Chapter 2, Winter provides a concise historical context of the Canadian society as an immigrant country and notes the place of multiculturalism as official policy in Canadian history. This chapter poses the main empirical questions alluded to above and introduces different minority issues and groups that have been salient in public and political debates over Canadian national identity. Although the chapter primarily focuses on the emergence of Quebecois group identity, the role of other immigrant and ethnic identities in Canada is also noted.</p>
<p>Part 2 is a combination of a detailed literature review of pluralism studies from the post-World War Two period to the 1990s (Chapter 3) and the development of a neo-Weberian framework (Chapters 4–5). In Chapter 3, Winter identifies two theoretical puzzles that emerge from pluralism studies. The first relates to the existing literature’s split among the concession/containment dimension. Winter notes that while theorists like Charles Taylor and Will Kymlicka view multiculturalism as justified concessions by majority groups to minority groups seeking integration, other critical theorists view multiculturalism as a policy of containment of ethnic groups through which economic inequalities are reproduced and cultural differences essentialized. The second relates to the theoretical gaps between theories of nationalism and theories of multiculturalism. Winter addresses both these theoretical issues through proposing a theory of ethnicity in which identities of both majority and minority groups are constituted in relation to each other through processes of social closure. Chapters 4–5 develop this framework through drawing on Max Weber’s sociology of ethnic relations and nation building. In these, Winter questions the ethnic/civic dichotomy that informs dominant accounts of modernization and typologies of nationalism and argues that all social groups contain both ethnic and civic dimensions. However, particular features are emphasized by different groups based on whether they form majority or minority groups. ‘Civic’ features are likely to be used as signifiers in self-descriptions by majority groups while ethnic features are likely to be adopted by, or attributed to, minority groups. These distinctions are produced in contexts of unequal power relations which set the terrain on which minority groups constitute themselves as ‘different but equal’. Thus discourses of difference are a function of differential access to power and not of essential ethnic, cultural or religious difference. Furthermore, different national self-understandings produce distinct approaches to pluralism. Winter differentiates between multinationalism and multiculturalism to argue that certain types of multiculturalism do not involve a transformation of the national imaginary in pluralist terms. The latter transformation is most likely when the national majority becomes aware of its own particularity as a group that shares social space with other groups.</p>
<p>With this theoretical framework, Winter turns in Part 3 to an empirical discussion of the book. In Chapter 6, Winter describes her data sources. The data essentially include news items and op-ed articles from two newspapers – Toronto-based editions of <italic>Globe and Mail</italic> and <italic>Toronto Star</italic> – between 1992 and 2001. Winter emphasizes that the importance of replacing exclusive us/them binaries with a triangular matrix of group relations is suggested by the data themselves when subjected to the rigor of extensive reading and analytic testing. In Chapter 7, Winter argues that the case of Canada depicts that a multicultural national identity is likely to emerge when the national majority is self-aware of its own identity as a particular identity and when it does not have the will or power to impose its own identity upon other groups. But even given these historical conditions, a multicultural identity continues to depend on how its Others are perceived. Thus, English Canada/Quebec comparisons on the one hand and Canada/US comparisons on the other have been essential in the construction of a multicultural national identity comprising both unified national and heterogeneous multicultural dimensions in Canada. Chapter 8 analyses the shift from binationalism to multiculturalism in Canada through the notion of ‘dual majority’. On the one hand, multiculturalism emerged as a compromise between English and French identities and thus did not propose itself as an accommodation for immigrant or ethnic minorities and Aboriginal peoples. In the 1990s, however, the conflict between the two ‘founding nations’ created the space for the gradual entry of these latter groups into a pan-Canadian national identity. One of the reasons for this transformation was a shift in discourse itself such that individuals and not communities were narrated as being integrated within the regime of multicultural recognition. Chapter 9 shows that within newspaper discourses, three distinct narratives – republicanism, liberal-pluralism, and liberal-multiculturalism – upholding a reconstituted multiculturalism emerged. The idea of Canada as a multicultural nation formed the ‘smallest common denominator’ in all of these, thus attesting to the consolidation of multiculturalism as a social imaginary in Canadian political discourses in the 1990s. Winter concludes the book by arguing that the containment of Quebec separatism and the ‘decommunitarization’ of multiculturalism have the potential to consolidate and further entrench multiculturalism within Canadian national identity.</p>
<p>On the whole, <italic>Us, Them, and Others</italic> presents a useful and optimistic account of the potential of multiculturalism when it is historically integrated with national self-understandings. It will interest students of group formation, transformation of identities, and discursive approaches to nationalism. It should however be noted that many basic and generally accepted ideas within sociology of group formation and theories of nationalism (such as critiques of community/society and ethnic/civic dichotomies and the relationship between theories of nationalism and multiculturalism) are presented as novel theoretical debates. Furthermore, a large part of the book is concerned with discussion of a range of literatures that at times appear disconnected. These discussions also occupy a central place in the empirical chapters, which, as it were, emerge quite late in the book. Notwithstanding these minor concerns, <italic>Us, Them, and Others</italic> remains an ambitious study that engages with a wide range of theoretical perspectives to present an interesting and useful account of the rise of a ‘multicultural we’ in Canada.</p>
