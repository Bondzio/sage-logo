<abstract>
<p>Increased residential development around lakeshores is associated with reduced wildlife habitat, lower biodiversity, and degraded water quality. One way to improve degraded lakeshores is riparian buffers. To accomplish this goal, one approach used by stakeholder groups focused on protecting lakes is to subsidize the costs of restoring native plants that lakeshore property owners can reestablish in more highly developed areas of their lakeshore property. Little research has explored how to increase participation in these programs. Two different coupons were mailed out randomly to subscribers of a county lakes and rivers association located in northwest Wisconsin. The message strategy tested builds on the “zero-price effect,” which posits that when faced with a choice between two product options, one of which is free, people respond more readily to the free offer as if the zero price not only implies a low cost of buying a product but also increases its perceived valuation simply in its being characterized as free. Households received a coupon that read “Free pack or $5 off” with the “free pack” as the visually dominant element or a coupon that read “$5 off or free pack” with the “$5 off” designed as the visually dominant element. Otherwise, the coupons were identical. Half of the households randomly received the first coupon and the other half received the second. Coupons could be redeemed at one of five participating nurseries. As hypothesized, results indicated the “free pack” coupon offer was more attractive to recipients with almost twice as many redemptions.</p>

<p>Residential development around lakeshores in the Upper Midwest has increased significantly in recent decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524500412466073">Baker, Schussler, &amp; Snyder, 2008</xref>), with a number of ecological concerns co-occurring with this trend (Henning &amp; Remsberg, 2009). Pristine riparian zones around lakes are biodiversity hotspots, with a wider range of native plant species found in undeveloped as compared to developed lakeshore property parcels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524500412466073">Elias &amp; Meyer, 2003</xref>). More highly developed lakeshores have also been associated with greater prevalence of algae in adjacent lakes, which may be due in part to runoff from lawn fertilizer (Rosenberger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524500412466073">Hampton, Fradkin, &amp; Kennedy, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Higher levels of lakeshore development (e.g., neatly manicured lawns and constructed, sandy beaches) can also have an impact on wildlife that depends on shoreline vegetation for habitat, and residential impacts near the shore may disrupt lake food dynamics by altering the presence of some species (Brauns et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524500412466073">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524500412466073">Lindsay, Gillum, &amp; Meyer, 2002</xref>; Rosenberger et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524500412466073">2008</xref>).  For example, research has found a relationship between the presence of forest understory by the shoreline and abundance of both frogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524500412466073">Woodford &amp; Meyer, 2003</xref>) and birds (Henning &amp; Remsburg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524500412466073">2009</xref>). Another study found a reduced level of vegetative cover in littoral areas adjacent to developed shores was associated with lower mean sizes for certain fish species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524500412466073">Radomski &amp; Goeman, 2001</xref>). When fish are smaller and less plentiful, anglers may experience a lower quality fishing experience as well.</p>
<p>One cost-effective way to improve degraded lakes is riparian buffers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524500412466073">Amato, Shaw, &amp; Haack, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524500412466073">Kramer et al., 2006</xref>). To accomplish this goal, one approach used by county land and conservation departments and other stakeholder groups focused on protecting lakes is to subsidize or discount the costs of restoring plants that lakeshore property owners can use to reestablish native vegetation in more highly developed areas. Social marketers also emphasize the potential of monetary incentives to encourage adoption of a targeted behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524500412466073">Kotler &amp; Lee, 2008</xref>; McKenzie-Mohr &amp; Smith, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524500412466073">1999</xref>). Offering property owners coupons to offset the initial costs of purchasing native plants at local nurseries has been recommended as one strategy to promote natural shorelines (Shaw, Radler, &amp; Haack, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524500412466073">2011</xref>). Importantly, previous researchers suggest that the way in which coupons are framed may impact the rates in which they are redeemed (Yin &amp; Dubinsky, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524500412466073">2004</xref>). However, little research to date has explored how to increase lakeshore property owners’ participation in programs designed to increase natural foliage along the lake’s edge to provide new wildlife habitat and protect water quality (for an exception see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524500412466073">Amato, Shaw, &amp; Haack, 2012</xref>). Drawing from the fields of social marketing and behavioral economics, this study explores which communication strategies might be more effective in pursuing these aims.</p>

<title>Zero-Price Effect</title>
<p>This study examines how seemingly simple changes in promotional messaging may influence the percentage of people who choose to redeem a coupon for native plants as part of a campaign to encourage natural shorelines. Specifically, this study builds on past research indicating that when faced with a choice between two product options, one of which is free, people respond more readily to the free offer as if the zero price not only implies a low cost of buying a product but also increases its perceived valuation simply in its being characterized as free (Shampanier, Mazar, &amp; Ariely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524500412466073">2007</xref>). This unique effect related to how people appraise the value of a free product has been dubbed the “zero-price effect.” Evidence suggests the main reason for this psychological effect is that a product that is free appears to elicit more positive affect than predicted by a standard cost–benefit analysis, and this emotional response serves as an input in an individual’s decision-making process (Shampanier et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524500412466073">2007</xref>). The authors explain that positive feelings arise because free offers imply only benefits and no costs. Although research on the zero-price effect is a new area, existing studies have found support for the phenomenon including receiving a “free” breakfast when staying at hotels (Nicolau &amp; Sellers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524500412466073">2012</xref>) and selecting gift certificates or consumer goods like chocolate (Shampanier et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524500412466073">2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Research Objectives</title>
<p>Based on previous literature, it appears that there may be a qualitative perceived difference for “free” compared with other prices or values—in other words, coupons offering “free” native plants with a value of $5 might be expected to be redeemed at higher rates as compared to “$5 off” native plants even though they are functionally the same offer. The primary objective of this study was to examine which promotional direct mail strategy is most effective in terms of maximizing coupon redemptions for buying native plants among lakeshore property owners. In this study, we hypothesized that a coupon offering a product—native plants—that is “free” for a value of $5 will be redeemed at significantly higher levels than a similar coupon offering a $5 off discount on the same product.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The coupon was sent out as part of a larger social marketing campaign called Share Your Shore designed to encourage natural shorelines in Burnett County located in northwest Wisconsin. Coupons were sent out with the Burnett County Lakes and Rivers Association newsletter titled LakeLines to a subscriber mailing list of 3,672 households. Along with the newsletter a color booklet called the Top 10 Native Plants for Burnett County was mailed, which described the type of wildlife the different plants would attract and featured plants that were most likely to survive the area’s sandy soils. Two different versions of the coupon were sent to lakeshore property owners in Burnett County. The first one had “$5 off or free pack” with the $5 off designed as the visually dominant element and the other coupon said “Free pack or $5 off” with the free pack as the visually dominant element (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524500412466073">Figure 1</xref>). Otherwise, the coupons were identical. Equal numbers of each coupon were randomly distributed to households on the newsletter mailing list. Random distribution was achieved by enclosing coupons into newsletters that were numerically sorted by zip code and randomly inserted into bulk mailing trays. Coupons could be redeemed at one of five participating nurseries in the county that stocked the 10 native plants featured on the associated booklet. There were no returns from the mailing because “or current resident” was included on the address label and furthermore the mailing list is continually updated based on the most current tax rolls. When people came to the nursery to redeem their coupons, a poster display indicated which native plants qualified for the coupon promotion.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>In total, 263 coupons were redeemed. Of those, about two thirds were the free coupons, and this proportion would have been higher if not for nursery #4, which had a notably lower free coupon redemption rate (closer to 50% and similar to that for the $5 off coupon) than the other nurseries. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524500412466073">Table 1</xref> summarizes the distribution of coupons redeemed at each of the five nurseries that participated in the natural shoreline promotion.</p>
<p>On the face of it, it appears that more people redeemed the free coupons, but to scientifically test this conclusion the data must be statistically analyzed to determine the probability of the obtained results as compared to chance. To determine whether more people tended to use the free coupon than the $5 off coupon, a chi-square goodness-of-fit statistic was applied to the data. The goodness-of-fit test compares the frequency distribution of a single categorical variable against a theoretical frequency distribution, that is, it tests the match or fit between an obtained sample frequency distribution and a theoretically expected frequency distribution. Because an equal number of coupons were randomly distributed—each to half of households in the study—and because both versions of the coupon have the same absolute dollar value, we can assume the expected redemption rate (or distribution) of the coupons to be 50–50. Put another way, the null hypothesis being tested is that the coupons would be redeemed in equal proportions. Using the combined totals of both redeemed coupons, a goodness-of-fit test was performed on the observed distribution of coupons (174 vs. 89) to determine if it differed from expected distribution (roughly 132 for each). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524500412466073">Table 2</xref> summarizes both distributions and the difference from the expected distribution. The chi-square goodness-of-fit test was highly significant (χ<sup>2</sup> = 27.5, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001), indicating that the obtained distribution (which showed that people tended to use the free coupon rather than the $5 off coupon) would happen less than 1 of the 1,000 times by chance alone. Thus, the null hypothesis of “no difference” was rejected, confirming that significantly more of the “free” coupons were redeemed.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Results from this study suggest that seemingly small changes in marketing messages can substantially influence how people respond to them. It is important to remind the reader that there was no functional difference in the messages contained within both coupon versions. Both gave the recipient $5 worth of native plants. However, a simple inversion of the messaging—focusing on the $5 free versus the $5 off—significantly altered response to the promotion.</p>
<p>According to the Direct Marketing Association, the average response rate for direct mail is 3.42% for a “house list”—compiled based on responses to previous mailings (Direct Marketing Association, 2010). In this study, the “free pack” offer produced a slightly higher-than-average response rate of 4.73% while the $5 off offer produced a slightly lower than average response rate of 2.42%. After learning that the “free pack” was more effective than the $5 off offer, all recipients of the Burnett County Lakes and Rivers Association newsletter received the “free” coupon in the following year’s native plant coupon promotion. In support of the findings reported on in the results, the coupon redemption rate was a directionally similar 5.8%, an increase over the previous year. This increase in the redemption rate may possibly be explained by the ongoing “Share Your Shore” campaign to increase awareness about the benefits of natural shorelines.</p>
<p>It should be noted that reestablishing $5 worth of native plants along the shoreline (if that is in fact where property owners placed their new plants) is not likely to make a tangible difference in the ecological health of a lake. Any lakeshore property owner committed to the idea of establishing a more natural shoreline would have to obtain significantly more plants than the $5 free or $5 off discount offer would allow for. Future research should also look at whether the free offer resulted in a greater overall purchase of plants as compared to the $5 discounted offer—or whether they were just more likely to pick up $5 in free plants from a local nursery.</p>
<p>Most of our results across nurseries were consistent in demonstrating the free-price effect. However, it should be noted that people who redeemed their coupons at Nursery 4 did so at similar percentages for both the $5 free versus the $5 off coupon offers. Despite thorough investigations to ascertain this anomaly in the data, we were unable to identify a systematic difference and attribute this difference to random variation as might be expected in any study though we cannot definitively state that this is the case.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the characteristics of our sample may have influenced their participation in the coupon promotion reported on in this study. For example, previous research has found that coupon redeemers tend to have both greater income and more education than non-redeemers (Levendahl, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524500412466073">1988</xref>). Arguably, this might be the case for our sample, which was primarily comprised of individuals who owned their lakeshore properties as second homes. Regardless, future research should examine how different target audiences respond to coupon promotions.</p>
<p>While this study specifically looked at distributing native plants to promote natural shorelines, similar types of marketing scenarios exist for other environmental products (e.g., compact fluorescent light bulbs, low-flow shower heads, low-flow toilets). The results of this current study strongly suggest that future research on green marketing campaigns that require purchase of a new product or service should test whether the “free” promotion helps to advance campaign goals in other social marketing contexts.</p>
