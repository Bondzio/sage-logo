<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this research is to use the reports of school nurses to facilitate the understanding of how schools experience and manage asthmatic, anaphylactic, and diabetic emergencies by quantitative and qualitative analysis of online surveys. E-mails with a link to SurveyMonkey® were sent to all U.S. members of the National Association of School Nurses (13,695). Subjects were asked to describe their self-reported knowledge, opinions, practices, and experiences with such emergencies and the devices used to manage them. Regarding the frequency of emergencies in a given school year, the medians were 8 for asthma, 0 for anaphylaxis, and 10 for hypoglycemia. Twenty-two, five, and one subjects, respectively, reported that events like these resulted in deaths during their careers as school nurses. These diseases create substantial potential for emergencies in schools, and the schools represented by these nurses appear to be somewhat, but not ideally, equipped to handle such crises.</p>

<title>Problem</title>
<p>Some chronic diseases, including asthma, allergies resulting in anaphylaxis, and diabetes, have the potential to cause immediate, life-threatening situations. These three diseases are also unique, because they all require immediate access to devices that deliver medication to prevent potentially deadly outcomes. The device could be a rescue inhaler (asthma), an epinephrine autoinjector (anaphylaxis), or glucagon (hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes). All of these devices contain a medicine that can slow or stop an attack of the disease. Understanding how these medical devices work and determining the proper time to use them can be a substantial challenge and responsibility for school nurses and other school personnel. The competence and expertise of school nurses in managing these emergencies is not the only issue of concern. School nurses work in a social environment of limited resources, so their attention to these issues must account for the fact that nonnurse staff are often involved in identifying and responding to such emergencies. Many schools do not have full-time nurses on the premises at all times when students are present. In Ohio, for example, a school nurse covering 7 schools and 2,400 students had to choose between treating a hypoglycemic student at one school and another student suffering from an asthma attack at a different school. After stabilizing the student with diabetes with glucose tablets, the nurse rushed to treat the student with asthma with nebulizer treatments. In the end, both students were fine, but the situation could have easily escalated with deadly consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840511420726">Horovitz &amp; McCoy, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1059840511420726">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of this research is to use the self-reported knowledge levels, opinions, practices, and experiences of school nurses to understand how schools experience and manage emergency situations involving asthma, anaphylaxis, and diabetes, and the devices used to treat these emergencies. Emergencies can happen during the school day or during after hours/off-campus activities, so school nurses and other personnel should be prepared to deal with both situations. Policies related to student self-carrying of devices are also considered. In addition, the school nurses’ knowledge/training related to these diseases and the availability of a school nurse to respond if an emergency arose are assessed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1059840511420726">
<title>Significance</title>
<p>It is important to determine how well prepared school personnel are at preventing emergencies. In Florida alone, schools called 9-1-1 over 6,000 times during the 2003–2004 school year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840511420726">Horovitz &amp; McCoy, 2005</xref>). School decision makers need to understand the significance of emergency situations at school and be prepared to handle and, preferably, prevent these situations. Having well-prepared plans and knowledgeable, well-trained staff can save lives. If children can spend more time in the classroom rather than recovering in a hospital, society as a whole will benefit. Logically, this can also have an effect on parent productivity, for they might have to miss work to attend to their child’s emergent situation and related consequences. In addition, teachers may need to spend extra time to get the student caught up with the rest of the class, which would add up to a substantial burden on our school system. Any treatment that can help students be in school, rather than out sick, could be important in reducing the economic burden to the school and to society as a whole.</p>
<p>In the event of an emergency situation, it is imperative that school policy and school personnel provide for the well-being of the student. Although some schools may be prepared for these emergencies, their plans of action may have room for improvement. If they do not have action plans in place, schools should be made aware of the urgency and importance of forming them. The results of this research will help to determine how prepared schools are to handle emergency situations related to asthma, anaphylaxis, and diabetes. Also, these results will hopefully point the way toward improvement. Because the vast majority (93%) of the subjects of this research was actively working as school nurses when they completed the survey, we expect the findings to represent a “best-case” scenario. This is so because many schools do not have nurses, and school districts that employ nurses do not always have a nurse present throughout the day at each school. For example, a study of (primarily) Florida school nurses found that the average nurse spent 15.4 hours at each school per week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840511420726">Johnson &amp; Hayes, 2006</xref>). Maughan found that only 13 states met the 1:750 nurse to student ratio recommended by the National Association of School Nurses ([NASN] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840511420726">Maughan, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511420726">Malone and Bergren (2010)</xref> recount the NASN reports that only 45% of schools have a full-time nurse, and 25% have no nurse at all.</p>

<title>Epidemiology and Economic Impact of These Disease States</title>
<p>In 2007, almost 23 million people had asthma, and about half of these experienced an asthma attack that year (American Lung Association, 2011). In that same year, the direct and indirect costs of asthma amounted to nearly 56 billion dollars. In 2006, there were over 14.5 visits to a doctor’s office, outpatient clinic, or emergency room for asthma. This number has declined since 2004 but still represents a large investment of resources (American Lung Association, 2011). The statistics for prevalence in 2007 show children of age 5–17 had the highest rate of any age group. Almost 10% of the children in that age group had the disease.</p>
<p>For a serious asthma attack, a person may need to go to an emergency room, which happened almost 1.7 million times in 2006. The number of asthma deaths in 2005 was 3,884. Between 1999 and 2005, 789 children died of asthma, averaging 113 per year (American Lung Association, 2011). In 2006, 131 children under the age of 15 died from this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840511420726">American Lung Association, 2011</xref>). Because asthma is such a common disease of childhood, it can result in many missed school days. It is estimated that about 15 million school days are missed due to students having complications from their asthma (American Lung Association, 2011). Finally, one study seeking to determine at what age (or grade) an asthmatic child is capable of safely self-carrying his or her own inhaler had found that only 13 (38%) of the 34 student participants passed the assessment. The mean passing age was 12 years old and the mean passing grade was 6.54 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511420726">Flower &amp; Saewyc, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Allergies affect over 50 million Americans and are the sixth leading cause of chronic disease in the United States, costing 18 billion dollars in health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840511420726">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 2003</xref>). There is no cure for allergies. Allergies are the most frequently occurring chronic condition in children and limit 40% of children’s activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511420726">Branum &amp; Lukacs, 2008</xref>). Food allergy occurs in 8% of children younger than 7 years of age. Fifty thousand visits to the emergency room occur each year due to food allergies. Ninety percent of all food allergic reactions are due to milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts (e.g., walnuts and cashews), fish, soy, shellfish, and wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840511420726">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Approximately 100 Americans, usually children, die each year from food-triggered anaphylaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511420726">Branum &amp; Lukacs, 2008</xref>). Most fatal anaphylactic reactions occur with people who have peanut or tree nut allergies along with asthma and do not have access to an epinephrine autoinjector. Teenagers with food allergies and asthma have the greatest risk of an anaphylactic reaction, because they often eat away from home more than people of other age groups. Teenagers are also less likely to carry their medications and often ignore the symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction. Allergies to insect venom that cause anaphylaxis kill between 40 and 100 Americans each year. Approximately 1% to 6% of the population has a latex allergy, and 10 deaths occur each year due to this type of allergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511420726">Branum &amp; Lukacs, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Almost 24 million (7.8% of the population) children and adults have diabetes, and 5.7 million of these people are unaware that they have this disease. Every year more than 400,000 new cases of diabetes are reported in people up to age 24 in the United States. In those aged 20 or older, 11.5 million women, 12 million men, 14.9 million non-Hispanic Whites, and 3.7 million non-Hispanic Blacks have diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840511420726">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1059840511420726">
<title>Treatment and Devices</title>
<p>Several medications are available for asthma. The two main categories are long-acting medication and quick relief medicine. Long-acting medicine prevents an asthma attack from occurring and includes inhaled corticosteroids. A rescue inhaler, such as albuterol, is used during an asthma attack to reverse smooth muscle constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840511420726">Kelly &amp; Sorkness, 2008</xref>). A person must have easy access to the rescue inhaler in case of an asthma attack. Approximately 60% of asthma deaths in children came from a sudden asthma attack. A sudden asthma attack is an overwhelming—versus gradual—onset of symptoms. Sudden attacks may be fatal within an hour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511420726">Greiling, Boss, &amp; Wheeler, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The immediate treatment for anaphylaxis is an injection of epinephrine. Patients at risk of anaphylaxis can obtain a prescription for an epinephrine autoinjector, which is a single dose of epinephrine. Patients (including most school-age children) should carry the epinephrine autoinjector with them at all times in case of an emergency situation. The epinephrine autoinjector effects will last between 10 and 20 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840511420726">Facts and Comparisons, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Patients with diabetes require constant care and monitoring. Those with type 1 diabetes must frequently monitor their blood glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511420726">American Diabetes Association, 2007</xref>). In addition to blood glucose monitoring, persons with type 1 diabetes and some with type 2 diabetes must inject insulin via a syringe, pen, or pump.</p>
<p>Patients should have a snack or glucose tablets nearby in case their blood glucose drops too low. In an emergency hypoglycemic situation, glucagon is injected to raise the patient’s blood glucose to a stable level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511420726">American Diabetes Association, 2007</xref>). If too much insulin is injected or if the patient has been exercising strenuously, they may experience hypoglycemia. They may feel shaky and dizzy, turn pale, be confused, and even have a seizure. In such a situation, it is imperative that the patient receives treatment immediately with glucose tablets or some other form of sugar. If the patient is nonresponsive, an injection of glucagon is needed immediately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511420726">American Diabetes Association, 2007</xref>). This situation could happen at any time, including during school.</p>

<sec id="section6-1059840511420726">
<title>Action Plans and Laws</title>
<p>Asthma, anaphylaxis, and diabetes are three serious disease states that schools must be prepared to handle. Of course, best practice requires school nurses to develop individual health plans for every student under their care. Developing Individualized emergency action plans to manage each student’s life-threatening disease is required by federal law. Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination against students with disabilities in public schools. Besides having an individualized emergency action plan in place for a life-threatening emergency, finding ways to prevent the emergency is also required. This can include accommodating a student in the classroom and finding a safe and appropriate place to take medication. For example, in gym class, if a student thinks he or she is going to experience an asthma attack from exercise, the student should be permitted to sit out without any sanctions. For a student with anaphylaxis, the school needs to provide alternative meals in the cafeteria so that an anaphylactic reaction can be avoided. Finally, the school has to ensure that the blood glucose levels of students with diabetes are checked, and insulin injected if necessary. Constantly reviewing an action plan will help accommodate each student’s needs and provide a safe, fair, and healthy school environment for students with life-threatening disease states.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>We created a server-mounted questionnaire via SurveyMonkey.com<sup>®</sup> and purchased a list of the e-mail addresses of all members of the NASN. This list included 13,803 e-mail addresses. All identifiers were removed from the list, and we sent e-mails via SurveyMonkey to all of these addresses that were within the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands (13,695). SurveyMonkey removed 115 of these addresses for technical reasons, resulting in a total of 13,580 e-mails being sent. These e-mails included a hyperlink that took them directly to the questionnaire. We set up a SurveyMonkey protocol so that no more than one survey would be accepted from any single IP address. After the e-mail blast was concluded, the NASN placed a brief announcement and explanation of the research in their weekly electronic newsletter along with an invitation to the reader to click on a hot link that took them directly to the questionnaire. There were 2,049 useable questionnaires (all completed by current or former school nurses), only 9 of which resulted from the newsletter announcement. If these 9 responses are excluded, the response rate from the e-mail blast was approximately 15% (2040 of 13,580). This research was approved by the Midwestern University Institutional Review Board on March 19, 2010.</p>
<p>School nurses were asked about their disease state knowledge, their school policies for handling students with life-threatening diseases, their opinions about these school policies, and any emergent/life-threatening experiences they have faced while on duty.</p>
<p>The survey was divided into five domains: Background (includes characteristics of the subjects and their schools/school districts); knowledge (includes assessment of knowledge of the three disease states and related devices of interest as well as knowledge of applicable rules and regulations existent in the subjects’ jurisdictions); experience (includes subjects’ estimates of how widespread these life-threatening events are and their descriptions of specific emergency events and how they were handled at their schools); policy (includes exploration of the policies and practices actually used by the schools where these nurses work); opinion (includes subject viewpoints regarding how serious these potential emergencies are, the best possible practices and policies that would minimize risk in this area, and other attitudes). The survey ends with an open-ended question that asks subjects to write about any other thoughts they have on these matters.</p>
<p>Knowledge, policy, and opinion questions were taken from the relevant literature pertaining to each of the three disease states and their related devices. Experience questions required school nurses to recall and describe emergency situations resulting from the presence (or lack thereof) of these diseases and devices in schools.</p>
<p>The survey was first reviewed for face validity by two pharmacy administration faculty and three clinical faculty members at the College of Pharmacy. More importantly, it was pilot-tested via administration to three school nurses, who were asked to provide suggestions for improvement. As a result of these assessments, the questionnaire was modified several times to ensure clarity and validity.</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics (frequencies, measures of central tendency) were used to analyze the quantitative data. Variables with missing data were not included in any analysis. Due to the volume of qualitative data provided by the subjects in response to open-ended questions, we decided that it was not practical to code and analyze it. Instead, the researchers used a consensus framework to agree on a small subset of comments that were most insightful. These are presented below as illustrative of the situation in schools and not as scientific summaries.</p>

<p>When asked in an open-ended question how nurses were deployed in their school/districts, subjects provided a wide range of descriptions. One public health nurse stated the nurse to student ratio is 1:3500. Another nurse said that one full-time nurse is responsible for 520 students. Still another said that her district has one nurse for medically fragile students in special education and two others to cover chronic health diseases, such as diabetes. Another said that her district has a set standard for assigning nurses: 1 per each 1000 students. One subject reported that “med clerks,” who have about 4 hr of training, are allowed to give scheduled medications under many circumstances. One said that her district has one nurse to cover kindergarten through 12th grade.</p>

<sec id="section10-1059840511420726">
<title>Knowledge</title>
<p>Respondents were very confident when rating their knowledge levels of the three disease states of interest (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059840511420726">Table 2</xref>). This confidence was backed up by their results on three simple tests. Subjects were given three unambiguous test questions taken from drug information sources for each of the three disease states for a total of nine questions. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059840511420726">Table 2</xref> also shows their average score on these three tests as well as their average combined test score (i.e., for all three tests together). A close examination of results revealed that anaphylaxis tests scores were lower primarily because about 25% of these subjects did not know that an epinephrine autoinjector can also be used to treat asthma and about a third were unaware that an additional epinephrine autoinjector may be injected after 10–20 min if symptoms remain unresolved. Finally, about 90% of these school nurses were correct in knowing that their respective states had passed laws allowing students to self-carry their own rescue inhalers</p>

<p>When asked to describe the most critical event/emergency they have experienced, the numerous subjects who responded provided a rich repertoire of anecdotes. One of the most common themes was children not being properly treated and cared for at home and, also, not bringing their devices to school. Many of these comments have important implications for the question of whether school decision makers should keep rescue devices on hand with standing orders (if allowed by law) to use them when needed. We chose what we judged to be the single most revealing comment for each of the three devices of interest.</p>
<p>In Regard to Asthma Attacks, one Respondent Stated:<disp-quote>
<p>The student required 9-1-1 transport because she did not have an inhaler at school or at home—the family had failed to obtain a new prescription. We used controlled breathing techniques and encouraged her to drink warm fluids while we waited for the paramedics. They administered a rescue inhaler to her on arrival, and she improved. We still sent her to the hospital so she would be able to return to school with a new inhaler. The student returned the next school day with an inhaler and did well the remainder of the school year.</p>
</disp-quote>With anaphylaxis, it was very common for these school nurses to report anaphylaxis resulting from bee stings and ingestion of peanuts. One subject described a noteworthy situation:<disp-quote>
<p>Unknown cause, while student was participating in outdoor physical activity. Giant hives all over body, chest tightness, breath sounds were clear, but stock Epipen<sup>®</sup> given anyway under medical director’s advice. Ambulance called, student transported for treatment, received IV Tagamet<sup>®</sup>, IM Benadryl<sup>®</sup>, and prescription for decreasing dosage of prednisone. Came to school the next day with written orders and Epipen<sup>®</sup>.</p>
</disp-quote>Descriptions of hypoglycemic emergencies were also quite insightful. One nurse said:<disp-quote>
<p>This happens enough with my diabetic students. Usually the student is given juice and rechecked in 15 min to make sure the blood glucose rises to an appropriate level. A snack is usually given unless it’s time for lunch. Well, one day the student was taking a nap (nap time in Kindergarten). I had just checked on her 20 min ago. Now she was unresponsive. Her blood glucose was in the 40s. Glucagon was given and the student immediately became conscious. She was able to eat a snack and her blood glucose was in the 90s. Her family picked her up to the doctor.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1059840511420726">
<title>Policy</title>
<p>These nurses reported that it was a common practice for their school policies to allow students to carry rescue inhalers (88%) and epinephrine autoinjectors (70%). It was not as common for glucagon (42.5%). The subjects also reported overwhelmingly that students undergo assessment before being allowed to carry rescue inhalers (84.4%) or epinephrine autoinjectors (71%). For glucagon, the number was much lower (45.7%). According to respondents, most school decision makers had developed device guidelines: rescue inhalers (89%), epinephrine autoinjectors (85.6%), and glucagon (65.3%). Also, at most schools, such devices were kept on hand: inhalers (78%), epinephrine autoinjectors (88%), and glucagon (68.4%). Due to the wording of this question, though, it was not clear how many of these were stored for individual students and how many were kept on hand for general emergency use. In most cases, however, the devices were stored in the school nurse’s office, although some subjects reported that epinephrine autoinjectors were stored in the cafeteria and inhalers in the gym.</p>
<p>When asked to describe other practices they employ to better ensure that these devices are used properly, subjects explained a multitude of interventions that they use. Two types of responses clearly emerged: proper training of students and staff and open communication among school nurse, staff, students, parents, and health care providers in the community.</p>
<p>Action plans were common for both in-school use and out-of-school events, such as field trips, bus rides, and extracurricular activities (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1059840511420726">Table 4</xref>). Furthermore, approximately 95% of these school nurses reported that nonnurse school personnel are made aware of these disease states, and about 92% are trained in recognizing the signs of asthma attacks, anaphylaxis, and hypoglycemia. Finally, these school nurses felt that they were well trained in proper technique for all three devices (99%, 99%, and 90%, respectively).</p>

<p>Subjects were also asked to review a fixed choice list of positions and indicate which of these are allowed to administer medications in their schools (see<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1059840511420726">Table 4</xref>). Other personnel identified as being trained and allowed to administer medications included bus drivers, security personnel, janitors, kitchen staff, and coaches. More precautions seem to be in place when it comes to glucagon relative to inhalers and epinephrine autoinjectors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1059840511420726">
<title>Opinion</title>
<p>Approximately 91% of subjects believe that use or misuse of these three devices has potentially important health consequences. In addition, they expressed high levels of confidence in their training and ability to handle such diseases, devices, and emergencies: inhalers (94%), epinephrine autoinjectors (92.4%), and glucagon (81.8%). They were considerably less confident in the ability of nonnurses to handle such situations: 65%, 56.4%, and 48%, respectively.</p>
<p>When asked what else could be done in schools to better ensure that these devices are used properly, respondents described a plethora of creative ideas. The first is the importance of proper communication among physicians, parents, and school administrators, teachers, and school nurses. School nurses mentioned the importance of holding conferences with staff members and parents to discuss each student’s medical history. Individualized emergency action plans are a way to achieve the same end without perhaps needing to schedule as many conferences. The second issue is the importance of effectively training staff and students in how to use the devices. There was one very pragmatic response that caught our attention:<disp-quote>
<p>Having been in my position for the past 9 years has helped me to familiarize myself with many of the students and their parents. However, because I cover so many school(s) I find the following to be essential: (1) annual update of medical health plan; (2) list of all students with health concerns distributed confidentially to staff at beginning of school year; (3) general review/training with staff on use of EpiPens<sup>®</sup>, inhalers, seizure management and glucagon etc.; and (4) field trip, afterschool, bus plans in place with necessary staff training.</p>
</disp-quote>In regard to self-carry, subject opinion varied by device. For rescue inhalers, 95.6% thought that self-carry was appropriate, 86% for epinephrine autoinjectors, and only 60% for glucagon. Most of these school nurses felt that there should be certain conditions in place before a student is allowed to self-carry. These included age (73%), training (77%), certification (43.7%), and authorization of important parties, primarily parents, physicians, school nurses, teachers, and/or administrators (77.8%).</p>

<title>Comparisons</title>
<p>Although this is a descriptive study, we did look at the relationship between some variables that could logically and meaningfully be associated with one another. We reasoned that knowledge and policy should ultimately have an effect on experience (especially the number of times it was necessary to call 9-1-1). All analyses done in this regard were bivariate. Alpha was set a priori at ≤.05, and only significant or otherwise noteworthy results are presented.</p>
<p>Independent sample <italic>t</italic> tests were used to observe associations between times that these subjects called 9-1-1 and several important policy variables. Nurses reporting that their school policies require action plans were significantly more likely to have reported calling 9-1-1 in an average school year for all three types of emergencies than those that did not require such plans. The same was true for those reporting that their school practice is to use action plans for out of school activities (e.g., field trips). Out-of-school action plans for diabetes were the exception. Nurses at schools with such plans reported calling 9-1-1 more often than those without but the difference was not significant. No significant relationships were found for the times 9-1-1 were called and whether school personnel are made aware of potential life-threatening diseases, whether school employees are trained in recognizing signs of emergencies, or whether the nurse reported that she had been trained in the proper technique for using these devices.</p>
<p>We used Pearson correlations to identify associations between scores on the knowledge tests and times that subjects called 9-1-1. These results showed significant positive correlations between times called 9-1-1 for anaphylaxis emergencies and both anaphylaxis test score (<italic>r</italic> = .088) and combined test score (<italic>r</italic> = .063).</p>
<p>Finally, we used Pearson correlations to examine the relationship between years of school nurse experience and the four actual test score variables shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059840511420726">Table 2</xref>, and all variables shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1059840511420726">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1059840511420726">4</xref>. In regard to knowledge (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059840511420726">Table 2</xref>), we found significant positive relationships between years of experience and anaphylaxis (<italic>r</italic> = .156) and total (<italic>r</italic> = .141) test scores. In regard to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1059840511420726">Table 3</xref>, we found significant positive relationships between years of experience and the number of students that carry glucagon pens (<italic>r</italic> = .054), the number of times in an average school year that anaphylaxis was observed (<italic>r</italic> = .086), and the number of times 9-1-1 was called for both anaphylaxis (<italic>r</italic> = .088) and hypoglycemia (<italic>r</italic> = .084). We found significant negative relationships between years of experience and whether the subject had encountered an asthma attack (<italic>r</italic> = −.129), anaphylaxis (<italic>r</italic> = −.179), and hypoglycemia (<italic>r</italic> = −.123). No significant relationships were found between years of experience and the policy variables shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1059840511420726">Table 4</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>School nurse coverage of schools varies widely according to these subjects (e.g., 1 nurse for 520 students vs. 1 nurse for 3500 students). The school nurses responding to this survey have high knowledge levels regarding these diseases and devices and are well equipped to handle the crises investigated here. Other school personnel, though, might have difficulty in the absence of a nurse. In fact, at least two studies have reported that unlicensed personnel are less likely to follow good practices and policies than are school nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511420726">Kelly, McCarthy, &amp; Mordhorst, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840511420726">Reutzel, Patel, &amp; Modi, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>These diseases and related devices create substantial potential for the occurrence of serious health crises in the school setting. A large number of students carry these devices, and respondents reported noteworthy levels of attack frequency and times that it was necessary to call 9-1-1. The number of deaths reported by these subjects might seem relatively low but could be an understatement. This is especially true, given that the number of deaths at schools or from school-related activities resulting from these three types of emergencies are not routinely recorded and stored in a database. Without specific details surrounding each case, it is impossible to know the extent of the problem in schools. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511420726">Malone and Bergren (2010)</xref> used media account of school rescues and school deaths and found that school nurses played a role in all 15 rescues reported and were not present at two of the four deaths. They also argue that school nurse leaders should try to quantify student safety outcomes, and they explicitly mention the importance of early interventions for complications resulting from asthma, diabetes, and anaphylaxis. In any event, school decision makers should be evaluating policies to make sure that as many of these incidents as possible are prevented.</p>
<p>Access to rescue devices also seems to vary widely across schools. Self-carry is allowed in many of these venues as is the storage of stock devices. Many nonhealth personnel have access to devices, but not all are adequately trained. Action plans were common, and most school nurses reported that nonnurses are made aware of students with these disease states and trained in recognizing the symptoms of attacks. An overwhelming proportion (91%) of these school nurses believe that the use or misuse of these devices carry important health consequences.</p>
<p>Bivariate analyses revealed some important results. First, nurses at schools with action plans (for both in and out of school) reported calling 9-1-1 more often than those at schools without such plans. We interpret this as a positive finding, because it is better to err on the side of caution, and the presence of action plans seems to result in a more proactive approach by school nurses and other personnel. Also, the fact that subjects with higher test scores on both the anaphylaxis and combined tests were more likely to make 9-1-1 calls supports the notion that enlightenment can lead to more aggressive responses to these emergencies.</p>
<p>Bivariate results also suggest that more experienced school nurses tend to be more knowledgeable. The seven significant relationships between years of experience as a school nurse and variables in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1059840511420726">Table 3</xref>, however, are a bit more difficult to interpret. It would seem that more experienced nurses might work at larger schools and/or might be more willing to allow students to self-carry glucagon and more vigilant when it comes to calling 9-1-1. Also, since experience is negatively correlated with whether or not the subject had experienced any of the three types of emergencies, it seems that more experienced school nurses are more likely to prevent these attacks from occurring. The only caveat is that experience is positively correlated with the number of times anaphylaxis was observed in an average school year. This could be the result of school size. Our data set did not allow us to control for size.</p>
<sec id="section16-1059840511420726">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Because the survey used in this research relies on memory, it is subject to the limitations inherent in such an approach. However, the survey does not seek to explicate abstract and complicated psychological constructs, so its reliability and validity should be comparable to questionnaires used in similar research projects.</p>
<p>The type of design and method used (a nonrandom sample coupled with an electronic survey) creates the potential for response bias. The questionnaire was server mounted, and follow-up of nonresponders was not possible. The survey was conducted during the summer when school nurses may have limited access to e-mail. Bias may also result, because it is likely that the school nurses most engaged in their profession would belong to their national school nurse association. Also, within the association, it is possible that the most engaged members completed the survey at a higher rate than those less involved. This type of bias is conservative, though, because if this research has indeed attracted the most engaged school nurses, then the situation described here, as troublesome as it is, could be much worse when considering schools as a whole. This is especially true when we consider that many schools do not have a school nurse present at all. In addition, like surveys of the members of any profession, respondents may try to advance their own school nurse agenda. If so, this would result in a conservative bias as well.</p>
<p>Because the survey could be completed on any computer at any time, respondents could have used the Internet, text books, and other sources of information to look up the correct answers to the knowledge test questions. This could have resulted in an upward bias on test scores. Finally, the term glucagon pen was used in the survey. While this may be a common phrase used by many to describe a glucagon kit, we found that its acceptance is not universal. Many subjects reported that this was a cause of confusion for them.</p>
<p>In spite of these shortcomings, we think a server-mounted approach to data collection has merit. It is very unlikely that we could have secured over 2000 subjects via telephone or mail methods.</p>

<sec id="section17-1059840511420726">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>These results suggest that the schools where these nurses work do quite well in regard to these emergency situations, especially given the resource-depleted situations they face. Nurses and other school personnel should continuously seek ways to strengthen their processes. This could include training lunch room workers or bus drivers to be aware of device use as well as signs of emergent situations. If the bus drivers are not school employees, school administration could seek to have training mandated in the contract with the transportation system.</p>
<p>Because we approach these issues as pharmacy educators, we also must make mention of the fact that pharmacists are easily accessible health care providers and able to serve as a resource for schools when it comes to managing these disease states and medications. For example, pharmacists can work with physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, students, parents, and school decision makers to prepare individualized emergency action plans. Pharmacists can also assist school personnel and school nurses when planning diabetes and allergy management for special situations, such as standardized testing, field trips, and in-class parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840511420726">Lawlor et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, the pharmacist can answer common questions that the student or parent might have.</p>
<p>Any intervention that increases communication among school personnel, students, parents, and health care providers can only bring positive results. Whether it is a consult with an allergy clinic or pharmacist, or development of a proficiency test, communication and finding the right way to treat each child are keys to success. Without further attention by policy makers at the state, district, and school levels, shortcomings in these areas will inevitably continue.</p>
