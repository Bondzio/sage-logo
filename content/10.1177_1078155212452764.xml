<abstract>
<p><bold>Background and objectives:</bold> The chemical contamination during the preparation of cytotoxics remains a serious problem in hospital pharmacies and the operators could contribute to this risk during their manipulations. A validation protocol was developed using a non-toxic, highly detectable tracer, quinine dihydrochloride.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> Further, a method for a high recovery extraction and quantification of this marker, and a protocol covering the critical operations of cytotoxic preparation, was developed and validated. Various devices were used to fill the syringes and perfusion bags. All the filled containers and used materials were collected at the end of the protocol and the tracer was extracted in water. The contaminated water was analyzed by fluorimetry. The number of spots on the working pads was counted under ultraviolet light. During a total of 28 sessions, the procedure was applied by 20 different operators.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean cumulated quantities of contamination were 6.2 µL (0.6–23.8) and &gt;10 spots (0–20), which was considered as high. No correlation was observed between the contamination rate and the operator’s experience.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This validation protocol facilitates controlling the operators’ working ‘cleanliness’ and helps to improve the initial and continuing training. This simple test presents an effective answer for the important issue of the chemical safety of operators.</p>

<p>Since the early 1980s, the preparation of injectable antineoplastic drugs and other cytotoxic products for adult and pediatric oncology units has been regularly performed in hospital pharmacies. This trend is based on two core rationales. It is aimed for a better protection for the nursing and the medical staff, who previously prepared these toxic medications in unprotected conditions, as well as ensuring better safety for the patients, supported by the quality assurance system implemented in the production units of hospital pharmacies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212452764">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155212452764"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155212452764">4</xref></sup> However, an important problem remained after the transfer of this activity from the nurses to the pharmacists. A number of studies have actually reported a contamination of the operators with the cytotoxics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212452764">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078155212452764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078155212452764"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1078155212452764">29</xref></sup> with two possible sources. These sources include a production residue on the primary packaging of antineoplastic drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078155212452764">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155212452764">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078155212452764">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1078155212452764">30</xref></sup> or a contamination by the operator during the production of the final drug for patients at the pharmacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212452764">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078155212452764">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078155212452764">28</xref></sup> These mechanisms led to a contamination of the syringes and infusion bags or the work area in the pharmacy. The follow up to this contamination has been tended by various methods. These controls can be performed by directly determining the cytotoxic levels on the working surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212452764">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212452764">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078155212452764">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078155212452764">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1078155212452764">29</xref></sup> or from the biological fluids (blood and urine) of the operators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212452764">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155212452764">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078155212452764"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078155212452764">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078155212452764">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078155212452764">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1078155212452764">31</xref></sup> However, the latter techniques present several drawbacks, such as the complexity of the analytical methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1078155212452764">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1078155212452764"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1078155212452764">34</xref></sup> as well as the theoretical risk of contamination during the analytical process itself. Moreover, the above mentioned approaches do not differentiate between the contamination due to the manufacturer and the one related to the manipulation in the hospital pharmacy. Therefore, it would be interesting to estimate the contamination produced during the preparation process. This would facilitate taking adequate measures to improve the teaching of the operators, if necessary. The selection of a non-toxic, sensitive, and easily quantifiable tracer would make it easier to bypass these problems. This would allow easy simulation of the routine operations as well as validation of the procedures and the operators. Several markers have been proposed in the literature for tracing the contaminations. Radioactive substances, such as technetium are very sensitive tracers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1078155212452764">35</xref></sup> However, their use is difficult because of the necessary protective measures to be taken for their manipulation. Another alternative solution is the use of fluorescent markers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1078155212452764">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1078155212452764"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1078155212452764">38</xref></sup> Fluoresceine, for instance has a higher sensitivity in comparison to other fluorescent tracers, but is inconveniently visible (yellow-orange solution). Thus, the operator could be abnormally attentive during the validation process. Quinine dihydrochloride (QdHCl) is natively fluorescent, non-toxic, invisible to the naked eye, soluble in water, and relatively easy to detect under ultraviolet (UV) rays, with a high selectivity and detectability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1078155212452764">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1078155212452764">40</xref></sup> Thus, it appears to be an ideal tracer for measuring the contamination during the preparation procedures.</p>
<p>The present study included two main objectives. First, it aimed to develop and validate a simple method using the QdHCl as a tracer. This would facilitate evaluating the contamination level by simulating the preparation of the injectable cytotoxic drugs. Second, the method was applied through a practical standard operating procedure (SOP) to different operators for checking their ability to work in a clean manner. This could help to avoid spreading the contamination in the environment or on the final preparation to be delivered to the wards. Based on the obtained results, new specific training has to be organized for the operators with the most contamination to correct their working methods.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1078155212452764"><title>Development and validation of the quantification of the tracer</title>
<p>A 0.1 µM solution of QdHCl in water for injection (WFI) was prepared to establish its fluorimetric spectrum. An excitation wavelength and an emission wavelength at 330 nm and 380 nm, respectively, were determined. The limits of detection and quantification were determined by the Eurachem approach based on the use of a target value for the area of the relative standard deviation (RSD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1078155212452764">41</xref></sup> The calibration curves were carried out at concentrations between 0.1 and 1 µM in WFI to test the linearity at five points. This was done three times for each point (0.10, 0.15, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 µM). Precision and accuracy were tested at 0.1 and 1.0 µM.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1078155212452764"><title>Development and validation of recovery of the tracer from the contaminated devices</title>
<p>The contamination of the working pads was evaluated semi-quantitatively by counting the number of stains found under the UV light, owing mainly to the absorbent nature of the liners. It was necessary to develop a simple and efficient quantitative extraction method to recover the contaminant (QdHCl) dropped on the gloves and the infusion bags. A number of previous studies have been based on wiping pads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212452764">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212452764">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1078155212452764">42</xref></sup> wetted with organic solvents (methanol) or alkaline solutions, where the contaminants were later extracted in another solvent.</p>
<p>In the present study, the tracer being used was well soluble in water. Thus, the extraction method was tested by complete immersion of the gloves, bags, and other contaminated devices in a glass beaker, containing 500 mL of WFI. This solution was stirred for 5 min. The contaminated water was directly analyzed by fluorimetry. The recovery was tested at two different levels of contamination: low (1 µL) and high (5 µL) and on two different devices: 50 mL NaCl 0.9% infusion bags and sterile non-powdered gloves. Either 1 or 5 µL of the 0.1 M solution of QdHCl was placed on each device. Subsequent to drying of the solution, the device was immerged in 500 mL of WFI.</p>
<p>To control the recovery rate, the fluorescence measured on the devices was compared with the standard solutions of 0.1 and 1.0 µM of QdHCl. The test on each device was repeated six times per day, for 3 days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1078155212452764"><title>Development of the operators’ validation protocol</title>
<p>To simulate the preparation of the lyophilized cytotoxics, 10 mL vials were filled with 10 mL of a 0.1 M solution of QdHCl. Later, they were placed in an oven at 90°C and their content was completely desiccated. After the vials were sealed with stoppers and capsulated, they were washed and checked under UV light for absence of any outside contamination.</p>
<p>A preliminary test was developed to check the feasibility of the operators’ protocol. A laboratory chemical fume hood was used to simulate the working conditions in the negative pressure biological safety cabinets class III.</p>
<p>For the preliminary test, a working pad was installed with all the necessary materials. For the entire test, the operator wore Chemprotect® gloves covered by a pair of other sterile non-powdered surgical gloves. Three vials of desiccated QdHCl were reconstituted with 5 mL of WFI. Overall, 2 mL of the solution was removed from each vial and added to a separate 50 mL NaCl 0.9% infusion bag. The covering gloves were changed after each bag.</p>
<p>At the end of the procedure, the working pads were observed under UV light to count the number of spots (only the number and not the dimensions were considered). A semi-quantitative scale was used to determine the contamination rate: low (0–5 spots), medium (6–10 spots), and high (&gt;10 spots). The diameter of the spots was not taken into account as the average size of the spots was less than ø 3 mm.</p>
<p>The contamination on the covering gloves and the infusion bags were separately measured by the previously developed quantitative method.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1078155212452764"><title>Operators’ validation protocol</title>
<p>The developed method was finally implemented in the real working environment, that is, the negative pressure biological safety cabinets class III placed in a class C GMP (ISO 7) clean room. Every operator’s validation session was performed in the presence of another validation operator, a junior hospital pharmacist, who controlled all the manipulations and the process timing (not exceeding 1 h).</p>
<p>All pharmacists and pharmacy technicians working in the cytotoxic preparation unit were required to prepare a fixed number of syringes and infusion bags in the isolator with a solution of QdHCl in a limited period of time. They were asked to follow precise instructions and adopt the same working procedures such as those used for the cytotoxics preparations.</p>
<p>For each operator, 10 desiccated vials of 0.1 M QdHCl were prepared, as previously described. The first step for the operator involved dissolving the desiccated QdHCl powder with 5 mL of WFI for all the 10 vials. Subsequently, the entire contents (50 mL in total) were transferred into an empty 50 mL sterile and clean vial. A short administration tubing set was installed on an infusion bag, and 15 mL of the QdHCl solution was transferred using a 20 mL syringe into the bag. A 100 mL vesical instillation syringe was filled with 15 mL of quinine solution and locked with a special cap. Another 50 mL infusion bag was completely emptied with a 50 mL syringe and the remaining QdHCl solution in the 50 mL vial was transferred with the help of a transfer-set into this bag. Finally, all the materials were collected in seven separate plastic bags (quinine vials, two infusion bags, vesical instillation syringe, other operational syringes, covering gloves, absorbent working pad and small wipes used to avoid aerosolization during solution retrieval from the vials).</p>
<p>The spots of the QdHCl solution on the working pad were counted under UV light. The contamination on the external surface of the objects was measured by the previously developed quantitative method. The correlation between rates of contamination (expressed in cumulated quantities of contamination in µL) and the operator’s years of experience was evaluated.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1078155212452764"><title>Development and validation of the quantification of the tracer</title>
<p>The LOD and the LOQ of the spectrofluorimetric method were determined at 0.008 µM and 0.025 µM, corresponding to a contamination of 0.05 and 0.15 µL of a 0.1 M solution of QdHCl, respectively.</p>
<p>The linearity was tested in the range of 0.1–1 µM. The correlation coefficients (r) obtained from the plot of experimental values as a function of theoretical values were always greater than 0.9985. It was observed that the intercepts and the slopes were not significantly different from 0.00 and 1.00, respectively (Student t-test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Thus, the method provided a linear response without systematic errors (fixed or relative). Repeatability and reproducibility were calculated as relative standard deviations (RSD): repeatability results were in the range of 2.1–5.0% (0.1 µM) and 0.8–2.0% (1.0 µM) and reproducibility results were in the range of 2.6% (0.1 µM) and 1.1% (1.0 µM) for the six replicate determinations.</p>

<p>A simple method was developed to measure the rates of contamination during the preparation of cytotoxics using a novel tracer, which targeted the spillage during the production process. It was observed that the protocol was easy to implement in any facility and was an important support to the quality assurance of the operator’s training.</p>
<p>The results showed significant contamination rates with a large inter-individual variability, which confirmed the interest of the conducted experiment. In most of the validation sessions (22/28), the contamination rates on the devices were less than the mean value. However, for the spots, only seven of them could be considered as ‘clean’ (zero spot) and more than half had a ‘high’ contamination. In the real-life scenario, the working pads were changed after each production session (maximum of 1.5 h), according to the operating procedures. There was no strong relationship between the contaminant quantity collected on the surface of the different devices and the number of spots detected on the working pad, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1078155212452764">Figure 2</xref>. The number of spots was high for one third of the operators having low surfaces contamination. It showed that most of the operators had to learn to manage the final preparation contamination and the working site contamination.</p>
<p>No significant correlation was observed between the years of experience of the operators and the contamination rate, even if all contamination quantities over 10 µL were related to the operators with 5 or less years of experience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1078155212452764">Figure 3</xref>). This suggested that specific individualized training is necessary to control chemical contamination and that the working appropriateness is not automatically obtained after several years of activity.</p>
<p>The present method in comparison to some of the previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1078155212452764">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1078155212452764">37</xref>,43</sup>–using tracers to set the general scoring and validation of the staff, focused more on the quantitative and detailed evaluation of their ‘cleanliness.’ The final goal was to identify the more contaminating operators, review their training and through comparison, decrease the mean contamination rate over time. At first glance, the results obtained could be considered as an acceptable level of contamination. However, according to the very strict 0.1 µL limit of the Georgiadi et al. study, the results could be considered to be extremely high.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1078155212452764">35</xref></sup> As both conclusions remain very subjective and as the protocols cannot be directly compared, there is a difficulty in interpreting the observed contamination rates in terms of risk and fixing an acceptable limit. In the context of the Food and Drug Administration specifications for the establishment of cleaning validation methods, some limits have been proposed by industry representatives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1078155212452764">44</xref></sup> These include analytical detection levels (10 PPM), biological activity levels (1/1000 of the normal therapeutic dose), and organoleptic levels (no visible residue).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1078155212452764">45</xref></sup> If these limits are applied to the contamination levels of the operators, the potential risk associated with the mean value of 6.2 µL would depend on the pharmacological activity of the active ingredient of the prepared cytotoxic drug.</p>
<p>For instance, for 5-fluorouracil with a daily dose of 1000 mg, the acceptable 1/1000 limit corresponded to 1 mg or 20 µL of contamination for a usual 50 mg/mL solution. For the tested operators, the contamination was equal to ca. 0.03–1.2 mg. It should be noted that if the measured contamination of a relatively low active substance such as 5-fluorouracil is acceptable for 90% of the operators, then, for two operators, a new specific training to learn cleaner working procedures and revalidation would be mandatory.</p>
<p>Conversely, with a highly active cytotoxic substance such as vincristine with a daily dose of 2 mg, the acceptable 1/1000 limit would correspond to 2 µg or 2 µL of contamination for a usual 1 mg/mL solution. In the present case, the contamination is below the acceptance limit for only 8 of 28 sessions. Thus, the training of a majority of the operators would have to be revised.</p>
<p>The two examples are helpful for evaluating the limits of the acceptance criteria for the contamination levels. However, an absolute risk level for the operators could not be clearly set up. Large-scale studies such as Monitoring-Effekt-Studie für Wischproben in Apotheken (MEWIP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1078155212452764">46</xref></sup> or monitoring-effect study for wiping samples in pharmacies) are used for evaluating the surface contamination of Carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic for reproduction (CMR) substances in pharmacies preparing cytotoxic injectable drugs in Germany. These help to establish the average limits and the statistical milestones by benchmarking. This is an interesting approach that can be applied to the present procedure when a larger number of results will be accumulated.</p>
<p>The present validation protocol offers an effective answer for the important issue of chemical security of the operators by following the well-known schemes of media-fill tests for microbiological contamination. Thus, the implementation of such validation protocols in other hospital pharmacies preparing cytotoxic injectable drugs parallel to the mandatory media-fill validation tests for operators would help to standardize the preparation methods. Further, it would also help to decrease the contamination levels through the improvement of the operating procedures, not only from a microbiological point of view but also regarding the hazardous drugs contamination.</p>
<p>This protocol can also be used to check the appropriateness of the devices used for preparing the injectable cytotoxic drugs. Further, it can be used to easily evaluate whether some of these devices could be considered as a closed-system, as regard the chemical contamination.</p>
<p>The present study does not set any objective limit for the acceptable level of contamination. Thus, the analysis of these results cannot be directly correlated to the risks for the operators’ health. However, they provide rather a quantitative indicator for the contamination level and a tool available to conduct education programs, in a continuing improvement spirit. In our setting, we considered that any operator having a contamination level above the mean level is a candidate for a new training program.</p>

<sec id="sec14-1078155212452764" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>QdHcl solution, as a simulating working solution, is an ideal tracer for testing the contamination during the preparation of cytotoxic injectable drugs. As a non-hazardous marker, it is easy to detect using a sensitive method. Further, it is also invisible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>The present validation method helps in testing all operators at least once per year. The obtained results show how the hospital pharmacy staff has successfully – or not – mastered the control of the chemical contamination. Every new operator should also be tested after the initial training to verify the ability to prepare cytotoxic drugs in a safe and professional manner.</p>
<p>In future, applying this protocol to other hospitals could facilitate better evaluation of the mean contamination level. In addition, this benchmarking could also permit the standardization and improvement of the operating procedures to decrease the chemical contamination of the final preparation and the production sites.</p>
