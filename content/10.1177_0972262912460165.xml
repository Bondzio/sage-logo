<p>As one of the editors says in the introduction to their book, there hasn’t been a book on occupational stress in specific occupations; though there has not been any dearth of journal articles. Talking about occupational stress in general may have its merits, but beyond a point, the details as well depth of analysis can only come from penetrative studies of particular occupations; for even the uninitiated can surmise that not all stress can be lumped into one undifferentiated whole. We need not go further than to recognize that, of the thousands of farmer suicides in India, it is the cotton sector that accounts for most number of suicides. By that token itself, such an edited book would have been welcome. But the real worth of any publication lies in the treatment of the subject and the quality of the papers within its covers.</p>
<p>In all, there are 24 papers grouped under six sections. Part I deals with stress at the workplace in the health sector. Part II, shortest of all, comprises two chapters on education, dealing with work stress of teachers and head teachers. Part III deals with emergency services and prisons, including first-responder officers in the emergency services (such as during 9/11 disaster), firefighters and correctional officers in prisons. Part IV draws our attention to workplace stress in such high risk operations such as oil rig drilling, fishing and engineering. Part V clubs together accounts of work stress from apparently unrelated areas: financial dealers, entrepreneurs, farm entrepreneurs and musicians. Part VI, the last section, carries four chapters on workplace stress experienced by truck and bus drivers, sports officials, non-profit social services and ‘work and rumination’ in high-intense occupations.</p>
<p>The coverage area being so wide, selective chapters have been reviewed to give a flavor of the whole. In Part I, six professions find mention: nurses, surgeons, psychiatrists, social workers, interns, dentists and emergency medical technicians. While most of us, either personally or courtesy our loved ones, have received some nursing care and are sort of familiar with their demanding work routine, poor pay and tough work conditions, the range of issues we learn from the first two chapters devoted to this profession is surprising. Based on the literature survey, the respective authors draw our attention to such issues as incivility and bullying in the workplace and the occupational stress experienced by remote area nursing (RAN) profession in Australia. The hazards of rape, assault and burglary that RAN professionals face have policy and administrative implications; more so because the literature suggests that many unfortunate incidents could have been prevented. But, if one was expecting lived accounts of stress experienced by nurses, that expectation is squarely belied. In the third chapter on dealing with surgeon stress in the operating room, Langan-Fox and Vranic review the literature to tell us that ‘it is not surprising that surgical errors, or hospital-acquired “adverse events”, are regularly attributed to stress related performance declines’. Referring to comprehensive studies, they aver that majority of surgical error cases involve multiple layers of failure. In the chapter dealing with the ‘Occupational stress, professional burnout and job satisfaction among psychiatrists’, we learn what most us probably know: that such specialists themselves experience ‘distressing emotional situations and profound suffering as a consequence of their job’.</p>
<p>It is the chapters in Part V that expose readers to workplace stress in occupations that are generally considered stress-free: in finance, entrepreneurship and music. Beginning with their own research on financial dealers in London, Kahn and Cooper go on to draw on other research findings to conclude that while work stress is increasing in all professions, financial workers are more prone to mental stress. According to them, financial dealers experience substantial job role change and role conflict in an industry that is experiencing unsettling turnover rates. In the next chapter, ‘On being entrepreneurial: the highs and lows of entrepreneurship’, Sharon Grant does an excellent job in fusing literature survey with short but lived accounts of the highs and lows of entrepreneurs. Grant informs us that what is unique to entrepreneurs is ‘the venture creation process and the tension between some of the satisfaction and stressors that accompany this process. Entrepreneurs appear to have a love-hate relationship with their work. Creative energy, autonomy, flexibility, freedom, challenge and variety (that work hand in hand with) rejection, self-doubt, need for control, work-life conflict… <bold><italic>can make this career path unbearably stressful at times</italic></bold> (emphasis added)’ (pp. 378–379).</p>
<p>But it is the chapter dealing with stress in farm entrepreneurs that merits special mention. Most informed people know that behind the visually ‘peaceful living environment’, the reality of farm life is harsh. Marja Kallioniemi and her three colleagues use Finland as an example in their chapter, although international studies are additionally reviewed. They discuss how changes in the international agricultural product market, globalization and other factors have led to deep distress in farming, and how that distress builds up unbearable stress on the farmers leading to high suicide rate. It does not take much to figure out that if this is the situation with farmers in developed countries like Canada, UK, Finland, Norway and New Zealand, what must be the stress level of marginal farmers living below the poverty line in India; and why suicide rate of Indian farmers is so horrendously high!</p>
<p>Two niggling questions however remain unanswered. First, why didn’t the editors provide introductory chapters to each Part? That integrative exercise was needed as there appears no connectivity between any two chapters, except for the ones written on the nursing profession. In the absence of introductory chapters for each Part, each chapter stands on its own—as happens with individual research papers in refereed journals. The two and a half page introductory chapter at the beginning of the book is too skimpy for an edited volume. By contrast, the shorter Foreword has a greater cognitive appeal. Perhaps it would have been more appropriate to term this volume a compendium of research papers than a handbook.</p>
<p>The second sense of loss, if one may say so, deals with the narrative. While each chapter is well researched, the treatment is clinical. We get to know the percentages, the types of stress, causative factors and, in some cases, interventions needed to reduce workplace stress. But nowhere can one feel the agony and stress; the lived accounts are missing. A brief interlude is however provided by Tessa Opie and her colleagues in their chapter on ‘Occupational stress in the remote area nursing profession’; so does Agnieszka Kosny in the penultimate chapter on ‘Work in nonprofit organization—the effects on worker health’. One is therefore reminded of—and longs for—the equally well researched <italic>Life in Organizations: Workplaces as People Experience Them</italic>, the edited book by Rosabeth Moss Kanter and Barry A. Stein. Perhaps one has to wait for a similar edition dealing with stress in various occupations.</p>
