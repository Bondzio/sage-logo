<p>These two books have much in common. They are both written by experienced researchers and teachers of qualitative research methods and are intended as introductory texts to their subjects. They combine discussion of key concepts and themes with illustrative examples drawn from a wide range of research texts. They offer much practical advice and help to clarify what can initially appear as obscure research processes. In both the term ‘ethnographic’ is used frequently. However, the way it is used is quite different.</p>
<p>In Madden’s book, as the title suggests ‘ethnographic’ is intimately connected with the discipline of ethnography and this in turn is described as a way of being. Hennink, Hutter and Bailey use ‘ethnographic’ in two ways. Less frequently, it is used as an adjective in relation to ethnography, which is described as one approach to fieldwork that a qualitative researcher may choose. More often, it is used as part of the phrase ‘ethnographic cycle’ to describe what might otherwise be referred to as a fieldwork cycle that could include a variety of research activities from a number of different traditions. The different ways the term is employed is indicative of key differences between two approaches to qualitative research. The first advocates and portrays an intimate relationship between researcher, their ethnographic field and their research practices. The second emphasises pragmatic choices and research goals. The different meaning of ethnographic is representative, and perhaps is the root, of distinct intents, style, structure and content in the two texts.</p>
<p>Madden is clearly passionate about ethnography. Madden seeks to combine practical considerations with a concern for the subjective experience of engaging in ethnography. In this he is largely successful. Each chapter includes a number of thought provoking and generally clearly formulated questions and activities about ethnography and its practice. Many of these are excellent starting points for discussion on graduate courses on ethnography. Some could be easily rephrased to be relevant to developing more generic qualitative research skills. Many direct attention to substantial methodological issues. The further reading suggested at the end of each chapter forms a commendable bibliography for an aspirant ethnographer that includes classic texts from both anthropological and sociological currents in ethnography as well as signposts to guides to fieldwork, textbooks that go into particular practices in more depth and work that discusses important current issues.</p>
<p>Madden begins, as might be expected, with a discussion of the nature of ethnography. He starts by describing what he considers to be essential features of ethnography: writing about, being with and theorising about people and the subjective embodied experience of being ethnographic. From here he moves into an overview of reflexivity and methods before giving a brief introduction to the origins of ethnographic practices in sociology and anthropology. Ethical considerations are introduced in a way that is later used to frame discussion about particular practices.</p>
<p>I found the second chapter on ethnographic fields especially thought provoking. Particular attention is paid to the concept of ‘home’. Here, Madden discusses his own doctoral studies based in an area in which he had grown up and returned to as an ethnographer and his realisation that a concern for the exotic or obviously different is a caricatured expectation that can belie the importance of taking an ethnographic stance to the familiar. This combined with a description of both multi-site ethnography and the discontinuous nature of ethnographic research today offers refreshing openings about what ethnography can be.</p>
<p>The central section of the book consists of three chapters, focused in a straightforward and direct way on talking to people, being with people and looking at people. The discussion of these issues benefits from a description of the informality of research practices as much to the formal explicit tenets of the discipline. So, for example, a thorough discussion of the art of negotiation and developing respectful and careful communication precedes a discussion of formal ethnographic interviews. Although discussion of this is relatively short, sources are discussed that can be followed up.</p>
<p>The chapters of the next section describe different processes of textual construction, from representation through fieldnotes, the movement from analysis to interpretation through to what Madden considers to be the outcome of ethnography, the telling of storied realities. Again in this section Madden offers much practical advice that inducts the novice ethnographer into the discipline’s practices. Issues of style and genre are considered through a discussion of Van Manaan’s <italic>Tales of the Field</italic>. However, arguably, beginning ethnographers should be offered some introduction to post-modern critiques of ethnography and anthropology beyond a suggestion of further reading. Perhaps it is because of Madden’s focus on the ethnographer as story teller that other forms of representation using image and film are largely absent. The text would benefit from a description of different approaches such as critical, post-modern and participatory ethnography.</p>
<p>This absence is one reason that his final chapter, ‘Expanding ethnographic horizons’, is a little disappointing. The two horizons considered are cyber-ethnography and human/animal sociality. Although these are interesting and significant new fields, the methodological and philosophical horizons of reconsidering the nature of ethnography and representation are also important. The second reason for disappointment is that the discussions of the two areas that are considered are somewhat short. In general my main criticism of the text is its brevity. Madden is an engaging and thought provoking writer who leaves an impression of having much more to offer on the issues he addresses. <italic>Being Ethnographic</italic> is a lively and readable introduction to the discipline that is likely to leave graduate students and others wanting to read, talk about and engage in ethnography.</p>
<p>Hennink, Hutter and Bailey’s <italic>Qualitative Research Methods</italic> is structured around three cycles: the design cycle, the ethnographic cycle and the analytical cycle. Above I suggested that what is described as an ethnographic cycle might be more simply described as a fieldwork cycle. As it stands there is a danger of creating some confusion amongst the new researchers that this book is aimed at. Similarly, the suggested choice of three fieldwork choices – ethnography, participatory action research and mixed research methods – is somewhat perplexing. No reason is offered for why these three approaches are favoured rather than other qualitative traditions and although commonalities between the approaches are acknowledged these are not fully discussed.</p>
<p>However, the rationale may lie in the origins of this text in the authors’ experience of teaching research methods courses internationally and conducting research in majority world settings. The case studies discussed and the recommended further reading on field practice offer a rich and varied reflection of current and important social concerns and are used to illustrate and highlight important topics. Many of these studies focus on health and community development issues. A subtext of this work is that research matters and makes a difference in people’s lives. Perhaps the tendency to a pragmatic and instrumental style is a reflection of the authors’ concerns and interests, a style that is emphasised by each chapter opening with a set of learning objectives and closing with a summary of key points.</p>
<p>As a guide to the application of qualitative research methods, Hennink, Hutter and Bailey’s textbook has much to recommend it. It offers comprehensive coverage of key issues, particularly in relation to the fields it focuses on. So, for example, the chapter on ethics is illustrated with examples from a wider range of settings than might be found in texts that are orientated more exclusively to the practice of research in European, North American or similar contexts. Novice researchers working in all settings may find much value in the detailed discussion of the important and sometimes neglected topic of participant recruitment. Chapters that follow on research methods provide detailed and helpful coverage of in-depth interviews, focus group interviews and observation. I found it surprising yet curiously refreshing that the usual inclusion of survey research in the qualitative research method liturgy was largely omitted. Again perhaps this reflects a concern with particular research contexts, ones in which literacy cannot be assumed. However, this omission is somewhat odd given that mixed methods research is advocated and the title of the book suggests a more complete coverage of methods. The inclusion of photographs of practitioners engaged in research activities to illustrate the text is a welcome departure from most research methods texts and are used as starting points for discussion of issues of power and relationship in the research process.</p>
<p>The final chapters focus on the process of analysis and writing of research texts. Here the clear and systematic style is continued and helps to demystify these aspects of qualitative research. The recommended approach to analysis is based on grounded theory and offers a concise yet reasonably detailed introduction to this method. Advice on writing also has these features and a number of useful writing frames are offered to help begin the writing process.</p>
<p><italic>Qualitative Research Methods</italic> is a welcome addition to research methods literature. In my view the title is a slight misrepresentation as it offers a detailed description of a particular approach to qualitative research in relation to particular context and fields rather than more comprehensive coverage. In an introductory text that aims at clarity there is inevitably a risk of over-simplification. In relation to the detail of method, Hennink, Hutter and Bailey generally avoid this. However, this is not always so in relation to providing an overview of qualitative research methods as a whole. Improvements that might address this would be the inclusion of more reflexivity about the purposes of the text and clearer signalling of unexplored complexity in appropriate places. Nevertheless, as a text on methods it will be of value to undergraduate or postgraduate students and novice researchers, particularly those with an interest in international contexts.</p>
