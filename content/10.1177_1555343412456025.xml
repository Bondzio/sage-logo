<abstract>
<p>The capabilities enabled by cognitive readiness underlie successful human performance in any complex environment. Cognitive readiness can be viewed as encompassing individuals’ inherent traits, their training and experience, and their current dynamic state. Because of this, collaboration across the physiological and cognitive research communities is critical. Incorporating the latest advances in cognitive readiness research that are documented in this three-part special issue into the design, development, deployment, selection, and training of human-machine systems will enable the operational community to enhance human performance and effectiveness.</p>

<p>Cognitive readiness is a state of being that influences the interpretation of information and subsequent execution of behavior. The capabilities enabled by cognitive readiness underlie successful human performance in any complex environment, including, for example, military operations, aviation and aerospace, Homeland Security, law enforcement, and emergency response (e.g., first responders, firefighters, emergency medical technicians). The U.S. Department of Defense, in particular, has a strong interest in cognitive readiness—lives literally depend on it in the complex and unpredictable environment of modern military operations as war fighters functioning in high-risk, high-speed, and potentially lethal operations must act without hesitation and in accordance with trained principles. Therefore, the science and technology (S&amp;T) enterprise must provide the operational community with a vision of how cognitive readiness contributes to enhancing human performance and effectiveness.</p>
<p>An often-cited definition of cognitive readiness is as follows: “<italic>Cognitive readiness</italic> is the mental preparation (including skills, knowledge, abilities, motivations, and personal dispositions) an individual needs to establish and sustain competent performance in the complex and unpredictable environment of modern military operations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1555343412456025">Morrison &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>, p. I-3). To expand on this definition, cognitive readiness is a combination of three components: individuals’ inherent traits (e.g., working memory, behavioral style, strategies, reaction time), their training and education (e.g., knowledge, including conceptual, transferrable, and abstract, experience, training, mental preparation), and their current dynamic state (e.g., fatigue, stress levels). Thus, obtaining a more complete understanding of individuals’ or a team’s cognitive readiness and their ability to perform in a complex and unpredictable environment requires an understanding of all three components.</p>
<p>One challenge to the S&amp;T community is to develop a suitable set of methodologies and agreed-on metrics for each of the components of cognitive readiness. An additional challenge is to present this information in a manner that is of value to operational decision makers. This information will lead to more effective and efficient individuals, teams, training techniques, and processes for personnel selection that match an individual’s aptitude to a career or task.</p>
<p>In addition to identifying and defining the states of cognitive readiness, the S&amp;T community must develop the tools to measure the states of cognitive readiness. Current technologies that are being utilized include monitors of brain wave activity, heart rate, and eye movement. However, there are limitations associated with these technologies, in terms of both practical utility and the validity of using physiological correlates for such a complex concept as cognitive readiness. There are at least two significant technological challenges. The first is the repackaging of stand-alone laboratory equipment into small, rugged, and networked suites of monitoring devices. The second challenge is the need to clearly identify where and how such instrumentation will be useful. There must be a firm foundation for advocating the use of such measurements and metrics, particularly in military applications, before they will be accepted by the operational community.</p>
<p>Cognitive readiness also applies to the creation of more effective and efficient teams. Complete understanding of each team member’s trained and real-time cognitive readiness status can contribute to a team’s capability. Analysis from a networked system could inform personnel selection to optimize team effectiveness, cohesion, and adaptability. Furthermore, task assignment can be based on the training, knowledge, and strengths of each individual, as well as each individual’s current physiological status.</p>
<p>Developing networked systems that will integrate team members’ cognitive readiness, recognize impairments, and perform actions to rectify those impairments is critical for optimizing team performance. Such systems might assist an individual, shift tasks to another team member, or make leadership aware of an impairment. In many cases, the danger lies in the level to which the individual is unaware of or ignoring a cognitive readiness impairment. The basis for these cognitive errors may lie in lack of knowledge, lack of training, or not wanting to admit to an impairment of cognitive readiness.</p>
<p>As the S&amp;T community leads in technology discovery, development, and demonstration, it is imperative that the construct of cognitive readiness is incorporated into the design, development, deployment, selection, and training of human–machine systems. The types of advancements made in cognitive readiness that are documented in this three-part special issue will optimize the effectiveness and efficiency of individuals and teams performing in complex and unpredictable operational environments.</p>

<label>Editors’ Note</label>
<p>This issue represents Part 3 of a special issue on cognitive readiness. Part 1 was published in Volume 6, Issue 3 (September 2012), and Part 2 can be found in Volume 6, Issue 4 (December 2012). Part 3 begins with a preface by Patrick Mason, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, which discusses the importance of cognitive readiness for human performance and operational effectiveness and identifies several challenges that must be addressed in future research (Mason &amp; McQuade). Then, three articles examine a variety of topics, including evaluating a team psychophysiological approach to measuring cognitive readiness during a complex and dynamic task (Walker, Muth, Switzer, &amp; Rosopa), using eye-based psychophysiological cues to enhance screener vigilance (Langhals, Burgoon, &amp; Nunamaker), and guidelines on how to conduct training of cognitive readiness research emphasizing transfer of cognitive readiness components to dynamic, stressful unpredictable environments (Kluge &amp; Burkolter).</p>
