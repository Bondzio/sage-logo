<p>As the battle against education privatization and so-called “school reform” heats up around the country, an explosion in online creativity illuminates the issue. A wonderful graphic nonfiction approach—online in its entirety—is <italic>The Disaster Capitalism Curriculum: An Interactive Comic</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.archcomix.com/Education.html">www.archcomix.com/Education.html</ext-link>) by Dan Archer and Adam Bessie, a freelance comic journalist and an assistant professor at Diablo Valley College, respectively. Archer and Bessie trace the evolution of Milton Friedman’s theory about the role of markets in education to gruesome practice, in the form of high-stakes testing, closing so-called “failing” schools and privatization. The three-part series is innovative, using striking images and looking just like a comic book, but interviews real experts—a teacher in a “failing” Washington, D.C., public school, for instance, who says that if she teaches in the way she knows her students will learn best, she risks bad test scores and, ultimately, her job and livelihood—and exposes reformers’ lies in a journalistic style, and with muckraking fervor. Archer and Bessie show how monied interests used Hurricane Katrina to push through privatization in New Orleans. They also show the devastating effects of purely quantitative evaluation systems on teachers, and highlight the Finnish system as a blueprint for genuine reform.</p>
<p>Students Last (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://studentslast.blogspot.com">http://studentslast.blogspot.com</ext-link>), the name clearly a takeoff on Michelle Rhee’s pro-privatization advocacy group Students First, is a funny site with headlines like “Teachers Suck More than They Used to” and “Stoning Teachers Raises Some Eyebrows.” Then there is “Edushyster” (edushyster.com) written by a former teachers’ union employee gone rogue. The blog is an entertaining—but also informative—field guide to the many hucksters attempting to profit from the achievement gap between rich and poor children through teacher bashing and the relentless promotion of charter schools. Edushyster often satirizes elite involvement in the school privatization movement: “Remember the good old days when the latter Kennedy scions busied themselves with worthwhile pursuits like snorting cocaine and battling their sex addictions???” The blog also features a drinking game involving the Vows section of the <italic>New York Times</italic>, which, reflecting today’s elite, often features young people at the forefront of the pro-charter school movement. Take a sip if the bride is below thirty years, the age at which teachers are “freshest.” Then,</p>
<p><italic>Take another sip if the bride teaches at a charter school. A larger sip is in order if she has already left the charter school. Chug your mimosa (there is really no more delicate way to put it) if, despite being below 30 years of age (the age at which teachers are at their freshest and most innovative), she is already the principal of her charter school.</italic></p>
<p>Edushyster, who is well worth following on Twitter (@EduShyster), also calls out disgracefully skewed media coverage of education. Calling for nominations for a bad education journalism contest, the blog also regularly singles out the worst offenders, noting for example, that after spending years attacking teachers unions, and more generally, lamenting the state of education in Massachusetts, when the state’s schoolchildren made record test score gains, the <italic>Boston Globe</italic> buried the story.</p>

<title>Health Care Reform</title>
<p>Those interested in the health care discussion in this issue of <italic>New Labor Forum</italic> might find the Service Employees International Union’s (SEIU) online guide to the new health care law (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.seiu.org/a/healthcare/the-best-resources-on-the-internet-for-the-health-care-reform-law.php">www.seiu.org/a/healthcare/the-best-resources-on-the-internet-for-the-health-care-reform-law.php</ext-link>) useful (though it fails to link to any labor or left sources critical of Obamacare, a significant omission). The SEIU’s links explain what health care reform will mean to you, what changes have already gone into effect, and how to keep up to date on right-wing attacks. For those who are more visually inclined, there is also a video. Like the SEIU site—indeed, “Caught in the Web” found it through the SEIU—the Kaiser Family Foundation site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://healthreform.kff.org">http://healthreform.kff.org</ext-link>) propagandistically promotes Obamacare as a major policy breakthrough. But it is still valuable, presenting detailed research on the law and its impact, data on public opinion about health care policy, links to federal government documents on Obamacare, explainations of how the individual mandate works, and fact sheets on how the law will be implemented differently in different states. True health care reform junkies—and honestly, the rest of us too, as it is hard to imagine who will remain unaffected by our nation’s chaotic and confusing health care policies—should follow Kaiser on Twitter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://twitter.com/kaiserfamfound">https://twitter.com/kaiserfamfound</ext-link>) and Facebook (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.facebook.com/KaiserFamilyFoundation?fref=ts">www.facebook.com/KaiserFamilyFoundation?fref=ts</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Student Loans</title>
<p>Some recent political stirrings have focused on student debt (for more information on the student debt movement, please see the articles by Andrew Ross and Dan Clawson, earlier in this issue of the journal). This is partly thanks to the Occupy movement and the activism it has inspired. A great place to start is Bhaskar Sunkara’s online <italic>In These Times</italic> column, “Uprising,” which offers a good introduction to the issue, with many links (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://inthesetimes.com/uprising/entry/13115/understanding_student_debt">http://inthesetimes.com/uprising/entry/13115/understanding_student_debt</ext-link>). Some of the sites below are discussed in his column.</p>
<p>For students and their families, the National Consumer Law Center has a fine roundup (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.studentloanborrowerassistance.org">www.studentloanborrowerassistance.org</ext-link>) of resources not only detailing borrowers’ rights and changes in student loan policy but also guiding the reader to online reading on problems like for-profit education. A more political site is run by an organization called “Young Invincibles” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://younginvincibles.org">http://younginvincibles.org</ext-link>), which covers the financial plight of young people, including student loans, youth unemployment, and health care. Part think tank and part advocacy group, Young Invincibles offers numerous issue reports and policy recommendations. Another good site describing the problem, and offering solutions, is Student Loan Justice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://studentloanjustice.org">http://studentloanjustice.org</ext-link>), which also presents concrete—if pedestrian, tell your story, contact your elected officials, and so on—ways to take action.</p>
<p>The more radical political sites on the subject are those infused with Occupy spirit, especially the Occupy Student Debt Campaign (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.occupystudentdebtcampaign.org">www.occupystudentdebtcampaign.org</ext-link>), which encourages borrowers to default—if and only if the campaign’s pledge to default reaches critical mass. The site also has statements for faculty and nondebtors to sign as well, vowing to support the debtors in the event of a strike. (Disclosure: the writer of this column has signed the faculty statement.)</p>
<p>Student Debt Crisis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://studentdebtcrisis.org">http://studentdebtcrisis.org</ext-link>) includes lucid information on relevant legislation, and also a video of personal testimonials. Individual stories are even more artfully included in <italic>Default</italic>, a powerful documentary on student debt—named Best Short Doc at the San Francisco Indie Fest—which tells of students who now owe two or three times the amount they originally borrowed, and of the devastating impact of this debt on their lives. The movie can be seen online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.defaultmovie.com">www.defaultmovie.com</ext-link>. Occupy Student Debt (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://occupystudentdebt.com">http://occupystudentdebt.com</ext-link>) has powerful written personal testimonials, including a heartbreaking one from a father who had a nervous breakdown over his son’s student loans (and over the son’s refusal to take any responsibility for the debt).</p>
<p>A highly readable writer on student debt—with a deep, wonky understanding of both finance and policy, as well as excellent translation skills for those of us not fluent in those languages—is Mike Konczal of the Roosevelt Institute. He maintains a compelling blog called “Rortybomb” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rortybomb.wordpress.com">http://rortybomb.wordpress.com</ext-link>) but it is also a good idea to follow him on Twitter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://twitter.com/rortybomb">https://twitter.com/rortybomb</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Is Labor Behind the Times on Social Media?</title>
<p>In a word, yes. This column aspires to highlight some of the best practices in that area, but still finds far too few examples of innovative social media in the labor movement, even in a world in which, as of June 2012, 552 million people were active <italic>daily</italic> users of Facebook. There has already been some work to remedy this within the movement, of course, but some of that has taken the form of younger people merely urging their elders to get on Twitter, which is not all that transformative in itself, and tends to be met with skepticism. One of the most useful resources on how unions can improve their social media strategy is Social Media Guide to Trade and Labor Unions by Abrams Research (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.abramsresearch.com/static/guides-whitepapers/ARSM_Unions.pdf">www.abramsresearch.com/static/guides-whitepapers/ARSM_Unions.pdf</ext-link>). The intro to different social media platforms is pretty elementary, but for some people, that may be appropriate. Even better though are the case studies detailing, for instance, why the Steelworkers’ blog works so well, while the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) social media presence has been lacking (funny considering most people would assume that AFTRA’s members would spend more time communicating on the Internet than the Steelworkers). The guide helpfully distinguishes between different uses of social media—engaging or mobilizing members, raising public awareness of a union’s issues, or countering bad press. Perhaps even more helpful—written for journalists but accessible to anyone seeking a stronger social media presence—is this guide to social media (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sreetips.tumblr.com/post/342517218/socmedia">http://sreetips.tumblr.com/post/342517218/socmedia</ext-link>) from Sree Sreenivasan, Columbia University’s first digital officer and a Columbia Journalism School professor, which explains how to make the most of each social media platform. Among many other instructive interventions, he defines what makes an effective tweet (this term, if you are entirely new to social media, refers to a post on Twitter, which only allows communications of 140 characters). With any luck, more people will read these online guides and “Caught in the Web” will have more labor movement social media successes to report.</p>
