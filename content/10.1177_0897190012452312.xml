<abstract>
<p>Standardized continuous quality improvement (CQI) programs combine Web-based technologies and standardized improvement processes, tools, and expectations to enable quality-related events (QREs) occurring in individual pharmacies to be shared with pharmacies in other jurisdictions. Because standardized CQI programs are still new to community pharmacy, little is known about how they impact medication safety. This research identifies key aspects of medication safety that change as a result of implementing a standardized CQI program. Fifty-three community pharmacies in Nova Scotia, Canada, adopted the SafetyNET-Rx standardized CQI program in April 2010. The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) Canada’s Medication Safety Self-Assessment (MSSA) survey was administered to these pharmacies before and 1 year into their use of the SafetyNET-Rx program. The nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to explore where changes in patient safety occurred as a result of SafetyNETRx use. Significant improvements occurred with quality processes and risk management, staff competence, and education, and communication of drug orders and other information. Patient education, environmental factors, and the use of devices did not show statistically significant changes. As CQI programs are designed to share learning from QREs, it is reassuring to see that the largest improvements are related to quality processes, risk management, staff competence, and education.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Continuous quality improvement (CQI) programs have the potential to improve various aspects of performance for numerous companies in numerous industries. Such programs are found in industries ranging from manufacturing (eg, auto, aerospace) to service providers (eg, hotels) to health care delivery (eg, hospitals).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012452312">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012452312"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012452312">3</xref>
</sup> The potential benefits of CQI are enormous. By systematically examining, changing, and monitoring core business processes, it is possible to identify and eliminate key sources of operational inefficiencies, poor quality, and waste, thereby improving overall levels of performance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012452312">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012452312"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012452312">6</xref>
</sup> Within community pharmacies, there is increasing pressure to implement formal CQI programs to enhance patient safety. This pressure is coming from, among other things, a number of high-profile cases involving quality-related events (QREs; ie, medication errors and near misses) in pharmacy practice and an increasing number of pharmacy regulatory authorities mandating CQI program use. Indeed, in many pharmacy regulatory authorities in North America where such programs are now required, CQI program use is not only a matter of good management practice but also one of compliance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012452312">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Such regulatory requirements are based on the assumption that if community pharmacies systematically examine their core processes, they can identify, address, and communicate the root causes of QREs, thus reducing the likelihood of such errors recurring and thereby improving patient safety. Coupled with the increased expectation of CQI program use, recent technological advances have enabled the development of standardized CQI programs. Standardized CQI programs, using common improvement processes and tools (to the jurisdiction), Web-based reporting and analytic tools, and anonymous online QRE reporting to a common database, enable QRE information, including details of the errors, key contributing factors, and recommended changes, to be disseminated to other pharmacies throughout the jurisdiction or country.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012452312">8</xref>
</sup> Standardized CQI programs provide pharmacies with the needed support, autonomy, and tools to learn from one another and leverage network effects, that is, the more adopters of the standardized CQI program, the better the quality of the data available to make improvements. Overall, such programs enable pharmacy staff to proactively address potential QREs before they occur.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012452312">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Yet, despite the potential of standardized CQI programs for improving patient safety and the increasing expectation of CQI program use, where safety improvements generally occur in community pharmacies as a result of implementing a standardized CQI program remains unclear. As a result, it is difficult to assess current deficiencies with such programs and where improvements to patient safety are likely to occur. Subsequently, the objective of this research study is to identify the key patient safety practices that change as a result of implementing a standardized and technologically sophisticated CQI program in community pharmacies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0897190012452312">
<title>Research Method</title>
<p>In order to explore how a standardized CQI program can improve patient safety, an extensive list of potential sources of QREs is required. The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) has identified 10 elements that have the greatest impact on medication use, and therefore areas where QREs are most likely to occur.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012452312">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012452312"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012452312">11</xref>
</sup> These elements include (1) patient information (eg, lack of information about the patient); (2) drug information (eg, lack of information about the drug); (3) communication of drug orders and other drug information (eg, communication and teamwork failures); (4) drug labeling, packaging, and nomenclature (eg, unclear, absent, or look-alike drug labels and packages, and confusing or look-alike or sound-alike drug names); (5) drug standardization, storage, and distribution (eg, unsafe drug standardization, storage, and distribution); (6) use of devices (eg, nonstandard, flawed, or unsafe medication delivery devices); (7) environmental factors (eg, environmental factors and staffing patterns that do not support safety); (8) staff competence and education (eg, inadequate staff orientation, ongoing education, supervision, and competency validation); (9) patient education (eg, inadequate patient education about medications and medication errors); and (10) quality processes and risk management (eg, lack of a supportive culture of safety, failure to learn from mistakes, and failed or absent safety redundancies).<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>A standardized CQI program provides the tools, training, autonomy, and support to potentially address the major causes of errors among all of these 10 safety elements. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that broad-based improvements along all of these elements are likely to occur as a result of standardized CQI program use. To explore whether this in fact is the case, this research presents 10 hypotheses, one for each element developed by ISMP.<list list-type="simple">

</list>A within-subject repeated measures design was used to explore where safety changes occur as a result of implementing a standardized CQI program. To control for the variability of CQI programs in terms of their technology, expectations, or QRE reporting and learning processes, this research focuses on only users of one particular standardized CQI program, specifically SafetyNET-Rx. SafetyNET-Rx is a CQI program which enables community pharmacies to better report and learn from QREs through a standardized QRE reporting and learning process and access to a common repository of QREs that are occurring (and being addressed) throughout Canada. The current version of the SafetyNET-Rx program is comprised of a number of technology, process, training, and regulatory elements, including a pharmacy-tailored CQI cycle, anonymous online reporting of QREs to the ISMP Canada national database using their Community Pharmacy Incident Reporting™ tool (CPhIR), access to pharmacy-level and national aggregate data on QREs, training sessions on CQI and related topics (eg, root cause analysis, quality management), and a mobile (iPad) system for pharmacy inspectors to assess compliance to SafetyNET-Rx or standards of practice related to CQI or QRE reporting. The core components of the SafetyNET-Rx program are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0897190012452312">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0897190012452312">Figure 1</xref>, community pharmacies are expected to perform a number of activities when a QRE occurs. Details surrounding the QRE, such as type of error, impact on patient, time the error occurred, and suggested changes are immediately logged using the CPhIR tool, which enables anonymous reporting to ISMP Canada’s QRE database.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190012452312">12</xref>
</sup> CQI meetings are held once every quarter or shortly after a serious QRE has occurred. During CQI meetings, pharmacy staff discuss the QREs that have occurred since the last meeting, and try to identify both the root causes of the QREs and solutions (ie, process, work flow, dispensing and technology changes) that would reduce the likelihood of similar errors reoccurring. Once management has approved suggested solutions, they are implemented and staff dispense according to the new procedures. Long-term changes and safety improvements in the pharmacy are assessed using annual safety self-assessment surveys.</p>
<p>In April 2010, 68 Nova Scotia, Canada, community pharmacies agreed to adopt the SafetyNET-Rx CQI program, representing (at the time) 23% of the province’s 293 community pharmacies. The pharmacies represented a variety of types (independent, banner, and chain), sizes, and locations (urban and rural). None of these pharmacies were using a CQI program similar to SafetyNET-Rx (eg, no online reporting to a common database, no quarterly meetings to discuss QREs, limited technology used). The extent of CQI program use in these pharmacies prior to SafetyNET-Rx ranged from having no program at all, to some one-way reporting to headoffice of those QREs that reached the patient.</p>
<p>A safety self-assessment survey was administered to each community pharmacy prior to their adoption of the SafetyNET-Rx program. To help ensure that the questions were answered as accurately as possible, pharmacies were encouraged to complete their questionnaire as a group, with at least a pharmacy manager, staff pharmacist, and technician involved. Next, these community pharmacies used SafetyNET-Rx for 1 year, allowing time to assess deficiencies and implement changes to improve patient safety. At the end of 1 year of use, the safety self-assessment survey was completed again at each pharmacy.</p>
<p>Because CQI programs may change many different safety-related practices and processes, it is important to use a research instrument that captures many different aspects of pharmacy practice. As a result, we adopted ISMP Canada’s Medication Safety Self-Assessment<sup>®</sup> for Community/Ambulatory Pharmacy™ (MSSA). As highlighted by ISMP Canada, the MSSA<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012452312">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The survey is comprised of the 10 key elements related to patient safety noted earlier. Each element is assessed based on the use of various safety practices and tools. Specifically, on a 5-point Likert-type scale with anchors of <italic>no activity to implement the items</italic> to <italic>full implementation</italic>, the questionnaire requires staff to assess the extent that various safety practices, process, and tools are present in the pharmacy.<sup>

<tr>
<td>Staff competence and education </td>
<td>Practitioners and support staff receive sufficient training and orientation to the dispensing process and undergo baseline and annual evaluation of knowledge and skills related to safe medication practices. Practitioners receive ongoing education about medication error prevention and the safe use of drugs and devices that have the greatest potential to cause harm if misused. </td>

<td>6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Patient education </td>
<td> Patients are included as active partners in their care through education about their medications and ways to avert errors. Pharmacists establish and participate in community-based disease prevention and monitoring programs to promote health and ensure appropriate therapy and outcomes of medication use. </td>
<td>- patients are informed about the potential for error with drugs that have been known to be problematic and are provided with strategies to help prevent such an occurrence; - pharmacists fully investigate all patient/caregiver concerns (eg, affordability, inability to swallow, difficulty adhering to directions) and questions about a medication prior to dispensing. </td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quality processes and risk management</td>
<td> A nonpunitive, system-based approach to error reduction is in place and is supported by pharmacy owners and senior management. Practitioners are encouraged to detect and report error, and teams regularly analyze errors that have occurred within the organization and in other organizations for the purpose of redesigning systems to best support safe medication practices. Simple redundancies that support a system of independent double checks or an automated verification process are used for vulnerable parts of the dispensing system to detect and to correct serious errors before they reach patients. </td>
<td>- practitioners and other staff report and openly discuss errors without undue embarrassment or fear of reprisal from pharmacy management; - management and staff pharmacists/technicians routinely review and use published error experiences from other organization to proactively target improvements in the medication dispensing process.</td>

<p>To explore how each of the possible safety elements changed over time, a score was calculated based on the mean of the various items (ie, individual safety practices) within each element. Using <italic>Patient Information</italic> as an example, the average score of all 6 safety practices for this element was calculated to produce a single score for each pharmacy for <italic>Patient Information</italic>. This process was performed for each of the pre-SafetyNET-Rx (labeled as t<sub>1</sub>) and 1-year SafetyNET-Rx (labeled as t<sub>2</sub>) MSSAs.</p>
<p>The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to determine whether the 10 safety elements changed as a result of SafetyNET-Rx use. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a nonparametric test that enables comparisons between 2 related conditions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190012452312">13</xref>
</sup> For this research, these conditions are each of the 10 elements for both the pre-SafetyNET-Rx (t<sub>1</sub>) and 1-year SafetyNET-Rx (t<sub>2</sub>) MSSA. The parametric equivalent, dependent sample <italic>t</italic> test, was not selected because the data for many of the elements was not normally distributed and efforts at transforming the data did not result in strong enough improvements in normality to warrant its use. Subsequently, discussions of the data are focused on medians and effect sizes (when significant differences exist).</p>
<p>When performing the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the pre-SafetyNET-Rx and 1-year SafetyNET-Rx MSSA for each element is matched and the absolute difference is taken for each pair.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012452312">14</xref>
</sup> The absolute differences are ranked from lowest to highest and then ranks are identified as positive or negative. The sum of the positive ranks and negative ranks are calculated, with the test statistic (ie, T which is converted to a <italic>z</italic> score), determined by the lower of these 2 sums. Therefore, if the test statistic (ie, <italic>Z</italic>) is based on negative ranks, a statistically significant relationship indicates that a positive performance improvement has occurred, as the sum of the positive ranks is the larger of the 2 sums. Should a statistically significant relationship be found, the effect size can be calculated to assess the magnitude of change<sup>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The MSSA was completed by 53 community pharmacies in April 2010, prior to using the SafetyNET-Rx program. A second MSSA was completed by these same pharmacies in the Spring of 2011, over 1 year into their use of the SafetyNET-Rx program. These 53 pharmacies represent 78% of the initial 68 SafetyNET-Rx pharmacies and 18% of Nova Scotia’s 293 community pharmacies. Twenty-one (39.6%) pharmacies were independent stores, while the remaining 32 (60.4%) pharmacies belonged to chains of varying sizes. Seven (13.2%) chains had between 4 and 9 pharmacies, 2 (2.9%) had between 10 and 49 pharmacies, 12 (22.6%) had between 100 and 499 pharmacies, and 11 (20.8%) had more than 500 pharmacies.</p>
<p>Of the 53 pharmacies, 18 (34%) dispensed less than 700 prescriptions per week, 25 (47.2%) dispensed between 701 and 1500 prescriptions per week, and 10 (18.9%) dispensed between 1501 and 3000 prescriptions per week. The types of services provided by the pharmacies also ranged. Fifty-two (98.1%) pharmacies indicated the provision of traditional dispensing and counseling, 17 (32.1%) provided the option of long-term care, 32 (60.4%) provided methadone, and 20 (37.7%) provided custom compounding. The number of staff within each pharmacy that participated in completing the pre-SafetyNET-Rx (t<sub>1</sub>) MSSA ranged from 1 to 10, with an average size of 3. The size of the pharmacy staff groups completing the 1-year SafetyNET-Rx (t<sub>2</sub>) MSSA ranged from 1 to 12, also with an average group size of 3. Follow-up analysis of each pharmacy indicated that all were actively participating in the SafetyNET-Rx program, such as reporting QREs using the online reporting tool and meeting to discuss QREs.</p>
<p>Results of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated statistically significant improvements in 7 safety elements, specifically, patient information, drug information, communication of drug orders, drug labeling and packaging, drug standardization and distribution, staff competence and education, and quality processes and risk management. As a result, hypotheses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 10 are all supported. No statistically significant changes were found concerning the use of devices (Hypothesis 6), environmental factors (Hypothesis 7), and patient education (Hypothesis 9). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0897190012452312">Table 2</xref> presents the complete results.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>CQI programs have the potential to improve many aspects of safety within community pharmacies. However despite this potential, little is known concerning what specific improvements can be expected. This research examines this issue by exploring the adoption of the SafetyNET-Rx standardized CQI program. Examining the median score for each element, it appears that pre-SafetyNET-Rx (t<sub>1</sub>) safety areas that required improving were patient information (median [Mdn] = 2.3), communication of drug orders (Mdn = 2.5), drug labeling (Mdn = 2.6), and staff competence and education (Mdn = 2.7). A number of other important safety practices were evident in these pharmacies before the adoption of the SafetyNET-Rx program, especially in the areas of patient education (Mdn = 3.8), use of devices (Mdn = 3.7), and drug standardization, storage, and distribution (Mdn = 3.3).</p>
<p>Over the study period a number of key aspects of pharmacy safety improved. Examining <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0897190012452312">Table 2</xref>, areas where the most significant changes occurred were with quality processes and risk management (Hypothesis 10; <italic>z</italic> = −5.015, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01, <italic>r</italic> = −.49), staff competence and education (Hypothesis 8; <italic>z</italic> = −4.585, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01, <italic>r</italic> = −.45), communication of drug orders and other information (Hypothesis 3; <italic>z</italic> = −4.370, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01, <italic>r</italic> = −.42), and drug labeling, packaging, and nomenclature (Hypothesis 4; <italic>z</italic> = −4.309, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01, <italic>r</italic> = −.42), with all showing a medium-to-large improvement based on effect size.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190012452312">13</xref>
</sup> Areas where only low-to-medium improvements occurred were with patient information (Hypothesis 1; <italic>z</italic> = −2.842, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01, <italic>r</italic> = −.27) and drug information (Hypothesis 2; <italic>z</italic> = −3.362, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01, <italic>r</italic> = −.32).</p>
<p>After 1 year of standardized CQI program use, it appears that pharmacies have implemented or increased their use of safety practices and tools related to drug labeling, packaging, and nomenclature as well as communication between staff. Addressing these sources of QREs is a good start, but community pharmacies are also making even more significant changes by increasing their use of safety practices and tools related to staff competence and education, quality improvement, and risk management. As community pharmacy CQI programs are designed to enhance communication and learning from QREs, it is gratifying that the largest increases in safety practices and tools were related to quality improvement and risk management and education.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190012452312">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012452312">16</xref>
</sup> One of the key objectives of CQI programs, such as SafetyNET-Rx, is to provide pharmacy staff with the tools, training, and support needed to assess and change core dispensing processes in order to improve overall levels of patient safety. CQI programs provide a systematic approach for identifying the root causes of QREs and implementing and assessing changes to address such errors. These activities help ensure that the error is not repeated, thus reducing the levels of risk that the pharmacy may face.</p>
<p>Improved staff communication, education, and awareness are also critical in the prevention of QREs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190012452312">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190012452312">18</xref>
</sup> By systematically reporting QREs and disseminating key lessons throughout the pharmacy and beyond, pharmacy staff can learn from the mistakes of one another and become more aware of their own actions, thus helping to improve their overall level of professional competency. Significantly improved detection of errors can occur as a result of goal setting, feedback, and pharmacy staff becoming more mindful of their own dispensing activities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190012452312">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190012452312">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Examining the findings, it is apparent that a number of elements did not experience significant changes in the safety practices and tools currently being used. These elements include patient education, environmental factors, and use of devices; albeit prior to using the SafetyNET-Rx program, pharmacies seemed to already be using many of the safety practices and tools. Standardized CQI programs are still in their infancy within the community pharmacy context. In their current iteration, CQI programs offer limited engagement with patients with respect to how to improve internal process and reduce QREs, despite research that advocates a potential role.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190012452312">21</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190012452312"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0897190012452312">23</xref>
</sup> Patient education is primarily done by means of patient counseling and this element of safety improvement was not intentionally addressed by the current version of SafetyNET-Rx. Within the context of this study therefore, a nonsignificant increase in the use of practices and tools related to external factors and patient education is not unexpected. Fortunately, these factors are aspects of pharmacy safety that are being performed reasonably well regardless of CQI program use.</p>
<p>There are a number of limitations to this study, which may also present excellent research opportunities. A standardized CQI program (ie, SafetyNET-Rx) needed to be used to ensure that sufficient research controls were in place. Although the majority of the users of the SafetyNET-Rx CQI program were surveyed, the total number of pharmacies represented in the study was still relatively low. Therefore, blindly applying the findings outside of Nova Scotia, or to other CQI programs, should be approached with caution. Second, this research surveyed community pharmacies at 2 specific points in their CQI journey. Future research is needed to assess the mid-term (eg, 3-5 years) and long-term (eg, 5+ years) safety changes that occur as a result of using a standardized CQI program, and if pharmacies eventually revert to their pre-CQI program ways. Third, this study is based on pharmacy staff’s self-assessment of their processes which has the potential for rater error. As well, pharmacies completed the MSSA in a group setting, and this has the potential to create a group think and/or social desirability effect. For these reasons, a mixed-methods approach focused on participant observation, secondary data analysis (eg, pharmacy inspection reports), and/or interviews with other stakeholders (eg, pharmacy inspectors, patients) should be undertaken in future studies to add to our understanding of the challenges of implementing various safety improvements. Such efforts will also help to increase our understanding of the drivers of these improvements (eg, managers vs staff) and, the impact that such changes have on staff relationships, employee satisfaction, and related effects.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This research explored the impact that standardized CQI programs have on safety within community pharmacies. As more jurisdictions require community pharmacies to adopt formal CQI programs, future research addressing this topic should include a wide variety of pharmacy stakeholders (eg, regulatory authority, pharmacy associations, and patients) and use a variety of research methods and at different points in time. This research has a number of potential implications for regulatory authorities, pharmacy managers, and pharmacy staff. For pharmacy regulatory authorities mandated with protecting public safety, this research highlights where safety improvements are likely to occur as a result of standardized CQI program use; thus setting realistic expectations as to the benefits of CQI programs and helping regulatory authorities better assess the value of requiring the use of such programs in community pharmacies. For pharmacy managers, this research provides early benchmarks with respect to safety practices in community pharmacies, thus allowing them to assess, using the MSSA tool, the extent that general safety deficiencies exist in their pharmacy and how these deficiencies compare to those of other community pharmacies. For pharmacy staff, this research helps to highlight the value of talking about QREs and reinforces that such discussions should not be treated as taboo and therefore avoided. Pharmacy staff will make mistakes. Creating an open and meaningful dialogue around the topic of QREs can invoke changes that have the potential to significantly improve the safety of patients, pharmacy practice, and the health care system.</p>
