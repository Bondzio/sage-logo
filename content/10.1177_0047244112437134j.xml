<p>This volume of essays is the product of a conference on Schiller held at California State University Long Beach in 2009 for the 250th anniversary of Schiller’s birth. Many of the essays take issue in one way or another with the once popular view that Schiller was an uncompromising idealist, and present instead a picture which aligns more with that of the cosmopolitan realist or the forerunner of modernism. There is more emphasis on his manifold activities than Coleridge, who provides the volume’s title question, might ever have imagined.</p>
<p>Jeffrey High discovers parallels between Thomas Jefferson’s education and Schiller’s, following the parallels through into their moral-political philosophies. He takes issue with views that emphasize only Schiller’s connections with the tradition of conservative revolution. Some readers might find the suggested links between <italic>Don Karlos</italic> and <italic>Star Wars</italic> less than convincing, and I am left wondering how comfortable Schiller would really have been in the world of US art. Hans Hiebel looks at gestural language and provides us with long lists of stage directions. Matthew Bell explains how the atmosphere of pessimism hanging over Schiller’s denouements relates directly to the melancholy tradition that takes its cue from Edward Young and <italic>Hamlet</italic>. Ehrhard Bahr deals with the concept of mourning in Schiller’s poetry and plays, showing it to be complementary to the idyll that is in practice unattainable. Peter Pabisch is hopeful that Schiller’s ballads can be reintroduced into the syllabus. In one of the most sustained engagements with the text of a Schiller play, Norbert Oellers looks carefully at the text of <italic>Wallenstein</italic> and revisits key questions of motivation.</p>
<p>Six essays are devoted to Schiller’s aesthetics and philosophy. Laura Anna Macor argues that Schiller’s early philosophical thinking laid the ground for his adoption of Kantian ideas. Her essay is complemented by Fritz Heuer’s, who shows how Schiller later develops his new perspective on <italic>The Critique of Judgement</italic>. David Pugh explores links between Schiller’s aesthetics and the Halle tradition, tracing the transmutations of the concept of humanity, while Bernd Fischer considers the political and ethical implications of Schiller’s aesthetics from the perspective of Odo Marquard’s notions of aesthetic compensation and therapy. John McCarthy departs from familiar approaches to the background of Schiller’s thought by focusing on the influence that concepts of kinetic energy had on how Schiller conceptualized grace, the beautiful and the sublime. The Copernican Turn from the cosmic to the molecular state of things also affected Schiller. Maria del Rosario Acosta López shows that Schiller is not concerned with the ‘aetheticization of politics’ (Benjamin), but rather that he repeatedly emphasizes the moral complexities of the individual’s relationship to others inherent in any political action.</p>
<p>History and politics also receive attention. Yvonne Nilges shows how Schiller formulates representative popular sovereignty as a constitutional ideal with recourse to Locke and Montesquieu, while Elizabeth Krimmer analyses Schiller’s conceptualization of the nexus between religious and political factors in his <italic>History of the Thirty Years War</italic>. Erik Knoedler shows that the Black Knight in <italic>Die Jungfrau von Orléans</italic> is in fact based on the ghost of Edward the Black Prince. Wolfgang Riedel argues forcefully for the view that, in his later plays, Schiller never strays from his psychological-analytical course. Jim Reed takes earlier commentators to task (particularly Ranke and Hegel) for their misrepresentation of Schiller the historian, reaffirming the view of him as a realist.</p>
<p>Essays on reception address the failure of <italic>Germanistik</italic> to fully recognize the influence of Gothic tradition on Schiller’s literary writings (Jennifer Colismo); or discuss productions of Schiller’s plays on the British stage in the early nineteenth century (Frederick Burwick), the figure of Mary Stuart from Vondel to Swinburne (Ritchie Robertson), and the decline in the fortunes of translations of Schiller’s works in America (Jeffrey L. Sammons). Nicholas Martin compares attitudes to Schiller during the First World War in Britain and Germany (where he had begun to become a polarizing figure); Jörg Robert shows how Kommerell’s view of Schiller was influenced by his relationship to Stefan George, and there is a welcome essay from Henrik Sponsel, which firmly demolishes the theory that he is a precursor of fascism, a charge laid at Schiller’s door by Theodor W. Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Paul de Man and Terry Eagleton.</p>
<p>The final section of the volume, ‘Schiller now’, contains essays that are even more closely focused: on classical parodies of <italic>Maria Stuart</italic> and the role of contemporary politics in adaptations (Dennis F. Mahoney); while Paul E. Kerry shows that intellectual historians, political philosophers and social scientists have begun to recognize transnational aspects of Schiller’s political thought. Gail K. Hart believes that approaches to Schiller have become fossilized, institutionalized and territorialized by a male-dominated profession, and are therefore in need of an injection of the speculative and the unconscious, but her views are rather contradicted by the variety of approaches in evidence in this volume and which have been pursued in Schiller scholarship for some time. Finally, to justify the picture of Schiller’s skull on the front cover of the volume, Walter Hinderer tells the fascinating story of the threefold burial of Schiller’s remains at different sites. All in all, this is a bumper volume for Schiller scholars, with only a few essays that I found less than thought-provoking.</p>
