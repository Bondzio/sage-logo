<abstract>
<p>Obesity and type 2 diabetes is becoming a major health problem affecting children and adolescents in the United States. This article reviews the current literature examining the association between the presence of acanthosis nigricans (AN) and risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in obese children and adolescents. Ethnicity, family history of diabetes, and emergence of obesity are contributing factors for development of hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance, and ensuing visible changes on skin which is known as the AN. The purpose of this review was to assess the validity of AN as an early indicator of T2DM. Nineteen articles that were published from 1994 to 2010 were included for this review and reported an association between AN, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia. Nurses and advanced nurse practitioners working with children and adolescents have a tremendous role in identifying the risk factors, counseling, role modeling, and referring them to available community resources to promote healthy living. Early initiatives focusing on lifestyle changes may halt the progress, chronicity, and burden of T2DM in children and adolescents.</p>

<body>
<p>Once thought to be a disease solely of adult population, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasingly prevalent among children and adolescents. Reports from different areas in the United States and various parts of the world reveal that T2DM is becoming an epidemic, and the progression is closely associated with the epidemic of overweight and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840511430952">Hu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840511430952">Meetoo, McGovern, &amp; Safadi, 2007</xref>). Acanthosis Nigricans (AN) is reported to link with T2DM. In 2000, the American Diabetes Association established AN as a formal risk factor for development of T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059840511430952">Miller, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>AN is a hyperpigmented, usually brownish black papillomatous velvety thickening of the epidermis that primarily affects axillae, posterior neck fold, flexor skin surfaces, umbilicus, and occasionally mucosal surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840511430952">Jones &amp; Ficca, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059840511430952">Sinha &amp; Sachwartz, 2007</xref>). The first documented case of AN was identified in 1889, in Germany, at Unna’s dermatology clinic. However, an association between AN and diabetes mellitus was first noted in 1976 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059840511430952">Miller, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059840511430952">Sinha &amp; Sachwartz, 2007</xref>). Studies have demonstrated an association of AN with hyperinsulinemia and T2DM, and the recent increase of T2DM among children and youth has heightened interest in children’s health, including screening children for AN as a risk factor for diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840511430952">Jones &amp; Ficca, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059840511430952">Whitaker, Davis, &amp; Lauer, 2004</xref>). Although the American Diabetic Association (ADA) and American Academy of Pediatrics support guidelines for screening children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) discourages screening children for AN in schools and communities because there is insufficient evidence to conclude AN is a risk factor for T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840511430952">Jones &amp; Ficca, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The emergence of T2DM as an epidemic in many parts of the world has captured the attention of researchers who point out the need for investigating simple and cost-effective screening measures to identify individuals at risk for developing T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840511430952">Caceres, Teran, Rodriguez, &amp; Medina, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840511430952">Hu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059840511430952">Narayan, Boyle, Thompson, Sorensen, &amp; Williamson, 2003</xref>). Research on insulin resistance (IR), resultant insulinemia, and gradual exhaustion of the pancreas has established hyperinsulinemia as a marker for a predisposition to T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840511430952">Kong et al., 2010</xref>). However, laboratory testing for IR and insulin level are not cost effective for population screening nor a valuable tool in the early developent of the problem. Since the first report about AN in 1889, many dermatologists and endocrinologists have searched for relationships between AN and IR. Although some studies reported an association between AN and IR, to date no systematic review or quantitative meta-analysis has been done on this topic. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the significance of AN as a reliable indicator for risk of type 2 diabetes in school-age obese children and adolescents.</p>
<sec id="section1-1059840511430952">
<title>Problem Statement</title>
<p>Consistent with the rise in childhood obesity, the epidemic of T2DM is mounting among children and adolescents globally. In the United States, 17% of children 2 to 19 years of age are obese with a body mass index (BMI) greater than the 95th percentile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059840511430952">Ogden, Carroll, Curtin, Lamb, &amp; Flegal, 2010</xref>). Every 20 minutes, 60 Americans will be diagnosed with T2DM, and 9 Americans will die from diabetes-related complications. Annually, 3,700 new cases of T2DM are diagnosed in youth in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840511430952">Meyer &amp; Hoffman, 2011</xref>). At present, 8% of the U.S. population (24 million) has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. The incidence of T2DM is growing rapidly, and by the year 2030, 400 million people worldwide will be battling this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840511430952">Campbell &amp; Martin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059840511430952">Narayan et al., 2003</xref>). In 2007, the estimated expense for the treatment of diabetes in the United States was $174 billion and is expected to grow to more than $350 billion by 2025 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840511430952">Campbell &amp; Martin, 2009</xref>). T2DM accounts for 95% of diabetes cases, and it is closely associated with obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypercoagulation disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511430952">CDC, 2011</xref>). In children, as in adults, type 2 diabetes is caused by the combination of IR and β-cell secretory failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840511430952">Kaufman, 2005</xref>). Insulin is a hormone produced by the β-cell of the pancreas and assists the metabolization of carbohydrate, lipids, and proteins. IR is a reduction in the ability of tissue cells to use insulin, resulting in an increased production of insulin by the pancreas (hyperinsulinemia) to maintain the blood glucose level within normal limits.</p>
<p>T2DM usually follows a progression through a phase of altered glucose metabolism, resulting in a pre-diabetes state which includes IR, impaired fasting glucose, and impaired glucose tolerance. Even though this process may take decades in adults to progress to T2DM, in children and youth, this process appears to be accelerated and may take less than 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840511430952">Campbell &amp; Martin, 2009</xref>). It is vital to screen and identify children and adolescents with IR and/or pre-diabetes for early intervention, to prevent, or to delay the progression to T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840511430952">Garnett et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Development of AN is influenced by high levels of insulin that stimulate epidermal keratocyte and dermal fibroblast via insulin-like growth factor receptors. This keratocyte proliferation leads to skin changes like papillomatosis and hyperkeratosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511430952">Grandhe, Bhansali, Dogra, &amp; Kumar, 2004</xref>). Several studies have associated AN with increased IR and hyperinsulinemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511430952">Hirschler, Aranda, Oneto, Gonzalez, &amp; Jadzinsky, 2002</xref>). There are familial and syndromic forms of AN caused by malignancies and administration of medications such as insulin. There is no sex preference for AN, but it is much more common in people with darker skin pigmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059840511430952">Sinha &amp; Sachwartz, 2007</xref>). Health care workers usually diagnose AN clinically by inspecting the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059840511430952">Sinha &amp; Sachwartz, 2007</xref>). AN is identified in many children with IR and, because of the association of IR and type 2 diabetes, AN was proposed as an IR marker and as an independent risk factor for T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840511430952">Brickman, Huang, Silverman, &amp; Metzger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059840511430952">Miller, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>The suitability of the material was assessed based on relevance to the review question. Studies obtained via literature search were first evaluated by the title of the study and then according to the abstract. Twelve clinical reviews were excluded as they were not research based. Eight studies lacking methodological research process and statistical analysis also were excluded. Four studies were excluded as the population of study was mixed and clear delineation about the data collection method was missing. Nineteen articles published from 1994 to 2010 were included for this review. Out of the 19 studies, 16 of them were exclusively on the population of children, and 3 of them had participants 3 to 40 years.

<title>Data Extraction and Synthesis</title>
<p>The studies that met the inclusion criteria were critically reviewed to assess validity. The summary of the studies are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840511430952">Table 1</xref>. The majority of the studies were descriptive cross-sectional studies. The tools of data collection used by the researchers were mostly screening, surveys, and questionnaires. Some studies used random selection of subjects to increase validity. The sample size varied widely from 61 subjects to 2,205 subjects. Most of the studies identified were conducted in the United States (13 studies), two of them in Japan, one each in Turkey, Bolivia, Argentina, Korea, and Brazil.</p>
<p>As the purpose of the study was to assess the significance of AN as an early marker for T2DM, findings concerning AN and fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin level, and IR were extracted from each study. Findings regarding cofactors such as age, obesity, and ethnicity also were compiled.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>Many factors contribute to the development of T2DM. Race and ethnicity, family history of diabetes, and presence of obesity are the three most significant determining factors that have shown an association with AN.</p>
<sec id="section8-1059840511430952">
<title>Ethnicity</title>
<p>There is considerable difference in the development of AN as well as T2DM in various ethnic groups. Native American children have a higher rate of T2DM than children of other ethnicities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840511430952">Drobac, Brickman, Smith, &amp; Binns, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059840511430952">Stoddart, Blevins, Lee, Wang, &amp; Blackett, 2002</xref>). Mexican American and African American children also are at increased risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059840511430952">Stuart, Smith, Gilkison, Shaheb, &amp; Stahn, 1994</xref>). The Cherokee diabetes study reported an overall high prevalence of AN among Native Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059840511430952">Stoddart et al., 2002</xref>). These findings were supported by studies done in New Mexico by Mukhtar, Cleverly, Voorhees, and McGarth (2001) and the PRIME Net study conducted in 2010 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840511430952">Kong et al. (2010</xref>), in which the prevalence of AN among Native Americans and Hispanics was high compared to non-Hispanic children. The researchers found that the severity of AN and hyperinsulinemia increased with age and degree of Indian heritage. The risk for T2DM was significantly higher among Native Americans when compared to non-Hispanic White subjects, as evidenced by an increased level of IR and high level of fasting insulin level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840511430952">Kong et al., 2010</xref>; Mukhtar, Cleverly, Voorhees, &amp; McGarth, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059840511430952">Stuart et al., 1994</xref>).

This low prevelance may be attributed to the fact that inexperienced clinicians have an increased difficulty in identifying AN in individuals with fair skin compared to darker colored individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840511430952">Kong et al., 2010</xref>).

According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840511430952">Meetoo, McGovern, and Safadi (2007</xref>), 90% of T2DM is associated with obesity. Among obese children, progressive hyperinsulinemia leads to rapid progression of AN during puberty. In addition to obesity, the presence of AN is one of the first signs that indicate IR and risk for developing T2DM. IR is a major underlying cause of AN, and the severity of AN may parallel the degree of IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840511430952">Brickman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059840511430952">Sinha &amp; Sachwartz, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>AN and T2DM</title>
<p>The presence and statistical significance of AN in relation to T2DM was reviewed (see Table.1). Among all the reviewed studies, 16 out of the 19 studies identified AN as a marker of IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840511430952">Brickman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840511430952">Guran et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840511430952">Kong et al., 2007</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840511430952"> 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840511430952">Miura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059840511430952">Silva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059840511430952">Stuart et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059840511430952">Whitaker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059840511430952">Yamazaki, Ito, &amp; Yoshida, 2003</xref>). All of these 16 studies reported a statistically significant higher level of fasting insulin in patients with AN. Studies conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511430952">Hirschler, Aranda, Oneto, Gonzalez, and Jadzinsky (2002</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059840511430952">Stoddart, Blevins, Lee, Wang, and Blackett (2002</xref>) reported an association between AN and obesity.

However, according to the researchers, body adiposity is the primary determinant of insulin sensitivity and AN grading has no significant clinical usefulness. Five of the 6 studies that measured IR using Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) associated AN with IR and a higher prevalence of T2DM in children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511430952">Bent et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511430952">Hirschler et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>A retrospective comparative study conducted on 439 obese Japanese children found that fasting blood glucose and insulin level are significantly elevated in children with AN, compared to children without AN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059840511430952">Yamazaki et al., 2003</xref>).

<p>A study on Brazilian adolescents with obesity reported that adolescents with two or more risk factors have higher IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059840511430952">Silva et al., 2007</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840511430952">Miura et al. (2006</xref>) study on Japanese children and adolescents reported a statistically significant difference in fasting immunoreactive insulin (IRI) and IR (HOMA-R) in obese children with AN. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840511430952">Mukhtar et al. (2001</xref>) reported that AN alone had a positive predictive value of 39.4% for hyperinsulinemia. Combined with obesity, AN substantially increased the predictive value for detecting children with hyperinsulinemia (47.2%). The findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840511430952">Drobac et al. (2004</xref>) supported the predictability of AN as a marker of IR and risk for T2DM.

However, even though AN is an independent risk factor for IR and development of T2DM in overweight Hispanic children, body adiposity is the primary determinant of insulin sensitivity. The prevalence of AN is less likely to be present in obese young Caucasians as a marker of T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840511430952">Kong et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The PRIME Net study analyzed the relationship between the presence of AN and the number of risk factors for T2DM and found that the greater the number of risk factors, the higher the prevalence of AN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840511430952">Kong et al., 2010</xref>). All 19 studies identified the presence of AN in children and adolescents as a risk factor for T2DM. Evidence supports AN as a reliable marker for glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia. IR and β-cell dysfunction are pathogenic components of T2DM. The association of AN with obesity increases reliability in predicting future development of T2DM. This review supported the previous findings on the role of ethnicity as a major risk factor for the development of T2DM. Native Americans, Hispanics, and African American children have a higher risk for T2DM when compared to non-Hispanic White children.</p>
<p>Together the findings from this review delineate the emerging importance of screening all obese children and adolescents with AN for T2DM. The presence of AN, a precursor to diabetes, is an early marker that when recognized provides the opportunity for early implementation of preventive measures, such as recommendations for increased physical activites and healthy eating.</p>

Limitations to the study include that they were over represented by Native American and Hispanic children. The effects of confounding factors on collected data cannot be excluded. There is a possibility of underestimating risk factors because the studies were based on risk factors that had been documented by the medical provider in the medical record. Family history was missing in several studies.</p>
<p>Moreover, currently there is no standard defintion or tool for AN screening (CDC, 2011). Out of 19 studies, only 4 studies included some details about the tools used, such as pictures or photographs for the identification, comparison, and grading of AN (Guran et al., 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840511430952">Kong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059840511430952">Stoddart et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059840511430952">Stuart et al., 1994</xref>). Moreover clinicians had difficulty in diagnosing AN in fair skinned persons, therefore classification bias may have resulted in underestimation of AN among non-Hispanic White children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840511430952">Kong et al., 2010</xref>). Studies that recruited participants on a voluntary basis may have sampling bias as participants with a family history of diabetes may have been more likely to be enrolled for the study. Most of the studies were conducted with Native Americans, African Americans, or Hispanics. There were only a few studies on mixed populations. Therefore, the findings are generalizable only to the specific group of people in the specific region. This systematic review is based on published studies and, therefore, subject to publication bias. Therefore, the possibility of an overrepresentation of studies that report a positive relationship with AN and T2DM cannot be expelled.</p>

<title>Implication for Practice</title>
<p>The consistency of the correlation of AN with T2DM and the overall high prevalence of AN in all the studies emphasize the generalizability of the findings. This review also supports the correlation of AN with the presence of hyperinsulinemia and IR in children with obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840511430952">Brickman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511430952">Chang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511430952">Grandhe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840511430952">Guran et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511430952">Hirschler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840511430952">Ice et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840511430952">Kaufman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840511430952">Kobaissi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840511430952">Kong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840511430952">Le et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840511430952">Miura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059840511430952">Peterson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059840511430952">Rodbard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059840511430952">Silva et al., 2007</xref>). The current magnitude of the increase in prevalence of obesity-related diabetes, coupled with future morbidity and mortality associated with diabetic complications, heralds the need for early identification and control of this epidemic, especially among the young population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840511430952">Jones &amp; Ficca, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840511430952">Meetoo et al., 2007</xref>). Appropriate screening for all children at risk for T2DM will result in early identification and implementation of preventive measures and a better likelihood of glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059840511430952">Rodbard, 2008</xref>). Screening for AN among Native Americans, Hispanics, and African American children who are at high risk for developing T2DM has important implications for early identification and intervention that can prevent or delay the progression to T2DM. The most effective treatment for AN is weight loss to correct the underlying condition of hyperinsulinemia and dyslipidemia. In 2005, the ADA and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended screening school age children ≥10 years old with a BMI &gt;85th percentile, who also have substantial risk factors such as family history or signs of IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840511430952">Jones &amp; Ficca, 2007</xref>). The CDC does not recommend AN screening but recommends primary preventive approaches that focus on nutrition and physical activity to control overweight and obesity (CDC, 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840511430952">Jones &amp; Ficca, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Even though currently there is no unanimous agreement for AN screening nationally, many clinicians believe that it is important to utilize this screening opportunity in order to educate the public about ADA recommendations and refer children who are at risk for further evaluation to prevent development of future health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840511430952">Jones &amp; Ficca, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059840511430952">University of Texas Pan American Border Health Office, 2009</xref>). Early identification and intervention with dietary modification and exercise to achieve a healthy weight and endocrinologic hormonal balance prevent development of T2DM and other associated complications. If AN is diagnosed clinically, further diagnostic tests including fasting serum insulin, glucose levels, and fasting lipid profile are warranted. Advanced nurse practitioners providing primary care services and those who provide services at school-based clinics have a tremendous role as team leaders to work with children, parents, school nurses, dietitions, social workers, and diabetic specialists.</p>

<title>Implication for Future Research</title>
<p>T2DM is a major health care issue escalating among children and adolescents. This systematic review supports a strong association of AN and future predicability of T2DM. However studies on the validity and reliability of the currently avaliable scale for assessment of AN are limited. Although, the current quantitative scale is highly specific to the Hispanic population, its validity and sensitivity are not evaluated among other ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511430952">Burke, Hale, Hazuda, &amp; Stern, 1999</xref>). The sensitivity and predictability of AN has shown a parallel increase with increase in BMI. However, it will be valuable to conduct studies to evaluate the usefulness of AN in quantitatively predicting the progression of T2DM. Future areas of research also include ethnic-specific studies especially on non-Hispanic White children as they were underrepresented in all past studies. Also more research and dissemination of data are needed to support AN screening as a standard requirement for all school children.</p>

<sec id="section15-1059840511430952">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Findings of this systematic review provide evidence to support AN as a reliable indicator for risk of type 2 diabetes in obese children and adolescents. School nurses, nurse practitioners, and primary care providers have a tremendous role in educating children and their parents about the risk factors for T2DM. Screening for AN in school children will open opportunities for patient education and parental involvement, including referral to primary care providers for further evaluation and management.</p>
