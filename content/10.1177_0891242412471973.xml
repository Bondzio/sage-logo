<abstract>
<p>In the knowledge economy, academic entrepreneurship occurs at the boundaries of different scientific and professional backgrounds, creating a need for support mechanisms to transcend those limits. The entrepreneurial university is seen as an important catalyst for regional economic and social development, particularly because it generates and exploits knowledge as entrepreneurial opportunities. However, evidence about this phenomenon is fragmented and disorganized. By adopting institutional economics, resource-based view, and endogenous growth approaches, this study provides a better understanding of the socioeconomic impacts of the entrepreneurial university. Using the case study methodology, the study presents the experience of entrepreneurial universities in a European Region (Catalonia, Spain). It describes some practical implications that could stimulate the entrepreneurial activity of universities and thus foster their contribution to the development of the modern knowledge economy.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurship has been considered as a key driver to economic growth, employment, and innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891242412471973">Acs &amp; Audretsch, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0891242412471973">Drucker, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0891242412471973">Storey 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0891242412471973">Wennekers &amp; Thurik, 1999</xref>). An entrepreneurial society generates scenarios in which its members can identify and exploit economic opportunities and knowledge to promote new entrepreneurial phenomena that have not been previously visualized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891242412471973">Audretsch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0891242412471973">Mueller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0891242412471973">Shane, 2004b</xref>). Within these societies, universities are seen as important catalysts for regional economic and social development because they are natural incubators that create new ideas and technologies, promote new business creation, and offer a variety of resources and capabilities that contribute to creating a sustained competitive advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891242412471973">Chrisman, Hynes, &amp; Fraser, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891242412471973">Dasgupta &amp; David, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0891242412471973">Kirby, 2002</xref>). An interesting phenomenon is the academic entrepreneurship that occurs at the boundaries of different scientific and professional backgrounds, creating a need for support mechanisms to transcend those boundaries. In the United States, this phenomenon has been occurring for 30 years since the enactment of the Bayh–Dole Act that is linked with the entrepreneurial and economic development activities of universities. In this line, some Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries have reformed the legislations related to academic entrepreneurship, but there are still several research opportunities at the systems, university, and individual levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891242412471973">Grimaldi, Kenney, Siegel, &amp; Wright, 2011</xref>). As a consequence, universities become more entrepreneurial to compete, to become more productive and creative in establishing links between education and research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891242412471973">Kirby, 2006</xref>), and to provide new alternatives to the university community that identifies an entrepreneurial opportunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891242412471973">Guerrero &amp; Urbano, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>For this reason, academic entrepreneurship has gained the attention of academics, governments, and policymakers around the world, who are making efforts to encourage it. Hence, the existing literature on academic entrepreneurship puts forth a strong effort to explain the technologies that lead to university spin-offs; the process of creation and development of an entrepreneurial university; the typologies, phases, and models; the challenges faced at financial and operational levels; and the university’s environmental and internal factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891242412471973">Grimaldi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0891242412471973">Lockett, Siegel, Wright, &amp; Ensley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0891242412471973">Mowery &amp; Shane, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0891242412471973">Phan, Siegel, &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0891242412471973">Shane, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0891242412471973">Siegel, Thursby, Thursby, &amp; Ziedoni, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0891242412471973">Siegel &amp; van Pottelsberghe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0891242412471973">Shane &amp; Venkataraman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0891242412471973">Wright, Clarysse, Mustar, &amp; Lockett, 2007</xref>). In the past 5 years in particular, the amount of literature about this topic has increased considerably.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0891242412471973">1</xref></sup> There are some limitations, however, in the existing literature; for example, the evidence is fragmented and sometimes without solid and organized arguments to explain the meaning, factors involved, typologies, outcomes, costs or benefits, and interconnections among entrepreneurial universities and how they help foster regional competitiveness. Under this perspective, academic entrepreneurship is a phenomenon where an entrepreneur, a researcher, or academic develops his or her daily activities within a university that provides an adequate environment and resources to support the generation, transformation, and commercialization of knowledge and technology. A possible explanation could be that academic entrepreneurship is still in an embryonic stage and therefore lacks sufficient empirical evidence. In general terms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0891242412471973">Pressman (1999)</xref> argues that academic entrepreneurship via spin-offs is directly responsible for the impact of the U.S. economy through the incomes generated ($33.5 billon) and jobs created (280,000); is indirectly responsible via tax collection, venture capital attraction, and linkage to local GDP (gross domestic product) growth; and also disseminates new knowledge from university research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891242412471973">Bozeman, Dietz, &amp; Gaughan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0891242412471973">Link &amp; Wessner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0891242412471973">Lowe, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Our main objective is to contribute to a better understanding of the socioeconomic impacts of entrepreneurial universities. With this purpose, our conceptual framework adopts the institutional economics<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0891242412471973">2</xref></sup> approach focused mostly on the environmental factors (formal [FF] and informal [IF]) that contribute to generate the entrepreneurial university’s outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0891242412471973">North, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0891242412471973">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0891242412471973">Pacheco, York, Dean, &amp; Sarasvathy, 2010</xref>), the resource-based view<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0891242412471973">3</xref></sup> approach to understand the internal factors (resources [R] and capabilities [C]) that contribute to generate the entrepreneurial university’s outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0891242412471973">Wernerfelt, 1995</xref>), and endogenous growth theory<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0891242412471973">4</xref></sup> to argue about the possible socioeconomic impacts of entrepreneurial universities based on the determinants of the production function, such as human, knowledge, social, and entrepreneurial capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891242412471973">Audretsch &amp; Keilbach, 2004</xref>). Using the case study methodology, the study presents the experience of entrepreneurial universities in a European Region (Catalonia, Spain). Furthermore, the potential contribution of this study is with regard to the insights about exploring new ways of testing the regional economic influence of its phenomenon and using these theoretical insights for data collection and other empirical research, as well as policies that can stimulate the entrepreneurial activity of universities and thus foster regional competitiveness. After this introduction, this study comprises four main sections: The nature of academic entrepreneurship, the role of entrepreneurial universities in academic entrepreneurship, the socioeconomic impact of entrepreneurial universities in a European region, and conclusions.</p>

<title>The Nature of Academic Entrepreneurship</title>
<p>Several studies have tried to define academic entrepreneurship but without consensus on the use of one specific definition, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0891242412471973">Table 1</xref>. Concretely, within universities, academic entrepreneurship occurs at the boundaries of different scientific and professional backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0891242412471973">Wright et al., 2007</xref>); these boundaries are particularly complex, often existing in schools and departments that lack shared knowledge, goals, and assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0891242412471973">Wood, 2009</xref>). In this study, an academic entrepreneur is defined as both an academic, affiliated at a higher academic organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0891242412471973">Samson &amp; Gurdon, 1990</xref>) categorized as an entrepreneurial university, and an entrepreneur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891242412471973">Chrisman et al., 1995</xref>) involved in a new venture start-up founded to exploit intellectual property created in this organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0891242412471973">Shane, 2004b</xref>). Also, academic entrepreneurship defines the identification and exploitation of knowledge generated within universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0891242412471973">Louis, Blumenthal, Gluck, &amp; Stoto, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0891242412471973">Shane, 2004b</xref>) and the promotion of such knowledge by entrepreneurs who develop research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0891242412471973">Klofsten &amp; Jones-Evans, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891242412471973">Feldman &amp; Desochers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0891242412471973">Zhao, 2004</xref>; among others). Empirical studies have shown that in general, academic entrepreneurship has experienced lower levels of commercialization and knowledge transfer activity through spin-offs<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0891242412471973">5</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0891242412471973">Shane, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0891242412471973">Wright et al., 2007</xref>). This tendency is explained in terms of the attributes of the scientist and the resources of the university and in terms of the nature and level of the research funding and the research intensity of the faculty, the university’s reward systems, the university’s culture, and attributes of the local region in which the university is located, such as local demand opportunities and the availability of venture capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0891242412471973">O’Shea, Allen, O’Gorman, &amp; Roche, 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>Academic entrepreneurs face several challenges in the university context, such as (a) differences in human capital emanating from the academic discipline base and business ownership experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891242412471973">Corrolleur, Carrere, &amp; Mangematin, 2004</xref>), (b) conflicts of interest regarding academic and entrepreneurial activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0891242412471973">Lockett &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>), and (c) strong links with scientific networks but not with commercial networks that are agents who gain knowledge from one domain and apply it to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0891242412471973">Vohora, Wright, &amp; Lockett, 2004</xref>). This implies that academic entrepreneurs do not exploit all opportunities that they discover but carefully select those opportunities that promise the highest future returns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0891242412471973">Hitt, Ireland, Camp, &amp; Sexton, 2002</xref>). Then academic entrepreneurs are economic agents with a given endowment of new knowledge who can best appropriate the returns from that knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891242412471973">Audretsch, 2004</xref>). As a result, this phenomenon has created the necessity of support mechanisms to transcend common university boundaries. This explains why several policies are designed at motivating academic entrepreneurs to create new financially rewarding ventures that may need to be different from the programs aimed at making these ventures only a technological success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0891242412471973">Patzelt &amp; Shepherd, 2009</xref>). For this reason, the entrepreneurial university is an important catalyst for the facilitation of academic entrepreneurship, which in turn generates regional economic and social development through the added value created by the identification and exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0891242412471973">Shane, 2004a</xref>).</p>

<title>The Role of Entrepreneurial Universities in Academic Entrepreneurship</title>
<p>Indirectly, one of the most interesting results from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0891242412471973">Table 1</xref> is the summary of elements that characterizes the entrepreneurial university, such as the organizational adaptation to environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891242412471973">Clark, 1998</xref>), the managerial and governance distinctiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0891242412471973">Subotzky, 1999</xref>), the new activities oriented to the development of entrepreneurial culture at all levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891242412471973">Clark, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0891242412471973">Kirby, 2002</xref>), and the contribution to economic development with the creation of new ventures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891242412471973">Chrisman et al., 1995</xref>) or commercialization of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891242412471973">Dill, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0891242412471973">Jacob, Lundqvist,&amp; Hellsmark, 2003</xref>). Applying these parameters, the entrepreneurial university has the ability to innovate, recognize, and create opportunities; work in teams, take risks, and respond to challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891242412471973">Guerrero &amp; Urbano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0891242412471973">Kirby, 2002</xref>); and seek to work out a substantial shift in organizational character to arrive at a more promising posture for the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891242412471973">Clark, 1998</xref>). Therefore, the entrepreneurial university is a natural incubator providing support structures for teachers and students to initiate new ventures: intellectual, commercial, and conjoint. Based on institutional economics, the resource-based view, and endogenous growth theory, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0891242412471973">Table 2</xref> first shows the adoption of the interconnections among the environmental and internal factors required to achieve the activities of the entrepreneurial university (teaching, research, and entrepreneurial but, particularly, academic entrepreneurship) with the potential outcomes associated with them. Later, we attempt to connect each outcome with each determinate of the economic production function to intuit the possible socioeconomic impacts of the entrepreneurial university, describing each of these elements in the following paragraphs.</p>

<title>Entrepreneurial Universities’ Activities and Expected Outcomes</title>
<p>The entrepreneurial university is required to fulfill three missions simultaneously, which otherwise might be at odds with one another: teaching, research, and entrepreneurship. To do so, the entrepreneurial university needs to become an entrepreneurial organization, its members need to become entrepreneurs, and its interaction with the environment needs to follow an entrepreneurial pattern. Since its creation, the universal function of a university has been <italic>teaching activities</italic>. In this sense, universities have educated and trained students, who, after graduation, have assumed public and private responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0891242412471973">Porter, 2007</xref>). The main outcome is to provide to the society graduates who become both job seekers and job creators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0891242412471973">Schulte, 2004</xref>). This means that a graduate requires not only theoretical knowledge but also practical abilities (e.g., willingness to change, ability to learn; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0891242412471973">Van Vught, 1999</xref>). Hence, academic entrepreneurship could have an impact on the social and economic notion about human capital. In the same perspective, <italic>research activities</italic> are a legitimate function of the entrepreneurial university. Within the new knowledge-based economy, the research generates not only academic publications but also innovations for new companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0891242412471973">Schulte, 2004</xref>). At this end, academic entrepreneurship contributes to the generation, attraction, and retention of prestigious researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891242412471973">Bramwell &amp; Wolfe, 2008</xref>), who, in turn, would facilitate the innovation process and the creation and transfer of knowledge through patents, licenses, and spin-offs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891242412471973">Colombo, D‘Adda, &amp; Piva, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0891242412471973">Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education [PASSHE], 2005</xref>). Moreover, <italic>entrepreneurial activities</italic> link the research results to their practical implications for the society. Knowledge spillover, therefore, appears to transmit the university research by several conduits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891242412471973">Audretsch, 2007</xref>). Based on that, new companies are generated by the commercialization of research outputs of multidisciplinary research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0891242412471973">Schulte, 2004</xref>). It is one of the most critical missions to regional development. Subsequently, academic entrepreneurship, in particular, could enhance local job growth and regional development by promoting partnerships in key regional clusters that identify and meet needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0891242412471973">Porter, 2007</xref>). As a result, entrepreneurship is a phenomenon observed at all university levels: the university management, the academic entrepreneurship observed among the academics and researchers, and the potential entrepreneurs among the undergraduate and postgraduate students.</p>

<title>Entrepreneurial Universities’ Inputs</title>
<p>The identification and exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities within universities requires a supportive climate to promote the drive for innovation and entrepreneurship in all members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0891242412471973">Mueller, 2007</xref>). It is important to note, however, that academics who identify an opportunity may not be able to exploit it because they do not have the required skills, networks, or abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0891242412471973">Venkataraman, 2004</xref>), and that universities are large organizations and by nature tend not to be the most entrepreneurial organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0891242412471973">Kirby, 2002</xref>). Nevertheless, the incorporation of an entrepreneurial orientation in a university’s missions could change this situation. In the literature of entrepreneurial universities, six theoretical models attempt to explain this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891242412471973">Clark, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891242412471973">Guerrero &amp; Urbano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891242412471973">Kirby, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0891242412471973">O’Shea et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0891242412471973">O’Shea et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0891242412471973">Rothaermel, Agung, &amp; Jiang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0891242412471973">Sporn, 2001</xref>). Particularly, the entrepreneurial university is analyzed using an adapted model from the work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891242412471973">Guerrero and Urbano (2012)</xref> and the influence of academic entrepreneurship with the theoretical taxonomy of spin-offs presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0891242412471973">Wright et al.

<title>Organizational structure (FF1)</title>
<p>Universities require clear missions to determine their actions and contribute to the goals of society and the economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891242412471973">Clark, 1998</xref>). Therefore, universities need to be more than just the sum of warring departments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891242412471973">Dearlove, 2002</xref>). In this sense, new organizational forms try to reduce the levels of bureaucracy that characterize rigid and public organizations as well as to support the commercialization of university-held innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891242412471973">Carlsson &amp; Fridh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891242412471973">Grandi &amp; Grimaldi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0891242412471973">O’Shea et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0891242412471973">Wood, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0891242412471973">Zhao, 2004</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891242412471973">Bercovitz, Feldman, Feller, and Burton (2001)</xref> found that organizational structures of Duke, Johns Hopkins, and Pennsylvania State universities affected the performance in a predictable manner through issues associated with strategies linked to information-processing capacity, coordination capability, and incentives alignment.</p>

<sec id="section6-0891242412471973">
<title>Governance structure (FF2)</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0891242412471973">Middlehurst (2004)</xref>, internal governance is used to embrace internal management structures, decisionmaking, and leadership roles. The university’s internal governance has changed over time in the following patterns: collegiums, bureaucracy, corporate, enterprise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0891242412471973">McNay, 1995</xref>), and managerialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891242412471973">Dearlove, 2002</xref>). Governance structure is relevant because it defines the entrepreneurial university missions in which the commercialization is considered as an automatic and natural consequence of research activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891242412471973">Guerrero &amp; Urbano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0891242412471973">O’Shea et al., 2007</xref>). Based on the missions, the policies and practices within the entrepreneurial university are clearly oriented toward enabling the university’s prospective entrepreneurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891242412471973">Audretsch &amp; Lehmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0891242412471973">Patzelt &amp; Shepherd, 2009</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0891242412471973">Geuna and Muscio (2009)</xref> identified that the European entrepreneurial universities have engaged several initiatives to develop efficient infrastructures in order to ease the transfer of knowledge and increase the level of interaction with the industry.</p>

These support measures try to reduce the problematic conflict of interest of being both an academic and an entrepreneur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0891242412471973">Lockett &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, these measures also allow academic entrepreneurs to create links to external agents and markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0891242412471973">Tushman &amp; Scanlan, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0891242412471973">Vohora et al., 2004</xref>). In the Canadian context, university researchers evidenced that the mechanisms for commercialization of knowledge are determinants to create spin-offs and are more intensive than commonly assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0891242412471973">Landry, Amara, &amp; Rherrand, 2006</xref>). In the United States, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0891242412471973">O’Shea et al.

<title>Attitudes toward entrepreneurship (IF1)</title>
<p>The main actors in the university transformation process are its community members (students, faculty, and administration), and a key factor to fulfill the entrepreneurial university’s missions is the attitude of the community members toward entrepreneurship. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0891242412471973">Louis et al. (1989)</xref> explored entrepreneurship in research university units and identified that individual characteristics and attitudes are the most important predictors of academic entrepreneurship in large-scale science, earning supplement income, industry support, patenting, and research commercialization. Other studies have analyzed how the career of research scientists and engineers could be influenced by entrepreneurial intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0891242412471973">Lee &amp; Wong, 2004</xref>). With these considerations, favorable attitudes toward entrepreneurship facilitate the development of dynamic entrepreneurial teams through the different stages of a spin-off process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0891242412471973">Vanaelst et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Role models (IF2)</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0891242412471973">Venkataraman (2004)</xref> argued that if capital risk is combined with novel ideas, some successful entrepreneurs would emerge and become the new role models who will show their peers that entrepreneurial success is more than a theory. Knowing someone who has undertaken an entrepreneurial venture and succeeded in turning a challenge into a feasible reality creates “possibility proof” for the entire community. Further studies reveal that role models constitute important socializing agents, influence entrepreneurial intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0891242412471973">Krueger, Reilly, &amp; Carsurd, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0891242412471973">Liñán, Urbano, &amp; Guerrero, 2011</xref>), have an impact on individual feasibility and desirability to create a new business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891242412471973">Boyd &amp; Vozikis, 1994</xref>), and stimulate spin-off creation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0891242412471973">Van Dierdonck &amp; Debackere, 1988</xref>).

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0891242412471973">Kirby (2006)</xref> argued that one of the strategic actions intended to promote an enterprise is a reward systems, both monetary (bonuses, use of corporate resources, profit sharing, etc.) and nonmonetary (promotion and recognition systems). In this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891242412471973">Bernasconi (2005)</xref> explained that offering incentives to a university’s community during an entrepreneurial transformation is an effective strategy. Incentives and/or rewards help balance the costs that occur when academic entrepreneurs undertake commercialization activities, which are their investment in the skills of research, teaching, and administration and the impact on career progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0891242412471973">Wright et al., 2007</xref>). Also, the incentives to launch spin-offs increase when researchers are supported by complementary financial resources provided by the university or external sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0891242412471973">Landry et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, the image of academic entrepreneurship as a career path for academics to pursue should be enhanced through developing incentives for academics to participate in the entrepreneurial process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0891242412471973">O’Shea et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

The entrepreneurial university is required to establish teams balanced in terms of functional background and experience because, usually, venture capital requires investment in spin-offs that guarantees a fast launch of the company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0891242412471973">Vanaelst et al., 2006</xref>). Each type of spin-off requires different forms of human capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0891242412471973">Wright et al., 2007</xref>), and the university needs to recruit researchers with skills and experiences that could be complemented by an environment that provides appropriate financial and network resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891242412471973">Clarysse, Wright, Lockett, Van de Velde, &amp; Vohora, 2005</xref>).</p>

Previous studies have focused on academic entrepreneurship activities such as large-scale science projects cosponsored by industry, government, or others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0891242412471973">Klofsten &amp; Jones-Evans, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0891242412471973">Powers and McDougall (2005)</xref> determined a positive and statistically significant relationship between annual university-wide R&amp;D expenditure and spin-off activity. Academic entrepreneurship requires the use of venture capital, loans, and R&amp;D subsidies or grants such as financing mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0891242412471973">Wright et al., 2007</xref>), most of which are obtained through university channels.</p>

<title>Physical resources (R3)</title>
<p>Defined by an expanded developmental periphery, physical resources delimit the old boundaries between the university and the external world through infrastructure designed to satisfy social demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891242412471973">Clark, 1998</xref>). Within the new knowledge production and economic development, it is necessary to invest resources into research centers, ranging in scale from single individuals or segments of departments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891242412471973">Gibbons et al., 1994</xref>) to fertile environments for innovation and new ventures. The main function of these infrastructures is to develop networks between potential entrepreneurs and venture capitalists who provide financial resources that are necessary to start a company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0891242412471973">O’Shea et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Status and prestige (C1)</title>
<p>Status and prestige represents the uniqueness of historical conditions, whereby firms as intrinsically historical and social entities can be the basis for sustained competitive advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0891242412471973">O’Shea et al., 2005</xref>). At MIT, the orientation and culture of its faculty partly reflect the historical emergence of the organization. In this case, a number of historical events and choices appear to have had a positive impact on the development of MIT as a university highly prolific in spin-off activity (i.e., promoting the attraction of human and financial resources, as well as networks or alliances). Similarly, in Europe, some research-based exemplars are Warwick (England), Twente (the Netherlands), and Chalmers (Sweden). Therefore, a university’s status and traditions represent an important capability used to attract investments, networks, and access to public funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0891242412471973">O’Shea et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section15-0891242412471973">
<title>Alliances and networks (C2)</title>
<p>A newly emerging entrepreneurial university requires transdisciplinary and heterogeneous structures, as well as hybridizing organisms for collaborating, networking, and partnering with multiple industries, universities, and private and public institutions in both national and international contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0891242412471973">Gibbons et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0891242412471973">Sporn, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0891242412471973">O’Shea et al. (2007)</xref> explained that MIT has a long history of securing funding for interdisciplinary studies, both within the university and with associated institutions (MIT houses more than 60 research centers). Strong and long social relationships support academic entrepreneurial activities through the attraction of financial resources required for spin-off creation.</p>

<title>Entrepreneurial Universities’ Determinants and Impacts</title>
<p>To understand how an economy works, it is necessary to know the political, social, and cultural factors that establish its institutional dynamics; one way is to study the system of beliefs and decisionmaking processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0891242412471973">North, 2005</xref>). For example, in the United States, several authors have examined and corroborated the impact of public higher education on regional economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0891242412471973">Feldman &amp; Desrochers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0891242412471973">Lendel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0891242412471973">Vogel &amp; Keen, 2010</xref>). Particularly, following the influence of each entrepreneurial university’s factors on academic entrepreneurship, the entrepreneurial university makes it possible to generate several direct outcomes from teaching, research, and entrepreneurial activities. In the long term, these outcomes could be transformed into a determinant of economic development based on the endogenous growth theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891242412471973">Audretsch &amp; Keilbach, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891242412471973">Coleman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0891242412471973">Lucas, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0891242412471973">Romer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0891242412471973">Solow, 1956</xref>), which later could produce positive impacts on the economy and society of a specific region. For example, <italic>human capital</italic> is considered as a factor of production by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0891242412471973">Lucas (1988)</xref>, and the Uzawa–Lucas model refers to the stock of competencies, knowledge, abilities, and skills gained through education and training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891242412471973">Becker, 1993</xref>). Therefore, entrepreneurial universities could contribute to social and economic impacts through the generation, attraction, and retention of job seekers and entrepreneurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891242412471973">Bramwell &amp; Wolfe, 2008</xref>). <italic>Knowledge capital</italic> has been identified as a part of the endogenous literature with the seminal articles of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0891242412471973">Solow (1956)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0891242412471973">Romer (1986)</xref>, who identified knowledge as a separate input in production with increasing marginal productivity. Examples of knowledge are copyrights, patents, licenses, trademarks, and others. Thus, the economic and social impact of entrepreneurial universities could be associated with the generation, attraction, and retention of prestigious researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891242412471973">Bramwell &amp; Wolfe, 2008</xref>) who facilitate the innovation process and transfer of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0891242412471973">PASSHE, 2005</xref>). <italic>Social capital</italic> is defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891242412471973">Coleman (1988)</xref> as connections within and between social networks that allow increased productivity (both individual and collective); similarly, social contacts affect the productivity of individuals and groups. Partnerships among universities, industries, and regional governments facilitate the access of knowledge to the companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891242412471973">Bramwell &amp; Wolfe, 2008</xref>). Thus, entrepreneurial universities could enhance inversion attraction by promoting partnerships in key regional clusters that identify and meet needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0891242412471973">Porter, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891242412471973">Audretsch and Keilbach (2004)</xref> introduced <italic>entrepreneurship capital</italic> to the production function to indicate that entrepreneurship contributes to output and growth by serving as a conduit for knowledge spillovers and increase in competition, and by injecting diversity. Thus, an entrepreneurial university could attract or generate new enterprises that promote competition and diversity. As a consequence, these impacts could produce several demographic, economic, infrastructure, cultural, mobility, educational, and societal challenges that later will be reflected in productivity, competitive advantages, regional capacities, regional networks, regional identity, and regional innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0891242412471973">Goldstein &amp; Renault, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0891242412471973">PASSHE, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0891242412471973">Porter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0891242412471973">Schutte &amp; Van der Sijde, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Socioeconomic Impact of Entrepreneurial Universities: The Experience of a European Region</title>
<sec id="section18-0891242412471973">
<title>Catalonian University System</title>
<p>By adopting a case study methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0891242412471973">Yin, 1984</xref>), this section presents the socioeconomic impacts of some public European universities of Catalonia. This European region was selected because it has been an example of rapid transformation from an economy based on the efficiency of the production factors to an economy promoted by innovation (Global Competitiveness Index from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0891242412471973">World Economic Forum, 2011</xref>). Catalonia is located in the northeast of Spain on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea, with an area that represents 6.36% of the total Spanish territory. The Catalonian region is integrated by four provinces: Barcelona, Girona, Lleida, and Tarragona. The capital is the City of Barcelona, which is the second largest city in Spain, just after Madrid, and is one of the major metropolitan regions in Europe. In 2010, Catalonia had 7,512,381 inhabitants, representing 15.97% of the total Spanish population. Its GDP per capita was 24% more than the European Union’s 27 member states (EU27) media and only 1.2% more than the Spanish media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0891242412471973">IDESCAT, 2010</xref>). In Catalonia, the university educational system is integrated <italic>by eight public universities</italic>, namely, the University of Barcelona (UB), the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB), the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC), the University of Rovira i Virgili, the University of Lleida, the University of Girona, Pompeu Fabra University (UPF), Open University of Catalonia (UOC) -an online university-; and <italic>by four private universities</italic>, namely, the University of Ramon Llull, the University of Vic, the International University of Catalonia, and the University of Abat Oliba. We focused only on the analysis of the seven public universities. Due to the characteristics of an online university, UOC is not considered in this study. In this sense, from the dimension of the Catalonian public university system, in comparison with the 15 countries that comprise the EU15, we can observe diverse situations such as homogeneous universities (France, Italy, and Spain) and dual, called research and science-applied, universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891242412471973">Grau, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0891242412471973">Table 3</xref> shows that the Catalan university system considers research universities and is one of the most compact in Europe, if the ratio of inhabitant/university is considered. Therefore, the lowest ranking and youngest public university system in Western Europe is the Catalan. However, one of the most important questions is whether the cost of this university system reveals an effective functioning. During the last months of 2009, a sample of 284 academics enrolled in the Business Economics and Engineering departments of Public Catalonian universities were interviewed and stratified using an online Entrepreneurial University Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891242412471973">Guerrero &amp; Urbano, 2012</xref>). We received the responses from 60 academics that bring us their valuation with a Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>lowest</italic>, 10 = <italic>highest</italic>) of the activities and environmental and internal factors based on the literature of entrepreneurial universities.</p>

<p>Accordingly, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0891242412471973">Table 4</xref> shows that the academics consider their universities are involved in all activities associated with entrepreneurial universities. The traditional activities (teaching and research), however, received a higher evaluation than the entrepreneurial activities; this is not a surprise because most of the academic evaluations are associated with the results that they obtained during the development of those activities. The entrepreneurial activities are not recognized by the Minister of Education of Spain and by the Catalan University Quality Assurance Agency in the academics’ evaluations. In general terms, almost the majority of the academics consider that the Catalonian universities have the environmental and internal factors required to achieve all the entrepreneurial universities’ missions. Particularly, the Catalan University System is a good combination of universities with historical prestige and presence, such as the UB and UAB. Age, however, is an important element but is not limited in entrepreneurial transformation because each period has been characterized by pioneer and entrepreneurial managers who have promoted these issues earlier than the majority of the Spanish universities that started in the 1900s.</p>

<p>Hence, at its beginning, each university implemented several actions such as specialized infrastructures to support entrepreneurs (business creation offices), the generation and transfer of knowledge (R&amp;D centers, TTOs), and specialized physical spaces to incubate university spin-offs (incubators and science parks), among others. Today all these spaces of production, transfer, diffusion, and use of knowledge are a part of the Network of Science and Technology Parks of Catalonia (Xarxa de Parcs Científics i Tecnològics de Catalunya—XPCAT). This is a central instrument for science, technology, company, and market systems because it is a collaboration formula for the future of Catalonia’s scientific, technological, economic, and social development. All of these universities work together to improve and reinforce entrepreneurship, thus creating networks. Some examples of cooperation and collaboration include the following: In 2006, five of these Catalonian universities created the first interuniversity network of business angels in Europe and linked it to the North American Keiretsu Forum to bring private investment to business initiatives that emerge from the umbrella of Catalan universities; and in 2011, the eight public universities plus University of Vic created the Network of Entrepreneurial Universities in Catalonia (Xarxa d’Emprenedoria Universitària -<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.xeu.cat">www.xeu.cat</ext-link>-) with the aim of carrying out coordinated actions to foster entrepreneurship with the objective of contributing to the detection of business talent and business vocations within the university community.</p>

<title>Socioeconomic Impacts</title>
<p>In this context, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0891242412471973">Figure 2</xref> shows an exploratory analysis of the impacts associated with the teaching activities developed within the Catalonian public universities during the past 10 years. In this sense, we can observe constant tendencies in the number of students matriculated in humanities, social, health, experimental, and technical courses provided by these universities, as well as in the number of students graduated. An interesting issue is that in the past decade, the number of women studying in Catalonian universities exceeded the number of men. However, there is still a gender bias regarding the presence of women and men in some areas of study, such as engineering. With regard to mobility, Catalonia is the third region in Spain that attracts the most foreign students, following Madrid and Andalusia. Here, universities play an important role in attracting human capital talent from abroad. Thus, universities promote the exchange of Catalonian students to foreign universities. With regard to labor insertion, every 3 to 4 years the Catalan University Quality Assurance Agency administers a survey to graduate students to follow their labor insertion. In 2001, a total of 9,557 graduate students, after 3 years of their graduation, were interviewed. It was found that those who achieved a university degree were clearly oriented to develop their profession. Accordingly, only 6% were unemployed and 4% were inactive. In 2005, a total of 10,330 graduate students were interviewed, with 90.2% reporting that they were working at the time of the survey; only 4.8% reported that they were unemployed and 5% were not seeking work. There were also significant differences based on the types of studies because some areas, such as health, exhibited the highest employment rate, whereas experimental areas of study had a lower employment rate. In 2008, the survey revealed 93.5% employment and that the area affected by unemployment was humanities. Thus, there is an increase in contracts by the public administration. Finally, the effect of the economic crisis was reflected in the number of graduates who found employment after 3 years of their graduation (only 88.8% were employed). In summary, the educational level is positively evaluated by the demand, and it has resulted in adequate educational programs (theoretical knowledge) with an efficient university–enterprise relationship that allows practical training in enterprises of the region (skills and competences). Therefore, the Catalonian entrepreneurial universities contribute with human capital that in the short and long term could affect socioeconomic regional development through the generation, attraction, and retention of job seekers and potential entrepreneurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891242412471973">Becker, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891242412471973">Bramwell &amp; Wolfe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891242412471973">Corrolleur et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>With regard to research and entrepreneurial activities, from 2000 to 2009 the number of Catalonian academics has increased nearly 3% every year, and the sources of R&amp;D funding in the Catalonian University System is integrated by 13% central government, 56% autonomic government, 1% local governments, 7% EU, 14% universities, 8% enterprises, and 1% others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0891242412471973">IDESCAT, 2010</xref>). The results associated with the generation and transfer of knowledge, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891242412471973">Grupo SCImago (2007)</xref>, is that up to 20% of the papers are published in Spain (most of them in journals with higher scientific impacts). Thus, 16% of the Spanish university patents are from Catalonian universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0891242412471973">Oficina Española de Patentes y Marcas, 2007</xref>). In the same line, the Catalonian university system has been a pioneer in research areas such as medical care (university–hospitals cluster), energy (Alba synchrotron light facility), urban, economic, and social innovation (project @22), among others. These clusters represent both knowledge and social capital and generate a spillover effect with the local and international agents, as well as bring several opportunities to achieve a competitive advantage and gain productivity in regional economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891242412471973">Coleman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0891242412471973">Lendel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0891242412471973">PASSHE, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0891242412471973">Porter, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Catalonian universities generate their own sources of funding because most of the research groups develop research agreements and services to the community. If we compare Catalonia with the rest of the European countries in terms of higher education scientific production by population and GDP, we can see that Catalonia is well positioned with respect to the average EU country. In terms of productivity by researcher, there is not a huge gap between Catalonia and the rest of the countries, which could also be motivated by the specific context of each region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0891242412471973">Figure 3</xref>). According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891242412471973">Associació Catalana d’Universitats Públiques (2011)</xref>, the direct and indirect economic impact of the Catalonian public universities is around 0.6% of Catalonia’s GDP. For other countries analyzed, this could be a relatively low contribution, but it is necessary to consider that greater effort for innovation, knowledge, entrepreneurship, and technology began in this decade, which is a short length of time to evaluate the real effect. These capacities generate entrepreneurship capital that produces regional dynamics by injecting diversity, competition, and challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891242412471973">Audretsch &amp; Keilbach, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0891242412471973">Goldstein &amp; Renault, 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>Beyond the teaching, research, and entrepreneurial activities, Catalonian universities have also generated some direct and indirect social impacts. For example, the existence of qualified market professionals and the high quality of research have been decisive factors when it comes to attracting business to Catalonia. In this process, the role of universities is recognized because they act as hubs of highly qualified researchers, teachers, and students, allowing the generation, transfer, and development of ideas, knowledge, and multiculturalism. Thus, global university rankings have also contributed to the prestige and recognition of Catalonian universities, which have recently obtained better rankings (e.g., UPC, UB, UAB, and UPF). Accordingly, Catalonia has been a referent of cooperation and collaboration inside and outside its geographic dimensions, producing social mobility of large sectors of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0891242412471973">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>For many years, universities were unable to capitalize financially on their knowledge resources because technology transfer was limited. The academic culture and environment had to change to generate added value in all activities, which soon led to all university levels applying an entrepreneurial approach. Each entrepreneurial university is a function of its history and past successes and includes specific factors (environmental and internal) that could generate relevant conditions to explain interuniversity variation in entrepreneurship within their missions (teaching, research, and entrepreneurial activities; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0891242412471973">O’Shea et al., 2005</xref>). Under this perspective, academic entrepreneurship tries to create a market value toward the generation and transfer of knowledge through innovation. Generally, this phenomenon occurs within the university, where the entrepreneur experiences several conflicts, particularly the tension of interests between teaching and research activities or the reconciliation of different ideological elements. Our main objective was to provide a better understanding of the theoretical aspects of academic entrepreneurship, focusing on the socioeconomic impacts of entrepreneurial universities, adopting the institutional economics, resource-based view, and endogenous growth theory approaches. The insight evidenced in the Catalonian University System is that beyond all environmental and internal factors involved in the development of entrepreneurial university missions, there is a strategy focused on improving the determinants of the production function (human, knowledge, social, and entrepreneurship capital). In the Catalonia Region, there are some insights as to the socioeconomic impact of entrepreneurial universities; nevertheless it is necessary to evaluate the real effect in the long term. Particularly, in times of crisis, recession and recovery are the institutional changes producing “cleaning effects” based on the entrepreneurial abilities to dare, to initiate, and to overcome obstacles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891242412471973">Caballero &amp; Hammour, 1994</xref>). Therefore, in these competitive environments, policies are required that improve the quality of the entrepreneurial pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0891242412471973">Ghatak, Morelli, &amp; Sjöström, 2007</xref>). In this context, university authorities need to recognize their core role, not only building but also enforcing the university entrepreneurship ecosystem that nurtures entrepreneurial potential (incentives, new learning tools, role models), as well as stimulating skills, competencies, and tools that are most useful in creating entrepreneurial mind-sets that drive innovation (not only inside universities but also within existing firms) and becoming entrepreneurial organizations. In summary, the practical implication of these findings is the recognition of the relevance of entrepreneurship in an economy and society such as Catalonia. To be competitive in areas with lower economic progress, the cost–benefit and inversion of the transformation of the higher education system must be evidenced. However, in these crisis times, the most relevant component will be the integration and the collaboration of the agents involved in the entrepreneurial ecosystem of each region to reactivate the economy and assure social wealth. Further research should focus on disentangling these complex socioeconomic impacts on other entrepreneurial universities in Europe and North America. This diagnostics will require stronger analytical tools and long-term data.</p>

<p>Generally, institutional economics was used to analyze the influence of environmental factors on entrepreneurship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0891242412471973">Thornton, Ribeiro, &amp; Urbano, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891242412471973">Coduras, Urbano, Rojas &amp; Martínez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0891242412471973">Veciana &amp; Urbano, 2008</xref>). More concretely, the institutional approach has analyzed the changes in tertiary educational systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0891242412471973">Hanson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0891242412471973">Witte, 2004</xref>), the impact on regional innovation systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891242412471973">Cumbers, Leibovitz, &amp; MacKinnon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891242412471973">Doloreux, Dionne, &amp; Lapointe, 2007</xref>), and the conditioning factors involved in the entrepreneurial university (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891242412471973">Guerrero &amp; Urbano, 2012</xref>). Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0891242412471973">North (1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0891242412471973">2005</xref>) proposed a wide concept of “institutions that are the rules of the game in a society, or more formally, institutions are the constraints that shape human interaction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0891242412471973">North, 1990</xref>, p. 3). Therefore, institutions include any form of constraint that human beings devise to shape human interaction. Institutions can be either formal—such as political rules, economic rules, and contracts—or informal—such as codes of conduct, attitudes, values, norms of behavior, conventions, or the culture of a determined society. Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0891242412471973">North (2005)</xref> attempted to explain how institutions and institutional context affect economic and social development.</p></fn>
