<p>What is the relationship between ‘old’ and ‘new’ media? Are we facing the end of traditional media? How to define media in a changing context? What is the future of journalism and democracy and how to understand the increasingly complex structure of the media landscape? These are some of the questions posed by Karol Jakubowicz in the <italic>New Ecology of Media</italic>, a book published in Polish that starts with the situation in Poland, a post-communist state with a 20-year long history of internet use. But the book goes beyond the Polish context. Its goal is to summarize the existing debate and research that looks at the changing media landscape by looking mostly on the European level. Jakubowicz departs from the critical evaluation of the notion of ‘endism’ advocated by scholars who suggest that the information age is synonymous with a radical transformation and disappearance of the existing media structures (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267323113485777">Seely Brown and Duguid, 2000</xref>). Jakubowicz does not believe in the forthcoming technological utopia and ‘the end of media’. However, he believes that the process of digitalization, as one of the main reasons of convergence, is steadily transforming all of the existing media (p. 16). He also argues that what we need first is to understand the complexity of the processes of convergence and mediamorphosis. In this way we will be able to see what happens to traditional media, what has really changed in the past three decades, and how much media can we actually find in the ‘new media’.</p>
<p>The book consists of eight chapters. The first chapter looks at convergence defined as a mutual process of ‘internetization of media and mediatization of internet’(p. 31). It also describes a variety of consequences of this process which include technological, corporate, consumption, industrial, market, public, legal, spatial and cultural aspects of media convergence. In Chapter 2, the author embarks on a quest to find adequate definitions of media in the context of three different new media generations: 1.0, 2. 0 and 3.0 and focuses particularly on how are they changing the media ecology today. Jakubowicz emphasizes the necessity to distinguish between ‘new media’ and ‘new technologies’ since these are sometimes misleadingly employed as synonyms. The scope of the term ‘new media’ is changing with time, argues Jakubowicz, because in different times different media are considered to be new (p. 59). Chapter 3 provides an overview of different forecasts and scenarios concerning the future of the digital media. The forecasts range from the slow transformation of traditional television to the possibility of a radical paradigm shift with complete interactivity and personalization of digital media. The author seems to support the argument that every potential change largely depends on economic resources and development and so far, none of the existing economic scenarios foresees the death of the traditional television, radio and press. Chapter 4 goes further and focuses on the process of mediamorphosis. The author sheds light on two dominant and opposite perspectives that serve as frameworks to analyse the changes in media and society. These are: technological and sociocultural determinism. Although the former, popularized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267323113485777">Marshall McLuhan’s (1964)</xref> famous ‘media is the message’ statement, have led many to believe that technology determines human actions and the way we appropriate it, Jakubowicz takes a clear stance towards the latter. He argues that this is the only way to understand the complexity of processes and conditions that define not only how technology is employed in the new media but also how and why people receive it that way.</p>
<p>The fifth chapter in the book discusses the influence that convergence has on the whole media system. Jakubowicz describes different scholarly accounts of how users can potentially transform from passive receivers into active prosumers. He also looks at the place of both public and civic media and the potential transformation they are or can undertake. From this chapter we also learn about the legal and regulatory aspects of the media system, mostly from the European Union’s perspective, where access to the internet is considered to be one of the fundamental human rights (p. 172). Chapters 6 and 7 look at the role of journalism and democracy in the digital age. In spite of some voices and scenarios pointing to the fact that the future of traditional journalism is threatened by the rise of civic journalism online, Jakubowicz convincingly argues that this is not necessarily the case. Also, he suggests, the current crisis of liberal democracy cannot be simply healed by online activism and the implementation of different forms of e-democracy. Instead, we might need a more radical transformation of the current model and perhaps even a redefinition of what we mean by democracy today.</p>
<p>The book ends with an epilogue where Jakubowicz presents the voices of different media scholars from Poland who were interviewed on the question of why Polish youth does not need television anymore. Scholars answered in different ways, but what they shared in common illustrates well one of the book’s main arguments. Namely, that there is a difference between ‘television’ as a medium and ‘television’ as a technological device. While the latter is slowly fading away and losing its importance, the former transforms into a digital medium that is continuously appealing to contemporary youth and beyond. By emphasizing this point, Jakubowicz concludes that we are still rather far from any radical paradigm shift towards complete digitalization. ‘Old ‘media such as the press, radio and television are still here and doing well, while some of them, such as the vinyl record, are even being revived.</p>
<p>The conclusions from this book are not particularly surprising or original. Especially not for those familiar with the literature on convergence understood as an ongoing dynamic process or series of intersections between different media systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267323113485777">Jenkins, 2006</xref>). The book is also rather poor when it comes to the analytical and argumentative part as the author’s own voice often gets stuck between myriads of definitions, suggestions and conclusions provided by other scholars. At the same time its strength lies exactly there. It provides a comprehensive, balanced, well-documented and very solid literature review of the scholarly debates, theories and research on the topic. Its encyclopaedic thoroughness can appeal to both students of media cultures and a general readership interested in current trends and changes in the media landscape. <italic>New Ecology of Media</italic> also confirms the suggestions of many media scholars who argue that old and new media are intersecting, that we are far from total digitalization and that what will really happen as a result of media convergence still remains to be seen.</p>
