<p>In a 2001 editorial titled, “Health Education and the Internet: The Beginning of a Revolution,” the authors noted that the Internet had the potential to completely revolutionize health education research and practice by providing far more powerful ways of “. . . compiling, facilitating, developing, packaging and delivering health information to and between individuals and communities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198113483140">Bernhardt &amp; Hubley, 2001</xref>, p. 643). In 2013, Internet-enabled new media continue to have enormous potential to revolutionize health education with diverse populations by enhancing our ability to implement evidence-based behavior change strategies in manners that are often far more effective and efficient than were possible in the past. For example, new media can now be used to do the following: improve the ability to deeply engage large numbers of targeted individuals and communities over a sustained period of time; facilitate the real-time solicitation and analysis of in-depth health-related data and feedback from participants and collaborators to identify and aggregate health needs and priorities for planning health education programs; design and deliver highly relevant and personalized health education messages that are sent through the most accessible and persuasive channels at the most appropriate and influential times; and assess the effectiveness of interventions by enabling the electronic collection and storage of process and impact data from participants. Therefore, new media can contribute to and improve on virtually all steps in the health education planning, intervention development, and evaluation process.</p>
<p>In 2001, there were an estimated 500 million Internet users throughout the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198113483140">Bernhardt &amp; Hubley, 2001</xref>) and more than 20,000 health-related websites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198113483140">Eng et al., 1998</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198113483140">International Telecommunication Union (2013)</xref> currently estimates that there are more than 2.3 billion global Internet users; and there are almost 3.5 billion results available when searching for “health” on Google. In 2001, the dominant Internet-based channels besides the web and e-mail included newsgroups, chat rooms, instant messaging, and file exchange servers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198113483140">Bernhardt &amp; Hubley, 2001</xref>). In 2013, social media and information sharing sites, such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, are among the most accessed websites on the Internet with more than 1 billion, 800 million, and 500 million users, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198113483140">Facebook, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198113483140">Lawler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198113483140">Lunden, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The technology revolution has spawned the rapid growth of new media channels, tools, devices and gadgets that leverage the Internet’s access to vast collections of information. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198113483140">Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project (2013)</xref> data show that laptop computer use is now favored over desktop computer use, and music players, video game consoles, electronic book readers, and tablet computers have all grown rapidly since their introduction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090198113483140">Figure 1</xref>). However, the most explosive growth has been in the use of mobile phones, most of which feature the ability to make voice phone calls and send and receive SMS (or text) messages. At the turn of the millennium, it was estimated that nearly two thirds of the world’s population did not and would not possess the ability to make a phone call (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198113483140">Wang, 2000</xref>). Yet total mobile cellular subscriptions reached almost 6 billion by the end of 2011, representing a global penetration of 86% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198113483140">International Telecommunication Union, 2013</xref>). Smartphones, which contain many features in addition to voice and SMS, such as mobile web access, sending and receiving e-mails, and running small downloadable programs called “apps,” have also grown rapidly. According to Nielsen, smartphones represent approximately half of all mobile phones used in the United States and two thirds of new phones that are purchased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090198113483140">Pollicino, 2012</xref>). Additionally, there were more than 1 billion mobile-broadband subscriptions globally by the end of 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198113483140">International Telecommunication Union, 2013</xref>).</p>

<p>Health education researchers have continued to explore creative new ways to leverage the Internet and diverse new media applications to increase the efficacy of their interventions. The number of new media and health education studies continues to grow, as does the number of manuscripts related to new media that are submitted to <italic>Health Education &amp; Behavior</italic>. In this issue, we selected five articles (each were submitted and accepted through the journal’s standard peer-review process) to be published together as a “theme section” on the topic of New Media for Health Education. These articles explore many of the most popular new media channels available for health education research and practice today, including smartphone apps, mobile-based text messages, web-based tailored messages, and video games. Together, these articles provide a state-of-the-art snapshot of health education and new media in 2013.</p>
<p>In the article titled, “Apps of Steel: Are Exercise Apps Providing Consumers With Realistic Expectations? A Content Analysis of Exercise Apps for Presence of Behavior Change Theory,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198113483140">Cowan et al. (2013)</xref> examine the presence of health behavior theory in iPhone apps targeting physical activity. The content analysis was conducted by using an adapted instrument developed to assess the use of theoretical constructs in website development, and the app sample was selected from apps accessible in iTunes App Store’s <italic>Health &amp; Fitness</italic> category. The coding instrument included constructs from four prominent health behavior theories: (1) health belief model, (2) theory of reasoned action/planned behavior, (3) transtheoretical model, and (4) social cognitive theory. After coding a sample of 127 apps, Cowan et al. concluded that the sample generally lacked theoretical content. Constructs from the health belief model emerged most frequently from the content analysis data; however, it was concluded that the presence of minimal theoretical content was indicative of app developers having limited background and training in the applications of health behavior theory. Cowan and colleagues suggest these findings highlight the need and opportunity for app developers to partner with health behavior change experts to incorporate theory into app development, which may lead to improved health outcomes.</p>
<p>Similarly, in “Design, Development, and Formative Evaluation of a Smartphone Application for Recording and Monitoring Physical Activity Levels: The 10,000 Steps ‘iStepLog’,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090198113483140">Kirwan, Duncan, Vandelanotte, and Mummery (2013)</xref> focus on the use of new media to develop and evaluate an app targeting physical activity that promotes the use of step-counting pedometers to monitor physical activity levels. They developed a specialized smartphone app that allowed participants in the 10,000 Steps online physical activity program, which promotes the use of step-counting pedometers to monitor physical activity levels, to log and monitor their physical activity levels using the iStepLog app. The iStepLog app was developed to mimic the 10,000 Steps website log functions, and was evaluated for usability with a mixed-methods approach. After a two-phase evaluation, Kirwan et al. modified the iStepLog app and concluded that the usability testing procedures resulted in higher usability of the iStepLog app that may increase not only the usage but also the health behavior outcomes of the physical activity program.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198113483140">Bock, Heron, Jennings, Magee, and Morrow (2013)</xref>, in “User Preferences for a Text Message-Based Smoking Cessation Intervention,” describe the needs and preferences for using text messaging as a mechanism for delivering a smoking cessation program to young adult smokers. Bock et al. identify technology-use behaviors and preferred components of text message-based smoking cessation interventions among a sample of young adult smokers (age 18-35 years), who were either interested in quitting or recently quit smoking. A qualitative study, using three focus groups, was conducted. The focus group scripts were framed around a semistructured, consumer-oriented approach to elicit reactions and suggestions from participants regarding the proposed text message–based smoking cessation intervention elements. Specifically, the focus group script guided data collection for the themes of smoking behaviors, smoking cessation, and technology use. The framework analysis technique revealed overall support for using text-based cessation programs. Moreover, participants suggested including social networking, an online profile, and text message features that enhance interaction between the user and the system. Results also indicate that study participants prefer smoking cessation programs that combine text messages with web-based program components. Bock et al. conclude that these study findings challenge traditional methods for implementing smoking cessation programs and will assist in the development of future smoking cessation interventions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198113483140">Ammann, Vandelanotte, de Vries, and Mummery (2013)</xref> evaluate a website-based computer-tailored intervention for older adults in their article titled, “Can a Website-Delivered Computer-Tailored Physical Activity Intervention be Acceptable, Usable, and Effective for Older People?” Specifically, the study focuses on differences in tailored communication/advice acceptability, physical activity changes, and website usability between three age-groups: (1) young (age 19-44 years), (2) middle (age 44-59 years), and (3) older (age 60-89 years). The website-based computer-tailored intervention provided individualized physical activity feedback, with no personal contact for the duration of the study. After data collection at baseline, Week 1, and Month 1 with 288 participants, Ammann and colleagues concluded that the oldest age-group improved physical activity behaviors more than the other two groups. In addition, the older group spent the most time on the website, although the perceived Internet self-confidence scores of this group were lower when compared with the two younger groups. The findings indicated that no statistically significant differences were found between groups regarding tailored advice acceptability and website usability. Ammann et al. suggest that these findings support the use of website-delivered physical activity interventions for older adults.</p>
<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198113483140">Peng, Crouse, and Lin (2013)</xref>, in “Using Active Video Games for Physical Activity Promotion: A Systematic Review of the Current State of Research,” conduct a systematic review of interventions using active video games (AVGs) to improve physical activity and present findings of laboratory studies measuring intensity of AVG use among adults and children. The comprehensive literature search was conducted in two waves to include relevant studies published between January 1995 and March 2011. Studies that measured the intensity of AVG play or used AVGs to improve physical activity with measured outcomes were included in the systematic review. A total of 13 AVG interventions and 28 laboratory studies were included in the final sample. Peng and colleagues reported that all laboratory studies indicated that AVGs have the capability of providing light-to-moderate intensity physical activity; however, only three AVG interventions supported the use of AVGs as an effective tool to significantly increase physical activity. They contend that additional research is warranted to determine the true potential and effectiveness of using AVGs to improve physical activity levels.</p>
<p>The five theme articles featured in this issue of <italic>Health Education &amp; Behavior</italic> reflect a representative cross-section of current health education research involving the application of new media. The first three articles demonstrate the growing emphasis on mobile phone–based health interventions (also known as mHealth) through the use of apps and SMS, whereas the last two articles focus on the significant, but not yet realized promise, of web-based tailored interventions and video games for health promotion. Although systematic literature reviews have demonstrated the efficacy of computer-tailored health promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198113483140">Baker et al., 2010</xref>), SMS-based interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198113483140">Cole-Lewis &amp; Kershaw, 2010</xref>), and video games for health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198113483140">Hall, Chavarria, Maneeratana, Chaney, &amp; Bernhardt, 2012</xref>), there is a paucity of published studies to date on the efficacy of smartphone apps for health promotion. More research and evaluation is necessary, particularly those that use designs that emphasize both internal and external validity, to draw conclusions on the potential effectiveness of mobile apps for measured and sustained health behavior change. Furthermore, the five articles in this issue reinforce the need for behavior change theories to inform new media interventions and for user-centered formative research strategies and closer collaborations with developers to improve the usability of new media applications with end users.</p>
<p>As we enter the third decade of the Internet revolution, the articles in this issue demonstrate that we are beginning to see the benefits of early research on health education. As new media platforms and channels used for electronic communication continue to evolve and expand, so too does the potential for leveraging these tools for effective health education programs. Mobile devices, in particular, offer incredible potential for revolutionizing health education because of their omnipotent presence in people’s lives and their near ubiquity around the world. Other forthcoming breakthroughs with the potential to revolutionize health education include mobile interactive voice response systems for helping people overcome health literacy barriers and mobile telemonitoring devices to help individuals track, monitor, and leverage their own personal health data for managing diseases and promoting health and wellness. We look forward to more innovations of new media for health education and the potential they hold for greater health for all. <italic>Vive la révolution!</italic></p>
