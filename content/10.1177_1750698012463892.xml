<abstract>
<p>There are two conflicting cultural memories of 1968: one that celebrates liberation and the other that condemns political violence and sexual excess. This article, based on interviews with five former 1968 activists in France, explores the ways in which they seek to navigate between their personal memories of becoming an activist, positive and negative group memories of being an activist, and the contested cultural memories of 1968, in order to make sense of 1968 and their part in it.</p>

<body>
<p>There is a divided or contested memory of the events that took place around 1968 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698012463892">Cornils and Waters, 2010</xref>: 4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1750698012463892">Portelli, 1997</xref>). One facet of that memory is that it was a utopian moment when a new generation sought to change the world and to change themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750698012463892">Artières and Zancarini-Fournel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1750698012463892">Marwick, 1998</xref>). Another is that it was a foolish and dangerous challenge to society that produced the chaos of hedonism and political violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1750698012463892">Le Goff, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1750698012463892">Lipovetsky, 1983</xref>). The legacy of 1968 is that its memory is constantly in tension between these two poles.</p>
<p>Where, however, is ‘memory’ located? At one level, it is the cultural memory of society as a whole, elaborated by politicians, journalists and commentators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1750698012463892">Olick and Robbins, 1998</xref>). This cultural memory is none other than the grand narrative or narratives, which shape society’s interpretation of events such as those of 1968 and their significance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1750698012463892">1</xref></sup> At a second level, it is the collective memory shared by individuals who experienced events within the same group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750698012463892">Halbwachs, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750698012463892">Hilwig, 2010</xref>). In the case of 1968 activists, these memories are constructed from the perspective of the militant network or networks to which they belonged. At a third level, it is the private memories of the activists themselves, who in interviews describe their personal involvement in wider events and seek to make sense of their experiences. These private memories relate to their family of origin and life choices, but they are not isolated pools; they also engage with the collective memory of the group or groups to which they belonged, and echo or contest the ‘cultural scripts’ or grand narratives of the society in which they live (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750698012463892">Crane, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750698012463892">Green, 2004</xref>). They articulate both the dreams and the struggles that marked their common projects, trajectories and reflections of 1968 activists.</p>
<p>The material for this article derives from a collaborative, pan-European project entitled ‘Around 1968: Activism, Networks, Trajectories’, which ran from 2007 to 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1750698012463892">2</xref></sup> Involving a team of 14 historians, it interviewed nearly 500 former activists belonging to over 100 activist networks in 14 European countries. It considers not only the epicentre of revolt – France, West Germany, Italy, but includes democratic northern Europe (Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Netherlands and Denmark) and dictatorial southern Europe (Spain, Greece), together with (east of the Iron Curtain) the Deutsche Demokratische Republic (DDR), Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and the USSR (Around 1968, 2011). This has made possible a study of Europe’s 1968 that is both comparative and transnational, exploring varieties of activism across Europe together with encounters and interactions between European activists. It also permits the close-grained analysis of life history interviews, which travel between the personal dimension of family and friends and the political dimension of group activism, and attempt to make sense of their activism in the context of longer-term developments and wider narratives about 1968 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750698012463892">Gildea et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>For this article, a selection has been made of 5 of the 60 activists interviewed in France for the project.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1750698012463892">3</xref></sup> This selection is in no way a scientific sample, but it follows one of the guidelines of the project, which was to ‘decentre’ accounts of France’s 1968 from the conventional focus on Paris-based student activists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750698012463892">Gordon, 2010</xref>). In this sample, two activists fit into this category. Yves Cohen (born in 1951) was a graduate of the élite École Normale Supérieure in Paris, the headquarters of the French Maoists, and he belonged to the Gauche Prolétarienne (GP, Proletarian Left) which, in the wake of the general strike of 1968, tried to stimulate a proletarian revolution of which May 1968 was said to be only a dress rehearsal. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750698012463892">Bourseiller, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750698012463892">Geismer et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1750698012463892">Wolin, 2010</xref>). Nadja Ringart (born in 1948) was a student at the Sorbonne who flirted with Trotskyism and the Maoist group Vive la Révolution (VLR), which combined agitation among workers with communal living and sexual liberation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1750698012463892">McGrogan, 2010</xref>). The other three activists may be considered marginal to the main narrative but each representative of extremely important dimensions of activism around 1968. Jean Le Bitoux (1948–2010) was schooled in Bordeaux and a student in Nice, had little to do with the events of May 1968 but threw himself into gay activism when it emerged in 1971. Jean-Marc Rouillan (born in 1952), brought up in Toulouse, was likewise only marginally involved in May 1968 while at school but was shaped by the anti-Franco activism of the Spanish Republican exiles around him. He took up activist violence after 1970 and became one of the leaders of France’s answer to West German and Italian terrorism, Action Directe; he has been in prison since 1987 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1750698012463892">Hamon and Marchand, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1750698012463892">Jacquard, 1987</xref>). Fatima Demougeot (born in 1949), finally, stands outside the main narrative in many ways. She was an Algerian immigrant who came to France as a young teenager, in 1962, missed out completely on formal education, and as a factory worker, took part in an iconic strike at the Lip watch-making factory in Besançon, in 1973–1974. That said, she represents a new narrative, the triumph of provincial, women-dominated and non-violent agitation over Paris-based, male and violent activism.</p>
<sec id="section1-1750698012463892">
<title>1968 and oral history</title>
<p>Given the near-contemporary nature of 1968, it is surprising that more use has not been made of oral testimony for an understanding of 1968. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1750698012463892">Kristin Ross (2002)</xref> intentionally ruled out interviewing activists: ‘Who would I have interviewed? What possible controls could govern my selection of the testimony of participants in a mass movement that extended throughout France?’ (p. 17). The exception to this is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698012463892">Ronald Fraser’s (1988)</xref> <italic>1968. A Student Generation in Revolt</italic>, the work of nine oral historians including Daniel Bertaux and Luisa Passerini, who in 1984–1985 interviewed 230 people in six countries. In Fraser’s study, however, oral testimony was used to add local colour to the historian’s narrative of dramatic events rather than to explore ways in which activists talk about how they became activists, about being activists and what sense they make of their activism now.</p>
<p>Subsequently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1750698012463892">Luisa Passerini (1996)</xref> expressed some dissatisfaction with what Fraser’s book offered, and made very different use of the oral testimony she had collected in Italy in her <italic>Autobiography of a Generation</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1750698012463892">4</xref></sup> Her own study revolved around using oral testimony not as local colour, far less to discover ‘what actually happened’, but as the construction of memory in the present about past experiences, and as a constant navigation between external events and personal experiences.</p>
<p>‘What attracts me’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1750698012463892">Passerini (1996)</xref> says first, ‘is memory’s insistence on creating a history of itself which is much less and perhaps somewhat more than social history’ (p. 23). What I think she means is that oral testimony is less good at extracting hard data about class, generation or gender than it is at eliciting a history or a story (<italic>storia</italic> in the Italian original), of what she calls a ‘political birth’ of activists and their pathways through and out of activism. Second, she regrets that Fraser’s book ‘can’t be a history of subjectivity; there is insufficient time to do the comparisons and the analysis ... It will be a narrative of some of the paths’ (p. 21). Fraser stages the events of May–June 1968 in six countries, without dwelling for long on any individual actors. What interests Passerini, however, is the way that activists construct themselves as activists, and how the interview can tap into past joys and anxieties, loves and conflicts, bringing hidden feelings to consciousness. While recounting these interviews, Passerini also uses herself as a subject, analysing (with the help of her therapist) her own struggles to come to terms with the fall-out of 1968. Third, therefore, Passerini’s account is also an object lesson in how to explore the tension between individual memory and cultural memory, or to put it another way, between the individual narrative and the master-narratives about 1968 – which tend to be either about liberation and utopia or about hedonism and violence – against which the interviewee plots his or her own story.</p>
<p>Interviews with our five activists will be analysed in three ways that link story-telling, subjectivity and levels of memory. In the first instance, they tell a story of their pathway to activism. This may be because of the power of external political events, which were often mediated through relations with parents and complicated by personal conflicts with parents or with parental figures – the school, church or political party – which articulated some kind of conflict of generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1750698012463892">Von der Goltz, 2011</xref>). Second, they construct themselves as activists who sought both to change the world and to change themselves. They wanted a revolution in politics but also in lifestyle. This led to a great deal of camaraderie but also to conflict and rupture, especially over difficult questions of the use of political violence and over sexual politics. The interview can bring some of these difficult moments to consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750698012463892">Grele, 1991</xref>). As Nadja Ringart said at one point, ‘That is a real question, yes, a real question ... as I tell you about it I start to think’ (personal communication, 5 June 2007). Third, the interviews are framed in and by a social and historical context and reveal tensions between individual and social memory, between individual narrative and society’s grand narratives. The first of these interviews were undertaken in 2007, during the presidential election campaign, when Sarkozy said that he was going to ‘liquidate’ the heritage of 1968 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750698012463892">Gordon, 2008</xref>). This ‘back-story’ provided a clear context to ways in which they try to make sense of their radical past around 1968.</p>

<title>Becoming an activist: family relations and political context</title>
<p>Activists seeking to explain their pathway into activism navigate between stories of their family and friends and an outside world in turmoil, torn by the Second World War, the German Occupation, the French Resistance, the Algerian war and the Vietnam War. The personal and the political are interwoven, and often the relationship with the outside world is mediated through the political affinities of the parents, which either inspire or anger the young activists. Two main story lines of political awakening emerge. The first is a story of a natural progression into activism as a family heritage, the product of a certain education or interaction with comrades. This is the story of the ‘born’ or ‘bloodline’ activist. The second is a story of struggle, of frustration, even anger at their parents, at their education and at their parents’ generation, with a discovery of politics that was often that of the loner lonely rather than through a friendship group. In reality, most accounts contain an inner tension or ambivalence, and develop story lines that include elements of both natural progression and struggle.</p>
<p>Yves Cohen and Jean-Marc Rouillan both present themselves as natural or ‘born’ resisters. Cohen begins by relating his mother’s pain-free birth to being held by the wider family of the Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT), the trade-union federation controlled by the French Communist Party (PCF), to which both his parents belonged.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My name is Yves Cohen. I was born on 30 July 1951 in Paris [ ... ] in the 11<sup>th</sup> arrondissement, in the metalworkers’ clinic. Because it was there that the first pain-free childbirths were pioneered, and my mother was an enthusiast of pain-free childbirth. The clinic belonged to the CGT metalworkers’ cooperative. (Yves Cohen, personal communication, 9 May 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like his pain-free birth, Yves’ initiation into the French Communist party was also initially straightforward. His father was a journalist with the Communist daily, <italic>L’Humanité</italic>, while his mother – Marie-Elisa Nordmann-Cohen, a research chemist – had been deported to Auschwitz, as a resister rather than because she was Jewish. She returned in 1945. Being the child and also the younger brother of Communists, however, meant that Yves was sent on a summer camp to East Germany and had to endure the stifling Stalinism of the French Communist Party and the preference of Moscow for better relations with the West rather than with supporting the revolutionary movements that were sweeping the Third World (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750698012463892">Gildea et al., 2011</xref>). In the mid-1960s, however, the Chinese Cultural Revolution offered the possibility of a global ‘revolution within the revolution’, a new form of revolutionary communism. Yves Cohen remembers,
<disp-quote>
<p>I hated the Communist Party, whereas I was immediately enthusiastic, when I started to find out about it, about the Chinese [Cultural] Revolution [ ... ] On the one hand there was an adolescent revolt against my parents, but there was also a constant homage rendered to my parents who had been resisters [ ... ] the fact that my mother had been deported. (Yves Cohen, personal communication, 9 May 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jean-Marc Rouillan, later the leader of the terrorist organisation Action Directe, expresses no hostility to his parents and indeed some kind of recognition of his father’s Left-wing socialism and role in the French Resistance.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My name is Jean-Marc Rouillan. I was born on 30 August 52 at Auch, in the Gers [ ... ] My family was quite united, although only my mother is still alive. My father was a primary school teacher (<italic>instituteur</italic>), politically on the extreme left. As a young man he belonged to the Revolutionary Socialist Party, known as the Pivertistes [ ... ] He was a radio operator [ ... ] linked to the British Intelligence Service and the Resistance’s army-in-waiting (Armée Secrète) [ ... ] He was a schoolteacher, one of those who were called the ‘red monks of the Republic’. I was in a town, a small provincial town which was sharply divided into two, between the reds and the Catholics. (Jean-Marc Rouillan, personal communication, 17 April 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On the other hand, the fact that his father had been a radio operator in the Resistance was not as important for Rouillan as the fact that Toulouse, to which the family moved, was the capital in exile of Spanish republicans who had left Spain after defeat in the Civil War in 1939 before becoming active in the French Resistance, themselves liberating much of south-west France in 1944 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698012463892">Dreyfus-Armand, 1999</xref>). After failed attempts to liberate Spain by invasion in the autumn of 1944, Spanish republicans returned to Toulouse, and their sons and sons’ friends began to think of new ways of liberating Franco’s Spain:
<disp-quote>
<p>The people I turned to were those old Spanish guerrillas whom I respected, who had refused to be traitors and who remained guerrillas to the end [ ... ] I was not at all interested in the resistance past of my father. (Jean-Marc Rouillan, personal communication, 17 April 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rouillan also explains that there was – or that he has found – an easy link between his later radical activity and the Swinging Sixties in a cultural sense. His first confrontation with the police was at the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970, when he got involved in fights with Hell’s Angels and was arrested for having cannabis on him. Seeking to reduce the marginality of his own trajectory, he argues that violence was inherent in the British rock music of his generation:
<disp-quote>
<p>The more I think about that period and see the videos, I feel violence contained in pieces by Van Morrison or The Yardbirds – a violence that exploded in 68 [ ... ] When you listen to ‘My Generation’ by The Who even the words are very aggressive. You feel that this generation will be trouble. I think that part of my politics can be traced back to Swinging London. (Jean-Marc Rouillan, personal communication, 17 April 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The accounts of the three other activists focus much more on a struggle with their parents and their social background in their attempts to find a radical identity with which they were happy. The account of Jean Bitoux begins positively, although shadowed by a mention of his absent father:
<disp-quote>
<p>My name is Jean Le Bitoux. I was born on 16 August 1948 in Bordeaux, in south-west France. I was born under the eaves at midday. The bells all rang out – there was a church opposite to announce my famous birth. I was born under the sign of Leo. My father was not there; he was on his naval ship sailing round England. (Jean Bitoux, personal communication, 10 April 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Le Bitoux traces his latent homosexuality back to a struggle with his cold and distant father who was himself brought up in a very conventional and repressive environment and spent much time away from home in the navy:
<disp-quote>
<p>My father was educated in a private boarding school by Jesuits [ ... ] The regime was extremely strict, he did not really have a family life as a boy or adolescent. His life was militarised from the start [ ... ] When I was fourteen he treated me like a seaman on his ship rather than as his son. He spoke to me very little. He was a distant figure and very quickly I came up against him. (Jean Bitoux, personal communication, 10 April 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In his autobiography, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750698012463892">Le Bitoux (2003)</xref> makes a connection between his repressive naval officer father and Admiral Darlan, head of government under the Vichy regime who proposed legislation outlawing same-sex relationships with minors (defined as under 21 years of age). What became the law of August 1942 was not repealed at the Liberation but became Article 331 of the Penal Code in 1945. In Le Bitoux’s case, then, the struggle against his father and that against a patriarchal, pleasure-denying regime are mapped one onto the other.</p>
<p>The interview with Nadja Ringart also throws up conflict with conformist and hypocritical society. This is dissociated from issues she had with her parents, which in her case focused on her sense of inferiority and marginality as an immigrant.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>RG:</speaker><p>I am going to start by asking you your name, date and place of birth please, Madame.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>NR:</speaker><p>That is a bad start. It is a bad start because my parents called me Nadja. But they didn’t know that they were allowed to call me Nadja. They had been told that they could only give French names, which was true at the time, and so they called me Nadine [ ... ] It wasn’t until I was much older that I told the teachers that they should call me Nadja Ringart. And I was born on 11 June 1948. (Nadja Ringart, personal communication, 5 June, 2007)</p></speech>
<p>For Nadja Ringart, doubts about her identity, torn between a Polish/Russian Jewish family that had to hide during the German occupation, and the demands of an assimilationist French culture, began with her name and continued through her school days:
<disp-quote>
<p>That leaves traces in spite of everything. When it came to getting help from my parents I had to write the excuse notes myself because they could speak French but did not write it very well; they made awful mistakes. Mine was the story of a little, second-generation immigrant girl, brought up in a milieu in which there was some culture but very little money. (Nadja Ringart, personal communication, 5 June, 2007)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nadja Ringart’s sense of revolt and passion for liberty was sharpened by the constraints of conventional society that was reinforced in post-war France by the authority of the Catholic Church and its importance as a social marker for the bourgeoisie, even when their private behaviour flew in the face of the morality they preached:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think it was social and religious hypocrisy that made me mad. It was really an issue for me. I had friends whose parents might be religious, Catholic, going to mass and yet were ... For example I had a friend who was abused by her father who was a churchgoer, a pillar of the Church [ ... ] I had the idea that liberty was a fundamental value, even before I understood the problem of equality [ ... ] sexual, personal, political, everything, the self-determination of peoples, things perhaps about which I did not think a great deal. (Nadja Ringart, personal communication, 5 June, 2007)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like Nadja Ringart, Fatima Demougeot suffered from a sense of inferiority as an immigrant and shame in respect of her parents. In her case, the suffering came not as Jewish immigrants but as Algerian victims of the Algeria War (1954–1962). She has the greatest difficulty talking about this shame, and is unable to name it. It transpires that her father was an Algerian <italic>harki</italic> – trained Muslim soldiers who fought alongside the French colonial forces in the war – and was forced to flee Algeria for fear of his life when the country gained its independence in 1962 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750698012463892">Besnaci-Lancou and Moumen, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1750698012463892">5</xref></sup></p>
<speech>
<speaker>FD:</speaker><p>My name is Fatima Demougeot. I was born on 28 January 1949, in Algeria</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RG:</speaker><p>What did your father do?</p></speech>

<p>The <italic>harkis</italic> were, however, equally unwelcome in metropolitan France, and Fatima Demougeot spent her adolescence in an internment camp in south-west France, looking after her younger siblings on behalf of her depressed parents and without education to speak of. At the age of 18, she fled from her family and went to the other end of France to begin her own life, finding a semi-skilled job in the Lip watch-making factory of Besançon, where she found a new family and the basis of her later activism:
<disp-quote>
<p>It was a difficult period, difficult for the immigrants then, for those who had been repatriated, and also for the children, and especially the older ones like me. Yes, yes, I already had to take responsibility for six young girls. I tried to do things to get my parents out of their harsh existence, one which remained harsh for a long time, but seeing no way out I left [ ... ] I was driven by the idea of getting on because the absence of schooling weighed very heavily on me. I had a burning desire for independence, to make my own life, which meant getting a job. That is what drove me at the time – I was eighteen. (Fatima Demougeot, personal communication, 21 May 2007)</p>

<title>Being an activist: camaraderie and conflict</title>
<p>In their accounts of activism, former activists articulate the same tensions between utopia and crisis, between camaraderie and conflict, that begin to be revealed when they talk about their pathway into activism and which continue to manifest themselves when they reflect back on the consequences of their activism. The camaraderie of working and often living together in pursuit of utopia is cut across by the replay of disputes about whether the revolution should be political or personal, over questions of political violence and terrorism or over issues of sexual liberation and sexual identity. These accounts are often gendered in that male activists tend to place themselves at the centre of the narrative and highlight the upbeat, while female activists tend to place themselves more at the periphery and focus on difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750698012463892">Evans, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Yves Cohen entered activism along the royal road of the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, which was the headquarters of Maoist intellectuals who fell under the spell of Marxist guru Louis Althusser. He says that he was at the front rank of the battles of May 1968, then assistant to the Maoist chief Robert Linhart and his wife Nicole, who led the movement of intellectuals to the factories because they believed that workers were the motor of revolution and had to be raised from their sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750698012463892">Linhart, 1981</xref>). Cohen places himself at the centre of the story:
<disp-quote>
<p>I joined up with the Linharts, that is to say Nicole and Robert, as an activist in the 13<sup>th</sup> arrondissement. I spent two years with Robert and Nicole, and I supported Robert in his factory work [ ... ] In <italic>The Assembly Line</italic> there is an Yves, in Robert’s book. I am that Yves. It’s me. (Yves Cohen, personal communication, 9 May 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>May 1968 was not particularly violent, but Yves Cohen explains his entry into the Gauche Prolétarienne by reaction to three deaths: the death of a student, Gilles Tautin, drowned in the Seine near the Renault car factory at Flins, and the death of two car factory workers at the Peugeot plant at Sochaux, in eastern France:
<disp-quote>
<p>In photos I found of Gilles’ funeral I am wearing a black jacket, and I remember wearing that black jacket for two years after that [ ... ] After that I went to Sochaux – Sochaux was where there had been the two other deaths in May ’68. Without my being conscious of it in any way, without thinking about it at all, my trajectory completely linked up these deaths. (Yves Cohen, personal communication, 9 May 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Following a battle with police, Cohen was arrested in 1971 and spent a year in prison. After this, he was involved in the debate within the GP between those who wanted to continue with clandestine operations and undertake ‘armed struggle’ – soon discredited as ‘terrorism’ – and those who had learned a lesson from the Lip watchmakers’ strike of 1973, namely, that workers did not need to be awoken to revolution by violent action by outside intellectuals, but could act effectively themselves, locally, autonomously and without violence. Along with the majority, Cohen took the first path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750698012463892">Gavi et al., 1974</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>After that there was Lip, and at Lip we decided to stop [ ... ] It was not only young who were against the dissolution but also many in my political generation too, who had known the beginnings of the GP and all that, ’68 and before ’68 [ ... ] But not all joined groups which were to become terrorist or which were already terrorist. (Yves Cohen, personal communication, 9 May 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By contrast, Jean-Marc Rouillan did go squarely down the road to political violence. He explains that this was less because of the events of 1968 in Toulouse, in which he was (aged 15) a marginal player, but because of the Burgos trial in 1970, when six Basque militants were sentenced to death by the Franco regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1750698012463892">Rouillan, 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1750698012463892">6</xref></sup> Brought up with the children of the heroes of the Spanish Civil War in Toulouse, he saw the Burgos trial as nothing other than a new phase in the Civil War, in which state repression provoked revolutionary violence.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Our group immediately linked up with ETA [ ... ] Paradoxically it was the Basques who put us in contact with people, comrades in Barcelona.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1750698012463892">7</xref></sup> I started to work with them, to take part in the creation of a group called the Iberian Liberation Movement. (Jean-Marc Rouillan, personal communication, 17 April 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He was involved, first of all, in symbolic violence, such as disrupting the Spanish Tour de France team or setting fire to coaches that had brought pilgrims to Lourdes, but also in more extreme violence in 1974, after the capture, trial and execution of one of his comrades, Puig Antich. He explains in vivid terms that for him, the choice of violence was above all to continue the fight in the name of a dead comrade:
<disp-quote>
<p>Those who survive ask themselves how they have survived and what is to be done, what will happen [ ... ] For a political activist vengeance means continuing the fight for the comrade who has fallen. (Jean-Marc Rouillan, personal communication, 17 April 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nadja Ringart, desperate to escape the ghetto of her immigrant Jewish upbringing, was drawn by the bright lights of both political and lifestyle radicalism and found herself confused on the boundary between them. Initially she frequented the Trotskyist Jeunesse Communiste Révolutionnaire (JCR, Revolutionary Communist Youth), which seemed open to sexual as well as to political revolution.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I looked at the different groups and very quickly I said, ‘if they take power, what will I do? I’ll go into exile’ [ ... ] the JCR was the most amusing, in the sense that they were the least rigid, the least macho in terms of behaviour – free love rather than marriage at any price, relations between men and women – that attracted me a lot. (Nadja Ringart, personal communication, 5 June 2007)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The inclusiveness of political and lifestyle activism broke down when the JCR was banned and went underground, like the GP. Nadja switched to Vive la Révolution, with its newspaper <italic>Tout!</italic> whose aim was precisely that: liberation across the board. There, for the first time, she found a group of like-minded comrades who gravitated around Guy Hocquenghem, founder of the Front Homosexuel d’Action Révolutionnaire (FHAR), the Homosexual Front for Revolutionary Action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750698012463892">Hocquenghem, 1994</xref>). She gives an account of their collective memory:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I was with Guy Hocquenghem’s group, with his family and his close friends, it seemed as though they were fifty years ahead of everyone else. It’s not complicated, it was an anti-totalitarian vision. (Nadja Ringart, personal communication, 5 June 2007)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even this group did not last, however, breaking up over the question of sexual politics. On one level, gay and feminist activists were both against what they called the ‘hétéro-flic’, the legal and social imposition of heterosexual norms. Many gay activists had a much more aggressive attitude to sexual liberation while feminists, seeing that power was a hidden issue, argued that ‘your sexual liberation is not ours’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1750698012463892">Picq, 1993</xref>). Nadja joined the feminist movement but even that broke up over whether feminists should espouse lesbianism:
<disp-quote>
<p>That was the [Monica] Wittig viewpoint, that women don’t exist. They were fighting for an androgynous humanity – you have to understand their utopia. And I thought that androgyny was based on a male model [ ... ] no breasts, no bum [ ... ] I thought that women disappeared in all that, that the feminist struggle disappeared [ ... ] I was in favour of happy motherhood. (Nadja Ringart, personal communication, 5 June 2007)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Jean Le Bitoux, the trigger of his activism was precisely the discovery of the 12th issue of <italic>Tout!</italic> magazine, in 1971, which was edited by Guy Hocquenghem and his friends and devoted to the question of gay sexuality. At the time, a repressed student in Nice, for Le Bitoux this manifesto was a revelation:
<disp-quote>
<p>I discovered an incredible thing, a convergence of my revolutionary convictions and my secret. That is, the emergence or revolt of something as intimate as your sexual preferences which are not those of others ... I discovered militant friendship. Until then I had not had sex, I did not even know how to masturbate. I think that I only just avoided psychiatric hospital or suicide [ ... ] I began to piece together the bits of my political convictions and the story of my body. (Jean Bitoux, personal communication, 10 April 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The honeymoon period did not, however, last for long. Le Bitoux was alienated by the overt and publicity-seeking FHAR, and in time joined a more discrete organisation, the Groupe de Libération Homosexuelle (GLH), before founding his own paper, <italic>Gai Pied</italic>, in 1979 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750698012463892">Le Bitoux, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750698012463892">Martel, 2000</xref>). He explains the conflict with the political leadership of FHAR:
<disp-quote>
<p>Guy’s take on the homosexual question was one-sided. It was about provocation, destablising norms, insolence [ ... ] But there was something missing. Not everyone was on the top floor of the [École des] Beaux Arts, screaming and having sex parties. That wasn’t the way forward because in the gay movement there were also high school and university students, respectable men in ties who wanted to come out and not just have sex. The collapse of the FHAR was something absolutely awful for me. (Jean Bitoux, personal communication, 10 April 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The tension between the demands of political liberation and personal liberation is also clear, finally, in the narrative of Fatima Demougeot. The strike in the Lip watch-making factory in 1973, when the workers occupied the factory and began to manufacture and sell watches under workers control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1750698012463892">Raguénès, 2008</xref>), was a profoundly transformative moment for her, as one of the workers who sat on the Action Committee, which masterminded strategy. Although she was recently married, the collective struggle took priority:
<disp-quote>
<p>We were fighting for our jobs, for our employment collectively, and when we got involved – each person from Lip was, some more than others, but I had assumed responsibilities even if I wasn’t in the front line – I felt publicly invested by a responsibility. Family life had to come second, our life as a couple scarcely existed. I admit that at Lip we lived more collectively than as couples. (Fatima Demougeot, personal communication, 21 May 2007)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The fact that the semi-skilled workforce was mostly women, while male workers dominated the skilled jobs and ran the unions, emerged only slowly during the struggle. It took the advice of socialist feminists from outside the factory to remind the female workers that there was also a gender dimension to the strike and to encourage them to write collectively about their experiences in <italic>Lip au Féminin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1750698012463892">N.a., 1977</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>The question of women occurred only afterwards when the women of the Parti Socialiste Unifié [United Socialist Party] got in touch and said, ‘a lot of women are involved but we don’t see them speak, their needs are not included’. It was only then that we began to think about our role in the struggle, what it had been like, whether we had spoken. It led us very quickly to ideas such as: ‘the unions don’t listen to us’, ‘the men don’t listen to us’, ‘the women’s question is not taken on board or analysed’. At that moment we decide to go further and we brought out a booklet called <italic>Lip au Féminin</italic> which was very successful. We asked the question then, we didn’t stop at that. (Fatima Demougeot, personal communication, 21 May 2007)</p>

<title>Navigating between memories to make sense of activism</title>
<p>The life-history interview explores ways in which the memory and narrative of the individual activist relates to the collective memories of activist groups and the cultural memory or master-narratives of the wider society. As such, it replies to a question <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750698012463892">Wulf Kansteiner (2010)</xref> asked in an earlier issue of this journal, that is, ‘how and under what circumstances [ ... ] individuals and collectives escape the gravitational pull of powerful social master narratives’ (p. 4). These master-narratives are generally of two kinds, a celebratory one of liberation both individual and social, and a demonising one of a descent into chaos, whether of private hedonism or political violence or complicity with totalitarianism. In their testimonies, activists navigate between three levels of memory – private, collective and cultural – in order to establish a coherent sense of their past activism and present identity.</p>
<p>The years of activism came to an end around 1973–1975. Activists confronted the ‘normalisation’ of politics, and were then the target of attacks on the ‘excesses’ of 1968. These ‘excesses’ were presented either as the descent into terrorist violence or into the extremes of sexual politics – feminism and gay rights. This forced former activists into a defensive position. Ex-Maoist Olivier Rolin, who led the military wing of the Gauche Prolétarienne, argued under a pseudonym (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750698012463892">Furet et al., 1985</xref>) that French activists – unlike their German and Italian colleagues – had never gone down the path of terrorism. Maoist activists, like himself, had mostly been graduates of the École Normale Supérieure (ENS) in Paris, where philosophers rather than revolutionaries had only played with symbolic violence. Meanwhile, another former Maoist, Bernard Kouchner, chaired a television show in May 1988, entitled ‘May on Trial’, which showed clips of a Nanterre classroom with the graffiti, ‘I dream of being an imbecile’, and brought on former 1968ers to apologise for the descent into violence or a militant feminism, which deprived women of having children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750698012463892">Gordon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1750698012463892">Ross, 2002</xref>: 147–58).</p>
<p>The interviews on which this article is based were begun in 2007, when former French President Nicolas Sarkozy vowed to liquidate the heritage of 1968 in the presidential campaign, and as further attempts to obtain the release of Action Directe activists who had completed 20 years in prison since 1987 were dashed. The activists interviewed were well aware of these debates, if not directly involved in them, and explain their past radicalism by confronting their own story or memory with wider cultural memories or narratives. Faced by the wider narratives, which either celebrate or condemn 1968, they are torn between two positions. They may insist that they had kept faith with the activism they embraced in 1968, or they may repent for the mistakes they may have made in the past. Often, they seek to combine the two positions in some way: former 1968ers who see no benefits and condemn 1968 completely, or who – on the other hand – have a starry-eyed vision and deny that any ‘excesses’ took place, are rare. At the same time, they navigate between, first, these cultural memories of 1968; second, the collective memory of their group or groups in which they were involved; and third, their own private memories concerning their family origin and life choices.</p>
<p>Yves Cohen expresses both pride in his radical past and regret with what went wrong, and has reinvented his radicalism both in an academic and political sense. On the one hand, he is keen to present himself as a heroic barricade-fighter who then ‘went to the people’ and battled with the police, along with other members of the Gauche Prolétarienne; on the other, like most former members of the GP, he does not want to associate himself with the path taken by the Red Army Fraktion in Germany or the Red Brigades in Italy, in the direction of what would be denounced as terrorism.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Without militant activism, without ’68, I would not have had the rich experiences which still to some extent nourish me. Of course there was also stupidity, the stupidity that still believed in the revolution, going down a road which was in fact a dead-end. At least we realised in time, before the worst happened, that it was a dead-end. (Yves Cohen, personal communication, 9 May 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He turned his militant interest in Peugeot into research, using his contacts to write a thesis on inter-war industrial relations there, and gave his interview in his office at the Écoles des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS), where he is a professor. Politically, his criticism of the Communist and Soviet system was manifested by support for Polish opposition under emergency rule in 1981 and support for Chechnya in the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>Jean-Marc Rouillan, who in 2008 was on day-release in Marseille, is keen to reintegrate his story into the narrative of 1968 from which it has been excluded. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1750698012463892">Ross (2002)</xref>, he argues that the story of 1968 has largely been rewritten as a cultural revolution of free love and that the issue of political revolution and state brutality has been entirely marginalised. He says that those like himself and his comrades who did take the path of armed struggle have been demonised by society as a perversion of 1968, understanding nothing of its dreams but only its violence. This has also enabled those 1968ers who dabbled in violence to escape from the narrative of descent into violence and project it onto a small number of the bastard children of 1968.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>For twenty years people said that 68 began in France over some story of access to girls’ dormitories [ ... ] The prefect of police in Paris wrote a book saying ‘I did everything to prevent a single drop of blood being shed’, while at Beaujon prison people were being beaten up. Today we would say that activists were arrested and tortured and the issue of armed struggle was raised [ ... ] The re-writing of the story of 68 is based on our trial. It was said that we were its perversion, that we came afterwards, that we had not known the <italic>gauchiste</italic> movement [ ... ] Action Directe was four individuals who killed people for no apparent reason, because they were evil or had it in their blood. In Germany they were seen as a handful of psychopaths. (Jean-Marc Rouillan, personal communication, 17 April 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jean Le Bitoux was never interested in political revolution, only with cultural change. Sidestepping the conflicts between gay activists and feminists in 1971, he argues that women’s liberation and gay liberation were dual products of that moment of 1968, the second achieving its goal with the decriminalisation of homosexual practices in 1982. At the same time, there was a dark side, the tragedy of AIDS, and the various blocks in society to equal rights for homosexuals.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think that we have made huge strides. I think that one of the most magnificent outcomes of May ‘68 was the women’s movement, which was born in 71 at the same time as the homosexual movement. They won the right to abortion and we won the right to the abolition of article 331 [of the Penal Code]. Fourteen years after 68 an epidemic arrived that we did not anticipate at all [ ... ] Most of the activists over the last forty years have died of AIDS. I have survived. It is extremely sad. We might have gone further. We can go to gay marriages in this priest-ridden country. We might have won the right of homosexual couples to adopt children. Which has still not happened because priests can’t stand the idea ... because people still run together homosexuality and paedophilia. (Jean Bitoux, personal communication, 10 April 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nadja Ringart and Fatima Demougeot both make sense of their experience of 1968 as a reinvention of radicalism in their working lives and in terms of their identities. That said, they have rather different attitudes to their families. Nadja Ringart has seized on the assimilationist agenda of contemporary French society, whereas Fatima Demougeot has returned to the problems of immigrant families like her own who have not been able to integrate into that society.</p>
<p>Having progressed from Trotskyism and Maoism to feminism, Ringart became a social worker working with battered women. She finds coherence in her life not at the level of activism but at that of identity.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think one is feminist when one is feminist [ ... ] I accept that I am a feminist. It’s an identity [ ... ] I worked professionally with women in trouble, with battered women, between 1980 and the mid-80s [ ... ] It’s not a career, it was not through a political group, it was not activism. It was a life. Is that clear, are you sure? (Nadja Ringart, personal communication, 5 June, 2007)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She does nevertheless articulate some of the contradictions in the aspirations of 1968. On the one hand, she was desperate to escape from her Polish/Russian Jewish ghetto and reach the promised land of liberty, equality and enlightenment. She is a feminist and dedicated to the rights of women everywhere. On the other hand, she is still in touch with her Judaism, and at the time of the interview, she was celebrating Shavuot. That said, she disagrees with women from religious and ethnic minorities who do not see women’s liberation in universal terms but rather as defined by their religious or ethnic community – accepting the veil, forced marriages and female circumcision. She denounces this as ‘cultural relativism’ or ‘integrism’.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If we are fighting against macho, sexist, patriarchal attitudes – call them what you will – in one’s own society, I don’t see why you would not help others. I don’t see why we would help women in Iran or in Algeria when they fight the obligation to wear the veil while here we are supposed to say, ‘fine, everyone has to right to live as they want in France’. (Nadja Ringart, personal communication, 5 June, 2007)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Fatima Demougeot also progressed through activist phases, from workers’ rights to feminism and then to the struggles of immigrant communities. In no sense has she gone back to Islam but she has returned to dealing with the problems of immigrant families like her own, seeking perhaps to repair the damage she did when she left her own parents at the age of 18 to seek her own way in the world but discovered the value of collective action.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Lip shaped me perhaps or I shaped myself through Lip to reach out to other people, and I found that there was much worse than Lip, in deprived neighbourhoods. So since 1990 I have been involved in those neighbourhoods, working with people of immigrant origin, fighting for them. I have found people more proletarian than the proletariat, it’s terrible but there it is.</p>
<p>Was it Lip or my conscience which carried me towards other people to help them? I worked modestly with women and their families, thinking about families and their disintegration, helping young people in trouble with the police or families who had to defend their claims in front of a judge, because they are poor, or illiterate, like my parents. (Fatima Demougeot, personal communication, 21 May 2007)</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>These five case studies, though only a tiny sample of the interviews undertaken by the ‘Around 1968’ project, articulate significant tensions between the celebratory and condemnatory narratives of 1968. They also illustrate powerful ways in which former activists navigate between private memory, group memory and cultural memory as they endeavour to make sense of 1968 and their part in it.</p>
<p>The political awakening of activists may be narrated either as a natural progression from or as the product of frustration with their family background and example. The family is seen as a mediator of external conflicts – collaboration and resistance in the Second World War, imperialism and colonialism – which linked the activists’ relations with their parents and outside oppressors. In reality, even stories of natural progression or ‘born activism’, such as Cohen’s, involve issues of conflict with parents or parental institutions such as the Communist party, while Rouillan plays down the role of his father in favour of that of his ‘adopted’ parents and friends, those of the Spanish <italic>guerilleros</italic> in Toulouse. The story of Le Bitoux associates his (geographically and emotionally) distant naval officer father with the Vichy regime of Admiral Darlan, which outlawed homosexual practices and eventually brought forth his activism. Ringart and Demougeot, finally, both trace their activist dreams back to the humiliation and isolation of their immigrant backgrounds.</p>
<p>At a second level, the narratives of activists articulate the collective memory of the groups of which they were members. These can be stories of enlightenment and transformation, as the individual finds a new political identity and personal fulfilment as part of a network of like-minded brothers and sisters in arms. These memories nevertheless hold a tension between camaraderie and solidarity on the one hand, conflict and rupture on the other. It is often with reluctance and a sense of pain that activists relate clashes over sexual politics and sexual identity on the one hand and political violence and ‘terrorism’ on the other, for these both fragmented activist groups and broke up relationships.</p>
<p>Third, activists continually negotiate between their own memories of 1968, the memories of the groups to which they belonged and the master-narratives of the wider society. Nadja Ringart holds fast to the promised land of freedom, equality and enlightenment that she reached in 1968, and which allowed her to escape from her immigrant background. She is intolerant of other immigrant groups, essentially Muslims, who for her have not made the same leap of faith into the Republic as she has, and she criticises their position from the perspective of a feminist, while herself retaining some connection with her Jewish roots. Fatima Demougeot forged a new identity as an emancipated worker through the Lip struggle and as an emancipated woman from the struggles that grew out of it. That said, she has returned to the damaged, immigrant, Muslim roots that she threw off at the age of 18 through a new fight – in her professional life – on behalf of immigrant communities, especially women and youth. Jean Le Bitoux found his utopia through the gay rights campaign although he is sharply aware of the dominant view that gay rights was part of the ‘hedonistic’ narrative of 1968 that led to AIDS and did not manage to free itself from the stigma of child abuse.</p>
<p>Yves Cohen navigates between defending his struggles and those of his group to emancipate the workers, while underlining that they learned from their mistakes and did not go down the road of terrorist violence. In a highly acrobatic account, finally, Jean-Marc Rouillan attacks the condemnatory narrative, which he argues has entirely depoliticised the nature of 1968 and demonised, in particular, his own group, whose honour he is intent on defending, while seeking to legitimise his actions through reference to the narrative of the 1960s, the violence of whose songs at some level inspired armed struggle. In complex and eloquent ways, these accounts articulate the powerful contradiction between the poles of utopian dreams and conflicts as they navigate between all levels of the memories of 1968: cultural, collective and personal.</p>
