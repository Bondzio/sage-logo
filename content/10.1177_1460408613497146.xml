<title>Introduction</title>
<p>High energy chest trauma resulting in flail chest injury or multiple rib fractures is associated with increased rates of patient morbidity and mortality. Operative fixation of acute rib fractures causing flail chest is thought to reduce morbidity by reducing pain and improving chest mechanics enabling earlier ventilator weaning. A variety of operative techniques have been described historically and we report on our unit’s experience of the introduction of acute rib fracture fixation using contoured locking plates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1460408613497146">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Between December 2010 and 2011, 10 patients underwent acute rib fracture fixation under the joint care of orthopaedic and thoracic surgeons. Outcome measures included patient demographics, time ventilated pre-operatively, time ventilated post-operatively and time spent on intensive treatment unit/high dependency unit (ITU/HDU) post operatively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1460408613497146">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The median time from presentation to surgery was 5 days (range 2–12 days), the median time ventilated post-operatively was 2 days (range 1–4 days) and the median number of days spent on ITU/HDU post-operatively was 6 days (range 2–11 days). All but two patients, who did not require post-operative ventilation, were weaned off the ventilator within 4 days of surgery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1460408613497146">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our results appear positive in terms of time spent ventilated post-operatively but no conclusion can be drawn as we have no comparable non-operative group. We have however shown that rib fracture fixation can be carried out successfully and safely in a trauma centre with few post-operative complications reported to date. Further evidence on rib fracture fixation is required from a large, multi-centre randomised controlled trial.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1460408613497146" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The management of the patient with significant chest injuries following high energy blunt trauma has evolved over the last 60 years. Prior to the 1950s, management focussed on addressing the chest wall deformity that occurred with multiple displaced rib fractures and flail chest injuries. Non-operative treatment predominated with external taping and closed reduction techniques used to reduce and hold rib fractures whilst healing occurred. These techniques resulted in prolonged periods of bed rest and led to the consideration of operative techniques to fix rib fractures. Initial techniques described include fixation with wire sutures and intramedullary fixation with rush nails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408613497146">Fitzpatrick et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408613497146">Nirula et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>These older techniques of rib fixation and chest wall stabilisation fell out of favour as advances in mechanical ventilation took hold and became increasingly sophisticated during the latter part of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408613497146">Fitzpatrick et al., 2010</xref>). Positive pressure ventilation largely removes the added respiratory work that would otherwise be required following the loss of chest wall integrity and the principle of ‘internal splinting’ was established, namely that the application of positive pressure to the lung maintains a degree of inflation and reduces chest wall excursion during tidal respiration.</p>
<p>However, when coming off positive pressure ventilation during spontaneous breathing trials or triggered weaning modes, the patient must once again generate a negative intra-pleural pressure. It is clear that for some patients with loss of chest wall integrity, the mechanical disadvantage conferred by this, often coupled with significant chest wall pain, can result in prolonged ventilator dependency, with the attendant risk of complications and additional cost.</p>
<p>Moreover, studies with longer patient follow-up have also reported that failing to correct the chest wall abnormalities results in high levels of chronic chest pain and associated dyspnoea<bold>,</bold> with few patients returning to employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408613497146">Gasparri et al., 2010</xref>). These concerns relating to both short and long-term outcomes have led to further consideration of the use of rib fracture fixation in selected patients, with the aim of reducing pain and chest wall deformity which should also aid weaning from mechanical ventilation and may result in reduced intensive treatment unit (ITU) and hospital stay.</p>
<p>With this in mind, our unit started carrying out rib fracture fixation on selected patients with significant chest trauma and we report on our initial experience with acute rib fracture fixation over a one-year time period from December 2010 to 2011.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1460408613497146" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-1460408613497146"><title>Pre-operative planning</title>
<p>All patients referred with significant chest wall injuries were jointly reviewed by Consultants in Orthopaedic Surgery, Thoracic Surgery and Intensive Care Medicine to assess the appropriateness of operative rib fracture fixation. All patients underwent computed tomography scanning, with the use of 3D reconstruction with rendering<bold>,</bold> to accurately assess the degree of chest wall deformity and the number and location of fractured ribs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1460408613497146">Figure 1</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-1460408613497146" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>(a) 3D computed tomography (CT) reconstruction of flail chest injury. (b) Application of contoured locking plates to rib fractures.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1460408613497146-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Patient selection for operative management was then determined by the multi-disciplinary team (orthopaedics, thoracic surgeons and intensivists). The usual indications, now outlined by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), for fixation in acute rib fractures are flail chest injury or multiple rib fractures causing significant pain and associated with significant chest wall deformity and/or difficulty with weaning from ventilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408613497146">Lafferty et al., 2011</xref>; NICE, 2010). The specific indications used in our unit were as follows:
<list id="list1-1460408613497146" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Flail segment (of usually &gt; 4 ribs in more than one place) associated with respiratory failure and failure to wean from mechanical ventilation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Significant chest deformity as a result of multiple rib fractures.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Multiple rib fractures causing pain and failure to wean in patients with underlying chronic lung disease.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Impending requirement for mechanical ventilation due to pain and/or failure of chest wall mechanics.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Selected patients were then operated jointly by consultant orthopaedic and thoracic surgeons which allows the thoracic surgeons familiar with the lateral thoracotomy approach to carry out a safe exposure of the fractured ribs whilst orthopaedic surgeons, familiar with applying locking plates to fractures, can carry out the fixation of the ribs. This joint approach ensures maximal patient safety for the operative procedure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1460408613497146"><title>Operative technique</title>
<p>The patient is positioned in the lateral decubitus position and exposure of the ribs is typically achieved through a vertical lateral thoracotomy approach although other approaches have been described.</p>
<p>The advancement of fracture fixation techniques has led to the development of dedicated trauma rib fracture fixation systems such as the MatrixRIB set (Synthes). The implant set consists of anatomically contoured, low profile locking plates that can be applied to the outer aspect of the ribs.</p>
<p>A small incision is made in the intercostal muscles, which are often torn at the time of the trauma, to allow a measuring calliper to be used to measure the depth of the rib. The drill stop is then set at the required depth reducing the risk of internal damage. The appropriately contoured plate can then be applied to the outside of the rib.</p>
<p>The procedure is carried out under general anaesthetic with the use of a double-lumen tube if thoracoscopy is carried out as part of the operative procedure. Post operation patients are initially kept ventilated on ITU but weaned off mechanical ventilation as soon as practically possible. Measures such as chest physiotherapy and patient positioning are used to reduce the risk of infection.</p>

<p>The median time from presentation to surgery at our institution was 5 days (range 2–12 days). Five of the ten patients were tertiary referrals from peripheral hospitals, who had been selected as appropriate candidates for rib fracture fixation by the multi-disciplinary team (MDT). The median time ventilated post operatively was 2 days (range 1–4 days) and the median number of days spent on ITU/high dependency unit (ITU/HDU) post-operatively was 6 days (range 2–11 days). Two patients (numbers 7 and 8) did not require mechanical ventilation post-operatively at all.</p>
<p>There were no mortalities within the study period and one patient (number 7) was re-admitted from the ward to HDU with an ileus. There were no operative complications. Long-term follow-up (6–18 months) has shown rib healing, stable plate positions and no plate fracture or other fixation related complications. Chronic pain has not been a feature in this group of patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1460408613497146" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This small case series outlining our initial experience after the introduction of a rib fixation service presents a positive view of rib fracture fixation in a select group of chest wall injured patients. Although no firm conclusions regarding post-operative ventilatory requirements can be drawn due to the lack of a matched control group, we have shown that rib fracture fixation can be carried out successfully and safely in a trauma centre with few post-operative complications and excellent short to medium term outcomes.</p>
<p>We feel that in part, this success is reliant on the close co-operation and effective shared patient care between orthopaedic and thoracic surgeons and intensivists. An effective multi-disciplinary approach is required from patient presentation to long-term out-patient follow-up in order to select appropriate patients, carry out the appropriate imaging, perform the surgery and manage the short- and long-term post-operative period.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the multi-disciplinary team approach has been suggested as beneficial to patient care, most often in the management of patients with cancer. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1460408613497146">Ye et al. (2012)</xref> compared the management of patients pre-MDT care with MDT managed group and suggested MDT management improved diagnostic accuracy, promoted communication between disciplines and ensured evidence-based decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1460408613497146">Ye et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The literature suggests that acute rib fracture fixation reduces pain and the time spent ventilated and on ITU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408613497146">Bottlang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408613497146">Fitzpatrick et al., 2010</xref>). Most recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408613497146">Slobogean et al. (2013)</xref> concluded from their meta-analysis that surgical fixation of flail chest resulted in improved outcomes in terms of ventilator days and the chances of developing pneumonia. They also acknowledged that conclusive evidence supporting the use of operative rib fracture fixation over non-operative management is limited due to the fact the majority of studies are small retrospective reviews of case series, often without a matched non-operative group for comparison. They identified only two randomised controlled studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408613497146">Slobogean et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>The first by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1460408613497146">Tanaka et al. (2002)</xref> compared operative, Judet strut fixation, with non-operative management in a group of 37 patients with flail chest injury. They identified reduced lengths of time ventilated and on ITU and reduced rates of pneumonia in the operative group compared to the non-operative group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1460408613497146">Tanaka et al., 2002</xref>). The second was carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408613497146">Granetzny et al. (2005)</xref> and compared non-operative, external strapping of patients with flail chest injury, with operative fixation using Kirschner wires. They reported reduced amounts of time ventilated and increased pulmonary function test results at 2 months in the operative group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408613497146">Granetzny et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the encouraging results seen in our series and that shown in these trials, there is still little conclusive evidence as to the efficacy of rib fracture fixation on both short- and long-term outcome and large, multi-centre randomised controlled trials are needed to clarify the role of rib fracture fixation and two such studies are currently recruiting patients: the Canadian trial compares operative versus non-operative management of flail chest with a primary outcome measure of time spent on mechanical ventilation but also considering length of ITU stay and pain score. However, this study excludes patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a common co-morbidity in our patient population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408613497146">St Michael’s Hospital, Toronto 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>An American, multi-centre randomised controlled trial using anatomical contoured locking plates, similar to our series, as the operative intervention is also currently recruiting. This trial aims to compare early operative fixation (&lt;72 h after injury) with non-operative management of flail chest. Their primary outcome measures are pain, length of time ventilated and length of stay on ITU but they also aim to look at long-term follow-up pulmonary function and quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408613497146">Virginia Commonwealth University, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>These studies should also help identify which patients would most benefit from fixation and which fixation may confer no benefit. From our limited experience, we have identified two sub-groups of patients in whom we were unsure as to the benefit of fixation. The first are patients who meet the listed indications for fixation (pain, chest wall deformity and respiratory failure) but who were not ventilated and would usually be managed with continuous regional analgesia. Operative management in this group would likely result in a period of ventilation post-operatively thus converting a patient who was self-ventilating pre-operatively to a ventilated patient post-operatively. Our approach was to not intervene in this group.</p>
<p>The second group were patients with significant, underlying pulmonary contusion. It has been suggested that managing these patients operatively confers little benefit as there is a lengthy period of ventilatory support required to enable lung healing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408613497146">Voggenreiter et al. (1998)</xref> compared operative and non-operative management of flail chest in patients with underlying pulmonary contusion and concluded that ventilatory support time was reduced in patients who underwent rib fixation with no underlying contusion but only reduced in patients with pulmonary contusion if fixation was carried out during ventilator weaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408613497146">Voggenreiter et al., 1998</xref>). The numbers in this study were small (<italic>n</italic> = 42) and no consideration was given to the longer term outcomes of pain relief and respiratory function. From our experience, the majority of patients with flail chest injury have underlying pulmonary contusion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1460408613497146" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our initial experience with operative rib fracture fixation for flail chest injury has been positive. We have demonstrated that the technique used is safe and with the multi-disciplinary approach outcomes in the selected patients are encouraging.</p>
<p>Rib fracture fixation will be continued in our unit and the service developed to provide further evidence that the technique is effective with positive outcomes. A large multi-centre randomised trial is required to clarify which patients would most benefit from rib fracture fixation and to demonstrate improved outcomes compared to a control group.</p>
