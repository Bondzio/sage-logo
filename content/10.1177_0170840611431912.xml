<p>The global financial crisis has quite literally shaken up the world and its repercussions continue to reverberate across the globe. As of October 2011, this is most keenly felt in the eurozone with the leaders of some of Europe’s major countries seeking to find ways to shore up the economies of Greece and Italy. The debts that countries have incurred, as a result of the financial collapse in 2008, has led to major cuts in welfare spending and this poses a threat to the standard of living for millions of people across the world. All of this has led to the vilification of bankers and yet it is important to separate investment banking from retail banking. Moreover, it is also important to distinguish between the CEOs, traders and city speculators, and the vast majority of people who are employed in the financial services sector. The latter are far removed from the “fat cats” of the financial world and so it is worth taking time to consider, and reflect, on “their” lives.</p>
<p>Based on an ethnography conducted in a major UK retail bank, Darren McCabe’s book <italic>Power at Work</italic> provides insights into the lives of employees that were impoverished even before the “credit crunch”. It investigates neo-tayloristic modes of regulating work and the intended and unintended consequences of these modes of organizing for workers’ subjectivity and working practices. This book will be a disenchanting read for all those who have thought that disciplinary forms of management and control have been displaced through “modern” ways of managing. In an enlightening way, McCabe illustrates that contemporary “entrepreneurial” forms of work organization are still deeply informed by disciplinary technologies of power and control (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840611431912">Josserand et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840611431912">Salaman &amp; Storey, 2008</xref>). In McCabe’s “thick description” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840611431912">Geertz, 1973</xref>) of the working life of bank employees, the coexistence of different organizational discourses becomes clearly evident, as well as the ambiguities resulting from various discursive codes. The author highlights, in a thought-provoking manner, what it means to be part of a regime that constitutes work as a rigid, monotonous and technical process and that considers employees as machines that have passively to fulfil the task assigned to them. Through the analysis of working practices, self-understanding and the positioning of the bank’s employees, McCabe discusses the extent to which these workers contribute to their own subordination.</p>
<p>The title of the book already refers to its programme. The book is interested in how power is exercised in the workplace and in work relations – an issue that is extensively discussed through accounts that employees (in both back- and front-office roles) provide of their work experiences. Simultaneously, the book’s title indicates its conceptual roots. It is mainly influenced by Foucault’s works and Foucault-inspired contributions within the field of management and organization studies, even if key concepts of the book such as power, work and labour are also related to ideas stemming from labour process theory or the works of Marx. Following Foucault’s line, power is seen as deeply embedded within social relations; it is thus considered as dynamic and productive, instead of static and simply repressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840611431912">Foucault, 1977</xref>). This dynamic nature of power is also seen as the “moment of hope” immanent in McCabe’s book. Considering power as a non-determined play of different creative forces implies that working subjects are not fully defined and controlled and that resistance is, hence, “never in a position of exteriority in relation to power” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840611431912">Foucault, 1978</xref>, p. 95). In light of this idea, the empirical insights McCabe presents are a bit easier to bear. In the context at hand, the employees hardly question the general “order of things”, such as the lines of division, the hierarchies, the dense grid of direct and indirect control practices and the inequalities that characterize their working environment. As the book’s subtitle already indicates, to a large extent the employees accept the fragmented and individualizing structures of the particular work organization as well as the “objectified” subject position which the management or “those in power” have created and defined for them. In so doing, they assist their own marginalization, although this is by no means a necessity. It might have been different, there were possibilities to act and organize differently – and there still are.</p>
<p>However, some of the insights McCabe presents in the eight chapters of <italic>Power at Work</italic> deserve closer attention: the dominant discourses that exist within the UK bank (“T Corporation”), where the ethnography was conducted during a business reengineering reform process, are analysed by the author as a “strategy” and “implementation discourse” (p. 6ff.). The “strategy discourse”, discussed in detail in chapter 2 (p. 13ff.), follows rationalities, norms, power and control technologies that are usually associated with disciplinary regimes of work organization; on the other hand the language, the promoted ideals and technologies of the “implementation discourse” show a clear proximity to entrepreneurial power programs (p. 42). Chapter 3 demonstrates that the “strategy discourse” follows an instrumental consideration of the work process and is, above all, interested in standardization and efficiency. As in the “factory model”, the fixed, disciplined and disempowered working subject is defined as a commodity and a pure cost factor that has to be reduced.</p>
<p>In contrast to such a (neo)tayloristic presentation of work and the work force, the “implementation discourse” designs the work process according to new management imperatives such as customer orientation, innovation, empowerment, team work <italic>and</italic> individualized competition. The ideal subject of this discourse is the flexible, active and self-responsible entrepreneur of the self. Through the analysis of T Corporation’s strategy documents (“business cases”), McCabe illustrates the different logics and languages that the management uses in explaining and legitimizing its organization, targets and internal and external business practices. Inconsistencies between these discourses are also experienced by the bank’s employees and affect their daily work practices and professional identity. Still, it seems that the various discursive demands do not solely constitute conflict, confusion and fragmentation. They also constitute “twilight areas” or “in-between spaces” that employees can use in order to express their own concerns and explain their conduct and (non)activities. Thus, the “tactical polyvalence of discourse” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840611431912">Foucault, 1978</xref>, p. 100), the incompleteness and coexistence of discourses do not solely threaten one’s subjectivity and sense of self; instead, multiple discursive “voices” also constitute chances for the active co-production of the social and political structures and practices in which we are embedded.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 makes it evident that the bank’s employees try, at least occasionally, to improve their working conditions, through creating a “humanized version of the machine” (p. 93). In the present context, these chances of co- and recreating the social conditions of work are not, as yet, collectively used. However, in chapter 5, the book’s most stirring chapter, we learn about the employee’s engagement in individual micro-politics. They follow their interests through particular practices of actively “making do”, practices which allow individuals to cope with the “regime’s” paradoxes and alienation tendencies without undermining them (p. 122ff.). McCabe also identifies practices of “making out” and these are presented as activities that are intended to escape or work against the regime, through cynicism, work-to-rule or fiddling, for example, in regard to the widespread performance measurements (p. 129ff.). Apart from the fact that the distinction between employee dissent and consent with organizational demands is often blurred (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840611431912">Salaman &amp; Storey, 2008</xref>), McCabe highlights that both “making do” and “making out” practices do not challenge the basic foundations and morals on which the bank’s work organization is built on. According to the narratives given, some of the employees seem to be aware of the ongoing (self)disciplinary processes within T Corporation – which highlights again the potential for resistance, as McCabe emphasizes several times. Despite this consciousness, including cynical comments about their life in a “chicken factory” (p. 102), the employees do not seriously problematize the individualizing and normalizing managerial practices and instruments of organizing, allocating and assessing their work.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 illustrates how the employees actually promote, especially within team-based forms of organizing, work intensification through continuously increasing their workload. In this vein they contribute to their own subjection and exploitation, to mutual surveillance, control and “visibility” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840611431912">Foucault, 1977</xref>). It thus seems that the employees unconsciously use their contingent collective power <italic>for</italic> the bank’s authorities, and <italic>against</italic> themselves. At several points it becomes obvious that they co-construct “otherness”, differences and separation lines among the heterogeneously composed staff (p. 157ff.). If the employees collaborate, then it is solely within their direct work environment. Only a few cooperate with other departments or institutions of the bank, as chapter 7 points out. The trade union, equally passive and “invisible” by nature, is hardly noticed by the employees and in general is not perceived as a means to organize to advance one’s own purpose. Many of the workers do not identify with the union. They do not understand themselves as part of the union; on the contrary, the majority of the employees define the union, like the management, as “other”, as opposite. In view of this McCabe concludes that most employees have absorbed the individualization, self-organization and responsibilization “dictates” advocated by T Corporation’s management – while forgetting that they could also form a collective.</p>
<p>In the final chapter, McCabe emphasizes that this specific conduct is (self)destructive. He insists that there are various chances to modify the social order at T Corporation. This however requires a willingness from the staff to rethink the images they have created about each other. It demands that they no longer consider each other as “other”, as “unknown” or “stranger”. It demands that we start to reject the dividing and individualizing technologies of power that deeply infuse our (working) lives since the emergence of disciplinary societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840611431912">Foucault, 1977</xref>). Thus, as a first step it demands the willingness to recognize individual frustration, disappointment, alienation and fear as part of a collective vulnerability, sensation of injustice and suffering. According to McCabe, the only effective chance to challenge established modes of how work and other spheres of social life are currently regulated by economic and political authorities lies in the acknowledgement of what connects us, instead of what disconnects and separates us from each other (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840611431912">Cooper, 1983</xref>). McCabe’s thinking of a “we” among T Corporation’s employees does not intend to silence multiple voices or to homogenize, unify and close difference and diversity. Instead, he seems to be inspired by the notion of a “we” that is close to Hardt and Negri’s concept of the multitude – a collective that is composed of multiplicity. Within the multitude, singularities are conjoined through certain ethico-aesthetic ideas and aspirations; because they wish to transform dominant power structures and programs they <italic>act</italic> and organize together in the spirit of these idea(l)s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840611431912">Hardt &amp; Negri, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>McCabe’s concern becomes finally very clear. In an empathic and personal way he invites the bank’s employees to rethink their subjectivity/ies as well as the management ideologies, the taken-for-granted truths and “natural” profit maximization orders that inform T Corporation. In order to attain a more embodied and joyful work experience he furthermore suggests that they organize their power and locally and collectively resist the bank’s dehumanized regime of uncertainty, pressure and anxiety (p. 227). The pedagogical, normative appeal he aims at the management: considering your employees solely in terms of an “exchange value” and treating workers like technical objects is not responsible. Besides, it is not reasonable. It also disregards the variety of intellectual, affective and creative potentials and qualities of human beings. All in all, McCabe’s book, in analysing internal forms of work organization in retail banking and the associated precarious effects on employees’ subjectivity, has various strengths. One in particular is McCabe’s ability to synthesize complex concepts of organizational theory, literary illustrations (i.e. from Orwell to Dostoyevsky), and very dense, moving empirical material in a comprehensive, clear and smooth manner. It is exactly this composition that makes <italic>Power at Work</italic> a little piece of art that is illuminating for a broad audience, ranging from students with an interest in the philosophy of organization and management, to critical and poststructuralist organization studies scholars to, more broadly, “leaders” and “followers” of bank institutions and beyond, who are interested and willing to question established practices of organizing work, life and self. Put differently, the book, published in paperback in 2009, promises to be inspiring for all those who would affirm Foucault’s belief that “there are times in life when the question of knowing if one can think differently than one thinks, and perceive differently than one sees, is absolutely necessary if one is to go on looking and reflecting at all” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840611431912">Foucault, 1984</xref>, p. 8). By any measure, the current financial and market crisis can be said to represent such a time.</p>
