<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Various lifestyle factors, such as sleep, diet, family variables, and drinking and smoking habits, have been reported to be correlated with school performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896910393788">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896910393788">8</xref></sup> Therefore, better lifestyle choices may result in beneficial educational outcomes in school students.</p>
<p>Daily school attendance is one of the most important educational outcomes in school students. With respect to school attendance, much attention has recently been paid to fatigue, since school absence from fatigue is not rare.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896910393788">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896910393788">11</xref></sup> Fatigue can be defined as difficulty in the initiation of or in sustaining voluntary activities,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896910393788">12</xref></sup> and it is a common symptom. Large community surveys have reported that up to half of the general adult population reports fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896910393788">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896910393788">14</xref></sup> In a recent prospective cohort study of adolescents, the prevalence of fatigue was 34.1 per cent to 38.1 per cent, the prevalence of chronic fatigue was 0.4 per cent to 1.1 per cent, and the prevalence of childhood chronic fatigue syndrome was 0.1 per cent to 0.5 per cent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896910393788">15</xref></sup> Because fatigue is related to impaired academic outcomes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896910393788">16</xref></sup> the impact of fatigue on school students should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>Although a relationship between lifestyle factors and academic performance has been identified, no correlation between these factors and school attendance has been identified in medical students. However, because various lifestyle factors are related to fatigue,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896910393788">8</xref></sup> and because fatigue is also associated with school attendance in medical students,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896910393788">8</xref></sup> various lifestyle factors have been reported to be correlated with school performance, and daily school attendance is one of the most important educational outcomes in school students, we hypothesized that some lifestyle factors are related to school attendance, and that the relationship, if recognized, might help medical educators to identify those at high risk of school absence. This would allow early interventions to lower the incidence of school absence and/or increase the rates of daily school attendance in medical students. Therefore, in the present study, the association between lifestyle factors and school attendance was examined in medical students.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0017896910393788">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>The study group included all 187 second-year medical students attending Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine. Because the presence of mental or physical diseases may be potential confounding factors, 30 subjects with medical illnesses (such as depression, hypertension, chronic nephritis, gastric ulcer, irritable bowel syndrome, bronchial asthma, atopic dermatitis, and seasonal allergic rhinitis), were excluded from the analyses. The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Osaka City University, and all subjects provided their informed consent prior to participating in the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0017896910393788">
<title>Questionnaire</title>
<p>Paper-and-pencil questionnaires were distributed to the subjects. The questionnaire completed by each subject covered the topics of lifestyle factors and school attendance. Questions about lifestyle included items about nocturnal sleeping hours on school days, breakfast (every day, not every day, or completely skipping every day), regularity of meals (always, not always, or completely irregular), watching television (≤ 1 hour per day, 2 hours per day, 3 hours per day, or ≥ 4 hours per day), spending time with family members (&lt; 30 minutes per day, 30 minutes to 1 hour per day, 1 to 2 hours per day, or ≥ 2 hours per day), alcohol consumption (yes or no), and smoker (yes or no). In addition, a question about daily school attendance (yes or no) was included in the questionnaire.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0017896910393788">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify lifestyle factors associated with school attendance. The 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each odds ratio (OR). The number of cases in the analyses varied because of incidental missing values. All <italic>P</italic> values were two-tailed, and <italic>P</italic> values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 17.0 software package (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These cross-sectional data demonstrate that skipping breakfast and taking meals irregularly were less likely to and spending time with family members was more likely to indicate a prevalence of everyday school attendance in medical students, independent of age and gender. In addition, smoking habit had a trend toward a lower likeliness to attend school. In contrast, nocturnal sleeping hours, television, and drinking habit were not associated with everyday school attendance in these students.</p>
<p>It has been reported that participation in a school breakfast programme was associated with improvements in school performance and reductions in absenteeism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896910393788">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896910393788">19</xref></sup>. Since skipping breakfast is related to low nutrient intake, and students who increased their nutrient intake after the start of a school breakfast programme were more likely to improve their school performance and reduce absenteeism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896910393788">19</xref></sup>, skipping breakfast may cause poor academic outcomes through impaired nutritional status. Thus, a plausible mechanism that would explain how skipping breakfast could induce lower prevalence of everyday school attendance in medical students may be, at least in part, based on impaired nutritional status. However, since we did not assess the subjects’ nutritional states, the interpretation of the linkage between the nutritional state and everyday school attendance is purely speculative.</p>
<p>Academic performance of school students has been reported to be associated with meal regularity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896910393788">20</xref></sup>, and the mechanism by which meal irregularity is related to poor academic performance has been explained by: 1) poor health status; 2) irritability, distractibility, and emotional changes; 3) anxiety resulting from feelings of deprivation; 4) parental stress, anxiety, and behavior; and 5) family functioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896910393788">21</xref></sup>. Although further studies are necessary, these factors might contribute to the development of a lower prevalence of everyday school attendance among medical students.</p>
<p>A British longitudinal cohort study showed that closeness to mother or father, including activities such as regular outings, reading to a child, and interest in a child’s education, was associated with higher academic motivation in adolescents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0017896910393788">22</xref></sup>; and family interrelationships, such as family bonds and intimate relationship between parents, have been shown to play an important role in academic motivation (expectation of achieving academic degree) and effort applied to studying (i.e., time spent on study after class) in adolescents with substance use problems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896910393788">23</xref></sup>. Thus, good friendships and communication with family members may be important determinants of academic outcomes among school students. In medical students, even after adjustment for age, class year, gender, race, relationship status, and subjective health, compared with students with lower levels of psychological well-being, those with higher levels reported more satisfaction with support from their families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896910393788">24</xref></sup>. They also reported having grown up in families with more cohesion, more active recreational orientation, more moral-religious emphasis, and less conflict<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896910393788">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, a close relationship between academic outcomes and good friendships and communication with family members might exist even among medical students.</p>
<p>Consistent with the present results, it has been reported that, among high school students classified according to cigarette smoking intention status (including non-intenders, mild intenders, and strong intenders), non-intenders reported greater intentions to attend college<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896910393788">25</xref></sup>. In addition, healthy lifestyle choices, such as not using tobacco or illegal drugs, were associated with higher academic performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896910393788">3</xref></sup>. Since non-intenders for cigarette smoking were more self-confident, intelligent, emotionally stable, moralistic, conservative, group-oriented, self-controlled, and more likely to respond in a socially desirable manner than strong intenders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896910393788">25</xref></sup>, these factors might contribute to the development of a lower prevalence of everyday school attendance among medical students who use tobacco.</p>
<p>As for the contributions of primary socialization influences (early lifestyle influences) and professional socialization influences (professionalism associated with entering the medical profession) as possible relative risk factors of school absence, it seems to be difficult to assess the weighting of these two influences. However, since lifestyle factors were presumed to be predisposing factors rather than perpetuating factors and psychological processes were presumed to be perpetuating factors rather than predisposing factors of some pathological conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0017896910393788">26</xref></sup>, the two influences may play different roles as risk factors of school absence, and the importance of both primary and professional socialization influences for everyday school attendance should be emphasized.</p>
<p>The present study had several potential limitations. First, only a limited number of subjects were studied; generalization of the results would require studies involving a larger number of subjects. Second, conclusions about cause-and-effect relationships cannot be made due to the cross-sectional nature of the data. Finally, the questionnaire used in this study did not include comprehensive questions dealing with lifestyle factors.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The present results provide evidence that certain lifestyle factors are associated with school attendance in medical students. Since a link between school attendance and understanding of lessons was also shown (understanding the lessons versus not understanding the lessons, OR: 0.39, 95 per cent CI: 0.19 to 0.80; <italic>P</italic> = 0.010 for univariate logistic regression analysis; understanding the lessons versus not understanding the lessons, OR: 0.39, 95 per cent CI: 0.19 to 0.79; <italic>P</italic> = 0.008 for multivariate logistic regression analysis), teaching healthier lifestyles choices to these students, educators, and their family members may contribute to a higher incidence of everyday school attendance, a lower incidence of school absence, and even to higher academic performance.</p>
