<abstract>
<p>This article argues that mainstreaming responsible management education in line with the Principles of Responsible Management Education (PRME) requires close attention to the hidden curriculum (HC), that is, the implicit dimensions of educational experiences. Altering formal curricular goals and content alone is not enough to improve students’ sense of social responsibility. Business schools are conceptualized in this article as multilevel learning environments comprising various message sites where students undergo moral learning and socialization processes. Using perspectives from HC research combined with transformative learning and communities of practice theory, the article offers an inquiry-based framework for PRME implementation that takes these moral learning and socialization processes into account. It provides suggestions for how to address the hidden curriculum both in the diagnostic phase of assessing a school’s PRME needs and in the implementation phase where PRME is integrated into business school learning environments. The concept of <italic>meta-messages</italic> is introduced to account for how students apprehend the HC at business schools.</p>

<title>PRME and the Challenge of Mainstreaming Responsible Management Education</title>
<p>Key business education fora and scholars concur that business school students need a stronger grounding in the professional ethics of business activities and a greater sense of responsibility toward the common good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1052562911420213">AACSB, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1052562911420213">Beyond Grey Pinstripes, 2009/2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1052562911420213">EQUIS, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1052562911420213">Ghoshal, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1052562911420213">Sims &amp; Felton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1052562911420213">UN PRME, 2008</xref>). Business schools are blamed for focusing too narrowly on technical business prowess, efficiency, and profit maximization; for being poor endorsers of professional standards and norms of conduct; and for promoting “amoral theories . . . that have actively freed their students from any sense of moral responsibility” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1052562911420213">Ghoshal, 2005</xref>, p. 76). Graduates are described as narcissistic and short-term oriented, with underdeveloped “moral muscles” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1052562911420213">Antunes &amp; Thomas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1052562911420213">Danko, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1052562911420213">Feldman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1052562911420213">Hendry, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1052562911420213">Mintzberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1052562911420213">Pfeffer &amp; Fong, 2004</xref>; Salbu, 2002, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1052562911420213">Starkey &amp; Tempest, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The Principles of Responsible Management Education (PRME) initiative was launched in 2007, with a view to addressing these problems and establishing “a process of continuous improvement among institutions of management education in order to develop a new generation of business leaders capable of managing the complex challenges faced by business and society in the 21st century” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.unprme.org">www.unprme.org</ext-link>). PRME consists of six principles, aligned with “global social responsibility” values such as those espoused by the UN Global Compact, to which business schools may voluntarily adhere (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.unprme.org">www.unprme.org</ext-link> for details). In this article, I focus on Principle 3, which commits schools “to create educational frameworks, materials, processes and environments that enable effective learning experiences for responsible leadership” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.unprme.org">www.unprme.org</ext-link>).</p>
<p>PRME is based on the implicit assumption that “management education actually does work to effect change in understanding, attitudes, and practice among learners” and also that what is currently offered on most management education programs is not up to this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1052562911420213">Waddock, Rasche, Werhane, &amp; Unruh, 2010</xref>, p. 16). As many have noted, students generally do not appear to apply what they learn in their corporate social responsibility (CSR), business ethics, or sustainability courses to their other learning or in their subsequent professional lives (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1052562911420213">Bennis &amp; O’Toole, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562911420213">Boyce, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1052562911420213">Danko, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1052562911420213">Sims &amp; Brinkmann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1052562911420213">Sims &amp; Felton, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent research suggests that this is because responsibility issues are typically addressed in stand-alone courses, often electives, whereas mainstream business courses are still taught with a heavy emphasis on “narrow business values” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1052562911420213">Starkey &amp; Tempest, 2004</xref>, p. 1522; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1052562911420213">Rasche, 2010</xref>). This seems to signal that ethics is not related to the rest of the curriculum, which “defeats that idea that ethics should guide all actions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1052562911420213">Borkowski &amp; Ugras, 1998</xref>, pp. 1124-1125). PRME recognizes the need for a holistic approach to responsible management education but does not offer specific guidelines for how to address it, out of respect for contextual differences in educational and social norms and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1052562911420213">Rasche, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1052562911420213">Waddock et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>PRME’s recognition of the need to mainstream to responsible management education in all teaching is an important step. But changing curricula alone is not enough. This is because signals about appropriate conduct are communicated in many subtle ways beyond formal curricular content. Indeed, in other settings, fostering moral reflection has been found to require a whole-school approach that infuses reflection about responsible conduct into all activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1052562911420213">Hafferty &amp; Franks, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1052562911420213">Johnson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1052562911420213">Villegas &amp; Lucas, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, I therefore argue that implementing PRME effectively requires that business schools look beyond formal curricular content and pay close attention to <italic>implicit</italic> dimensions of the learning environment. I propose that insight into these implicit dimensions may be drawn from research on the <italic>hidden curriculum</italic> (HC), broadly defined as “what is implicit and embedded in educational experiences in contrast with the formal statements about curricula and the surface features of educational interaction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1052562911420213">Sambell &amp; McDowell, 1998</xref>, pp. 391-392). These implicit dimensions have been found to strongly influence students’ values and ethics learning and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1052562911420213">Trevino &amp; McCabe, 1994</xref>). They include a school’s structuring of time, rules of conduct, assessment procedures, traditions, socialization routines, incentives, and sanctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1052562911420213">Gair &amp; Mullins, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1052562911420213">Sambell &amp; McDowell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1052562911420213">Wren, 1999</xref>). The HC concept permits differentiation between “curriculum as designed and curriculum in action” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562911420213">Barnett &amp; Coate, 2005</xref>, p. 3), that is, inconsistencies between a school’s formal standards and the subtext communicated among school actors about “what really matters” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1052562911420213">Sambell &amp; McDowell, 1998</xref>, p. 392; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1052562911420213">Donnelly, 2000</xref>). It can therefore help shed light on why students seem to pick up the “wrong” messages about appropriate conduct despite being taught the “right” ones in their CSR classes and to provide concrete suggestions as to how to integrate PRME goals into all learning.</p>
<p>To understand this fully, however, we also require a theoretical understanding of how moral learning and socialization processes occur within the HC at business schools. Moral learning is a transformative process that involves altering a student’s existing frame of reference—that is, it is not just a matter of delivering the “right” knowledge. Understanding how moral learning occurs therefore requires insight into what kinds of predispositions students bring to their studies in the first place. And since values are learned in social interaction, moral learning is also a social process, not merely an individual one. I therefore supplement HC theory with perspectives from <italic>transformative learning</italic> (TL) and <italic>communities of practice</italic> theory (CP), which offer concepts to explain how these moral learning and socialization processes occur.</p>
<p>The article is structured as follows. First, I discuss the HC concept in greater detail and explain how it may be combined with concepts from TL and CP theory to understand moral learning and socialization processes at business schools. I link these perspectives by introducing the concept of <italic>meta-messages</italic> to account for how students apprehend the HC. I then outline an inquiry-based framework to enable a context-sensitive HC “diagnosis” at business schools and offer some suggestions as to how schools can align the HC with PRME. The article is primarily theoretical and is based on secondary literature supplemented by secondary data<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1052562911420213">1</xref></sup> gathered at a major Scandinavian business school in preparation for PRME implementation.</p>

<title>The Hidden Curriculum and the Implicit Dimensions of Learning</title>
<p>Once we look beyond formal curricular content as the key learning channel at business schools, other aspects of learning come into clearer view. These include the elusive “spirit” or “feel” of a school, which, though important, has proven hard to define and research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1052562911420213">Donnelly, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1052562911420213">Solvason, 2005</xref>). The HC concept offers a precise set of dimensions for studying these elusive, implicit aspects of educational settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1052562911420213">Gair &amp; Mullin, 2001</xref>). It also encourages a critical research agenda that is helpful in rethinking the assumptions that underpin management education, within a PRME framework. This critical agenda may be traced to the HC’s origins within a critical pedagogy tradition that explores power relations in schools. This critical pedagogy looks beyond the formal classroom to explain learning, seeing curricula as expressions of political and ideological agendas that manifest as neutral, didactic tools in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562911420213">Apple, 1990</xref>; McClaren &amp; Giroux, 1995). In a business school context, for instance, an ideological agenda might manifest as the teaching of economic rationales as normal, natural, and proper or as the unquestioned use of “signature” management education pedagogies such as case studies and project work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562911420213">Ehrensal, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1052562911420213">Schmidt-Wilk, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Scholars debate whether the “hidden curriculum” really is hidden, or is actually plain for all to see but just so much a part of how “business as usual” takes place in schools that it is not normally taken into account (Ng in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1052562911420213">Gair &amp; Mullins, 2001</xref>, p. 23). Much of what is routinely defined as the HC—for example, the organization of physical spaces, course delivery, and assessment procedures—hides “in plain sight” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1052562911420213">Gair &amp; Mullins, 2001</xref>, p. 21). So rather than “hidden,” the HC might more accurately be thought of as a backdrop that school actors learn to “not-notice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1052562911420213">Tonso, 2001</xref>, p. 156).</p>
<p>Although the HC concept has been mostly used in basic education, several studies recognize its important role in higher education (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1052562911420213">Bergenhenegouwen, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1052562911420213">T. Jones &amp; Young, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1052562911420213">Margolis, Soldatenko, Acker, &amp; Gair, 2001</xref>). Snyder’s (1971) pioneering work on the HC in higher education explored the contradictions between <italic>explicit</italic> and <italic>tacit</italic> curricular goals. He found that although formal curricula explicitly aimed to foster skills such as independent thinking and analysis, the tacit message conveyed to students in assessment and teaching was that they would be rewarded for rote learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1052562911420213">Sambell &amp; McDowell, 1998</xref>). The HC concept has also been much deployed in medical education, which has a strong ethical component. Here, formal instruction has been found to play only a small part in shaping the formative “moral community” at medical schools, compared to the implicit messages students receive about appropriate conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1052562911420213">Hafferty &amp; Franks, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1052562911420213">Lempp &amp; Seale, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In management education, the HC concept has been little used, with two notable exceptions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562911420213">Ehrensal (2001)</xref> uses Bourdieu’s concept of “symbolic violence” to describe how undergraduates are socialized to identify with the capitalist interests. He studied the accumulated “pedagogic actions” through which students internalized a “managerial habitus,” finding that pedagogic authority was used to present management knowledge and values as unequivocal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562911420213">Ehrensal, 2001</xref>, p. 104). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1052562911420213">Trevino and McCabe (1994</xref>, p. 406) used the HC concept to underpin their recommendation for a “just community” approach to business ethics learning, where students would learn to enact ethical practices in their daily lives. They proposed that since values are learned in interaction, student–faculty dialogue should challenge students’ assumptions, thereby fostering cognitive disequilibrium and preparing the way for values learning.</p>
<p>These valuable contributions both note that the HC may subvert formal curricular intentions, that learning has a social dimension, and that management education should take account of students’ predispositions. Yet neither directly addresses the question of how or why students seem to pick up the “wrong” messages communicated through the HC rather than the “right messages” they are taught in their ethics/CSR/sustainability classes. Unless we can answer this question, targeting PRME interventions optimally will be difficult.</p>
<p>To address this question, we need to understand how moral learning occurs. Moral learning is broadly defined here as the ability to recognize ethical decisions and reflect on the rightness or wrongness of one’s actions and the consequences of those actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1052562911420213">Trevino &amp; Brown, 2005</xref>). Below, I outline how TL theory can help shed light on such moral learning processes.</p>
<sec id="section3-1052562911420213">
<title>Instrumental or Transformative Learning?</title>
<p>As outlined above, PRME presupposes that business schools can influence students’ moral learning. Although skeptics claim that formative socialization occurs in early childhood, and hence that that people’s ethics are “essentially incorrigible” by the time they reach business school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1052562911420213">Gioia, 2002</xref>, p. 142; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1052562911420213">Trevino &amp; McCabe, 1994</xref>), there is plenty of evidence to the contrary that supports PRME’s assumption. Moral psychology research shows that ethics “develop through a complex ongoing process of social interaction with peers and significant others,” which continues at least during young adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1052562911420213">Trevino &amp; McCabe, 1994</xref>, p. 406), and adult education research shows that it is possible to successfully foster, during adulthood, “whole person” dispositions such as analytical thinking, positive attitudes toward diversity, and civic-mindedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1052562911420213">Cranton, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1052562911420213">M. Jones, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1052562911420213">Kolb, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1052562911420213">Lengnick-Hall &amp; Sanders, 1997</xref>). Research specifically on business students shows that the way economics is taught can either minimize students’ inclination to collaborate with others or improve their honesty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1052562911420213">Frank, Gilovich, &amp; Regan, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>TL theory has played an important role in conceptualizing such “whole person” learning processes in adults. TL is broadly defined as “the process of effecting change in a <italic>frame of reference</italic>, i.e., ‘a coherent body of experience—associations, concepts, values, feelings, conditioned responses—that define [people’s] life world’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1052562911420213">Mezirow, 1997</xref>, p. 5). Transformative learning, where students critically reflect on their own frames of reference, is distinguished from <italic>instrumental learning</italic>, which is uncritical and “supports a society’s ‘cultural canon, socioeconomic structures, ideologies, and beliefs about self [that] often conspire to foster conformity, and impede development of a sense of responsible agency’” (Mezirow, 2000, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1052562911420213">Glisczinski, 2007</xref>, p. 319; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1052562911420213">Cranton, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1052562911420213">Mezirow, 1997</xref>). Students’ frames of reference are thought to create habitual expectations that result in “uncritically assimilated ways of knowing, believing, and feeling” shaped by culture and family influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1052562911420213">Mezirow, 1997</xref>, p. 6; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1052562911420213">Cranton, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>TL theory is underpinned by a social constructivist perspective where students are seen as active constructors rather than mere receptors of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1052562911420213">Lunenberg, Korthagen, &amp; Swennen, 2007</xref>). Meanings, including moral values, become explicit and are subjectively mediated and negotiated through discussion with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1052562911420213">Kitchenham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1052562911420213">Mezirow, 1997</xref>). This perspective opens up for the possibility that students may respond in very different ways to the same formal curricular messages and requirements, depending on their frames of reference, including their motivations and orientations to study. Teachers, similarly, may interpret and deliver curricula differently according to their experience, gender, teaching orientations, and situational constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1052562911420213">Curry, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1052562911420213">Remillard &amp; Bryans, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1052562911420213">Sambell &amp; McDowell, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1052562911420213">Mezirow (1997)</xref>, frames of reference consist of <italic>habits of mind</italic>, that is, “broad, abstract, orienting habitual ways of thinking and acting influenced by assumptions” (pp. 5-6), and <italic>points of view</italic>, which are articulations that result from these habits of mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1052562911420213">Mezirow, 1997</xref>). Points of view may be replicated by others, but the habits of mind that underpin them cannot. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1052562911420213">Kitchenham (2008)</xref> gives the example of a teacher who believes that PowerPoint can replace overhead projectors, a point of view based on beliefs about the role of technology in the classroom. Another teacher could adopt this point of view but without necessarily sharing the first teacher’s underlying habit of mind about technology, which produced the point of view.</p>
<p>Although transforming frames of reference is arduous, TL theory holds that it can be achieved either through critical reflection about habits of mind or by the “accretion of transformations in points of view” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1052562911420213">Mezirow, 1997</xref>, p. 7). Critical reflection is triggered by introducing <italic>disorienting dilemmas</italic> where students’ existing assumptions, values, beliefs, feelings, or actions become inadequate to cope with the task or situation confronting them. In higher education, disorienting dilemmas have been found to occur during taught courses, informal interactions with fellow students, and cross-cultural experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1052562911420213">Glisczinski, 2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1052562911420213">Biggs, 1996</xref>). If handled sensitively, disorientation can act as a strong incentive for students to reevaluate their frames of reference so that they can make sense of new situations, preparing them for profound critical reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1052562911420213">Glisczinski, 2007</xref>). So assuming a student enters business school believing that unethical decisions may be necessary to advance his/her career (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1052562911420213">Lawson, 2004</xref>), according to TL theory transforming this frame of reference would require introducing disorienting moments that consistently and cumulatively challenge his/her points of view and habits of mind.</p>
<p>TL theory outlines four types of learning process that underpin transformation: (a) building on existing points of view without fundamentally changing them, (b) establishing new points of view, (c) transforming points of view, and (d) critically reflecting on the habits of mind and assumptions that underpin points of view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1052562911420213">Mezirow, 1997</xref>). A further distinction is drawn between types of reflection: <italic>content reflection</italic>, where students are brought to reflect on what was done; <italic>process reflection</italic> involving deducing lessons from what was done to modify future actions; and <italic>premise reflection</italic>, where events are situated in the context of the student’s overall value system.</p>
<p>These distinctions between different types of learning and reflection provide a framework for exploring whether and how the HC fosters transformative critical reflection. Does the HC disorient students’ existing frames of reference, or does it leave them in their comfort zones? Are students encouraged to reflect critically on the content, processes, and premises of what they are taught? And do business schools know enough about their students to trigger such critical reflection? Addressing these questions potentially allows for precise change interventions in connection with PRME, as I outline later.</p>
<p>Learning is not only an individual process, however, and although the HC may be “experienced individually” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1052562911420213">Curry, 2001</xref>, p. 178), it is also a means by which business schools collectively and implicitly socialize students into the values of the business community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1052562911420213">Alvesson &amp; Deetz, 2000</xref>). This socialization includes, for example, learning appropriate role behaviors, norms and values, and particular work skills and abilities (Feldman, 1981, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1052562911420213">Elkin, 1995</xref>). Seen through this lens, freshman business students are neophytes learning to become a particular “kind of person” through social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1052562911420213">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>, p. 53; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1052562911420213">Elkin, 1995</xref>). Studies in a wide range of areas show that social interactions among school actors have a powerful influence on values learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562911420213">John &amp; Osborne, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1052562911420213">Johnson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1052562911420213">Kerr, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1052562911420213">Trevino &amp; McCabe, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>CP theory provides tools to conceptualize these social interactions as an important socialization dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1052562911420213">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>). In CP theory, learning is not merely seen as a matter of individuals appropriating new knowledge or dispositions but in terms of acquiring the ability to “act on the world in socially recognized ways,” making it a collective, situated, and ongoing phenomenon involving participation in context-specific socialization practices (Bruner, 1996, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1052562911420213">Seely Brown &amp; Duguid, 2001</xref>, p. 200; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1052562911420213">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>). Thus, a CP perspective enables investigation of how students learn how to act in ways that make sense both within and beyond the formal classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1052562911420213">Barton &amp; Tusting, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Socialization practices include not only formal classes but also activities such as internships, participating in associations, and learning to speak—or be silent—like a full participant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1052562911420213">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>). The CP concept of <italic>legitimate peripheral participation</italic> describes the newcomer’s ongoing socialization into a community of practice. <italic>Peripherality</italic> denotes the dynamic and open-ended process of becoming a full participant. Participation is always partial, however, and there “may be many different types of membership in any one community”; neither is there any central core or any single ability that denotes full participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1052562911420213">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>, pp. 36-37). In that respect, participation is a centripetal force, albeit with no definitive center, which gradually brings newcomers to fuller membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1052562911420213">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>). It may also ultimately work as a centrifugal force that expels those who cannot reconcile their frames of reference with the community. Thus, students who do not feel they “fit in” at business school may drop out, leaving behind those whose predispositions are more compatible with the school’s.</p>
<p>From a CP perspective, then, learning is not limited to intentional instruction and does not take for granted any automatic alignment between what is taught and what is learned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1052562911420213">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>)—a point also made in HC theory. Mastering participation in a community is not seen merely as a function of what the teacher does but of how the learning community is organized; the things that are valued, undervalued, or devalued within it; and the way that teaching is received. This decentered view of learning “moves the focus of analysis away from teaching and onto the intricate structuring of a community’s learning resources” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1052562911420213">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>, p. 94).</p>
<p>Shifting the focus away from the teacher–student relationship as the main learning channel also brings other school actors into clearer view, such as mentors, administrative staff, and peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1052562911420213">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>). This enables new sets of questions about how, and among whom, socialization processes occur in business schools, as I show later. The framework also conceptualizes students’ learning and socialization processes as dynamic and ongoing, suggesting that PRME interventions could be tailored to specific stages during their studies. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1052562911420213">Figure 1</xref> depicts the conceptual framework described above.</p>

<title>Diagnosing Business School Hidden Curricula: An Inquiry-Based Framework</title>
<p>Investigating the HC is tricky because it is such an integral part of “business as usual” that it is easily overseen and may vary considerably from one school to another. So it would be rash to offer a generic recipe for aligning the HC with PRME. Instead, I propose an inquiry-based tool to facilitate reflection on how moral learning and socialization occur within the HC. I give examples of how different HC dimensions can manifest at business schools, based on secondary literature and preliminary data from my own school. For each dimension, I propose a set of questions about existing practices based on the theoretical framework outlined above. This inquiry-based approach is broadly inspired by appreciative inquiry, notably the idea that “organizations move in the direction of what they consistently ask questions about” and that questions lend themselves more readily to improvisation than “how-to” recipes and are hence more adaptable to different contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1052562911420213">Whitney &amp; Trosten-Bloom, 2010</xref>, p. 12).</p>
<p>I adapt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1052562911420213">Hafferty’s (1998)</xref> notion of a school as a multidimensional learning environment comprising three overarching HC <italic>message sites</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1052562911420213">Hafferty &amp; Franks, 1994</xref>) where moral learning occurs: the <italic>formal curriculum, interpersonal interactions</italic>, and <italic>school governance</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1052562911420213">2</xref></sup> These message sites are generic to business schools. It is here that school actors interact, producing what I define as <italic>meta-messages</italic>, that is, the messages about appropriate conduct that students apprehend, which may differ significantly from intended formal curricular messages. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1052562911420213">Figure 2</xref> depicts an overview of how the HC may be aligned with PRME based on inquiry into these three key message sites.</p>

<sec id="section5-1052562911420213">
<title>Formal Curriculum</title>
<p>Various dimensions of the formal curriculum convey implicit signals about what really matters at business schools; hence, they are an important aspect of the HC.</p>
<sec id="section6-1052562911420213">
<title>Course Organization, Content, and Curricular Integration</title>
<p>Within a single business school, different ideas may coexist about what responsible management education is and how to teach it. At my own school, for instance, study leaders asked to define this and explain how they addressed it in their courses gave very different responses. Some prioritized student and teacher welfare through mentorship and faculty support systems. Others emphasized good conduct and antiplagiarism at introductory events and mentoring. Several large umbrella programs reported that a responsibility dimension was not a specific concern for them, while others wrote that they assumed this was being addressed at the individual program level. Some responded that they had integrated a responsible management education dimension by earmarking electives or compulsory courses to CSR-related issues. Others stressed the ethical dilemmas associated with particular professions, for instance, the Master in Accounting trained graduates for a role as “public shop steward.”</p>
<p>This diversity is encouraging, but also problematic, since the way in which responsibility issues are integrated into teaching sends implicit messages about school priorities. For instance, if responsibility issues are “covered” by addressing ethical dilemmas only in students’ particular profession (e.g., accounting), broader responsibility issues such as sustainability may be neglected. Similarly, if CSR is only offered in electives, this sends a powerful signal to the students about course prestige and priority. And addressing responsibility issues only implicitly, for example, through initiatives to support student/faculty well-being, may be too weak a measure to make a strong and consistent point about the need for responsible conduct. Questions about practices in this message site include the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1052562911420213" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Do responsibility issues feature in the study program? If so, how are they represented? Explicitly, for example, in electives, mandatory courses, organized events (such as a school “Responsibility Day”), modules, cases, or examples integrated into mainstream courses? Or implicitly, for example, in initiatives to improve student/teacher well-being?</p></list-item>

<sec id="section7-1052562911420213">
<title>Course Delivery</title>
<p>Management education is based on assumptions about the right and proper way to handle people, businesses, and profits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1052562911420213">Hendry, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1052562911420213">Rasche &amp; Escudero, 2010</xref>). Economic theories, models, and rationalities are “ethical constructs . . . [which involve] moral and political choices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562911420213">Apple, 1995</xref>, p. xv; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1052562911420213">Ghoshal, 2005</xref>). Thus, PRME-aligned management education should challenge students’ assumptions about what constitutes good business theory and practice and endorse critical reflection on the latter as value-laden perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1052562911420213">Keeley 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1052562911420213">Waddock et al., 2010</xref>). In line with TL theory, fostering critical reflection means reiteratively challenging students’ points of view/habits of mind and obliging them to problematize the <italic>content, process</italic>, or <italic>premises</italic> of the learning delivered. Taking Porter’s Five Forces model as an example, teachers might encourage students to discuss the model’s implicit assumptions, for example, that “companies must compete not only with their competitors but also with their suppliers, customers, employees and regulators” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1052562911420213">Ghoshal, 2005</xref>, p. 75). Critical readings can be assigned alongside mainstream interpretations of theories and used as a basis for class discussion. There are plenty of texts within scholarship on critical management theory, cultural economy, and feminist economics, for instance, that are highly suitable for this purpose.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1052562911420213">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Course delivery also involves stories, examples, metaphors, and representations (see Stepanovich, 2009), which represent success and failure, role models and antiheroes in ways that are not value-neutral. Business schools are, with internationalization, also becoming increasingly multicultural, so teaching practices should be scrutinized with an eye to whether they respect and represent cultural diversity in teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1052562911420213">Morey &amp; Kitano, 1997</xref>). For instance, the images often used in PowerPoint-based lectures form a tacit backdrop to which teachers should be alert. Managers, for instance, need not only appear as suit-clad white males. And wishing a religiously diverse student body a happy Christmas does not necessarily come across as congenial, as a Muslim student pointed out to me recently. Teachers may also unwittingly use examples that camouflage stereotypes, for instance, using particular world regions to illustrate problems. Pedagogy also plays an important role in course delivery. For instance, since a major challenge for responsible management education is to train business students to think beyond their own self-interest, exclusively individual learning strategies are unlikely to produce students who think that “it is to their advantage for other students to learn well and to their disadvantage for others to do poorly” (Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1989, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1052562911420213">Johnson, 2003</xref>, p. 25).

<title>Assessment: Mainstreaming the “Triple Bottom Line”</title>
<p>Assessment is an important part of the hidden curriculum, since it establishes what kind of learning and competences count: “Any assessment is a head-on encounter with a culture’s models of prowess. . . . Assessment publishes what we regard as skill and what we will accept or reject as demonstration of accomplishment” (Wolf, 1993, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1052562911420213">Sambell &amp; McDowell, 1998</xref>, p. 392). The parameters for assessment are established in course learning objectives, making these an important dimension of the HC, and for PRME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1052562911420213">Waddock et al., 2010</xref>). Learning objectives and assessment should therefore ideally oblige students to incorporate a responsibility focus in all courses not just specifically CSR-related ones. For instance, a PRME-aligned course might incorporate the “triple bottom line” principle into learning objectives and assessment, so that students must account for the social consequences of their findings in exam assignments, perhaps allowing them to draw on what they have learned in their courses on, for example, CSR or business ethics.</p>
<p>Alignment between assessment and pedagogical strategies is another important area. For instance, if students are required to write projects in groups, but are examined/graded individually, this signals that only individual effort is rewarded. Thus, a student whom I examined individually recently based on a group assignment remarked postexam that she had “saved” a particular argument for herself to get a better grade than her peers—not exactly the behavior the course was intended to foster.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1052562911420213">4</xref></sup> Assessment must be designed to reinforce desired behaviors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1052562911420213">Riley (2008</xref>, p. 12) suggests “setting assessments that connect individuals together to demonstrate the values and necessity of group cohesion” so that young people learn to form positive relationships with their communities—a fitting goal for PRME.</p>
<p>Finally, it is curious that even at a school like my own, where responsibility issues are high on the agenda, standardized student evaluations of courses do not include questions about whether and how courses have addressed these responsibility issues. Providing opportunities for student feedback signals that responsibility issues are a school priority and is a key step toward alignment of teaching and assessment (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1052562911420213">Waddock et al., 2010</xref>).

<title>Interpersonal Interactions</title>

<title>Endorsement: “Role Modeling” and Alignment</title>
<p>Student cynicism has been found to result when schools do not practice what they preach, so leading by example is important for PRME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1052562911420213">Trevino &amp; McCabe, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1052562911420213">Waddock et al., 2010</xref>). Democratic governance, where school actors respect each other as equals with the right to free expression, has for instance been proven to foster moral reflection and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1052562911420213">Trevino &amp; McCabe, 1994</xref>). Schools can also lead by example by aligning responsibility goals with school practices, for instance, in relation to sustainability (e.g., implementing initiatives to cut CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, save on printing, etc.), or combating misconduct such as plagiarism or fraud. They may also act as role models by supporting diversity, for example, by working to support equal gender, generational and ethnic representation among faculty, and in their marketing materials (brochures, websites, etc.). Leading by example also applies to the people or companies that schools hire and endorse. One example of contradictory messages at my own school is the sponsoring of lecture theatres by powerful but CSR-challenged companies. Every year, students note the irony of attending lectures on CSR in a room sponsored by a tobacco multinational. Endorsers may be guest speakers from the business or political community, honorary doctors, and board members who are presented as exemplary in the business school context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1052562911420213">5</xref></sup> Questions about practices in this message site include the following:</p>

<title>Implications for Practice: Discussion and Suggestions</title>
<p>Earlier in the article, I raised the question of why students seem to pick up the “wrong” messages about responsible conduct despite efforts to include a responsible management education component in formal curricula. From a HC perspective, the first point to note in response to this question is that moral learning is not a straightforward matter of delivering the “right” knowledge in formal teaching. Rather, it requires careful attention to implicit dimensions of the learning environment that shape the meta-messages students receive about “what really matters.” In other words, to be effective, PRME-friendly attitudes and behaviors must be reinforced in all HC message sites, not just in formal curricula. A key insight here from TL theory is that moral learning during adulthood is an arduous process, which requires persistently challenging students’ assumptions about what it means to be, in this case, a business student/professional. Seen from this perspective, we can begin to see why the odd course on CSR or business ethics is unlikely to have much impact on the overall meta-messages that students take away from business school, as long as both mainstream teaching <italic>and</italic> implicit HC socialization practices reinforce inappropriate conduct and/or fail to gainsay students’ frames of reference.</p>
<p>This means that it may not be enough to be alert school actors to the existence of the HC or even to align it with PRME goals. Rather, in line with TL theory, students’ habits of mind and points of view must be <italic>explicitly</italic> and <italic>repeatedly</italic> challenged. To give an example, instead of just tacitly implementing green classroom practices like shared handouts, teachers should explicitly and repeatedly draw students’ attention to such practices. Regular comments like “I hope you don’t mind sharing, we need to save trees” take little effort and explicitly align the HC with PRME goals at little cost to the institution. In short, a PRME-friendly hidden curriculum must not be hidden at all but should be loudly and insistently publicized.</p>
<p>Mainstreaming PRME in this way, however, carries the inherent risk that one set of norms about appropriate conduct will merely be substituted by another, albeit more benevolent, set. Here, TL theory offers the important insight that moral learning is not about appropriating new dogmas but about encouraging critical reflection. To be able to steer such critical reflection, teachers require knowledge about their students’ frames of reference, so that they are able to build on or challenge their assumptions. At business schools, this might involve, for example, knowledge of students’ motivations for studying business and their preconceived ideas about what it means to be a business student/professional. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1052562911420213">Glisczinski (2007)</xref> recommends that teachers assess students’ dispositions as learners before, during, and after the learning process, using a descriptive instrument. Although this may not be feasible at all business schools, there are leaner ways to gain these insights by engaging students in PRME-inspired inquiry at their own schools, in a manner consistent with a “just community” approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1052562911420213">Trevino &amp; McCabe, 1994</xref>). The benefits of engaging students in research are well documented (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1052562911420213">Willison &amp; O’Regan, 2007</xref>). For instance, organization studies courses might include assignments to carry out “PRME ethical ethnographies” of the school. Research methods courses could require students to survey/interview peers about their expectations of business school study and business as a profession. As well as generating useful information for PRME implementors, this would enable students to “actively engage the concepts presented in the context of their own lives” (Mezirow &amp; Associates, 1990, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1052562911420213">Mezirow, 1997</xref>, p. 10). Finally, teachers can gain a great deal of insight into how students perceive and target their learning process by being attentive to casual remarks (such as the student who “saved an argument for herself” in an exam).</p>
<p>A second point is that because the HC consists of multifarious message sites, aligning it with PRME goals cannot be done through isolated interventions but requires whole-school coordination and continuity. This is challenging because of the strong departmental autonomy that often characterizes business schools and may therefore require some form of incentive from school management. Also, many students are taught mainly by external lecturers who may not have designed their courses themselves and who have higher turnover than permanent faculty. Because of this, and ongoing program revisions, each generation of students may experience a study program differently. Study leaders are therefore key figures to enlist in support of PRME, since they can ensure consistency by posing questions such as: If a course has changed hands, have new faculty been informed about how the course was been aligned with PRME? Is she/he aware of the HC of school governance, course delivery, assessment, interaction, and so on?</p>
<p>A third point concerns teacher training, which reaches faculty across departments, and is therefore also an obvious area to raise awareness about the moral learning and socialization processes that take place in different HC message sites, and to engage in dialogue about whether these underpin PRME goals. A major goal here should be to encourage teachers to regularly reflect on their practices by asking themselves: “What <italic>meta-messages</italic> are students likely to receive if I . . . (deliver/integrate/assess/joke, etc.) in this way?” “Does my teaching confirm students’ existing points of view, establish new ones, transform them, or encourage them to critically reflect on the habits of mind and assumptions that transform them?” “Do my classes foster content reflection, process reflection, and premise reflection?” The framework outlined above offers ideas for such inquiry-based teacher training. In line with a CP approach, other school socializing instances such as peer support networks, mentor systems, and administrative staff training are also obvious places to conduct HC awareness campaigns in support of PRME.</p>
<p>Finally, CP theory suggests that there may be certain critical periods and moments where students are particularly receptive to socialization into a new community and hence also to transforming their frames of reference. The induction period when new students arrive at business school would, for instance, from a CP perspective, be an important moment for encouraging critical reflection and for fostering PRME-friendly forms of peripheral participation. School ceremonies such as prize-giving, where school community values are often made explicit, are another. Empirical research is needed to investigate the most appropriate timing and placing for PRME interventions.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1052562911420213">Gosling &amp; Mintzberg (2006</xref>, p. 422) observed a few years ago that “a curiosity of management education is its mixed messages.” This article proposes that a hidden curriculum framework can help shed light on the nature and source of mixed messages regarding appropriate conduct that are communicated at business schools and to explain why students do not always seem to pick up the “right messages” taught in their formal curricula. I draw on transformative learning and communities of practice theory to argue that moral learning at business schools is shaped by socialization processes that “hide in plain sight” both within and outside the formal curriculum. Through their participation in these cumulative socialization processes, students learn what it means to be a business student and future business professional. I use the term <italic>meta-messages</italic> to refer to how students apprehend the messages the school sends about appropriate conduct. The meta-messages received depend both on the nature of the HC and on students’ prior frames of reference.</p>
<p>By highlighting the HC, I do not mean to underplay the role of the formal curriculum in supporting PRME. There are important skills, theories, and bodies of knowledge connected with responsible conduct that students must master (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1052562911420213">Trevino &amp; McCabe, 1994</xref>). The hidden and formal curriculum should be seen as mutually reinforcing dimensions. It should also be recognized that even a fully PRME-aligned HC cannot ensure that all students or staff will espouse PRME values. Resistance is inevitable and is a valuable reminder that implementation must involve ongoing, respectful dialogue with all school actors. Critical discussion should be encouraged in the spirit of PRME itself.</p>
<p>Finally, not all will agree that business schools should foster critical reflection and take a stance on moral learning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1052562911420213">6</xref></sup> Yet taking seriously PRME’s aspiration to produce “a new generation of business leaders” calls for a transformative form of education that encourages critical thinking and responsible agency rather than instrumental education that unquestioningly supports particular ideological agendas. What currently passes for value-neutral “business as usual” at business schools is premised on a narrow view of human nature and society that has not served us well. A major potential strength of PRME is that it can play “angel’s advocate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1052562911420213">Starkey, Hatcheul, &amp; Tempest, 2004</xref>, p. 1523) in questioning this view and reconfiguring the business school accordingly. Hidden curriculum analysis offers tools that can help us begin this important task.</p>
