<title>Introduction</title>
<p>I would like to reflect on some of the more recent research on the nature of concentrated poverty, which refers to the percentage of poor people living in a particular area, and whether the response of the policy community has sufficiently addressed the challenges posed. My article comes a few months after the 25th anniversary of my book <italic>The Truly Disadvantaged</italic>. The University of Chicago Press published a second edition of <italic>The Truly Disadvantaged</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1936724413492665">2012</xref>), which includes my long afterword reflecting on many of the major empirical studies that support, extend, and challenge arguments advanced in the book.</p>
<p>I pointed out in the afterword of the second edition, that 25 years later, the economic processes emphasized in the book have continued—the loss of manufacturing jobs, the movement of jobs from cities to the suburbs and overseas, and even greater internationalization of the economy, especially through trade liberalization facilitated by free trade agreements in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Moreover, given the expansion of low-wage jobs lacking fringe benefits, and the polarization between high-wage and low-wage occupations, higher education is even more critical for social advancement in the labor market today. Furthermore, the adverse effects of deindustrialization on inner-city black employment continue to be a major problem.</p>
<p>By and large, the conditions described in <italic>The Truly Disadvantaged</italic> are not qualitatively different 26 years later, even though when I wrote the book, urban conditions had been in decline for roughly 15 years (i.e., since the early-1970s). There are still major racial differences in concentrated poverty. Although the country experienced dramatic declines in concentrated poverty in the 1990s, including declines in urban black neighborhoods, the substantial decreases seem to have been blips of the economic boom in the 1990s rather than permanent trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1936724413492665">Jargowsky 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Unemployment and individual poverty rates have increased since 2000, and there is every reason to assume that concentrated poverty rates are on the increase again, although complete data on concentrated poverty will become available only after a more thorough analysis of the 2010 census. The problems of joblessness have continued and have even gotten worse for low-skilled blacks. The racial employment disparities have persisted. The black/white unemployment ratio seemed essentially fixed at 2.0 or greater, which means that even through economic upturns and downturns, the black unemployment rate has been at least twice that of the white unemployment rate—although during this recent economic crisis, the rate dipped below 2.0 because of the sharp increase in joblessness among whites.</p>
<p>There have also been some important changes that should be noted. There is greater class polarization among African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1936724413492665">Wilson 2012</xref>). The out-migration of middle-class blacks from the inner city continues, but more have moved to the suburbs, including suburban black neighborhoods. And a growing number of poor blacks now live in the suburbs rather than the cities, many in older inner-ring suburbs that feature poverty rates approximating those in the inner cities.</p>
<p>Immigration has been very consequential in reshaping cities and urban labor markets, especially low-wage labor markets. Incarceration has sharply increased in the 25 years since <italic>The Truly Disadvantaged</italic> was published and has had profound consequences for the urban black poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1936724413492665">Western 2006</xref>). There is of course the Great Recession and its aftermath—the current period of high unemployment, long-term joblessness, and foreclosures. These changes notwithstanding, the basic arguments in <italic>The Truly Disadvantaged</italic> are as relevant and important today as they were when the book was published in 1987.</p>
<p>When I began writing the book in the mid-1980s, I was motivated to explain the sharp increase in concentrated poverty in black inner-city neighborhoods between 1970 and 1980. I argued that this increase could not be explained by purely racial factors, even though the current black inner-city ghetto is one of the legacies of historical racial subjugation in the United States.</p>
<p>I regret that I did not make this point clear because even today many people interpret <italic>The Truly Disadvantaged</italic> as denying the importance of race in the formation of the ghetto. However, the book is not about factors that led to the formation of the ghetto, which obviously implicates race. Rather, the book was designed to explain the sharp increase in concentrated urban poverty after 1970, an increase, I argued, that was mainly due to fundamental changes in the economy and the out-migration of working-class and middle-class blacks from many inner-city neighborhoods to other neighborhoods in the city and to the suburbs, leaving behind a higher proportion of poor families in these neighborhoods. In further elaborating on this thesis, I developed a theory on the social transformation of the inner city, which highlighted the effects of growing concentrated poverty and social isolation on individuals and families, effects that were exacerbated by changes in the economy.</p>
<p>As many of you know, <italic>The Truly Disadvantaged</italic> created a paradigm that led to hundreds of empirical studies, across social science disciplines, in response to my arguments, particularly my arguments dealing with the causes and effects of increased concentrated poverty. These included studies on neighborhood effects, economic restructuring and spatial mismatch, persistent poverty and depopulation, social isolation and concentration effects, and the male-marriageable pool hypothesis. And, I would like to briefly discuss some of the important research on neighborhood effects, a topic that received a good deal of attention from scholars across social science disciplines.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1936724413492665">
<title>Research on Neighborhood Effects</title>
<p>The concept of <italic>neighborhood effects</italic> refers to the impact of various social, cultural, and demographic neighborhood conditions on the residents. And the research on neighborhood effects suggests that concentrated neighborhood poverty increases the likelihood of social isolation from mainstream institutions, joblessness, dropping out of school, lower educational achievement, involvement in crime, unsuccessful behavioral development and delinquency among adolescents, nonmarital childbirth, and unsuccessful family management (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1936724413492665">Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1936724413492665">Small and Newman 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In general, the research reveals that concentrated neighborhood poverty adversely affects one’s chances in life beginning in infancy and lasting well into adulthood. However, some scholars have been concerned that these studies reached conclusions about neighborhood effects based on data that do not address the problem of self-selection bias, a term used in research to describe the effect of people grouping themselves together based on common characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1936724413492665">Jencks and Mayer 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1936724413492665">Tienda 1991</xref>). These scholars argue that the effects we attribute to poor neighborhoods may instead be caused by the characteristics of families and individuals who end up living there.</p>
<p>In other words, they feel that disadvantaged neighborhoods might not be the cause of poor outcomes, but rather that families with the weakest job-related skills, with the lowest awareness of and concern for the effects of the local environment on their children’s social development, with attitudes that hinder social mobility, and with the most burdensome personal problems are simply more likely to live in these types of neighborhoods. For example, as the economists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1936724413492665">John Quigley and Steven Raphael (2007)</xref> pointed out,
<disp-quote>
<p>In interpreting . . . data on the isolation of low-income workers from job concentrations it is likely that those with weaker attachments to the labor force will have chosen to locate in places where employment access is low [e.g., inner-city ghetto neighborhoods]. This is simply because monthly rents are lower in these places. (P. 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Indeed, some scholars have maintained that neighborhood effects disappear when researchers use appropriate statistical techniques to account for self-selection bias (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1936724413492665">Evans, Oates, and Schwab 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1936724413492665">Plotnick and Hoffman 1993</xref>). However, the issue of individual self-selection into neighborhoods was addressed in the publication of the research on the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment, a housing pilot program, undertaken by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) between 1994 and 1998.</p>
<p>The MTO experiment was framed as a test of the arguments presented in my book <italic>The Truly Disadvantaged</italic> about whether neighborhoods matter in the lives of poor individuals. HUD’s MTO demonstration program conducted a lottery that awarded housing vouchers to families living in public housing developments in high-poverty neighborhoods in five cities—Boston, Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York.</p>
<p>More than 4,600 Families entered the lottery, thus indicating their desire to move, and were randomly assigned to one of three groups—one was awarded housing vouchers that could be used to rent in the private market in any area, one was awarded housing vouchers that were restricted to private rentals in low-poverty neighborhoods, and one did not receive either voucher in the lottery and was therefore treated as a control group to be compared with the other two groups.</p>
<p>The MTO interim evaluation studies were considered superior to other research on neighborhood effects because they were based on data from a randomized experimental design that eliminated the self-selection bias “that has made it difficult to interpret non-experimental analyses of the association between living in poor neighborhoods and individual outcomes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1936724413492665">Kling et al. 2004</xref>:30). In other words, by comparing randomly selected groups with the same socioeconomic characteristics—those who received vouchers, which enabled them to move—the experimental groups—and those who did not receive vouchers—the control group, the MTO studies effectively removed individual self-selection as an explanation of the findings.</p>
<p>The reports and publications on the interim evaluation, which was finalized in 2003, provided mixed evidence for neighborhood effects when comparing the group whose MTO vouchers were restricted to low-poverty areas with the group that did not receive vouchers. On one hand, during the five-year period following random assignment, the MTO movers who relocated to low-poverty areas were more likely to experience improvements in mental health and less likely to be obese, and girls experienced a significant reduction in “risky behavior” (i.e., drinking, taking drugs, engaging in sex, etc.).</p>
<p>On the other hand, research investigators found no evidence of an impact on employment rates and earnings or of any marked improvement in the educational or physical health outcomes of children and young men. These mixed results have led some, including reporters, to question whether there really are enduring negative effects of living in poor segregated neighborhoods. And they seem to reinforce the view among some scholars that when studies effectively control for self-selection bias, neighborhood effects are weak or disappear.</p>
<p>However, one of the criticisms of the MTO interim evaluations is that they really did not address the problem of the long-term effects of living in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty. The problem of the long-term cumulative effects of concentrated poverty were clearly spelled out in a number of recent longitudinal studies by scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1936724413492665">Patrick Sharkey (2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1936724413492665">Robert Sampson, Sharkey, and Raudenbush (2008)</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1936724413492665">Geoffrey T. Wodtke, David J. Harding, and Felix Elwert (2011)</xref>.</p>
<p>In an impressive study that analyzes data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) with methods designed to measure intergenerational economic mobility, Patrick Sharkey found that “more than 70% of black children who are raised in the poorest quarter of American neighborhoods will continue to live in the poorest quarter of neighborhoods as adults” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1936724413492665">Sharkey 2008</xref>:933). He also found that since the 1970s, a majority of black families have resided in the poorest quarter of neighborhoods in <italic>consecutive generations</italic>, compared with only 7 percent of white families. Thus, he concluded that the disadvantages of living in poor black neighborhoods, like the advantages of living in affluent white neighborhoods, are in large measure inherited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1936724413492665">Sharkey 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Accordingly, this persistence of neighborhood inequality raises serious questions about studies on neighborhood effects. Many of these studies substantially underestimate the racial inequality in neighborhood environments, because they use a single point in time, generation, or measure of neighborhood poverty or income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1936724413492665">Sharkey 2008</xref>). Whereas living in the most impoverished neighborhoods is a temporary state for white families, most black families who lived in the poorest neighborhoods in the 1970s continue to live in such neighborhoods today. Sharkey suggested therefore that the focus of the research on neighborhood effects might be shifted to an examination of how the effect of living in poor neighborhoods over two or more generations differs from short-term residence in such neighborhoods.</p>
<p>We should also consider another important study that Sharkey coauthored with senior investigator Robert Sampson and another colleague, Steven Raudenbush, which examined the durable effects of concentrated poverty on black children’s verbal ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1936724413492665">Sampson et al. 2008</xref>). They studied a representative sample of 750 African American children, ages 6 to 12, who were growing up in the city of Chicago in 1995, and followed them anywhere they moved in the United States for up to 7 years. The children were given a reading examination and vocabulary test at three different periods. Their study shows “that residing in a severely disadvantaged neighborhood cumulatively impedes the development of academically relevant verbal ability in children,” so much so that the effects linger on even if they leave these neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1936724413492665">Sampson et al. 2008</xref>:846).</p>
<p>Their research raises important questions “about ways in which neighborhoods may alter growth in verbal ability producing effects that linger on even if a child leaves a severely disadvantaged neighborhood” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1936724413492665">Sampson et al. 2008</xref>:846). They argue that if researchers were trying to determine the extent to which neighborhoods affect children’s verbal ability by randomly providing housing vouchers to black children who lived and grew up in inner-city ghetto neighborhoods and who took a test measuring verbal ability before they moved, and then compared the results of the same test a few years later after the children had resided in better neighborhoods, the conclusion would very likely be there are no neighborhood effects. Why? There would be no difference in verbal ability linked to their movement to a better neighborhood, simply because their verbal abilities had already been formed.</p>
<p>Children’s verbal ability certainly has consequences for school performance, including the completion of high school. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1936724413492665">Geoffrey T. Wodtke et al.’s (2011)</xref> important recent study used the PSID to examine the effects of long-term exposure to disadvantaged neighborhoods on high school graduation. They tracked 4,154 children by measuring their neighborhood context once each year from age 1 to 17 and found that continuous exposure to disadvantaged neighborhoods—featuring high rates of poverty, unemployment, female-headed households, and welfare receipt, as well as few well-educated adults—throughout “the entire childhood life course has a devastating impact on the chances of graduating from high school” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1936724413492665">Wodtke et al. 2011</xref>:731). The authors stated that their findings are “consistent with Wilson’s foundational arguments regarding the consequences of spatially concentrated poverty, which motivated nearly all recent studies of neighborhood effects” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1936724413492665">Wodtke et al. 2011</xref>:731).</p>
<p>In the most recent study of the effects of the MTO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1936724413492665">Ludwig et al. 2012</xref>), unlike the previous interim evaluations, the researchers were also able to gauge the longer term effects (10–15 years) of moving from high-poverty to low-poverty neighborhoods, and these effects significantly improved mental health and subjective well-being (i.e., happiness).</p>
<p>Although the finding on improvements in subjective well-being is certainly not surprising, when one considers the dangerous-distressed neighborhoods from which many of the voucher holders migrated—neighborhoods with high violent crime rates and other rates of social dislocation—the finding is nonetheless important because it provides rigorous scientific evidence for the assumptions that many of us have made about the effects of living in distressed neighborhoods on mental health and subjective well-being. Many of the voucher holders expressed feelings of relief because of their move to less distressed neighborhoods.</p>
<p>However, the researchers also found that although the residents perceived their new neighborhood on average to be safer, moving to these neighborhoods did not significantly affect economic self-sufficiency (e.g., employment and welfare receipt), a finding that once again raises questions about the ultimate power of neighborhood effects. This finding was not really surprising to those of us familiar with the design of the MTO experiment.</p>
<p>Although the research on the MTO experiment is rigorous, there are serious issues with the design of the experiment that limit the extent to which one can generalize about neighborhood effects on factors such as economic self-sufficiency. First of all, many MTO movers, who experienced difficulties in moving and obtaining apartments in areas of lower poverty, relocated to neighborhoods that were not significantly different from the ones they left. For example, three-fifths of MTO families entered highly segregated black neighborhoods. Such neighborhoods tend to be considerably less advantaged than integrated areas.</p>
<p>Harvard sociologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1936724413492665">Robert Sampson (2008)</xref> analyzed the neighborhood attainment of all Chicago MTO families and found that after approximately seven years, although the voucher winners resided in neighborhoods with poverty rates somewhat lower than the neighborhoods of control families, both groups clustered in segregated black neighborhoods that were still considerably poorer than what an overwhelming majority of Americans will ever experience (neighborhoods with poverty rates of roughly 30 percent).</p>
<p>Furthermore, as pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1936724413492665">Quigley and Raphael (2007)</xref>, the experiment did not improve accessibility to employment opportunities for MTO movers, because their new neighborhoods were no closer to areas of employment growth. And Lawrence Katz, the Harvard economist and one of the coauthors of the article in <italic>Science</italic>, told the <italic>New York Times</italic> that “the preference for educated workers [in this country] was so strong that changing neighborhoods did not do much to improve job options for the participants, who were mostly African American women without college education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1936724413492665">Tavernise 2012</xref>:A3).</p>
<p>Finally, the adults who entered the program had been exposed all their lives to the effects of severe concentrated disadvantage, and no matter how long they are followed in their new neighborhoods, the effects of those earlier years are not erased. For all these reasons, their new neighborhoods are highly unlikely to result in significant improvements in economic self-sufficiency, despite being safer and less distressed.</p>
<p>It should also be pointed out that the study in <italic>Science</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1936724413492665">Ludwig et al. 2012</xref>) uncovered an interesting finding: a decline in neighborhood poverty is more beneficial for subjective well-being than a comparatively sized decline in racial segregation. The finding is robust even though the change in racial segregation and neighborhood poverty were relatively modest as indicated previously.</p>
<p>And the finding is important from a public policy perspective, because since 1970, income segregation in the United States has increased at the same time that racial segregation has decreased. The authors of the article state, “The rise in U.S. residential income segregation since 1970 raised the possibility that the problem of harmful neighborhood effects on people’s well-being may be getting worse rather than better over time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1936724413492665">Ludwig et al. 2012</xref>:1510). However, if the goal is to reduce the adverse effects of dangerous, distressed neighborhoods on poor families, then we need to give serious attention to reducing the harmful effects of income segregation and racial segregation, because the two often go hand-in-hand.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this more clearly seen than in many inner-city black ghettos that experienced significant depopulation following the cessation of the Great Migration wave of blacks from the South seeking employment opportunities in burgeoning northern industries, which characterized a good part of the twentieth century. However, the Great Migration abruptly ended around 1970 in the face of the accelerated out-migration of central city manufacturing due to improvements in transportation and the suburbanization of employment.</p>
<p>So with the cessation of migration from the South, and the out-migration of higher income families, many poor black inner-city neighborhoods—especially those in the Midwest and Northeast—changed from densely populated communities of recently arrived migrants to depopulated areas with thousands of vacant lots and abandoned buildings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1936724413492665">Quillian 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1936724413492665">Wilson 1987/2012</xref>). And these neighborhoods have been slow to revive because of the combined effects of poverty and racial segregation. Working-class and middle-class black families leave these neighborhoods, but their ranks, for the most part, have neither been replaced with new immigrants flowing into this country nor with any other nonblack ethnic group. Indeed, these groups tend to avoid inner-city black ghetto neighborhoods.</p>
<p>By contrast, Mexican neighborhoods, which are also plagued with high levels of concentrated poverty, feature population density because of the influx of immigrants from Mexico. The most significant growth in immigration occurred in the mid-1990s, reaching its peak at the end of the decade. And, although annual immigrant flows from Mexico declined sharply after 2005, in the wake of a weakening U.S. job market and heightened border enforcement, the number of immigrants from Mexico remains high at approximate 12 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1936724413492665">Sampson 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>As one of my researchers in Chicago put it,
<disp-quote>
<p>Mexican immigrants living in Chicago poverty areas may well be residents of crowded and dilapidated buildings, but they are surrounded by small local businesses, many of them owned and operated by persons of Mexican origin, and by Mexican-targeted social service agencies. Poverty-track blacks are more isolated from jobs and from employed neighborhoods than are immigrants. (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1936724413492665">Wilson 1996</xref>:52)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1936724413492665">Robert Sampson (2012)</xref> pointed out in his landmark book, <italic>Great American City: Chicago and the Enduring Neighborhood Effect</italic>, first-generation immigrants when they arrive in the United States have a positive effect on the neighborhoods in which they reside, including the revitalization of certain inner-city neighborhoods and the reduction of the violent crime rate in these neighborhoods. However, it should also be noted that immigrants, who make the effort to leave their home country to improve their social and economic status, are not necessarily representative of the populations they leave behind. There is indeed a selection bias. Nonetheless, the longer the immigrants and their offspring remain in this country, the more their social and economic outcomes begin to resemble indigenous populations.</p>
<p>In other words, the structural and cultural factors that affect, say, black inner-city outcomes eventually take their toll or have an effect on inner-city Latinos. Accordingly, if the sharp drop in Latino immigration to the United States that began in 2005 represents a long-term rather than a short-term pattern, structural and related cultural problems that drive high rates of social dislocation, including crime, in the inner-city African American community could conceivably over time have similar and notable effects in poor Latino communities, effects that offset the positive impacts of the first-generation immigrants on inner-city areas.</p>

<sec id="section3-1936724413492665">
<title>Public Policy Responses</title>
<p>Let me conclude by discussing whether the response of the policy community has been sufficient to the challenges posed by concentrated poverty. If we focus only on Congress, the answer is obvious. However, in the time remaining, I would like to restrict this question to a discussion of the actions of the Obama administration.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, I think that Obama’s programs have prevented poverty, including concentrated poverty, from rapidly rising, considering the terrible economy. For example, Obama’s stimulus package (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) earmarked $80 billion for low-income Americans, which included such things as an extension of unemployment benefits, a temporary increase in the earned income tax credit, and substantial additional funds for Food Stamps (what we now call Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program). It also included nearly $4 billion in job training and workforce enhancement programs, and $2 billion for neighborhood stabilization efforts.</p>
<p>Moreover, I consider the Health Care Legislation as an antipoverty program. Over the long term, the Health Care Legislation will significantly benefit lower income Americans. Indeed, the share of Americans who are uninsured declined between 2010 and 2011. And this improvement was in part due to a provision of the Health Care Bill that allows children to remain on their parents’ health plan until they reach age 26. Over the long term, the Health Care Bill will have a huge positive impact on blacks and Latinos, two groups who are seriously underrepresented among those with private health insurance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Obama worked out a deal with Republicans to address the impact of the recession on lower income Americans, a negotiation, which, although resulting in an extension of the Bush-era tax cuts, led to a 13-month extension of federal unemployment benefits for more than seven million jobless workers, as well as the continuation of programs that benefit the poor and working classes, including (a) the earned income tax credit, (b) the refundable component of the Child-Tax-Credit, and (c) the 2 percent reduction in the Social Security Payroll tax for one year, all of which put more money in the hands of ordinary Americans.</p>
<p>Now when you consider how these policies fit in with the broader sweep of policy changes over the last few decades, one has to acknowledge that the legislation enacted was in response to the extraordinary economic situation that now plagues this country. Taken together, they far exceed any legislation beneficial to low-income Americans passed during either the Carter, Ford, Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, or George W. Bush administrations.</p>
<p>In addition to this legislation, much of it in response to the Great Recession and continuing economic challenges, the Obama administration has also promoted some noteworthy programs aimed directly at addressing concentrated poverty.</p>
<p>I specifically have in mind two programs—the Department of HUD’s Choice Neighborhood program and the Obama’s administration’s Promise Neighborhood program, which is patterned after the Harlem Children’s Zone—a 97-block laboratory in Central Harlem that combines two reform-oriented charter schools with a web of community services designed for children from birth to college graduation to provide a supportive and positive environment outside the schools.</p>
<p>The Choice Neighborhood program, which in effect is designed to replace HOPE VI—launched in the early-1990s to help overcome the adverse effects of public housing projects in blighted neighborhoods—goes beyond the rehabilitation of physically deteriorated public housing neighborhoods, which was the focus of HOPE VI, and includes comprehensive neighborhood investments ranging from early childhood education to employment, safety, and transportation components.</p>
<p>Under Obama’s Promise Neighborhood initiative, hundreds of organizations across the country applied for planning grants. And, in 2011, 20 were awarded between $300,000 and $500,000. These planning funds are intended to help communities to better position themselves when applying for the full Promise Neighborhood implementation grants. The budget for Promise Neighborhoods has been severely cut by the current Congress, but the program is indicative of the Obama administration’s awareness of the problems of concentrated poverty.</p>
<p>Now given all of this action during Obama’s first term, is there any solid reason to feel that he will not attempt to address some of the problems of concentrated poverty that plague cities like Camden during his second administration. My answer, partly based on a meeting I had with Obama officials at the White House last spring, is a resounding “yes.” Just think what the prospects for poor people would have been if Romney had been elected President.</p>
