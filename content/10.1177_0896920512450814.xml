<body>
<p>In the book <italic>The Accidental President of Brazil: A Memoir</italic>, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, former President of Brazil (1995–2002), acknowledges the contributions that his team made towards his own achievements: ‘As someone who arrived at the presidency thanks to no small amount of luck and circumstance, it would be arrogant for me to take all the credit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920512450814">Cardoso, 2006</xref>: 280). The same could be said about Dilma Rousseff, perhaps even more of an accidental president than Cardoso, who had been a senator for nearly a decade and also a leader of his party in that house before he was a presidential candidate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0896920512450814">1</xref></sup> Like Cardoso, Dilma Rousseff had been a minister in the administration immediately preceding her own and received support from the outgoing president to run for the post of president of the republic. Both Cardoso and Rousseff had also been personally identified with a set of policies that were hugely successful in the outgoing administration. Cardoso was the minister in charge of the Plano Real (Real Plan), which put an end to hyperinflation and stabilized the Brazilian economy, and Rousseff headed the <italic>Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento</italic> (PAC, or Program of Growth Acceleration), the largest development program ever launched in Brazil, aimed at building infrastructure and industrial capability. There is no doubt that the current growth of the Brazilian economy, which recently replaced the United Kingdom’s as the sixth largest in the world, was made possible by economic stability. There is equally no doubt that the transition from Cardoso to Lula da Silva was key not only for economic stability but also for democracy consolidation in Brazil. Democracy was further consolidated when Lula da Silva won re-election and passed the gavel to a successor, thereby diffusing fears that he would be changing or breaking the constitution to seek a third term, in spite of his high approval ratings and the regional precedent set by Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. What does the transition from Lula da Silva to Rousseff tells us about the Brazil of the present and the future? The collection of papers selected for this special issue brings to a wider audience a deep understanding of achievements, realities and challenges in several key issue-areas in Brazil. Taken together, the articles provide a comprehensive review of the legacy of the most popular president in Brazilian history, Lula da Silva, a tough act to follow. They also bring an early assessment of policy changes and continuity under Rousseff, the first female president in Brazilian history.</p>
<p>In this special issue, UK and Brazil-based authors reflect upon the most controversial aspects of the transition from Lula da Silva to Dilma Rousseff and provide analyses from different theoretical perspectives and disciplines. They first came together to discuss Brazil in each of their areas of expertise during a conference convened by the Brazil Institute at King’s College London, which used the milestone of President Rousseff’s first 100 days in office to take stock of the new government. This tradition of assessing the first 100 days of an administration began with Franklin D. Roosevelt’s first term in office, in 1933, which saw the introduction of a raft of New Deal legislation that changed the political economy of the United States. The first 100 days of the FDR administration are still a measure of presidential performance for all new presidents in the US. Building on a successful presidential campaign, this is usually the ‘honeymoon’ or ‘grace’ period where the president is most able to push legislation through Congress and escape heavy media criticism. Speakers at the conference were asked to take note of presidential appointments, political discourse, policy changes and continuities with the previous administration. Although continuity was a campaign motto, Dilma Rousseff made it clear early on that her administration would bring a twist to the legacy left by Lula da Silva.</p>
<p>Over the six months that followed that first gathering, the team worked on a series of questions they set for themselves. Will Dilma Rousseff consolidate a ‘developmentalist’ agenda while she continues to reduce poverty and inequality? Will economic growth be sustainable despite high interest rates and a strong Brazilian currency, the ‘real’? Will President Rousseff be able to manage the coalition of more than ten parties supporting her government in Congress? How will her government deal with environmental and human rights issues? Is foreign policy likely to change? Will there be new policies in the area of culture? Could the role of the military in internal politics change? Will new regulation of the media be introduced? Can President Dilma improve Brazil’s infrastructure in time for the 2014 World Cup? At a time when Brazil is increasingly visible on the world stage, trade and macroeconomic policy, defence, public security, media, culture, human rights and environment policy were brought up and critically examined. When we talk about continuity, however, we cannot ignore that this would actually refer to extending an unprecedented period of change in Brazilian society. The true dimension of changes experienced by Brazil in recent years cannot be fully grasped without a few indicators. For instance, the fact that 798,000 new jobs were created in the first 100 days of the Rousseff administration (January–April 2011) cannot be seen in isolation, since in the same four-month period of 2010 Lula Da Silva created 962,000 new jobs. Indeed, the demand for labour has not significantly gone down in Brazil since the year 2000. More jobs mean more income, and indeed in a wider picture Brazil fares better than any other of the main emerging economies, the BRICS nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920512450814">O’Neil, 2001</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0896920512450814">2</xref></sup> in terms of inequality reduction. Under Lula da Silva family income grew at a faster pace than the economy in Brazil (on average 1.8 percent above GDP), and unlike other BRICS, Brazil saw the income of the poorest 20 percent of the population grow at larger rates than the income of the richest 20 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920512450814">Neri, 2010</xref>: 13–14). Public opinion polls reflect these results, and also show that, unlike other BRICS, in Brazil a significant majority (over 67 percent) of both the poorest 20 percent and the richest 20 percent are satisfied with their standard of living. These data are consistent in the 2009–11 period, showing that both Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff were able to please two very distinct strata of society at once.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0896920512450814">3</xref></sup> However less spectacular its growth may seem in comparison to China, its social indicators and democratic regime make Brazil appealing as a model to be followed by developing countries.</p>
<p>Cardoso and Lula da Silva laid the foundations of an era in which Brazil was propelled to a new, higher international standing because each of them chose (to varying degrees) to pursue state policies and build on each other’s work instead of ‘re-inventing the wheel’. This may seem trivial in well-established democracies, but is a major step for the consolidation of democracy in Brazil, a country where there are still no fewer than 22 political parties represented in the lower house and 15 in the national Senate. Such fragmentation requires a government by coalition, and the fact that Rousseff is not an experienced politician and has inherited from her predecessor a coalition she did not build herself may disrupt executive–legislative relations. As Anthony Pereira pointed out in his article in this special issue, reforms were not part of Lula da Silva’s achievements. If his was a government of projects, Rousseff’s is one of even greater projects, as she will be getting the country ready to host the next World Cup in 2014. While her infrastructure construction works are moving fast, the bill to enact political reform first introduced during Lula da Silva’s second term in office is still in Congress. The end of re-election<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0896920512450814">4</xref></sup> is not part of this reform, so Rousseff may well be seeking another term in office. Should she be successful, it would be the ultimate achievement for the party Lula da Silva co-founded (the PT). With Lula da Silva as its candidate, the PT had lost three successive presidential elections (1989, 1994 and 1998) before it won the highest office in 2002. The score is now even, after Lula da Silva won re-election in 2006 and Rousseff was elected in 2010.</p>
<p>President Rousseff has had the opportunity to take her own steps after Lula da Silva stepped down, but does not miss an opportunity to thank him as a major contributor to the success of the projects she led as minister, unlike Cardoso, who wrote vaguely that ‘Some previous presidents also did their part, and I credit Brazil as well’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920512450814">Cardoso, 2006</xref>: 280). One of the most famous Brazilian songwriters, Antônio Carlos Jobim, once said: ‘Brazil is not for beginners’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920512450814">Eakin, 1997</xref>: x). While Dilma Rousseff may be an accidental president, she’s certainly not a beginner. Her approval ratings at 51 percent nine months into her term are much higher than Lula da Silva’s (43 percent) or Cardoso’s (40 percent) at the first nine months in their own terms in office. The collection of articles in this special issue gives the reader a sense of how Rousseff managed to beat the odds.</p>

<p>Re-elections for mayors, governors, and the president in Brazil were introduced during the first term of the Cardoso administration (1995–8) and passed after a significant amount of pork was handed out. This constitutional amendment was driven by President Cardoso and benefitted him directly, since he was able to immediately seek a second term in 1998.</p></fn>
