<abstract>
<p>The authors describe a demonstration of stereotype use in everyday language that focuses on common phrases reflecting stereotypic beliefs about ethnic groups or nationalities. The exercise encourages students’ discussion of stereotype use. Students read 13 common phrases from the English language and stated whether they had used each phrase and whether the meaning of the phrase is positive or negative. Evaluations of the exercise showed that it is effective for increasing awareness of stereotype use in everyday language. The authors provide suggested topics for class discussion.</p>

<p>Stereotypes about social groups are conveyed through parents, peers, and the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0098628311430314">Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010</xref>). Stereotypes also are transmitted and maintained through the words and phrases people use, often without their thinking about them. For example, people attach qualifiers when referring to those in nontraditional roles, such as female athletes (e.g., Lady Boilermakers) and minority group members who are professionals (e.g., the “Black” doctor; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0098628311430314">Ng, 2007</xref>). Language also serves to maintain stereotypic beliefs. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628311430314">Maass, Salvi, Arcuri, and Semin (1989)</xref> found that people use abstract language that cannot easily be discounted when making negative statements about outgroups but use concrete language that can be easily disconfirmed when describing their own group’s negative characteristics. More generally, in everyday conversation about ethnic group members, people are more likely to mention traits that are stereotypically associated with those ethnic groups than traits not stereotypically associated with those groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0098628311430314">Schaller, Conway, &amp; Tanchuk, 2002</xref>); linguists have identified many common English language expressions that convey such stereotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0098628311430314">Bolinger, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0098628311430314">Whitley and Kite (2010)</xref> reviewed the wealth of social psychological research and theory on stereotyping and prejudice that instructors can use to prepare interesting and thought-provoking lectures on these topics. It is more difficult, however, to get students to talk about their own stereotype use. Students are reluctant to admit that they have stereotypic beliefs because holding such beliefs is perceived as socially undesirable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0098628311430314">Crandall, Eshleman, and O’Brien (2002)</xref>, for example, found that at least 93% of respondents agreed that prejudice against American ethnic groups is socially unacceptable. People often feel uncomfortable talking about stereotyping and prejudice, in part because they believe they might make a social blunder, be rejected or ridiculed, or appear prejudiced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0098628311430314">Stephan &amp; Stephan, 2001</xref>). But, people do, of course, regularly use stereotypes; indeed, stereotypes facilitate the ability to quickly process information about others and that makes the world a predictable, orderly place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0098628311430314">Macrae &amp; Bodenhausen, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>On one hand, then, people readily use stereotypes to navigate their social world; on the other hand, they realize that doing so has social costs, making it difficult for them to talk about their stereotypic beliefs. This classroom exercise offers a vehicle for facilitating discussion of stereotypes. It is based on phrases that reflect national and ethnic stereotypes that are commonly used in everyday discourse, often without speakers considering their meaning or origin.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>A total of 34 students in a social psychology class at a Midwestern university received a list of 13 commonly used expressions that reflect ethnic or national stereotypes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0098628311430314">Table 1</xref>
). The stereotypes embedded in these phrases were verified by the <italic>American Heritage Dictionary</italic> and the <italic>Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628311430314">Morris &amp; Morris, 1988</xref>). Students reported whether they had personally used the expression (yes or no) and rated the perceived valence of each expression using a 5-point scale (1 = <italic>positive</italic>, 5 = <italic>negative</italic>). Next, students met in groups to discuss their definitions, when and why the terms were used, and their evaluation of those terms. After the discussion, students answered the free-response question, “What are the major goals of the exercise?” and used a 5-point scale (1 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>, 5 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to answer three closed-ended questions about the exercise (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0098628311430314">Table 2</xref>
).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0098628311430314">Table 1</xref> shows the percentage of students who reported using each phrase and the mean rating of perceived valence of the phrases. Usage varied from 82% (“got gypped”) to 4% (“get your Irish up”). Evaluations were generally neutral or negative; only “Dutch treat” was rated positively.</p>
<p>We examined the course goals students listed and used an ad hoc coding system to create five categories that represented their responses (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0098628311430314">Crano &amp; Brewer, 2002</xref>). We then placed each goal into one of these five categories. The percentages of students listing a goal in each category were 79% for increasing awareness of stereotypes in language, 41% for raising awareness that seemingly neutral statements can have negative connotations, 29% for increasing understanding of stereotype use, 14% for reducing stereotype use, and 14% for increasing awareness of others’ responses to stereotypes. Because students listed three goals, individual students’ responses could be represented in more than one category. To determine whether the exercise had a positive effect on a majority of the students, we evaluated responses to the closed-ended questions by comparing the proportion of students who either agreed or strongly agreed with the item to an expected value of 50% (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0098628311430314">Table 2</xref>). Results showed that the majority of students strongly agreed or agreed with all three items, but chi-square analyses were significant only for Items 1 and 2.</p>

<sec id="section3-0098628311430314">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this exercise, we used phrases reflecting stereotypes about ethnic groups to facilitate discussion of stereotype use. Students reported using many of the phrases, and they generally believed that doing so was neutral or negative. Responses to the evaluation measure showed that the exercise encouraged a majority of students to think about the ways in which language conveys stereotypes.</p>
<p>After students rated the phrases, they received the list of definitions reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0098628311430314">Table 1</xref>, and they discussed their responses in five groups of five to six people. Afterward each group summarized its conversation. Those summaries provided anecdotal evidence that, prior to the exercise, even students who used the expressions often were unaware that the phrases reflected social stereotypes. Several discussion groups reported that the association between the social group and its stereotype was not always obvious. For example, most students did not know that the expression “got gypped” came from the association of Gypsies with dishonesty. Another common topic discussed was whether the expressions, as they are used today, remain slurs. When this issue was raised, we asked students to consider the question of who decides whether an expression is offensive—the user of the expression, the members of the group to which it refers, or a complex interaction between those two possibilities. We also explained the history of the phrases noting, for example, that the term “take French leave” is rooted in the long-standing animosity between the British and the French and that the term “Jew down a price” reflects anti-Semitic beliefs that have existed for centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0098628311430314">Bolinger, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>In our experience, people’s anxiety over discussing prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0098628311430314">Stephan &amp; Stephan, 2001</xref>) extends to the classroom, so that students are reluctant to talk about their ethnic and gender stereotypes. In contrast, students were very willing to talk about the stereotypes presented in this exercise. Many of our students were members of one of the ethnic groups reflected in the phrases (e.g., Western European); because these students were talking about their own ethnic origins, albeit in a somewhat distanced context, they may have felt more comfortable discussing the topic.</p>
<p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0098628311430314">Table 1</xref>, students seldom reported using some of the phrases, such as “Young Turks” and “Jewish American princess.” Instructors could shorten or revise the list to include only familiar phrases. However, even the infrequently used phrases convey stereotypes; that is, although students might not use the phrase “get your Irish up,” the Irish are stereotypically viewed as short-tempered. Instructors could also add phrases that are unique to their geographic regions. Finally, although many of the phrases are European in origin, other world regions undoubtedly have similar expressions that refer to outgroup members; hence, this exercise could be readily modified for students in other geographic areas.</p>
<p>We have used this exercise, with the same methodology, in three courses: social psychology, the psychology of prejudice and discrimination, and the psychology of diversity; it could also be useful in introductory psychology. To reduce the class time required for the exercise, instructors could ask students to complete the exercise at home and bring their responses to class for discussion. Students could search for other common phrases that reflect stereotypes and report them to the instructor and/or to the whole class.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0098628311430314">American Psychological Association (2007)</xref> has identified understanding and respect for sociocultural and international diversity as one of 10 learning goals for undergraduate psychology students. An important way to achieve this goal is to encourage students to openly discuss the role stereotypes play in their everyday lives. Results of both the open-ended and closed-ended evaluations suggest that this demonstration was effective in raising students’ awareness of group stereotypes in everyday language. This increased awareness can provide a basis for further discussion of how stereotypes are transmitted and maintained, the role cognitive processing plays in stereotypic information processing, and the social costs of stereotype use (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0098628311430314">Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010</xref>).</p>
