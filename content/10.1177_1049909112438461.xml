<abstract>
<p>Historically, medicine has been warned, “first, do no harm.” In contemporary practice, however, the emergency response has generally been to err on the side of action with resuscitation efforts. Typically, it is only later on when medical therapy is considered futile that treatment is withdrawn. In such circumstances, a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order is typically enacted as a part of an advance directive. However, when such patients attempt suicide, the approach to their care becomes complicated. Is the DNR order valid in a suicidal patient? What is the role of patient autonomy? How should an ethics consultant advise? This case details the method by which such issues should be approached in the emergent care of patients who have DNR order and attempt suicide.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A 79-year-old Vietnamese woman, on hospice care with a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order due to a diagnosis of advanced metastatic colon cancer, is found unresponsive with multiple pill bottles including antihypertensives and morphine at her house in her room by her son. Her son immediately called 911. The emergency medical technicians (EMTs) respond to the scene whereupon the son admits that a DNR did exist, but then immediately revokes the DNR, per his surrogate decision-making status, resulting in the patient being intubated in the field. She is then transported by ambulance to the local emergency room (ER).</p>
<p>At the ER, the patient is received and given narcan. Thereafter, a discussion was facilitated by the ER chaplain among the ER physicians and the son, whereupon the son stated that he wished his mother could continue to live but recognized that with her being on hospice and a DNR order she had chosen not to be resuscitated. At this point, a decision was made in the ER to not undertake any other resuscitative efforts. The patient was extubated and admitted to a medical floor.</p>
<p>On the medical floor, there is a great deal of unease among the health care providers and especially 1 physician who believes that not resuscitating the patient and not classifying her at the highest therapeutic support level would be akin to participating in a suicide effort in this instance. The physician asks for an ethics consult. How ought the responding ethics consultant act?</p>
<p>This case is a characteristic of a number of reasons. Such a vignette is typical of the sort of history and the information available to health care providers in the ER; decisions must be made quickly with limited data. Often times, it is only with the passage of time and involvement of additional health care team members that questions regarding the ethics of a situation are asked.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1049909112438461">
<title>Stakeholders</title>
<p>The response of the ethics consultant in this case has widespread and possibly severe consequences for a very large group of stakeholders. The immediate stakeholders in this case are obvious. First and foremost, the patient herself, a 79-year-old Vietnamese woman, as the entire case revolves around her, and any response by the ethics consultant could very likely impact her care. Additionally, the patient’s son has quite a bit at stake: his emotional well-being is certainly in flux as evidenced by his initial revoking of the DNR order. It will be important for us to be sensitive to this fact and to ensure that we do not add to any feelings of guilt or remorse. Additionally, the patient’s other immediate and extended family as well as friends and close associates of course have an emotional stake in the outcome of this case per the extent of their relationship with the patient.</p>
<p>Additionally, we can include the initial responders, the EMTs. They had the first contact in this situation, and although they may not face much of any legal consequences, they may feel the effects of ethical or moral doubts that may become amplified by the response of the ethics consultant. Additionally, such feelings can be expanded to include members of the staff and the physicians who provided care to this patient throughout her current stay. Most acutely, we must also be extremely sensitive of the obvious unease the consulting physician has already expressed; to have even expressed such concerns publicly and to do go as far as to call an ethics consult when many other peer physicians did not feel a need to do so, may cause feelings of isolation and thus may bring about defensiveness or even exasperation, all points which the ethics consultant must consider in the manner in which it presents its response.</p>
<p>The response by the ethics consultant also has implications for the local population from which patients are currently drawn as this response by the ethics consultant may apply to other cases as well. Furthermore, as it is customary in this institution to inform the family that an ethics consult has been requested, if the son receives the consultant’s response negatively, the patient might be transferred to another facility which not only impacts the patients in that area but also the health care providers there.</p>
<p>All the above impacts, of course, can exponentially increase if this hospital policy statement sets a standard or is repeated across the community or even more broadly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049909112438461">
<title>Facts</title>
<p>There are some clearly evident facts. The patient is a 79-year-old female of Vietnamese ethnicity. Her ethnicity may of importance as many cultures view a terminal illness as a form of punishment and some may feel shame or guilt due to such a condition. This is an area that the ethics consultant may wish to ask for more information on and perhaps discuss with the family regarding the patient’s state of mind or values and wishes. Furthermore, the patient is known to have been diagnosed with advanced metastatic colon cancer having subsequently been placed in in-home hospice care. This was done in conjunction with a DNR order. The timing or motives for this order were not clear as the patient had not discussed this with her son.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are aware that a 911 call was placed by the patient’s son in response to finding her unresponsive with multiple pill bottles next to her. We know that EMTs responded and that they intubated her after the son revoked the DNR. However, the reasoning behind whether the son even had the authority to do so, per substituted judgment or even with or without taking into consideration the supposedly competent signing of a DNR previously, is seriously in question. Sadly, the circumstances in which the original DNR order was requested remain unknown to us; it must be noted that the nature of decision-making capacity of the patient at that original time would be very important to know in this case, especially if we are to speculate that these course of actions could have been premeditated. </p>
<p>Furthermore, we are aware that initially upon presentation to the ER, the patient was treated similar to that of a suicidal attempt, with the administration of narcan and the continued ventilation. However, after a discussion with a chaplain, the ER physicians and the son seemed to have decided that the original DNR should be followed and as such the patient was extubated and other resuscitative efforts were discontinued.</p>
<p>After admission to the medical floor, the first real challenge materialized against the course of action taken thus far. The physician in particular has expressed his beliefs that not providing full resuscitative efforts in this case is akin to participation in a suicide effort. Such strong words indicate a large moral dilemma at play, which the ethics consultant should be acutely aware of in their conversations with stakeholders and especially this attending. </p>
<p>Of course, outside of the case details, certain facts are also known. Whereas it is not illegal to actually commit suicide, most states do not allow physician-assisted suicide. One of the only instances of case law on this specific subject of suicide attempts and coexisting DNR orders is from San Diego, where it was suggested that a DNR order should be honored even in light of a suicide attempt.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909112438461">1</xref>
</sup> However, in most circumstances, although it is not mandated, physicians in ERs currently assume that a patient committing suicide is acting irrationally and thus treatment is almost always initiated.<sup>

<sec id="section4-1049909112438461">
<title>Normative and Value Criterions</title>
<p>Two main ethical principles are relevant in this case: the conflict between beneficence and autonomy. Respect for the patient’s autonomy is one of the most popular and legally codified ethical values in American bioethics. In fact, it has gained so much prominence that many would argue that it acts as a gateway value before any other ethical values can be considered. Regardless, it is important for us to understand that a respect for a patient’s autonomy goes beyond a simple consent form and entails a true understanding of a patient’s self-identity and evaluation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909112438461">3</xref>
</sup> In this case, we must view the patient’s decision to not to undergo any resuscitative efforts in light of her old age, advanced metastatic colon cancer, and culture among other factors. Although we are not aware of how long ago this DNR was signed, we can be fairly assured that it was done so under a rational mindset as the DNR order had not been revoked within the intervening time indicating a stable decision. Thus, it seems quite appropriate to accept the patient’s wishes and treat accordingly. However, the major question that remains is whether the patient’s state of mind might have changed, as evidenced by a supposed suicide attempt. The suicide attempt quite possibly could have been the acting out of an intense frustration against her condition, a momentary lapse; in fact, the lack of any evidence of premeditation including the lack of a suicide note might even point toward this being the case. If so, then the patient may not, in a rational mindset, wish for the DNR to be applied in this situation. </p>
<p>The main argument against honoring the patient’s DNR order is that the patient’s suicide attempt invalidates her autonomy. Suicide in of itself is an irrational act and as such the patient does not have decision-making capacity at that time:<disp-quote>
<p>Generally, we intervene with the suicidal patient based on the assumption that the person is suffering from a mental illness that impairs judgment. This assumption is usually correct, with 90% of suicides being found on postmortem psychological review to be associated with mental illness such as depression, substance abuse, or psychosis. The physician assumes that he or she is acting beneficently in preventing harm (in this case self-harm) from coming to the patient, who is incapable of making a rational choice. Most, but not all, physicians would agree that certain mental illnesses so impair the person as to make autonomous decisions impossible.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049909112438461">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Thus, even if the patient was indicating a desire for no resuscitative efforts at the time of presentation to the ER, the health care team would not be bound to follow her desires. Although we are not aware of any depression or other mental illness, this is something that should be investigated by the ethics consultant to further embolden this argument.</p>
<p>The principle of beneficence demands substantially more from us as it asks us to unequivocally weigh the benefits and harms of any action, and then to act accordingly; it is a call to action. Physicians, in the absence of a patient’s wishes, must act in the best interest of the patient. It is undoubtedly clear that if the patient is not given the appropriate medical care, she will die and as such it would seem evident that providing treatment would be beneficial in terms of the elongation of life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049909112438461">
<title>Options and Justification</title>
<p>The goal in this case is to determine the validity of the DNR order and as a corollary the ethical advice that the ethics consultant should provide to the health care team. Per the ethics consultant at this hospital, the response should be to advise that the patient should be given full therapeutic support. Furthermore, the consultant should advise that a system should be put into place to allow of an immediate ethics consultation in such emergent cases and that caution should be given on the side of providing treatment if doubt exists.</p>
<p>This case very clearly is a difficult one and either beneficence or autonomy must be impinged upon:<disp-quote>
<p>[This] situation occurs when an individual, having authorized an EMS DNR order, attempts suicide and is discovered before the attempt becomes successful. [These] circumstances provoke the classic dilemma, where the ethical wishes of rescuers to act for the good of their patient i.e., beneficence, run counter to the individual’s autonomous wishes expressed in the EMS DNR order. The rescuer cannot satisfy both of these conflicting ethical principles.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049909112438461">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The justification for this response is direct: the patient is considered to have lost decision-making capacity per her irrational act of attempting suicide. Some might argue that the DNR order was placed while the patient still had decision-making capacity and as such should be honored as a legitimate voice of autonomy. However, suicide in of itself is irrational and is not covered by a DNR order. The context behind the DNR order was the advanced metastatic colon cancer and its ensuing complications and as such the DNR order should be considered invalid in this circumstance.</p>
<p>It is important that the ethics consultant presents their response in the form of advice from the field of ethics and not as a judgment; the decisions of course remain up to the attending and family. The ethics consultant should take steps to better communicate these ethical principles through policy measures and education to ensure that such urgent cases requiring quick decision making are adequately addressing bioethical principles.<sup>
