<p>The author of this text is a lecturer and researcher at the University of East London. The aim of the book is to explore the deficits in the delivery of treatment to crack cocaine users in ‘Rivertown’ (the pseudonym for an area of South London), and in doing so highlightthe impact it can have upon both the individual and wider society. This ethnographic study will both shock and sober the reader. In a gripping text with an anecdotal style, Briggs gives a detailed insight into the lifestyles of crack cocaine users, a description of the evolution of crack cocaine careers and the socio-structure of drug-using practices (p.167).</p>
<p>Briggs states that in 2003 he recognized shortfalls in treatment services for crack cocaine users and he explains that the purpose of the study was to have a greater understanding of the ‘social and structural’ circumstances of the drug’s use’ (p. 33). The ethnographic study was carried out between September 2004 and May 2005, funded by Rivertown Drug Action Team (DAT) with the specific aim being to identify why these drug users ‘dropped out of services, the service needs of this group, the function of crack houses and street dealing locations’ (p. 34).</p>
<p>Following the introductory chapter Briggs provides a comprehensive historical account of crack cocaine use, an exploration of the pathways into crack cocaine use, why people use this substance and the impact upon society. The third chapter outlines Rivertown’s social demographics and the current treatment services available. Although a relatively short chapter, it is necessary for the reader to have that understanding to further contextualize the study.</p>
<p>The fifth chapter looks at the hierarchical structure within crack cocaine users and informs the reader of how this is formed. Briggs describes the structure as being split into ‘clusters’, with those as the top of the architecture as the ‘high society’, having their ‘own private smoking venues... blessed with personal crack deliveries’ (p.79). This was in stark contrast to ‘low life’ where he describes ‘limited gains... they feel they get the poorest quality crack’ (p. 84). This ‘low life’ group also ‘experience higher chances of violence, victimisation and manipulation’ (p.105) and therefore often work in partnership to fund their use (p. 85).</p>
<p>The next chapter reflects upon the impact of social and political policies upon the crack scene. Briggs weaves the structure of this chapter between an academic analysis of government policy and quotations from the subjects. This allows the reader to see a direct link between the policies and the impact it has upon the crack user. In Chapter 7 the text identifies the need that individuals have to strive towards improving their lifestyle and their desire to obtain trusting relationships with others (p.142). Here Briggs describes a high level of denial among the crack cocaine users of the impact their use has upon their lifestyle, but also that many spoke of their intentions to abstain from long term drug use (p.142).This links well with Chapter 8 which defines the methods used by crack cocaine users in accessing treatment. It provides an insight into the drug support services provisions, structures and limitations.</p>
<p>The penultimate chapter draws tightly together the theory and research findings and from this makes clear recommendations for policy and practice in this area. Briggs recommends consultation with crack cocaine users on how best to deliver treatment services (p.179) and says that if possible individuals need a choice of service – regardless of where they reside (p.180). Service providers approaching drug users, as opposed to the expectation that the user will approach the service (p.180), is a tactic that Briggs feels would yield better results, as would allowing for a balance between high intensity contact when the user is motivated and lower intensity harm reduction work during periods of drop out (p.180). Treatment providers should be more flexible to include evening and weekend accessibility to services (p.180) and Briggs advises that crack cocaine users need to be ‘distinguished’ from cocaine users in policy documents because they are different social groups and require ‘appropriate drug treatment design’ (p.181).</p>
<p>From the practitioner’s perspective Briggs research is valuable because it is an analytical account of crack cocaine use that develops the reader’s understanding of the drug users’ self-perceptions of shame and guilt (p.77). In the final chapter, Briggs tells the reader of his encounters with some of the participants since this study concluded. It is an emotive conclusion to the book where he describes how it has impacted upon him as an individual, reminding the reader of the human story entrenched in this research.</p>
