<abstract>
<p>Male infertility is a relatively common condition caused by low sperm production, immobile sperm, or blockages that prevent the delivery of sperm. This condition can be caused by a variety of illnesses, injuries, chronic health problems, lifestyle choices, other factors, or idiopathic, in which abnormal semen parameters occur without an identifiable cause. Medical management traditionally focuses on correcting endocrine abnormalities related to hormone deficiencies. Clomiphene citrate is an antiestrogen thought to increase sperm parameters in males attempting to conceive. The objective of this review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of clomiphene citrate in the treatment of male patients with infertility. A literature search of MEDLINE (1966-June 2012) and EMBASE (1980-June 2012) was conducted using the medical terms clomiphene and male infertility and 9 clinical studies were identified. Overall, only 1 study detected a statistically significant benefit on the pregnancy rate in the clomiphene group; however, the majority of the studies demonstrated a statistically significant increase in sperm concentrations. At doses used to treat male infertility, clomiphene was well tolerated with no identified serious adverse effects. Based on the reviewed studies there is insufficient evidence to indicate that clomiphene is effective for the treatment of male infertility.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>For couples attempting to start or add to a family, the inability to conceive can be a difficult and frustrating obstacle. According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, infertility is the failure of a couple to conceive after 12 months or more of regular, unprotected intercourse.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112466304">1</xref>
</sup> Infertility can result from either the female or male partners or a combination of factors from both the partners. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine reports that in 40% of infertility cases the male is either the sole cause or a contributing cause of infertility and 25% of couples have more than 1 factor that contributes to infertility.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112466304">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The production of sperm, or spermatogenesis, is dependent on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), all components of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis. The GnRH is released from the hypothalamus and stimulates the secretion of LH and FSH from the anterior pituitary. Within the testes, LH functions as a promoter of steroidogenesis within Leydig cells while FSH serves as a promoter of spermatogenesis within Sertoli cells. Although LH does not have a direct role in the regulation of spermatogenesis, testosterone regulates its own production through negative feedback of the HPG axis, indirectly slowing spermatogenesis. Human spermatogenesis is a slow, complex process and takes at least 60 days to complete.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112466304">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Given the multiple feedback pathways and hormones involved in spermatogenesis, there are several ways in which this process can be disrupted and lead to infertility in males. The most common potential causes of male infertility include hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, testicular atrophy, testicular cancer, radiation, ejaculatory duct obstruction, Y chromosome microdeletions, and multiple other conditions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112466304">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112466304">5</xref>
</sup> Medications are another potential cause of male infertility and include the use of alkylating agents, ketoconazole, spironolactone, anabolic steroids, and certain lubricants.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112466304">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112466304">6</xref>
</sup> Reversible causes of male infertility should be recognized and appropriately treated in those attempting to conceive prior to initiating pharmacological treatment options.</p>
<p>Idiopathic male infertility is a condition in which abnormal semen parameters occur without an identifiable cause.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112466304">4</xref>
</sup> The World Health Organization (WHO) defines low sperm concentrations or oligozoospermia as a concentration &lt;15 million/mL while normal sperm concentration is defined as &gt;15 million/mL.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112466304">7</xref>
</sup> Some patients may also present with azoospermia or the absence of sperm in semen or a failure of spermatogenesis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112466304">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Medical management of male infertility focuses on correcting an endocrine abnormality or hormone deficiency (FSH, LH, and testosterone levels). According to a 2010 American Urological Association survey of 387 urologists, clomiphene citrate (antiestrogen), human chorionic gonadotropin, and anastrozole (aromatase inhibitor) were the most commonly prescribed agents, though clomiphene was by far the most commonly used (&gt;90% of respondents).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112466304">8</xref>
</sup> However, there is no consensus on the management of male infertility.</p>
<p>Clomiphene citrate is an antiestrogen agent approved for the treatment of ovulatory dysfunction in women. It is typically given as 50 mg daily for 5 days of each menstrual cycle.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112466304">9</xref>
</sup> Clomiphene has also been studied for the treatment of male infertility and is proposed to bind to the estrogen receptors on the hypothalamus thus inhibiting normal estrogenic negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. This increases the secretion of FSH and LH, which stimulates Leydig cells to increase testosterone production and thus spermatogenesis. In male infertility, the recommended dosing is typically 25 to 50 mg daily, based on the results of early investigations of the drug’s effect in men. Duration of treatment has varied between previous trials, but is typically given for at least 3 to 6 months.<sup>

</sup> The common adverse effects of clomiphene relative to males include nausea and vomiting, breast discomfort, blurred vision, and headache.<sup>

<title>Data Sources</title>
<p>A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE (1966-June 2012) and EMBASE (1980-June 2012). Medical terms used in this search included clomiphene and male infertility. Results were limited to studies conducted in humans and publications written in English. A manual search of selected bibliographies was also conducted. Comparative studies were included if they evaluated the use of clomiphene in the treatment of male infertility. Nine studies were selected for review (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719112466304">Table 1</xref>).<sup>

<title>Literature Evaluation</title>
<p>Clomiphene has been used for the treatment of female infertility for many years and has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this indication.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112466304">9</xref>
</sup> The use of clomiphene for the treatment of male infertility does not carry an FDA-approved indication, though its use in males has been reported in the medical literature since the 1960s.<sup>

<title>Active Control Trials</title>
<p>A randomized, open-label, multicenter study conducted by Abel et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112466304">13</xref>
</sup> compared the effect of clomiphene 50 mg daily for the first 25 days of each month to vitamin C 200 mg daily. A total of 179 patients were stratified by sperm density and received study medication for 6 months, then followed for an additional 3 months to monitor outcomes. No specific inclusion criteria were provided by the authors, but patients with azoospermia, varicocele, undescended testes, a known endocrine disorder, or a wife with bilateral fallopian tube obstruction were excluded from the study. The study groups were similar at baseline, however, the clomiphene group had a statistically significant longer duration of infertility compared to the vitamin C group (36 months vs 24 months, respectively).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112466304">13</xref>
</sup> After 9 months, there was no difference between the study groups in regard to semen measurements or pregnancies, though patients receiving clomiphene did have a statistically significant increase in FSH levels compared to those in the vitamin C group. No difference in pregnancy rates was found between the study groups based on patient’s baseline FSH level, sperm density, and changes in hormone levels following treatment. Although this study failed to identify a benefit of clomiphene compared to vitamin C, it does have significant limitations. By the end of the observation period at 9 months, 38 (21%) patients  were lost to follow-up, calling the validity of the study results into question. Patients in the clomiphene group were also more likely to have a longer duration of infertility prior to enrollment in the study, possibly making them less likely to respond to therapy.<sup>

<p>In 1983, Wang and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112466304">14</xref>
</sup> conducted a randomized, multiple control study to compare clomiphene citrate 25 and 50 mg daily to placebo, mesterolone 50 mg twice daily, pentoxifylline 400 mg 3 times daily, and testosterone enanthate 100 and 200 mg intramuscularly every 2 weeks. Of all, 46 men with idiopathic oligospermia, aged 28 to 45 years, were included. All men were required to have at least 6 sperm concentrations &lt;20 million/mL in order to be included in the study and normal FSH, LH, testosterone, and prolactin levels. Patients were treated for 6 to 9 months. At baseline, more than 50% of the participants had severe oligozoospermia with a mean sperm concentration &lt;5 million/mL. Four pregnancies occurred in both the clomiphene 25 mg/d group (36.4%) and in the clomiphene 50 mg/d group (22.2%). However, 75% of these pregnancies occurred in men with a basal sperm count of &gt;10 million. In addition, the clomiphene 25 mg daily group showed an increase in sperm concentration, FSH, LH, and testosterone. Both mesterolone and pentoxifylline showed no change in sperm count, nor did any pregnancies occur. In the testosterone group, sperm concentrations significantly increased 7 to 10 months posttreatment in patients receiving 100 mg every 2 weeks; however, no pregnancies resulted in either testosterone group. Analysis of the results also indicated that patients with moderate hypospermatogenesis and marked oligospermia (&lt;5 million/mL) generally did not respond to any form of treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112466304">14</xref>
</sup> Although more than 50% of the men included in this study had a mean sperm concentration &lt;5 million/mL, the results show that pregnancy is significantly more frequent in women whose men have mild hypospermatogenesis compared to severe hypospermatogenesis. This trial did show that clomiphene 50 mg had no advantage over the lower 25 mg/d dose. The study had a small sample size and may not have been powered adequately to detect a difference in pregnancy rates for each of these medications.<sup>

</sup> compared a GnRH analog, buserelin acetate 15 µg intranasally once daily with clomiphene citrate 50 mg daily. In total, 44 participants with a mean age of 30 years were enrolled in the study, in which the participants were treated for 3 months. All the participants were newly diagnosed with idiopathic normogonadotropic oligoasthenozoospermia and had FSH levels below the upper limit of normal. No statistically significant change in sperm density was observed in the clomiphene group, nor did any pregnancies occur. Conversely, the sperm density in the GnRH group increased significantly from baseline and 3 pregnancies (1 spontaneous, 2 by artificial insemination) were observed in this group. The GnRH analog dose used was 2% of the dose necessary for medical castration and found to have a stimulatory effect in an earlier study.<sup>

</sup> Since, this study had a relatively short duration and two-thirds of the pregnancies in the GnRH group were achieved via artificial insemination, it is difficult to draw a conclusion from this study, given the potential biases.<sup>

<p>A randomized, double-blind, controlled study reported by Moradi et al<sup>

</sup> compared <sc>l</sc>-carnitine with clomiphene citrate in 52 idiopathic infertile men. <sc>l</sc>-carnitine is an amino acid normally produced in the body and is available over the counter as a dietary supplement. It has been found to concentrate in the epididymis and seems to have a protective ability against oxidative damage and is essential for mitochondrial metabolism, a key process in sperm motility. Patients in this study were randomly assigned to receive either <sc>l</sc>-carnitine 2 g daily or clomiphene citrate 25 mg daily. The study included men with a history of infertility of at least 1 year and with semen abnormalities (sperm concentration &lt;20 million/mL, motility &lt;50% with a grade “a + b” or &lt;25% with a grade “a”, and morphology &lt;50%). Those with symptoms of hypogonadism, sperm count of &lt;10 million/mL, hormonal disorder, any operation, infection, or disorder of reproductive structures were excluded. Both groups were found to have statistically significant increases in sperm count and motility, though <sc>l</sc>-carnitine was superior to clomiphene when considering motility. Only the <sc>l</sc>-carnitine group had a statistically significant improvement in semen volume, while the clomiphene group had a significant improvement in normal morphology. Pregnancy outcomes were not recorded in this study; therefore, sperm and semen outcomes could not be correlated to increased pregnancy rates, the ultimate objective of infertility treatments. <sc>l</sc>-carnitine is only available over the counter and the trial authors did not disclose which brand or formulation of <sc>l</sc>-carnitine was provided to the study participants and it is unknown which formulation of <sc>l</sc>-carnitine may provide the most consistent benefit.<sup>

<p>A cross-over study by Rönnberg<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719112466304">18</xref>
</sup> investigated the effect of clomiphene on spermatogenesis compared to placebo. Patients were randomly assigned to either placebo or clomiphene citrate (50 mg daily for 3 months), followed by a 3- to 4-month period with no medication, then switched to the opposite treatment. The study included 30 infertile males whose FSH levels were above or below normal (mean 4.2 U/L in both groups; normal range 5-15 U/L). The median age was 30 years and the mean duration of infertility was 4 years. Clomiphene administration caused an increase in sperm count and in the levels of FSH, LH, testosterone, and estradiol and a decrease in prolactin level. Three pregnancies occurred in the clomiphene group and one in the placebo group. Nonresponders were more likely to have basal sperm counts below 5 million/mL (referred to as severe oligozoospermia). Patients received therapy only for 3 months, which is near the minimum time period to be on therapy due to the prolonged spermatogenesis process (∼2 months).<sup>

</sup> conducted a randomized controlled study comparing the effects of clomiphene 50 mg daily versus no treatment for 6 to 9 months. The study enrolled 101 men with oligozoospermia and an infertile marriage of more than 2 years. All the participants had low or normal FSH levels. After treatment with clomiphene, semen volume and density, sperm motility, and FSH levels all had statistically significant increases from the baseline levels. The only statistically significant change noted in the nontreated group was a decreased seminal volume. A sperm density greater than 20 million/mL was achieved in 18 men receiving clomiphene compared to 3 men in the nontreated group. Seven (12.5%) pregnancies  occurred in the treated group, whereas no pregnancies occurred in the nontreated group. Relative to similar studies, this study had one of the larger patient enrollments; however, it is limited by its lack of a blinded comparator group and the authors’ failure to report the age of the study participants.<sup>

<p>A randomized, double-blind, prospective study by Sokol et al<sup>

</sup> was conducted to compare the effect of clomiphene citrate 25 mg daily to placebo for 12 months. Of all, 23 males were included if they had 3 semen analysis with sperm count of 0.5 to 20 million, normal sperm morphology, sperm motility &gt;10%, and normal LH, FSH, testosterone, and prolactin levels. Male participants were also required to have a female partner with no known causes of infertility. There was 1 (9%) pregnancy in the clomiphene group, compared to 4 (44%) pregnancies in the placebo group. Significant increases in the LH, FSH, testosterone, and estrogen levels were seen in the clomiphene group compared to the control group. No increase in sperm concentration or total sperm count occurred in either of the groups. This study also had a small sample size and it is unknown whether enough patients were enrolled to obtain sufficient statistical power to determine a difference in pregnancy rates between the 2 groups. Although this study did find a significant increase in hormone levels, they did not find an increase in sperm concentrations as other studies have reported.<sup>

<p>The WHO<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112466304">21</xref>
</sup> conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study measuring the effect of clomiphene citrate 25 mg daily versus placebo for at least 6 months. They included couples who failed to achieve pregnancy after at least 12 months of attempting to conceive and men who had a diagnosis of idiopathic-deficient sperm quality, with a sperm concentration &lt;20 million/mL and a sperm motility &lt;50%. They included 190 couples, though 48 were deemed to be ineligible as they did not provide full study information and 35 couples discontinued therapy before the end of the study. A total of 24 couples were lost to follow-up during the study. Results for fully eligible couples were reported separately. Overall, there were 18 pregnancies—10 occurring in the placebo group and 8 in the clomiphene group. Only in eligible couples there were 13 pregnancies overall, with 6 in the placebo group and 7 in the clomiphene group. It was also observed that 1 pregnancy in each of these groups occurred before any study medication was taken. Pregnancy rates were higher in couples having less than 3 years of infertility and in males with less severe impairment of semen quality (baseline sperm concentration &gt;5 million/mL). No significant increases in sperm concentration were seen after 4 months of therapy in the clomiphene group, though the placebo group was found to have a statistically significant increase in semen concentration from baseline (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Analysis showed there was no difference in the response with regard to the hormone levels and semen values among those couples who did or did not achieve pregnancy. This study had numerous flaws in participant enrollment and many patients dropped out of the study or were lost to follow-up. Therefore, the study lacked sufficient power to detect a difference between the 2 treatment groups.<sup>

<p>Finally, a recent study by Ghanem et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112466304">22</xref>
</sup> evaluated the effect of treatment with a combination of clomiphene and vitamin E compared to placebo in 60 infertile men. Patients were determined to be infertile after a minimum of a year of regular unprotected sexual activity and repeated exhibition of oligoasthenozoospermia (sperm concentrations repeatedly &lt;20 million/mL, total motility &lt;25%, and normal sperm morphology &gt;30%). Patients were excluded if they had a known etiology or apparent physical findings for infertility, diminished testicular volume, varicocele, or abnormal FSH. Patients received placebo or a combination of clomiphene 25 mg daily plus vitamin E 400 units daily. Results from this trial showed significantly more pregnancies in the treated group compared to placebo. There were 11 (36.7%) pregnancies  in the treated group and 4 (13.3%) pregnancies in the placebo group (<italic>P</italic> = .037). The results, however, were not significantly different until months 4 to 6. In months 1 to 3, there were 4 pregnancies in the treated group and 3 in the placebo group. There was also a significant increase in sperm concentration (<italic>P</italic> = .0025) and forward progression motility in the treated group compared to the placebo group (<italic>P</italic> = .0286). No difference was found in other sperm or semen parameters between the 2 groups. This study appears to show benefit when prescribing clomiphene and vitamin E simultaneously; however, given that there was no clomiphene control group, it is difficult to determine whether the combination significantly affects pregnancy rates compared to clomiphene alone.<sup>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Clomiphene has been used for many decades for the treatment of male infertility, though trials to date have generally been small, single-site, and placebo-controlled. Inclusion and exclusion criteria have varied, as have treatment doses and durations, which likely contributed to the variability in study outcomes. Only 1 study reported a statistically significant benefit on pregnancy rate in the clomiphene group.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112466304">22</xref>

These findings suggest that there may be factors other than those assessed during routine semen analysis that affect pregnancy and reinforces the need for outcomes that are not based solely on semen parameters.</p>
<p>Wang and colleagues reported that 6 (75%) of the 8 patients receiving clomiphene whose wives became pregnant had baseline sperm concentrations &gt;10 million/mL.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112466304">14</xref>

</sup> Conversely, the WHO study<sup>

</sup> However, the majority of the studies followed patients for 3 to 6 months, which likely affected the incidence of adverse events.</p>
<p>It should be noted that there have been recent reports of patients who develop azoospermia after treatment with clomiphene for idiopathic oligospermia. A case series reported by Pasqualotto et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719112466304">23</xref>
</sup> highlighted 3 patients who, after taking clomiphene for 3 to 6 months, developed azoospermia. All 3 patients were advised to discontinue use of clomiphene. Within 3 months, all had returned to baseline sperm concentrations. The FSH levels were considered normal before and after clomiphene treatment. There are several limitations to these reports, most notably the lack of clomiphene dose prescribed to these patients. Testicular volume, concomitant medications, past medical history, and other possibly important information were also not provided, making it difficult to draw conclusions from this report.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719112466304">23</xref>
</sup> Despite the limitations, this small case series serves to illustrate the importance of proper dosing and regular monitoring of patients treated with clomiphene.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no consensus recommendations for the selection of the appropriate medication for male infertility.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112466304">8</xref>
</sup> Tamoxifen is another antiestrogen agent used to treat male infertility. Similar to clomiphene, reports of tamoxifen have yielded both beneficial effects on semen parameters and a lack of beneficial effects on pregnancy rates.<sup>

</sup> Patients more likely to benefit from the treatment with clomiphene may include those meeting the following criteria: men with a diagnosis of idiopathic infertility, sperm concentrations &lt;20 million/mL but greater than 10 million/mL, normal FSH and LH levels, and normal or slightly below normal motility and morphology. Patients with a sperm concentration &lt;5 million/mL should not be treated with clomiphene, as it has not shown benefit in this population. There does not appear to be any additional benefit with doses of 50 mg daily compared to 25 mg daily.</p>
<p>The lack of consensus treatment recommendations for the management of male infertility underscores the need for more research in this area of care. Large, multicenter, randomized controlled trials with consistent inclusion and exclusion criteria are needed to investigate the efficacy and safety of clomiphene for the treatment of male infertility and would have a greater ability to detect a difference in pregnancy rate.</p>
