<p>Social work is becoming increasingly interactive, collaborative, and international as we learn to think globally and act locally in our teaching as well as in our work with individuals, families, groups, and communities. Technology has made it possible to communicate much more readily as we carry on dialogues via Facebook, MySpace, email, cell phones, Skype calls, and internet conference calls. Our knowledge and collaborative interchanges have grown exponentially as daily we are able to interface and interact with one another. In our continuous evolution as a profession, we are developing new theories and practices based on the cultivation of a multiplicity of voices, reveling in the richness and generosity that diversity and complexity encourage. As a profession, we are working to integrate a melting pot of ideas and positionings in evolving theories and practices that are borrowed from multiple disciplines, multiple worldviews, and multiple locations on the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020872811400718">Flaskas, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As international social workers, we are striving to embrace a not-knowing approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872811400718">Anderson, 1997</xref>) that welcomes diverse life situations and brings a curiosity and openness to our day-to-day interactions. We are learning the importance of collaborating with our students, clients and client systems as we learn from them and with them what it is that they need to learn, and what it is that they know and can teach us. In light of all of this, the presence in my MSW classes of international students, including students from other countries as well as US students who have studied and volunteered internationally, has increased my awareness of a number of pertinent issues, and enriched the interplay of exchanges that are possible in the classroom.</p>
<sec id="section1-0020872811400718">
<title>International social work: Issues to consider</title>
<p>As the world grows smaller and more accessible it is important that we recognize that all social workers are engaged in international social work to an extent, and must become apprised of the critical issues that are being debated in this arena. In international social work education, we are increasingly called to embrace knowledge about globalization and social work as a human rights profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872811400718">Abbott, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872811400718">Healy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872811400718">Hong and Song, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020872811400718">Hugman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872811400718">Midgley, 2007</xref>), definitions of international social work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872811400718">Healy and Thomas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020872811400718">Hugman et al., 2010</xref>), universalism versus relativism as they pertain to international social work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872811400718">Healy, 2007</xref>), and issues specific to international social work education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872811400718">Beecher et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020872811400718">Irizarry and Marlowe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872811400718">Mathiesen and Lager, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020872811400718">Schatz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020872811400718">Taylor, 1999</xref>; Wehbi, 2010).</p>

<title>Definitions of international social work</title>
<p>The definition of international social work is one that is complex and is still evolving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872811400718">Healy and Thomas, 2007</xref>). International social work definitions tend to focus on delineating populations served, the nationalities of the providers, and/or the different national and cultural contexts in which the social work practice takes place, with a particular focus on comparing social welfare systems and cross-cultural awareness. ‘Globalization, inequality, human rights, poverty and loss [are] some of the concepts central to international social work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872811400718">Healy and Thomas, 2007</xref>, p. 585). Of utmost importance is the question of whether practice knowledge, both global and local, can be generalized in useful ways from one geographic area to another.</p>
<p>The International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW) and the International Association of Schools of Social Work (IASSW) define international social work as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The social work profession promotes social change, problem solving in human relationships and the empowerment and liberation of people to enhance well-being. Utilizing theories of human behaviour and social systems, social work intervenes at the points where people interact with their environments. Principles of human rights and social justice are fundamental to social work. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020872811400718">IFSW, 2004</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The ‘Ethics in Social Work, Statement of Principles’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020872811400718">IFSW, 2004</xref>), emphasizes human rights and human dignity. It says that social workers should promote the right to involvement and participation of all people, underscoring the importance of the wholeness, strengths and empowerment of all human beings. It also emphasizes social justice through challenging ‘negative discrimination’, recognizing diversity, equitably distributing resources, challenging injustices, and ‘working in solidarity’.</p>
<p>A recent article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872811400718">Trygged (2010)</xref> offered a useful and comprehensive discussion of the many complexities involved in the development of an international definition of social work. He revised the IFSW/IASSW definition to include the notion that international social work must incorporate structural perspectives as compared to ‘individualistic’ perspectives, involving ‘new actors, such as development agencies and NGOs, and issues of policy, development, mobilization, power and action’ (p. 653) in international social work. He proposed adding a paragraph to the IFSW/IASSW definition that would recognize the importance of research at both the international and national levels. ‘In this way, global standards will help to codify the norms for social work even more, and with a stronger legitimacy they might help to unify social work in different parts of the world’ (p. 653).</p>

<title>From globalization to glocalization</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872811400718">Hong and Song (2010)</xref> have written about the importance of recognizing that globalization can have both positive and adverse effects on a given area, as it increases awareness and appreciation of ‘the common humanity of all people’, while also potentially undermining ‘the sovereignty of governments and creat[ing] unemployment and poverty’ (p. 657). They underscore the importance of developing a global civil society with a global social policy system that acknowledges and adjusts for the inequities inherent in a global world.</p>
<p>Recent literature has expanded the term globalization, moving beyond ideas of economic, social and cultural exchange, to discuss a concept that is termed ‘glocalization’. ‘Locating international social work within the idea of glocalization is advantageous in that an analysis that is situated in the global and local does not only reflect global interdependency but also recognizes the power relations within which international social work exists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020872811400718">Hugman et al., 2010</xref>: 634).</p>

<title>Universalism versus relativism</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872811400718">Healy (2007)</xref>, as countries are becoming increasingly multicultural, the universalism–relativism debate has become highly relevant to the practice of social work. The debate centers on the belief that there are universal rights and values, as opposed to the belief that context and cultural specifics govern the rights and values of a people.</p>
<p>This debate is important as we think about human rights and the ethical codes that guide social work practice. Many of our international students plan to return to their native countries to work and to live, following graduation from our US MSW program. As we prepare them to become social workers in the world we must keep in mind the constructs of imperialism and colonialism. It is critical that these students learn how to meet people where they are, and help them to attain their goals on their terms, working with them toward their particular self-determined futures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0020872811400718">
<title>Our international social work students</title>
<p>When I think of our international students, the word ‘hero’ comes to mind. Regardless of their motivations for pursuing international social work, these students are bridging worlds and, I believe, performing acts of heroism as they move out of their comfort zones and move to the edges, working to challenge and to educate themselves, and us, toward the promotion of universal rights and values for all people.</p>
<sec id="section6-0020872811400718">
<title>What is a hero?</title>
<p>The word hero comes from the Greek and literally means protector or defender. A hero is a person of courage who is often said to be fulfilling a quest and/or risking his/her life for a person or a people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872811400718">Hero, n.d.</xref>). Many of our international social work students are on quests in which they are venturing to other worlds, some of them risking their lives, to develop knowledge and experience with which they hope to better the life chances of all people.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0020872811400718">
<title>In the classroom</title>
<p>There are a number of ways in which international social work is experienced in the classroom. An increasing number of our US students have lived and worked in other countries and bring with them expanded world views and an awareness of a broader range of global challenges. Their lived experiences enrich and alter the ethos of classroom interactions as they participate in discussions that bring forth such issues as the history of US hegemony and colonialism on the world stage, the insularity of much of US social work education, the importance of cultural competence and cross-cultural communication, and the relative ‘we and they’ dichotomies that are inadvertently extant in many social work courses. In these dialogues we strive to alter the dynamic in which we learn about ‘doing it to’ our client systems and engaging in ‘oppressive social relations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872811400718">Wehbi, 2009</xref>: 55), and instead seek to exchange knowledge and skills, and encourage mutual agency. Our increasing numbers of international students have enriched the classroom and their field internships, offering heightened awareness of the importance of global contexts and human rights, and teaching us about acceptance, respect, openness, and cultural competence through their facility with multiple languages and their abilities to bridge worlds.</p>

<title>Amadou’s story</title>
<p>Amadou, a student who has been my graduate research assistant this year, offered not only his competence in a number of arenas, but also inspiration, as he talked with me about his life experiences and his commitment to his family, his village, and his people. At the ripe old age of 20-something he has a wisdom and a depth of spirit that undoubtedly are already making the world a better place.</p>
<p>Amadou’s story is that he grew up in a small village in Mauritania on the border of Senegal, an area of Northwest Africa that has been the scene of much ethnic discord, oppression, and violence. His father died when he was seven, and his older brother stopped his education after high school in order to go to work to support their family. Amadou was able to go on to earn a BS in Business and Administration at a university in West Africa, and then to earn his MSW in the United States. While earning his MSW, he worked part-time and sent as much money as he could home to his family, as well as to more than 80 members of his village. Without this money, he said, they would have starved.</p>
<p>From early in his life Amadou was very active politically, which led to arrests, imprisonments, beatings, and time spent in refugee camps. He describes the lives of his people as filled with strife, poverty, rape, and brutality. ‘Education is freedom’, he says, and he is passionately committed to dedicating his life to a better world and to education for his people.</p>
<p>His internship this year was at a school where he worked with African refugees, helping them to succeed in local high schools. He described their issues as having to do with more than just learning the language and the ways of US education. ‘These students have never been in a school building where there are walls.’ Beyond cultural and linguistic differences, he said, ways of learning and of using one’s mind are completely different in the US. It is important to understand and to work with these differences in order to help these students feel capable of learning so that they do not become discouraged and get involved with pursuing negative activities. It is important also, he said, that they not become acculturated to the US ways, and that they learn to respect themselves and honor their ways of being.</p>
<p>Amadou speaks of a cultural value of giving, and a belief that his life is protected as long as he uses it to better the lives of his people. In his culture, he says, the mother is the most important person. His mother is very proud of him and tells him always to give. He does it to please her, and because that is the model his older brother has provided him of how to live. In turn, he serves as a model for his younger siblings as well as for others in his village.</p>
<p>A colleague donated a sewing machine to Amadou this year, and he delivered it to the women of his village over the winter break. These women have become avid seamstresses and he is now getting training in microenterprise and development programs, which he plans to use to help these women create a business that can sustain them and their families in years to come.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0020872811400718">
<title>Amadou’s experience</title>
<p>I interviewed Amadou about his experience as an international student in our program in preparation for writing this article:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>How relevant has a US-based education been for understanding your situation back home and your current work?</p>
<p>Education here in the US helped me understand that I can accomplish any goal I set for myself as far as I persevere and work hard toward it. I am also struck by the tremendous academic and social support I got from attending university here in the US. Back home, I was among the few fortunate boys in my hometown to finish university, but we did it with quasi-non-existent academic, social and financial support. This is because for the most part, our society, unlike the American society, does not value education. I realize here in the US people have a pervasive education culture, unlike in my country where only few people understand and appreciate the importance of education.</p>
<p>Moreover, US-based education gave me the opportunity to expand my knowledge in many areas related to my career field through theory and practice. I have done a lot of schooling in my home country, but not enough practice of what I have studied for years, because of the lack of infrastructures, materials and accommodations in my country school system. Going to school here in the US, and obtaining a college or graduate degree, provide opportunities for a better future, which is not necessarily the case in my country. Even with my college degree back home, I never had a real job. In my country and in many other countries in Africa, a college degree is not a key to prosperity, it is more about influence, power, connections, corruptions and bribery that will help you find a job after you graduated from college.</p>
<p><italic>In what ways can international students challenge or at least broaden possible ethnocentric bias in the NASW (National Association of Social Work) code of ethics?</italic></p>
<p>As an international student in social work, I have to say that the application of numerous elements in social work practice I have learned in the classrooms, through textbooks and in a real-life agency settings became clear as I witnessed the challenges and the rewards of the profession. The program stresses the importance of self-awareness, and taught me that a non-judgmental, respectful attitude, and confidentiality are essential when working with any population, which I also believe are universal principles we all social workers share around the world. These principles, including ethical awareness, are fundamental to our field of social work.</p>
<p>However, as an international social worker who shares his practice between the United States and Africa, I am also aware that the ethical challenges and problems facing social workers are not the same in each country. One of the challenges I found in Western-based social work education is that there are many skills, intervention strategies, and policies I have learned in the US that cannot be applied across cultures or completely divorced from the local context. For example, the principles of self-determination, human rights and individual rights in the NASW code of ethics are more appealing to the Western population than to other cultures such as African or Middle Eastern populations.</p>
<p>In Africa, for example, social workers deal with poverty, HIV/AIDS, illiteracy, conflicts, and a lack of human rights and social justice. Therefore, social work in Africa might be different from that in the United States. Social work in Africa emphasizes community-based approaches, which implies that poverty, HIV/AIDS, human rights, social justice, and conflicts as community issues have to be understood in a cultural and social context and be solved as such. Western ideas, skills and values have not always been found useful in the local African context because many issues that social work is faced with have to be dealt with in a community context rather than on an individual basis.</p>
<p>Given the globalization and increasing multiculturalism, I would like to see more of the international perspective on the social work code of ethics and on other social work practices. Many social workers face challenges of respecting other cultures while upholding professional ethics. I believe we need to examine further the perspective of universalism and cultural relativism as applied to ethical decision making in social work, and take a more comprehensive vision that values diversity and human rights globally.</p>
<p><italic>What is your current work? Are you staying in the US?</italic></p>
<p>Right now I finished my MSW degree, I did not have a hard time finding a job, less worry about finding one. Because I know, here in the US, I will be hired based on my credentials, experience, work ethic and competence, not based on my race, tribe, gender or political influence.</p>
<p>I work in schools as a social worker and also as a program coordinator of an after-school project. I am not planning on going back to my country in the near future, because staying here in the US will give more opportunities to work on projects, mobilize resources that will bring a lot of help to my people back in my country.</p>
<p><italic>Why have you focused on education as the primary solution to such complex problems?</italic></p>
<p>I believe education is freedom for us in Africa, we still lag far behind, and I believe only through education will our country’s sons and daughters be able to meet the demands and challenges of the 21st century. Education always pays off, and I knew that when I followed the footsteps of my older brother and my younger brother followed my footsteps. What I really found attractive about getting education in the household is the additional benefits that accrue to empowering other members of the household with greatest capacity to alter the life prospects of the generation to come. I really appreciate the value and importance of education, and through education, I believe we can solve many of the complex problems we have as Africans.</p>

<title>Lessons learned</title>
<p>When I chose Amadou as my Graduate Assistant I had little knowledge of him and of his motivations for pursuing an MSW degree in the US. I had hopes that we would be able to collaborate on research projects and that he would be able to teach me some of his research and macro social work skills, as well as learn with me as we worked together. I learned much more than I had anticipated, and it was a humbling experience.</p>
<p>As we began our work together I learned that Amadou’s sense of time was not the same as mine; he tended to take longer to perform a task than I had expected. I learned to accommodate to his timing and to be more explicit about my expectations. There was a period of time when he missed appointments and did not communicate with me; I learned that his teeth were bothering him and he had never been to a dentist. I informed him of a pro bono dental service in the area and he was able to get some relief from his pain. I also found that if I asked him to do something that he didn’t understand, he would not tell me he didn’t understand; he would just not do what I had asked. I learned to carefully and respectfully ask if he understood or if he needed help with the things he was not completing. As I accommodated Amadou’s ways of being, I became painfully aware of how many accommodations he was making in order to earn his highly-esteemed MSW degree. Not only was he negotiating a different language and culture, he was having to learn new ways of being in order to meet our requirements.</p>
<p>I learned that my worldview has been an extremely insular one. Although I have taught about power differentials and the hegemony of knowledge as theoretical constructs, and though I strive to engage in collaborative learning/teaching processes in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872811400718">Lord, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020872811400718">2009</xref>), it is clear that I have a long way to go toward grappling with these issues as they pertain to international social work. These issues are extremely delicate and complex. As social work educators, it is important to acknowledge that there are power differentials in which we participate in the classroom. Ironically through the process of teaching, we are enacting the very dynamics of power and control that we seek to change. We exercise a certain hegemony of knowledge, in that we, as a faculty, determine what the curriculum will contain. We also develop assignments and grade our students on their performance according to a set of standards that we develop. In working with Amadou, I became aware that there were many cultural differences of which I was not aware. While he was learning about certain aspects of social work in the US, I was not sure how transferable the skills might be or how applicable they might be to his particular glocal agendas, and I learned to ask more and accommodate more. I began to think about ways to tailor my teaching and assignments to better address the diverse and global contexts in which many of our students plan to live and work; this is a work in progress.</p>
<p>Hopefully, as we move forward and continue to become more interactive, collaborative, and international in our work, the social work profession will become increasingly aware of the importance of continuing to cultivate our agency, our involvement, and our visibility in the ‘global human rights movement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872811400718">Healy, 2008</xref>: 744). It is important that social work as an international profession focuses its attention and efforts on the political and civil rights as well as the economic and social rights of all of humankind. Education <italic>is</italic> freedom, and it is of critical importance that we continue to educate ourselves as we participate daily in international social work on the world stage.</p>
