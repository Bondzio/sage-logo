<abstract>
<p><italic>Purpose</italic>: To determine whether pediatric SLE patients without European ancestry are at higher risk for development of severe lupus nephritis (ISN/RPS class III, IV or V). <italic>Methods</italic>: Ninety-eight of 101 patients with pediatric SLE (age &lt;18 years at diagnosis) were enrolled. Race/ethnicity of four grandparents, socioeconomic status (SES) and language proficiency were collected. The primary outcome was time to development of severe lupus nephritis. <italic>Results</italic>: Based on patient report of four grandparent ancestry, 29% had at least one grandparent of European ancestry (14% had all four grandparents of European ancestry). Patients without European ancestry were 46% Hispanic, 47% Asian, and 3% African American. In the entire 98 patient cohort, 12% had ≥3 different ancestries. Patients without European ancestry had significantly lower SES levels and English proficiency. There was no significant difference between patients with or without European ancestry in duration of SLE, age of onset, and lag time between symptoms and diagnosis. Patients with at least one grandparent of European ancestry had a decreased risk of developing severe lupus nephritis, which remained significant after controlling for age, gender, SES and English proficiency (hazard ratio 0.4, 95% confidence interval 0.2–0.9). <italic>Conclusion</italic>: This study demonstrates that presence of at least one grandparent of European ancestry decreases the risk of severe lupus nephritis, a finding that is not explained by measurable socioeconomic differences and language barriers.</p>

<p>There have been few studies investigating the effects of race and ethnicity on disease presentation and course in pediatric lupus patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312437805">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312437805">2</xref></sup> Adult lupus studies have reported greater risk of lupus nephritis among African and Hispanic Americans with worse renal outcomes and higher mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312437805">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312437805">3</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312437805">6</xref></sup> In both pediatric and adult studies, the influence of race and ethnicity on clinical manifestations is controversial.

<p>Although currently accepted categories of race/ethnicity have been primarily conceived as social, cultural and political constructs, recent studies in the field of genetic determinants of race/ethnicity have demonstrated that self-reported race/ethnicity based on ancestral geography correlate highly with ancestry informative markers, which can be further refined by grandparent ancestral data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203312437805">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203312437805">23</xref></sup> Understanding the background ancestries is essential to identifying genome-wide associations in complex genetic traits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203312437805">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203312437805">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study was conducted in Northern California where the population is heterogeneous in its racial and ethnic composition. We hypothesized that patients without European ancestry had an increased risk of developing severe lupus nephritis and evaluated the extent to which this risk could be explained by socioeconomic status (SES), access to health care or language barriers.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203312437805" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-0961203312437805" sec-type="subjects"><title>Patient population</title>
<p>All pediatric patients attending the pediatric rheumatology clinic at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford University Medical Center (October 2004–July 2009), who met the ACR diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of SLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961203312437805">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961203312437805">26</xref></sup> with disease onset prior to age 18 years were identified. All patients regularly followed for care of their SLE were eligible to participate. All those agreeing to participate signed informed consent and assent where appropriate. The study was approved by the Stanford Institutional Review Board.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203312437805"><title>Race/ethnicity variables</title>
<p>A patient/parent questionnaire was used to assess the racial/ethnic background of four biological grandparents. A modified format for definitions of race/ethnicity as recommended by the National Institutes of Health (Statistical Policy Directive No. 15, Race and Ethnic Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative Reporting) was used: Native American (including American Indian and Alaska Native), Asian American/Pacific Islander (including Native Hawaiian), African American, Hispanic/Latino (of any and all races including White), Non-Hispanic White (including people of European, Middle Eastern and North African descent), and Multiracial/Other.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961203312437805">27</xref></sup> There were no Middle Eastern or North African individuals in this cohort; therefore all of the non-Hispanic White patients were European in origin. For this reason, the term ‘European ancestry’ was used to denote this racial subgroup in this study. For all analyses, patients were divided into two groups: patients of European ancestry (having one to four grandparents of European ancestry) and patients of non-European ancestry (having no grandparents of European ancestry).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0961203312437805"><title>SES and language variables</title>
<p>SES variables and language variables were assessed by parent/patient questionnaire. SES data included the following: household income level, insurance status (none, government, or private insurance) and parent/guardian education level at the time of SLE diagnosis. Each parent/guardian educational level ranging from no high school to graduate school was collected. Language preference at home and English proficiency of the parent/guardian were assessed. English language proficiency score was based on the frequency that the individual parents/guardians spoke in English (never or rarely, sometimes, or often or always) and whether they were able to write or read in English. Our purpose for evaluating English language proficiency was to assess/confirm that ‘English language preference at home’ correlated with higher parental English proficiency scores. The English proficiency scores have not been validated in this clinical setting.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0961203312437805"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>All clinic visits were documented using a standardized clinic form. Baseline patient and disease characteristics, as well as outcome data, were collected retrospectively from electronic medical records using the STRIDE (Stanford Translational Research Integrated Database Environment) Data Review Tool.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961203312437805">28</xref></sup> Baseline data included demographic information, time between symptom onset and diagnosis of SLE, and standardized assessments including clinical manifestations of SLE and standard SLE laboratory measures. Disease activity was measured utilizing the <italic>modified</italic> Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961203312437805">29</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961203312437805">31</xref></sup> based on the SLEDAI 2000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961203312437805">32</xref></sup> The SLEDAI has been validated for use in children and in retrospective chart review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961203312437805">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0961203312437805">34</xref></sup> Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, mm/h) was obtained at onset. To determine ACR criteria and SLEDAI, serologies (antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith, anticardiolipin, other antiphospholipid tests), complete blood counts, complement levels and urinary protein and sediment were collected at onset. We collected data corresponding to our outcome variables at the time of diagnosis and at every clinic visit thereafter, which was approximately every three months (range 1–4 months). At any point, if the patient developed ‘severe lupus nephritis’, then this would constitute an event in our ‘time-to-event’ analyses (Kaplan–Meier estimate and Cox analyses). Severe lupus nephritis was defined by renal biopsy findings classified by International Society Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) (after 2003) or World Health Organization (WHO) Class III, IV, V (before 2003), or when biopsies were not obtained, by the presence of significant azotemia (estimated creatinine clearance &lt;90 ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) with nephritic or nephrotic syndrome. Renal biopsies were reviewed by the Stanford University Department of Pathology. Aggressive immunosuppression was defined as use of cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, cyclosporine A or rituximab for severe organ-specific or systemic disease. Start dates for aggressive immunosuppression were recorded and served as the censoring dates for the Kaplan–Meier and Cox analyses. All patients receiving these immunosuppressive medications noted above also received high dose corticosteroids. All patients received hydroxychloroquine.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0961203312437805"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>SLE patients were divided into two groups, one with no European ancestry and the other with at least one grandparent having European ancestry. The analytic goal was to describe factors/characteristics that were similar or different between these two groups. The primary predictor of interest was ‘at least one grandparent of European ancestry’ and the primary outcome measure was ‘time to development of severe lupus nephritis (class III, IV, V)’ with the start point being the lupus diagnosis date. Pre-specified exploratory outcome variables reflecting disease severity included ‘time to initiation of aggressive immunosuppression’ for any affected organ system and hospital days. Our primary predictor and primary outcome variables were determined a priori and were analyzed by the log rank test and Cox regression.</p>
<p>The following covariates were treated as ordinal variables: household income level (0 = &lt;$25,000; 1 = $25,000–49,999; 2 = $50,000–74,999; 3 = $75,000–99,999; 4 = $100,000–150,000; 5 = &gt;$150,000); insurance level (0 = no insurance, 1 = government insurance, 2 = private insurance); and each parent/guardian education level (0 = no high school, 1 = some high school, 2 = graduated high school, 3 = some college/technical school, 4 = graduated college/technical school, 5 = graduate school). English language proficiency score was treated as an ordinal variable and based on the frequency that the individual parents/guardians spoke in English (0 = never or rarely, 1 = sometimes, 2 = often or always) and whether they were able to write in English (0 = no, 1 = yes) or read in English (0 = no, 1 = yes) for a max score of 4 per parent. English preference at home was treated as a binomial predictor – yes: English was the preferred language spoken in the home versus no: another language was the preferred language spoken in the home. We used a correlation matrix to determine whether English proficiency scores correlated with ‘English preference at home’ to reaffirm the latter as a marker of English proficiency in this patient population. Time-to analyses were used to optimize use of all available data, especially follow-up times. With regards to the primary outcome (severe lupus nephritis), observations were censored based on date of last follow-up or start date of aggressive immunosuppression (definition above) used for non-renal disease.</p>
<p>Chi-Square tests were used to compare difference in proportions. Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to compare differences in means. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to evaluate correlation among SES and language proficiency covariates. Multivariate Cox regression was used to control for SES and language covariates. Significance was set at &lt;0.05. SAS 9.1 statistical analysis software was used for all data analysis.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0961203312437805" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>One hundred and one patients with pediatric SLE were eligible and 100 subjects consented and completed the facilitated questionnaire on racial/ethnic background, socioeconomic background and English language proficiency. Two patients were excluded from the analysis because the ancestry of all four grandparents was not known, resulting in 98 subjects for analysis. Of the 28 patients with one or more European grandparents, 14 had exclusive European ancestry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203312437805">Table 1</xref>). Patients with ≥3 distinct racial/ethnic heritages were more likely to have a European grandparent (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0001). There was no difference in age of onset, time from symptom onset to first subspecialty clinic visit (rheumatology or nephrology) or length of follow-up time between the two groups (patients with one to four grandparents of European ancestry versus no grandparents of European ancestry). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961203312437805">Table 2</xref> describes clinical features at onset of SLE, but this table should be interpreted with caution since the <italic>p</italic>-values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Patients without European ancestry more frequently presented with a renal disorder (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01) as defined by the ACR criteria for renal disease (&gt;0.5 g/day protein in urine or cellular casts seen in urine microscopy).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961203312437805">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961203312437805">26</xref></sup> In addition, patients without European ancestry had higher ESRs (87 <italic>vs.</italic> 65 mm/h, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03), and higher SLEDAI scores at onset (17 <italic>vs.</italic> 13, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03) compared with patients with one or more grandparents of European ancestry.

<p>Patients were eligible for renal biopsy at any time during the course of disease if they developed evidence of nephritis (active urinary sediment with red blood cells (RBC) &gt; 5 and proteinuria). Sixty-four patients underwent renal biopsy. Two patients with presumed severe lupus nephritis based on clinical features (azotemia with nephritic or nephrotic syndrome) were not able to undergo renal biopsy due to risk of complications. Fifty-eight of the 64 patients with biopsies had severe lupus nephritis with 16 patients having class III, 35 with class IV and 6 with class V. Overall, patients with no grandparents of European ancestry were diagnosed with severe lupus nephritis more frequently compared with patients with one to four grandparents of European ancestry (<italic>p</italic> = 0.04, Chi-Square). Using a Kaplan–Meier nephritis-free analysis as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203312437805">Figure 1</xref>, those patients with no grandparents of European ancestry had a significantly higher probability of developing severe lupus nephritis (<italic>p</italic> = 0.006, log rank) both at onset and during the period of observation. The numbers of patients were too small to allow analysis of any differences between the pathologic classes of nephritis between the groups or analysis by specific racial/ethnic group. Among patients with severe lupus nephritis, there were no statistical differences between the two groups with regard to the following renal outcomes: need for antihypertensive medication, need for dialysis, presence of nephrotic syndrome greater than two months and progression to end stage renal disease; but our study was under-powered to detect such differences.

<p>A correlation matrix was constructed to determine which SES variables should be included in the final Cox proportional-hazard model and to reaffirm the language barrier variable. When any pair of covariates had a correlation greater than 0.6, we chose the covariate which had higher reliability, least amount of missing data and least amount of correlation with other covariates in the model. Maternal and paternal education levels were highly correlated (0.73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001); we included maternal rather than paternal education levels since there was less missing data with regards to the maternal education levels. Income level correlated with insurance status (0.73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001); we chose to include insurance status in the final model since insurance status was more reliable as it was confirmed by chart review and there was no missing data. The variable ‘English is the preferred language spoken in the home’ was highly correlated with maternal (0.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and paternal (0.71, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) English proficiency scores. Additionally, maternal and paternal English proficiency scores were also correlated to each other (0.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Therefore, the final model included the following covariates: maternal education levels and insurance status as the markers of SES, and English preference at home as the marker of language proficiency.</p></sec>

<p>We further explored whether European ancestry contributed to disease protection by determining whether there was a dose effect with respect to the number of grandparents with European ancestry. We retained the ethnicity variable as an ordinal predictor based on number of grandparents with European ancestry, i.e. 0 = no grandparent of European ancestry, 1 = one grandparent of European ancestry, 2 = two grandparents of European ancestry, etc., to 4 = all four grandparents with European ancestry. For each grandparent of European ancestry, the risk of developing severe lupus nephritis was decreased and remained significant after controlling for age, gender, maternal education, insurance status and English preference at home (HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6–0.9).</p>
<p>Additional exploratory analyses to evaluate severity of disease were performed. Eighty of the 98 patients received aggressive immunosuppression, which was used to treat nephritis, neuropsychiatric lupus, hematologic lupus and pulmonary involvement. Although there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients receiving aggressive immunosuppression (for any lupus manifestation) in the two groups, there was a trend towards earlier time to aggressive immunosuppression use in patients without European ancestry (HR 1.6, <italic>p</italic> = 0.08, data not shown). Patients without European ancestry spent more days in the hospital (20.4 <italic>vs.</italic> 5.3 days, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01), but whether this is related to severity of disease or other environmental or socioeconomic factors was not evaluated.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec12-0961203312437805" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we report on disease manifestations at presentation and outcomes in 98 patients with pediatric SLE diagnosed and followed at a single center in Northern California with diverse racial/ethnic groups. In this cohort, severe lupus nephritis was less frequent and presented later in the disease course in patients who had European ancestry compared with those patients with no European grandparents. This observation remained significant, even when adjusted for SES and English proficiency barriers, suggesting that the health disparities in this cohort of patients with severe lupus nephritis are not explained by measurable SES and language barriers.</p>
<p>The primary predictor for this study relied on patient/parental report of the patient’s four grandparent race/ethnicity. As mentioned previously, two patients were excluded because they did not know the race/ethnicity of all four grandparents. For the remaining 98 patients, there was no missing data for this information; we attribute this low rate of missing data to the fact that the parents were answering the race/ethnicity question about their own parents. Although it is possible that some of the reported grandparental information was incorrect, self-report of ancestry has been shown to be a reasonable proxy for genetic ancestry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203312437805">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0961203312437805">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0961203312437805">36</xref></sup> and four grandparent race/ethnicity data has been shown to correlate with and, in some cases, enhance the substructure analyses in genetic studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203312437805">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0961203312437805">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0961203312437805">38</xref></sup> The ancestry categories analyzed in this study allow for substantial heterogeneity, especially with regards to the Hispanic subgroup, which may include patients with White and indigenous American ancestry. For these reasons, it will be important to perform ancestry informative marker genotyping in this study population to validate, refine and improve our findings. Our study was underpowered to evaluate effects of racial/ethnic subgroups and this will be an important future study to conduct as a multi-center project.</p>
<p>For our analysis, the primary predictor variable was dichotomous. However, for secondary analysis, to see whether there was a dose–response effect with regards to the number of European grandparents, we used the raw data to create an ordinal variable based on the number of European grandparents, and this result indicated increasing protection with increasing number of European grandparents even after controlling for SES and language barriers (HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6–0.9) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0961203312437805">Table 4</xref>).</p>
<p>The primary racial/ethnic groups represented in our study were Hispanic/Latinos, Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders, and Whites primarily of European descent. Few African Americans were included in this cohort, in contrast to most adult and pediatric SLE studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312437805">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312437805">10</xref></sup> The increase in renal disease seen in this study is consistent with other studies in adult and pediatric multiethnic cohorts including those studies with significant proportions of African Americans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0961203312437805">39</xref></sup> Admixture proportions, especially of Asian subgroups and indigenous peoples of the Americas, may further enhance the discrimination of this model.</p>
<p>SLE is a disease in which health disparities are clearly present, as it more severely affects females, young persons and individuals of color in the USA and around the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312437805">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312437805">7</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203312437805">14</xref></sup> These characteristics are associated with lower SES, which can confound the determination of whether health disparities are due to social, economic and cultural differences or to the primary disease of SLE itself. The correlation between SES and race/ethnicity makes it difficult to analytically tease out the effects of either construct. Many confounders modulate the effects of race/ethnicity on disease expression and outcome including insurance status, transportation issues, language barriers, time to referral, medication compliance, cultural differences, health care beliefs and others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0961203312437805">40</xref></sup> Health insurance, income and employment have been found to be unstable measures of SES in adult lupus patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0961203312437805">41</xref></sup> Language barriers have important effects on health outcomes, especially in Hispanic/Latino and Asian American subgroups. A study by Weinick and Krauss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0961203312437805">42</xref></sup> demonstrated that healthy Hispanic/Latino children have less access to primary health care, a disparity that endured after controlling for health insurance and SES, but the disparity disappeared after controlling for language proficiency. Thus race/ethnicity studies must control for language barriers in order to get an adequate assessment of the disparities that affect people of color.</p>
<p>We evaluated whether the time between symptom onset and diagnosis varied substantially in our study population. We posited that a systematic delay in diagnosis would bias our study (i.e. patients with lower SES or language barriers may have a delay in diagnosis and thus present with more severe disease and/or have an earlier time to onset of severe lupus nephritis). Therefore, we attempted to evaluate this ‘delay in diagnosis’ by evaluating ‘time from symptom onset to first rheumatology/nephrology visit’. The date of ‘symptom onset’ was/is collected by our clinic physicians per routine and is documented in the patient’s electronic medical record. This date is determined by interviewing the patient and reviewing medical records of the primary care physician and outside physicians. Our study found no difference in ‘time from symptom onset to first rheumatology/nephrology visit date’ between the two racial/ethnic groups despite there being a significant difference in SES and language proficiency (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203312437805">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0961203312437805">3</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study did not demonstrate a contribution of SES and language proficiency to the disparities between racial/ethnic groups in regard to severe renal disease. It is possible that these potential barriers are mitigated in this cohort due to the local health care environment, or perhaps these factors have less impact on disease manifestations in children and adolescents with SLE. Notably, access to initial and ongoing care in this cohort was not different between patients with European ancestry compared with patients with no grandparents of European ancestry, even though the typical features of higher SES (income, education and insurance) were significantly associated with European ancestry.</p>
<p>In addition to the increase in severe renal disease in patients without European ancestry, the increased disease activity by SLEDAI scores and higher ESRs noted at onset, as well as the trend towards more aggressive treatment and more hospitalization days in patients of non-European descent, suggest that SLE may be more severe in this group compared with those with European ancestry. However, this observation will need to be studied in more depth before any specific conclusion can be drawn. This study did not evaluate disease damage and was underpowered to detect a difference in the rates of end stage renal disease (ESRD) and other renal outcomes between the two groups.</p>
<p>This study reports the finding that having one or more grandparents of European ancestry decreases the risk for developing severe lupus nephritis among pediatric patients. Although we found significant differences in SES and language proficiency between patients with and without European grandparents, these differences did not fully explain the increased risk of severe lupus nephritis in the patients with no European ancestry. The concept that this represents a biologic effect is further supported by the apparent ‘dose effect’ where each additional grandparent of European ancestry decreases the risk of severe renal disease, a finding that remained significant after controlling for SES and English proficiency.</p></sec>
