<abstract>
<p>The development and initial psychometric investigation of the Dating Attitudes Inventory (DAI) is reported. The DAI was created, to fill a gap in the literature and to measure specific masculine ideology and traditional gender attitudes that rationalize the abuse of women. Using a sample (<italic>n</italic> = 164) of male college students, a 20-item measure was developed consisting of two subscales (Rationalization of Abuse and Dominance and Control) and a total score. The 20-item DAI and other measures used for validation were completed by 216 male college students. The DAI correlated in theoretically expected ways with measures of propensity for abusiveness, relational dominance, and masculine gender role stress. A confirmatory factor analysis supported the two theorized factors of the DAI. Results of the present study offer initial support for the validity and reliability of the DAI. The authors discuss the importance of measuring masculine gender role attitudes and beliefs that support and rationalize dating violence.</p>

<p>Intimate violence is a pervasive and universal problem with multiple negative consequences for those involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260511431432">Lewis &amp; Fremouw, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0886260511431432">Schafer, Caetano, &amp; Clark, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0886260511431432">Straus &amp; Kantor, 1994</xref>). Recent research has found that rates of dating violence are higher than domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0886260511431432">Schafer et al., 1998</xref>), suggesting the need for increased understanding of this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0886260511431432">Jouriles, McDonald, Garrido, Rosenfield, &amp; Brown, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0886260511431432">Luthra &amp; Gidycz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0886260511431432">Wolfe, 2006</xref>). In addition, dating violence has been associated with increased risk of intimate violence as an adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260511431432">Callahan, Tolman, &amp; Saunders, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260511431432">Foo &amp; Margolin, 1995</xref>). Unfortunately, attempts to understand and subsequently prevent and remediate intimate violence are relatively new; thus far, prevention and remediation efforts have been met with limited success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0886260511431432">Schwartz &amp; Waldo, 2004</xref>). Research has suggested multiple predictive factors of intimate violence. However, the limited number of valid and reliable instrumentation designed to measure aspects of intimate violence is one barrier to an improved understanding of this phenomenon.</p>
<sec id="section1-0886260511431432">
<title>Gender Role Socialization and Intimate Violence</title>
<p>Historically, research on domestic violence has focused on patriarchal societal norms and resultant male entitlement as the primary contributors to men’s violence toward women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0886260511431432">O’Neil &amp; Harway, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0886260511431432">Pence &amp; Paymer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0886260511431432">Walker, 1984</xref>). Although there is current evidence of complex predictors of intimate violence, there is a need to further understand the impact of gender socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0886260511431432">Luthra &amp; Gidycz, 2006</xref>). There is evidence for an intergenerational transmission of specific masculine gender role ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0886260511431432">Luddy &amp; Thompson, 1997</xref>), providing additional support that socialized masculine gender role attitudes that justify intimate violence are learned. Further research has suggested that attitudes and beliefs that justify intimate violence may mediate the experience of exposure to family of origin violence and perpetration of intimate violence as an adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511431432">Alexander et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0886260511431432">Simon et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, the combination of witnessing violence and socialization of gender role attitudes that support violence appears to be strongly related to the perpetration of intimate violence as an adult.</p>
<p>Research and theory suggest that through the process of gender role socialization, men construct and adapt various masculinity ideologies defining what constitutes appropriate gendered thoughts, feelings, and actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0886260511431432">Pleck, Sonestein, &amp; Ku, 1993a</xref>). Gender role ideology has been defined as attitudes and beliefs related to the proper or traditional versus nontraditional roles, behaviors, and characteristics of men and women in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0886260511431432">McHugh &amp; Frieze, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0886260511431432">Spence, 1993</xref>). Research has found that men with rigid and traditional gender role ideology report more adversarial relationships with women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260511431432">Fischer &amp; Good, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0886260511431432">Pleck, Sonenstein, &amp; Leighton, 1993</xref>). Traditional and restrictive gender role ideology has been associated with psychological and physical intimate violence toward women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260511431432">Bookwala, Frieze, Smith, &amp; Ryan, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511431432">Crossman, Stith, &amp; Bender, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260511431432">Fitzpatrick, Salgado, Suvak, King, &amp; King, 2004</xref>). In addition, research has found that gender role conflicts resulting from rigid adherence to traditional masculine gender roles have been related to negative attitudes and hostility toward women and gender equality as well as involvement in intimate violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511431432">Blazina &amp; Watkins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0886260511431432">Robinson &amp; Schwartz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0886260511431432">Schwartz, Waldo, &amp; Daniels, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0886260511431432">Wade &amp; Brittan-Powell, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511431432">Mahalik, Aldarondo, Gilbert-Gokhale, and Shore (2005)</xref> found that failure to meet internalized and rigid masculine ideals (gender role stress) predicted controlling relationship behaviors, further supporting the relationship between traditional masculine ideology and aspects of intimate violence.</p>
<p>The majority of intimate violence prevention and remediation interventions address masculine gender socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511431432">Dutton &amp; Starzomski, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0886260511431432">Pence &amp; Paymer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0886260511431432">Slep, Cascardi, Avery-Leaf, &amp; O’Leary, 2001</xref>). Despite the popularity of these interventions, it is still unclear how masculine gender socialization contributes to abusive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0886260511431432">O’Neil &amp; Harway, 1999</xref>). In addition, it is difficult to separate the impact of masculine gender socialization from the other predictors of intimate violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0886260511431432">Schwartz &amp; Waldo, 2004</xref>). In a review of adolescent dating violence prevention outcomes, studies concluded that there have been promising findings with regard to changing attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs associated with intimate violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260511431432">Avery-Leaf &amp; Cascardi, 2002</xref>). Beliefs and attitudes related to the justification of male violence against women have been identified as important risk factors for dating violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260511431432">Franchina, Eisler, &amp; Moore, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0886260511431432">Slep et al., 2001</xref>). This emphasizes the need for instruments that identify and illuminate these beliefs and attitudes. Most current popular measures of dating violence focus on actual abusive behavior but often fail to account for the attitudes or beliefs that contribute to or justify intimate violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0886260511431432">Schwartz, Hage, Bush, &amp; Burns, 2006</xref>).The DAI has the potential to address this issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0886260511431432">
<title>Current Instruments</title>
<p>The most common extant measures of intimate violence, such as the Conflict Tactics Scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0886260511431432">Straus, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0886260511431432">Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, &amp; Sugerman, 1996</xref>) and the Psychological Maltreatment of Women Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0886260511431432">Tolman, 1989</xref>), have been criticized for failing to identify the context of or precursors to violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260511431432">Borjesson, Aarons, &amp; Dunn, 2003</xref>). Thus it is unclear, for example, if violence occurred in a context of patriarchal gender oppression. Measures that focus on attitudes toward dating violence, such as the Attitudes Toward Interpersonal Violence Scale (AIV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0886260511431432">Slep et al., 2001</xref>), measure the extent to which respondents believe that physical aggression is justified. Other scales such as the Attitudes About Aggression in Dating Situations (AADS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0886260511431432">Slep et al., 2001</xref>), Attitude Toward Male Dating Violence Scale (AMDV; Price, Byers, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0886260511431432">the Dating Violence Research Team, 1999</xref>), and the Attitudes About Dating Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260511431432">Foo &amp; Margolin, 1995</xref>) assess how gender affects attitudes and perception of abusive behavior. None of these instruments are based on extant theory of how male socialization specifically contributes to dating violence. In examining this literature, there appears to be a need for an instrument that directly assesses specific masculine gender role ideological beliefs related to the primary theory of male violence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0886260511431432">
<title>Rationale for a New Scale</title>
<p>It is important to illuminate individual differences in the multiple predictive factors (e.g., gender role ideology, pathology, lack of interpersonal skills) related to intimate violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260511431432">Dutton, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260511431432">Gortner, Gollan, &amp; Jacobson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260511431432">Holtzworth-Munroe &amp; Stuart, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0886260511431432">Stuart, 2005</xref>). Although the relationship between masculine ideology and intimate violence is well supported (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260511431432">Coopenhaver, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0886260511431432">Schwartz et al., 2005</xref>), it has been correctly pointed out that not all men who endorse traditional masculine gender ideology commit intimate violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260511431432">Dutton, 1995</xref>). Therefore, it is important to increase our understanding of gender role ideological beliefs that support intimate violence. Furthermore, school- and community-based programs designed to prevent relationship violence in children and adolescents have grown significantly in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511431432">Avery-Leaf et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260511431432">Becky &amp; Farren, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260511431432">Foshee et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260511431432">Jaffe, Sudermann, Reitzel, &amp; Killip, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0886260511431432">Macgowan, 1997</xref>). Although initial evaluations of these programs show promising results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260511431432">Avery-Leaf &amp; Cascardi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0886260511431432">Wolfe &amp; Jaffe, 1999</xref>), there is considerable variability in the evaluation methods used. Popular measures of dating violence (e.g., Conflict Tactics Scale) have been criticized for failing to account for the context and consequences of intimate violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0886260511431432">Rathus &amp; Feindler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0886260511431432">Yllo, 1988</xref>)</p>
<p>Current debate on the relation of gender and perpetration of intimate violence has focused on the methods used to measure intimate violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260511431432">Hamby, 1996</xref>). It has been argued that current popular measures of intimate violence do not measure forms of abuse that include attempts to gain power and control over another person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260511431432">Johnson &amp; Ferraro, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0886260511431432">Kimmel, 2002</xref>); this type of abuse has been found to be more common in men than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260511431432">Johnson &amp; Ferraro, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0886260511431432">Lavoie, Robitaille, &amp; Herbert, 2000</xref>). Considering the myriad research that supports multidimensional causes of intimate violence, it appears more constructive to attempt to further understand the issues such as gender ideology that contribute to abusive behavior rather than to debate gender differences. Previous research has found specific gender role ideological beliefs that rationalize the endorsement of interpersonal violence against women. These beliefs based on male privilege and entitlement and the instrumental use of aggression to obtain dominance and control are directly related to intimate violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511431432">Burk, Burkhart, &amp; Sikorski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260511431432">Hamby, 1996</xref>). Thus, traditional masculine role norms (i.e., restrictive emotionality), may be differentiated from specific masculine ideology that rationalizes the abuse of women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511431432">Burk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0886260511431432">Mahalik et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>A new measure of specific masculine gender role ideological beliefs that justifies dating violence would serve multiple purposes: Primarily, it would assess the belief system in which dating violence occurs, that is, attitudes regarding rationalizing abusive behavior, dominance, and control in relationships based on masculine ideology. Measuring the beliefs and attitudes related to gender and intimate violence would assist in designing prevention strategies at multiple levels to change socialized beliefs related to intimate violence. In addition, it would target sexist and misogynistic beliefs in remedial work to deter further violence.</p>
<p>The DAI measures two conceptual areas (dominance and control and rationalization of abuse) that link masculine gender role ideology and intimate violence. These subscales are based on previous research and theory that suggest a link between masculine gender roles and intimate violence and suggest specific masculine gender role ideology rationalizes abusive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0886260511431432">Pence &amp; Paymer, 1993</xref>) and supports the use of abuse as a way to obtain power and control in relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511431432">Burk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260511431432">Hamby, 1996</xref>). For example, men are justified to be abusive as a way to assert their rightful dominance (power and control) over women. The DAI is designed to assess gender role ideology that supports the notion that men should be dominant and controlling in an intimate relationship with a woman and the rationalization of abuse based on traditional masculine gender role ideology.</p>

<title>Item Development</title>
<p>The initial pool of items was derived based on theory and research on masculine gender role socialization’s effect on intimate violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260511431432">Franchina et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0886260511431432">O’Neil &amp; Harway, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0886260511431432">Pence &amp; Paymer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0886260511431432">Schwartz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0886260511431432">Walker, 1984</xref>). Items were generated to tap two hypothesized factors of masculine gender role ideology related to dating violence: abuse rationalization and dominance and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511431432">Burk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260511431432">Hamby, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0886260511431432">Pence &amp; Paymer, 1993</xref>). Abuse rationalization refers to the endorsement of interpersonal violence against women based on male privilege and subsequent entitlement; dominance and control refers to gender role ideology that supports the instrumental use of aggression to obtain dominance and control. A team of three researchers generated an initial pool of 100 items based on these two factors. One team member was a counseling psychologist and the other team members were post-master’s level doctoral students.</p>
<p>Content validity was assessed by three expert raters. The raters were doctoral-level counseling psychologists who are experts in intimate violence and gender role ideology. The expert raters experience ranged from 20 to 30 years. The raters were asked to review the items for theoretical relevance and to identify items that were confusing, poorly worded, and redundant with other items. Feedback from the raters was used to reduce the scale to 38 items.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Research participants were 164 male college students ranging in age from 17 to 48, with a mean age of 22 (SD = 5.22). The majority of the sample was White (non-Hispanic, 61.6%; n = 101). Other racial groups represented included Black/African American (non-Hispanic, 25.6%; n = 42), Asian American/Pacific Islander (4.3%; n = 7), Latino/Hispanic (6.1%; n = 10), International Student (1.8%; n = 3), and Ethnicity/race not included (.6%; n = 1). The majority of participants reported that they were single (69.5%; n = 114); 15.2% (n = 25) reported they were partnered; 8.5% (n = 14) reported they were married; 4.3% (n = 7) reported they were separated/divorced; and 2.4 % (n = 4) reported they were remarried. There was no significant difference between the single participants and the married participants, t(126) = −3.80, p &gt; .705, therefore, we chose to include the 14 married participants.</p>

<title>Item Reduction and Internal Consistency</title>
<p>The goal of item analysis is to choose those items that relate best to the hypothesized construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511431432">Gorsuch, 1997</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260511431432">Gorsuch (1997)</xref>, using item-total correlations to evaluate items is a special case of factor analysis. Each item is correlated with the total score and then items with the highest item-total correlations are chosen as representative of the construct in question. Item reduction for the dominance/control and abuse rationalization scales were based primarily on analysis of each item’s contribution to internal consistency and the correlation of each item with the total score. A priori, it was decided that the final instrument should contain no more than 20 items (10 Dominance/Control items and 10 Rationalize Abuse items). It was felt that a 20-item scale would maximally combine reliability with ease of usage. When selecting the 10 items for each scale the following rules were used: (a) no item-total correlations on each subscale could be less than .40 for accepted items; (b) the items with the highest item-total correlations would be selected; and (c) if items chosen were redundant with each other, items with the highest item-total correlation would be retained, and items deleted would be replaced with items that had the next highest item-total correlation. Item-total correlations for the 10 Dominance/Control items ranged from .42 to .68 and for the 10 rationalize abuse items the range was .44 to .59. Item <italic>M</italic>s, <italic>SD</italic>s, and item-total correlations for the final 20 items are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260511431432">Table 1</xref>. Internal consistency of the DAI was found to be satisfactory for this sample. Internal consistency estimates are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886260511431432">Table 2</xref>. The final 20-item version of the DAI is presented in the appendix.</p>

<title>Study 2: Convergent and Discriminant Validity</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate initial construct validity of the DAI and its subscales and to obtain additional reliability data. Theoretically, the DAI is a measure of specific masculine role ideology that supports intimate violence, thus it should relate to the potential for intimate violence, dominance and control, and general masculine ideology. As we are attempting to measure a restrictive masculine ideology that proscribes sexist attitudes and behavior, we predicted it would negatively relate to self-esteem. Self-esteem was conceptualized as a positive orientation toward the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0886260511431432">Rosenberg, 1965</xref>). We hypothesized that the DAI and its subscales would be positively related to the propensity for abusiveness, masculine gender role stress and dominance, and negatively related to self-esteem.</p>
<p>Propensity for abusiveness is measured by the Propensity for Abusiveness Scale (PAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260511431432">Dutton, 1995</xref>) which was created to predict abusive behavior and minimize reactivity (social desirable responding). The PAS has been found to successfully differentiate between level of emotional and physical abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260511431432">Dutton, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511431432">Dutton, Landolt, Starzomski, &amp; Bodnarchuk, 2001</xref>). Thus, we predicted that there would be a positive relation between the DAI and the PAS, suggesting endorsement of masculine ideology supporting intimate violence is related to the propensity for abuse.</p>
<p>To measure an aspect of masculine ideology, the construct of masculine gender role stress was used. Masculine gender role stress is defined as the cognitive appraisal of stress in situations that lead to a perception of an inability to fulfill male roles or behavior that is not masculine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260511431432">Eisler, Skidmore, &amp; Ward, 1988</xref>). It has been posited that men who report high masculine gender role stress have increased anger in situations that require or involve behavior inconsistent with traditional male gender role norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260511431432">Eisler et al., 1988</xref>). Thus, we predicted that there would be a positive relation between the DAI and masculine gender role stress suggesting that the DAI is measuring masculine ideology that is related to anger in situations that lead to a perception of unmasculine behavior or identity.</p>
<p>Finally, to measure relational dominance, the Dominance Scale was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260511431432">Hamby, 1996</xref>). The Dominance Scale (DA) consists of three subscales: Authority which is a need to have power over one’s partner; Restrictiveness which is controlling and restricting behaviors of one’s partner; and Disparagement which is putting down a partner’s ability and efficacy. Therefore, we predicted that the Dominance scale would have a positive relationship with the DAI and dominant relational behavior, suggesting that gender role ideology that supports intimate violence is directly related to dominance in intimate relationships.</p>
<p>To support discriminant validity, we hypothesized that there would be no relation between the DAI and social desirability. Social desirability is used to identify individuals who tend to describe themselves in an overly positive light, especially in terms of what is considered socially acceptable.</p>

<title>The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE)</title>
<p>This scale is a 10-item Guttman self-report scale which measures self-esteem. Participants respond using a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0886260511431432">Rosenberg, 1965</xref>). After half of the negatively worded items are reverse scored, item responses are totaled. Higher scores on the measure indicate greater self-esteem. Adequate reliability for the Rosenberg RSE scores has been demonstrated and summarized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260511431432">Goldsmith (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260511431432">Crandall (1973)</xref>. Estimates of internal consistency reliability have ranged from .86 to .93 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260511431432">Goldsmith, 1986</xref>), and test-retest reliability over a 2-week period was .85 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260511431432">Crandall, 1973</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260511431432">Goldsmith (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0886260511431432">Rosenberg (1965</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0886260511431432">1979)</xref> reported that the RSE is “widely used as a research instrument and considered by most reviewers to be a valid measure of global self-esteem” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260511431432">Guindon, 2002</xref>, p. 210). The RSE has a Guttman scale coefficient of reproducibility of .92, indicating good internal consistency. The RSE has demonstrated validity correlating significantly with other self-esteem measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0886260511431432">Rosenberg, 1979</xref>). For the present study, internal consistency as measured by Cronbach’s alpha was .88.</p>

<title>The Masculine Gender Role Stress Scale (MGRSS)</title>
<p>This is a 40-item self-report scale designed to measure the amount of perceived stress men feel in situations that may challenge their masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260511431432">Eisler &amp; Skidmore, 1987</xref>). It is scored on a scale ranging from 0 (<italic>not at all stressful</italic>) to 5 (<italic>extremely stressful</italic>). Factor analysis identified five factors of the MGRSS: Physical Inadequacy, Emotional Inexpressiveness, Subordination to Women, Intellectual Inferiority, and Performance Failure. The Performance Failure subscale consists of two dimensions, one addressing inadequate work performance and the other addressing inadequate sexual performance. Support for the construct validity of the MGRSS has emerged from studies that report men who score significantly higher on the MGRSS and the five MGRSS factors than do women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260511431432">Eisler &amp; Skidmore, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0886260511431432">McCreary et al., 1996</xref>). Further evidence for validity has been found as scores on the MGRSS have positively related to anger and hostility and elevated cardiovascular reactivity to masculine role stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260511431432">Lash, Eisler, &amp; Schulman, 1990</xref>). Previous research has found high 2-week test-retest reliability (<italic>r</italic> = .93) and adequate internal consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0886260511431432">Skidmore, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0886260511431432">Thompson, 1991</xref>).

It is scored in a Likert scale ranging from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 4 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>) with higher scores indicating more dominant relational behavior. Factor analysis identified three factors of the DA: Authority (e.g., “Sometimes I have to remind my partner of who’s boss”), Restrictiveness (e.g., “I have a right to know everything my partner does”), and Disparagement (e.g., “My partner doesn’t have enough sense to make important decisions”). The validity of the DA was supported by positive correlations with physical abuse, injury, and psychological abuse. Previous research found adequate internal reliability with each subscale having a coefficient alpha above .72. For the present study, internal consistency for the total scale as measured by Cronbach’s alpha was .82.</p>

The PAS was created by a using previously created instruments that measure constructs related to abuse that have demonstrated low reactivity to social desirability. Thus, the PAS was constructed by using subscales of instruments that measure the following concepts: Borderline Personality (BPO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260511431432">Gunderson, 1984</xref>), Trauma (TSC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511431432">Briere &amp; Runtz, 1989</xref>), Recollection of Parent Rejection (EMBU; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260511431432">Gerslma, Emmelkamp, &amp; Arrindell, 1990</xref>), Attachment Orientation (RSQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511431432">Dutton, Saunders, Starzomski, &amp; Bartholomew, 1994</xref>), and Anger (MAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0886260511431432">Siegel, 1986</xref>). Evidence was found for the validity of the PAS in that it correctly classified 82% of men as one standard deviation above or below their partner’s report of their abusive behavior. In addition, the PAS has been correlated with reports of psychological and emotional abuse and threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511431432">Dutton et al., 2001</xref>).

<title>Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (SDS)</title>
<p>This scale was used to assess discriminant validity. The SDS is a 33-item self-report scale that uses a true/false format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511431432">Crowne &amp; Marlowe, 1960</xref>). The SDS has been used extensively to measure social desirability as a response tendency in studies that use self-report formats. The SDS is designed to identify individuals who describe themselves as possessing culturally sanctioned characteristics considered rare in the general population to obtain the approval of others. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260511431432">Crowne &amp; Marlowe, 1964</xref>). Studies have demonstrated that individuals with high scores in comparison with low scores are more likely to change their attitudes in response to social pressures, to cheat following a poor score on a test, and to express less aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260511431432">Crowne &amp; Marlowe, 1964</xref>). The SDS has been used extensively to measure social desirability as a response tendency in studies that use self-report formats. Internal consistency reliability was reported as a KR-20 coefficient of .88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260511431432">Crowne &amp; Marlowe, 1964</xref>). Test-retest reliability over a 1-month period was .88. For the present study, internal consistency as measured by Cronbach’s alpha was .67.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants (n = 216) were recruited from undergraduate and graduate psychology classes at a midsize Southern university. Each participant was given a research packet containing an informed consent form explaining the nature of the study, the 20-item DAI, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Inventory, the MGRSS, the Dominance Scale, the PAS, the SDS, and a demographic questionnaire. The instruments were counterbalanced to control for order effects. Again, to encourage a high response rate, participants were offered extracredit as an incentive for completing the research packet. Packets were distributed and immediately completed after class and then returned to the investigator.</p>

<title>Validity Analysis</title>
<p>To determine initial construct validity estimates for the 20-item DAI, correlations between the DAI, its subscales, and measures that relate to the hypothesized elements of the DAI were examined. The bivariate correlation coefficients between the DAI and the measures against which the DAI was validated are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260511431432">Table 3</xref>. As hypothesized, the RSE was significantly negatively related to the DAI total score (r = −.19, p &lt; .01), the Dominance/Control subscale (r = −.18, p &lt; .01), and the Rationalize Abuse subscale of the DAI (r = −.15, p &lt; .01). Although these are relatively small correlations, the finding do suggest that high scores on the DAI are negatively related to self-esteem supporting construct validity.</p>

<p>As hypothesized, the PAS was significantly positively related to the total score of the DAI (<italic>r</italic> = .26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and the Dominance/Control subscale of the DAI (<italic>r</italic> = .32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). These small to moderate findings suggest that propensity for abusiveness is positively related to the overall DAI and aspects of dominance and control supporting construct validity.</p>
<p>As hypothesized, the MGRSS was positively related to the total score of the DAI (<italic>r</italic> = .22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), the Rationalize Abuse subscale (<italic>r</italic> = .14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and the Dominance/Control subscale (<italic>r</italic> = .23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Contrary to our hypotheses, the Rationalize Abuse subscale does not significantly positively correlate with the PAS. However, as predicted, no relation existed between social desirability and the DAI providing support for discriminant validity. Internal consistency of the DAI was satisfactory for this sample. Internal consistency estimates are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886260511431432">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section27-0886260511431432">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Research participants were 37 male college students. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 22, with a mean age of 19 (SD = 1.14). The majority of the sample was White (non-Hispanic; 67.6%; n = 25). Other racial groups represented included Black/African American (non-Hispanic; 27%; n = 10), Asian American/Pacific Islander (2.7%; n = 1), and Latino/Hispanic (2.7%; n = 1). The majority of participants reported that they were single (94.6%; n = 35); one participant reported he was engaged; and one reported “other.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0886260511431432">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Dating attitudes were assessed using the 20-item DAI. Items were rated on a 5-point rating scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). A demographic questionnaire was used to gather demographic information such as gender, age, race and/or ethnic origin, marital status, and education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-0886260511431432">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were recruited from undergraduate psychology classes at a midsize Southern university. Participants were given a research packet containing an informed consent form explaining the nature of the study, the 20-item DAI and a demographic questionnaire. Participants who completed the research packet were asked if they would complete the 20-item DAI again in 2 weeks. Of the 45 participants that completed the research packet during the first administration, 37 of these participants completed the DAI 2 weeks later. Consistent with the two preceding studies, participants were offered extracredit as an incentive for completing the research packet. Packets were distributed and completed after class and then returned to the investigator.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section30-0886260511431432">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The internal consistency of the DAI was found to be satisfactory for both samples. In the first administration, internal consistency as measured by Cronbach’s alpha was .85 for the Dominance/Control subscale, .72 for Rationalize Abuse subscale, and .87 for the DAI Total Scale. Internal consistency estimates for the second administration was .87 for Dominance/Control subscale, .70 for Rationalize Abuse subscale, and .87 for the DAI total Scale. The DAI and its subscales were found to be stable over a 2-week period. The retest coefficients were .89 for Dominance/Control, .83 for Rationalize Abuse, and .94 for DAI total Scale. Reliability estimates and retest coefficients are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886260511431432">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Additional Analyses</title>
<sec id="section32-0886260511431432">
<title>Confirmatory Factor Analysis</title>
<p>As the DAI was a theoretically derived instrument with two hypothesized factors, Dominance/Control and Abuse Rationalization, we wanted to test whether a model consisting of these two factors represents the best fit of the data. A maximum likelihood confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the underlying factor structure of the DAI. The entire sample of 216 male participants from study two was used for this analysis.</p>
<p>We compared an oblique two-factor model and single-factor model with each other. An oblique model was chosen because the two hypothesized factors were found to be moderately highly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = 0.73). The single-factor model, a unidimensional model, was tested because the moderately high correlation provides some support for the possible existence of a unidimensional construct or one factor.</p>
<p>Mplus 6.1 ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0886260511431432">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998-2010</xref>) was used for all analyses. Models were run using aggregated variables within each factor. More than four or five items per factor and/or a large sample size can result in a poor fit due to the many parameters that must be estimated and the potential for high levels of random error. To adjust for these problems, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260511431432">Bagozzi and Heatherton (1994)</xref> recommended creating aggregated variables or item parcels within each factor. For this analysis, the 10 dominance/control items were randomly parsed into 3 variables (i.e., 4 items each in Variables 1 and 2, and 2 reverse scored items in Variable 3) and the 10 rationalize abuse items were randomly parsed into 3 variables (i.e., 3 reverse scored items in Variable 1, 4 items in Variable 2, and 3 items in Variable 3).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The models were compared using the chi-square goodness-of-fit test and several indices of fit that are used to supplement the chi-square test. The chi-square statistic was computed for each model and was found to be significant for both models. A significant chi-square statistic results in the rejection of the null hypothesis, which would suggest that the model being tested is not probable in the population. However, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0886260511431432">Quintana and Maxwell (1999)</xref>, the chi-square statistic is limited in that it does not test for a close enough fit and is overly restrictive in its evaluation.</p>
<p>To further evaluate the models tested, Standardized Root Mean Squared Residual (SRMR), Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA), and Comparative Fit Index (CFI) indices were computed. SRMR is an index of absolute fit that assess how well a model reproduces the sample data and estimates the amount of variance and covariance accounted for by the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260511431432">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1995</xref>). A smaller value (≤0.08) of SRMR indicates a better model fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260511431432">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>). RMSEA is an index of parsimonious fit that assess the overall discrepancy between the model-implied covariance matrix and sample covariance matrix while taking into account model’s simplicity. A smaller value (≤0.06) of RMSEA indicates a better model fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260511431432">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>). CFI is an index of incremental fit that assess the relative improvement of the model being tested with the baseline or null model ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260511431432">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260511431432">1999</xref>). A higher value (≥0.95) indicates a better model fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260511431432">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>). The results of the CFA for the aggregated items are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0886260511431432">Table 4</xref>. On the basis of the indices of fit, the oblique two-factor model seems to provide a much better fit of the data than the one-factor model. In addition, the χ<sup>2</sup> difference test (Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 41.66, <italic>df</italic> = 1) was found to be statistically significant at the alpha level = .01, implying that the oblique two-factor model is preferred over the one-factor model.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of the present study was to develop and investigate the psychometric properties of an instrument designed to measure specific masculine gender role ideological beliefs that have been shown to justify intimate violence in dating relationships. Initial construct validity and reliability of the DAI were supported. Evidence of convergent validity was supported by significant positive correlations between the DAI and measures of masculine gender role stress, propensity for abusiveness, and dominance. It is important to note, that the correlations with all of the instruments with the exception of the Dominance Scale were small to moderate. Consistent with gender role ideology theory, two subscales were retained: Dominance/Control and Abuse Rationalization. The DAI was created to provide a viable measure of masculine gender role ideology that has been shown to specifically relate to intimate violence. Extant measures of intimate violence focus on either general attitudes or specific behaviors but often fail to link intimate violence to specific causative factors. The DAI was developed to link the two, specifically gender role ideological beliefs and intimate violence.</p>
<p>Of particular importance to the validation of the DAI was the significant positive relationship with scales measuring propensity for abuse and dominant relational behavior. The Propensity for Abuse Scale has been found to reliably identify individuals who perpetrate intimate violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260511431432">Dutton, 1995</xref>), suggesting that the DAI is tapping into attitudes that lead to abusive behavior. The strong positive relationship between the DAI and a measure of dominant relational behavior suggests that the DAI is a valid measure of dominant relational behavior. However, it differs from DA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260511431432">Hamby, 1996</xref>) by measuring masculine gender ideology that supports dominant and controlling relational behavior. It is important to note that although a strong relationship existed between the DAI and dominance (<italic>r</italic> = .54), the two constructs are empirically distinguishable from one another. DA has been related to intimate violence including psychological and physical abuse further supporting the link between the DAI and intimate violence. Overall, the DAI was positively related to propensity of abusiveness and dominance in relationships supporting convergent validity and suggesting that the DAI is tapping into abusively dominant relationship behavior and propensity to abuse a partner.</p>
<p>In addition, further supporting the validity of the DAI is the significant positive relationship with the MGRSS. It is important to note that the correlations between the DAI and MGRSS are significant but small to moderate correlations and thus the implications made from these results are tentative. Although since we only intended to measure specific masculine ideology that supports dating violence, the size of the correlations is not surprising. This finding supports the theoretical rationale that adherence to strict gender role ideology is related to rationalization of intimate violence and dominance and control. The results of the validity study indicate that the overall MGRSS and the MRGSS subscales measuring masculine gender role stress stemming from situations related to emotional inexpression, physical inadequacy and subordination to women are related to the DAI. This is consistent with previous research which found gender role stress to be related to controlling behavior and endorsement of physical and psychological abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260511431432">Franchina et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260511431432">Mahalik et al., 2005</xref>). It appears that men who feel threatened over lack of physical adequacy and/or losing control to women or over their emotions relate to endorsement of abusive ideology.</p>
<p>Overall, the DAI may represent an improvement over current instruments by providing the ideological gender role attitudes and beliefs that contribute to dating violence. Also, it may allow researchers and practitioners to identify precursors to intimate violence and to plan and implement effective prevention interventions. The evidence for concurrent validity suggests that the attitudes and beliefs measured by the DAI are related to the perpetration of physical and psychological abuse as well as to an extant measure of masculine ideology. Thus, the DAI demonstrates promise in identifying specific masculine ideological beliefs that directly relate to intimate violence.</p>
<sec id="section35-0886260511431432">
<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>The results of this study should be understood in the context of its limitations. The primary limitation of this study is the generalizability of the results. The participants were primarily White college students from a southern public university. Caution should be exercised when generalizing these results to other populations. In particular, the experiences of college-aged students with intimate violence may significant differ from adult men. Specifically, utilization of the DAI for the prevention or treatment of abusive men should be made cautiously before the DAI scale can be replicated with a clinical sample.</p>
<p>Future research should examine the ability of the DAI to identify a subset of abusive men whose behaviors are directly related to gender ideological beliefs. Previous research has found typologies of abusive men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260511431432">Holtzworth-Munroe &amp; Stuart, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260511431432">Dutton &amp; Starzomski, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260511431432">1994</xref>). The DAI may assist researchers in identifying a subset of men whose behavior is strongly related to endorsement of specific gender role ideology related to intimate violence. In addition, future research could use the DAI to assist in understanding multiple causative factors in abusive behavior. Increasing our understanding of the multidimensional predictors of intimate violence allows for the eventual design and validation of multidimensional treatment approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0886260511431432">Stuart, 2005</xref>). In addition, primary prevention could be conducted to specifically challenge those beliefs. Furthermore future research could assess if the results of the DAI could identify those at risk for perpetration of intimate violence. There is evidence that perpetration of intimate violence is often underreported, particularly by men, suggesting that attitudes that support intimate violence may be an important target to facilitate prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0886260511431432">Pederson &amp; Thomas, 1992</xref>). Finally, future research could assess if the DAI could be used in the treatment of abusive men to assist in choosing specific and effective interventions. Research suggests that there are multiple predictors of partner violence and one treatment may not be effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0886260511431432">Stuart, 2005</xref>). The DAI could assist us in understanding the most effective approach for men in treatment. Further replication and validation of the DAI is needed to establish it as an important instrument in the field of intimate violence.</p>
