<sec id="section1-1071100712466850">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Symptomatic gutter impingement after ankle arthroplasty has been reported with various designs. However, the incidence and origin of impingement have not been fully elucidated. Furthermore, the outcome of patients following gutter debridement has not been reported.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712466850">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A review of 489 total ankle replacements was performed to calculate the incidence of symptomatic gutter impingement in 4 different devices and between the presenting causes of arthritis. The incidence of gutter impingement was determined for patients with and without preemptive gutter resection at the time of implantation. The functional outcome of 30 of the 34 patients who had subsequent gutter debridement was determined with 3 different outcome instruments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712466850">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Symptomatic gutter disease occurred in 34 of 489 cases (7%) followed for a minimum of 1 year (range, 1-12 years). There was a 2% incidence of gutter disease in the 194 ankles that had prophylactic gutter resection at the time of implantation and a 7% incidence in the 295 ankles that did not have gutter resection at the time of implantation. When the ankle treated with an Agility (DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc, Warsaw, IN) device was excluded, there was a 2% and an 18% incidence of gutter disease in the 2 groups, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). There was no difference in the incidence of gutter disease between the various implants and origins of ankle arthritis. Postoperative outcomes were favorable in the 27 patients who did not have another procedure after the initial gutter debridement. Seven patients (21%) required reoperation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1071100712466850">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Prophylactic gutter resection should be considered at the time of implantation to reduce the incidence of postoperative symptoms. Although most patients had favorable outcomes following gutter debridement, there was a high reoperation rate.</p>

<p>Total ankle replacement has become a viable alternative to ankle fusion in the operative treatment of end-stage ankle arthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712466850">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1071100712466850">22</xref></sup> By design, the talomalleolar facets involved in the degenerative process are not fully replaced or resected during total ankle arthroplasty. Accordingly, these areas are prone to osteophytic or soft tissue impingement and may be a source of pain after surgery. Symptomatic gutter impingement after total ankle arthroplasty has been reported with various total ankle designs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712466850">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712466850">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712466850">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712466850">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712466850"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712466850">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712466850">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1071100712466850">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1071100712466850">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1071100712466850">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1071100712466850">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1071100712466850">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1071100712466850">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1071100712466850">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1071100712466850">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1071100712466850">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1071100712466850">41</xref></sup> The exact cause of impingement has not been fully elucidated but appears to be multifactorial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712466850">14</xref></sup> Possible inciting factors include prosthesis design,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712466850">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712466850">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712466850">19</xref></sup> oversized tibial and talar components,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100712466850">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1071100712466850">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1071100712466850">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1071100712466850">42</xref></sup> undersized talar component,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712466850">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712466850">11</xref></sup> uncontrolled varus or valgus thrust,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712466850">7</xref></sup> component loosening,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1071100712466850">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1071100712466850">42</xref></sup> residual gutter debris after total ankle replacement,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712466850">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712466850">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100712466850">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712466850">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1071100712466850">39</xref></sup> undersized polyethylene thickness, and talar subsidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712466850">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712466850">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>None of the ankle replacement systems currently available in the United States advocate prophylactic gutter resection as a component of the primary procedure. In fact, analysis of the product literature and published operative technique manuals highlights the importance of malleolar preservation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1071100712466850">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1071100712466850">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1071100712466850"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1071100712466850">35</xref></sup> The contribution of unaltered malleolar anatomy to the incidence of symptomatic gutter impingement is unknown. Given the incomplete coverage of the talomalleolar facets by the available implants and the relatively high incidence of impingement, this cause and effect relationship needs to be explored.</p>
<p>Secondary operative revision for gutter impingement has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712466850">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712466850">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712466850"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712466850">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712466850">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712466850">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1071100712466850">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1071100712466850">30</xref></sup> The described operative technique has included both arthroscopic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712466850">13</xref></sup> and open arthrotomy techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712466850">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712466850">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712466850">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712466850">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1071100712466850">25</xref></sup> Yet, the results of operative treatment of gutter impingement are limited. The purpose of this investigation was to report the incidence of gutter impingement in a large series of total ankle replacements with 4 different designs. A detailed analysis of the pathological factors and possible confounding variables were explored to determine whether the incidence of gutter impingement with total ankle replacement might be reduced. The functional results of gutter debridement after implant arthroplasty were analyzed.</p>
<sec id="section6-1071100712466850" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>An institutional review board exemption was granted for this study. Prospective data were collected on 517 consecutive primary ankle replacement surgeries performed by a single surgeon (JMS) on 501 patients between February 2000 and June 2011. This case series consisted of 168 Agility (DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc, Warsaw, IN) replacements (161 patients), 81 Inbone (Wright Medical Technology, Inc, Arlington, TN) replacements (78 patients), 131 Salto-Talaris (Tornier N.V. Amsterdam, The Netherlands) replacements (128 patients), and 137 STAR (Small Bone Innovations, Inc, Morrisville, PA) replacements (134 patients). Twenty-three patients (28 total ankle replacements) were unable to be contacted because they died (3 patients: 2 Agility, 1 Salto-Talaris), left the health plan (11 patients: 5 Agility, 3 Salto-Talaris, 5 Inbone), or otherwise were lost to follow-up (9 patients: 5 Agility, 2 Inbone, and 2 Salto-Talaris). Only patients who were followed for a minimum of 1 year were included in the study, which left 489 replacements on 478 patients for this investigation. These were categorically separated into 153 Agility replacements (150 patients), 75 Inbone replacements (73 patients), 124 Salto-Talaris replacements (121 patients), and 137 S.T.A.R replacements (134 patients).</p>
<p>To calculate the true incidence of symptomatic gutter impingement, prospective surveillance was conducted of all patients throughout the study period for a minimum of 1 year after implant arthroplasty. The entire case series was divided into those who had prophylactic gutter resection (PGR) at the time of the index operation and those who did not have any operative manipulation of the gutters as part of the implantation. Patients were considered to have symptomatic impingement only if they had a secondary gutter resection (SGR) to decompress or widen 1 or both gutters. The percentage of patients who had gutter impingement was calculated for the 2 groups (prophylactic gutter resection vs standard implantation) for each implant.</p>
<p>The cause of the end-stage arthritis that prompted the total ankle replacement was prospectively recorded. Specific origins of the patientsâ arthritis were categorized into posttraumatic arthritis (PTA), idiopathic degenerative joint disease, instability with repetitive injury (varus or valgus), inflammatory, and other. The latter category consisted of patients with neuromuscular diseases, clubfoot, or focal avascular necrosis. The incidence of PGR and SGR was determined in each category to see whether there was any correlation to the incidence of gutter impingement.</p>
<p>Those who had subsequent operative debridement of 1 or both gutters were evaluated independently. Data from the medical charts of these patients were prospectively recorded. Demographic data were collected including patient age and sex, age at time of implant arthroplasty, prosthesis type, the time to gutter debridement, and operative technique (arthroscopic or open). Additionally, the location (medial, lateral or both gutters) and quality of preoperative symptoms were identified.</p>
<p>To evaluate clinical outcomes following secondary gutter debridement, 3 evaluations were administered by the surgeon of record as part of the routine yearly review of each ankle arthroplasty. These instruments were the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle score,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712466850">10</xref></sup> the Buechel-Pappas (BP) ankle score,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712466850">2</xref></sup> and a questionnaire compiled by the authors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712466850">Figure 1</xref>). The evaluation tools were administered from July 2010 through May 2012. The questionnaire included a modified visual analog scale (VAS) that was administered in person or sent to the patient via fax or US mail when the patient was not physically evaluated during the stated interval. The minimum follow-up after secondary gutter debridement was 12 months (range, 12-61 months).</p>

<p>Pre- and postoperative radiographs of the patients who had gutter resection were evaluated for definitive evidence of gutter resection and maintenance of patent gutters during the follow-up period. The final postoperative radiograph was compared with the respective postoperative scores to determine whether there was any correlation of the extent and patency of gutter resection with the clinical scores.</p>
<p>For nonparametric data, statistical significance was determined using the Mann-Whitney U test. Differences were considered to be statistically significant at a level of <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
<sec id="section7-1071100712466850">
<title>Operative Technique</title>
<p>Debridement of the gutters was performed with either an arthroscopic or an open approach. The choice of technique was primarily surgeon preference, but more recently all procedures had been done in an open fashion. For the arthroscopic approach, the ankle joint was approached via standard anteromedial and anterolateral portals. For the open technique, a linear vertical incision was made directly over the affected gutter. The affected gutters were then debrided of all osseous and soft tissue sources of impingement using power or hand instruments. A satisfactory debridement occurred when a 4.0-mm burr could be freely passed through the newly created corridor. Fluoroscopic imaging was used to confirm the adequacy of resection of the affected gutters. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712466850">Figure 2</xref> demonstrates a typical sequence of intraoperative maneuvers. After each operation, the affected extremity was placed in a posterior sugar tong splint. Protected weight-bearing in a removable boot was allowed after the first postoperative visit, which was between 10 and 14 days. Patients were encouraged to transition to a regular shoe and regular activity as soon as possible thereafter.</p>

<p>Collectively, there was a 7% (31/295) incidence of secondary gutter resection in the patients who did not have any manipulation of the gutters at the time of implantation. Only 2% (3/194) of the ankles that had PGR at the time of implantation required SGR in the follow-up period (<italic>P</italic> = .04). However, when the incidence of symptomatic gutter impingement is calculated with exclusion of those patients with the Agility implant, 9% (29 of 336) of the patients required SGR. Of these 336 patients there was a 2% (3/194) incidence of SGR when there was PGR at the time of implantation and an 18% (26/142) incidence of SGR when the gutters were not manipulated preemptively (<italic>P</italic> = .01).</p>
<p>The incidence of ankles that had a SGR for each of the respective implants can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712466850">Table 1</xref>. When the incidence of SGR is analyzed for each of the respective implants, there were 5 of 153 (3%) patients with the Agility ankle who had a subsequent gutter debridement, but none of them had prophylactic gutter resection as part of the total ankle arthroplasty procedure. However in the entire series of Agility cases, there was resection of the articular facets of both malleoli as part of the recommended technique. One of the 31 Inbone ankles that had PGR required a SGR (3%). Seven of the 44 ankles that did not have PGR required a SGR (16%) (<italic>P</italic> = .2). Of the 124 cases that had the Salto-Talaris implant, 63 had PGR of 1 or both gutters as part of the original implantation. Only 1 of these ankles went on to a SGR (2%). Most of these 63 cases with PGR were later in the study period as there was empirical evidence of postoperative gutter symptoms by patients implanted earlier in the series. Of the 61 Salto-Talaris cases that did not have PGR at the time of implantation, 14 went on to require debridement of the gutters (23%) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04). One of the 100 S.T.A.R ankles that had a PGR later required a SGR (1%). Five of the remaining 37 ankles without PGR had a secondary procedure (14%) (<italic>P</italic> = .15).</p>
<p>The average interval between implant placement and gutter debridement was 17 months (range, 5-52 months). The interval of time between original implantation and gutter debridement for each implant varied. For the Agility, the average interval was 31 months (range, 23-52 months), for the Salto-Talaris 17 months (range, 5-44 months), for the Inbone 19 months (range, 5 to 60 months), and for the STAR 11 months (range, 3-25 months).</p>
<p>Two-hundred ten of the entire study group of 478 patients (43%; 210 ankles) had an initial diagnosis of PTA at the time of implantation. There were 68 patients (14%; 75 ankles) with degenerative joint disease, 78 patients (16%; 78 ankles) with instability, 65 patients (14%; 69 ankles) with inflammatory arthritis, and 57 patients (12%; 57 ankles) with other diagnoses. With the numbers available, there were no statistically significant differences with regard to the distribution of the diagnoses between the various implants.</p>
<p>In the group of patients who had SGR, the distribution of diagnoses can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1071100712466850">Figure 3</xref>. There were no significant differences in the distribution of diagnoses between those patients with SGR and the rest of the study group. As well, there were no significant differences among the specific diagnoses with regard to the incidence of SGR. When the time from implant to SGR was determined for each specific diagnosis, no patterns could be detected. In the patients with PTA (43%), the average time from implant to SGR was 20 months (range, 5-42 months). In those patients with degenerative joint disease (15%), the mean interval from implant to SGR was 13 months (range, 4-44 months). In the patients with instability, inflammatory arthritis, and other diagnoses, the mean interval was 16 (range, 3-31), 10 (range, 4-17), and 13 (range, 6-26) months, respectively.</p>

<p>Patients reported symptoms of pain over 1 or both gutters that were distinctly different than their symptoms before implantation. All patients reported that the symptoms were worsened by activity and relieved by rest. Physical examination was consistent with point tenderness to palpation over the affected gutters.</p>
<p>The patients (n = 30; 4 patients did not meet the 12-month follow-up criterion) who only had 1 gutter debridement procedure all reported subjective pain reduction of their preoperative symptoms at final clinical follow-up. The average AOFAS ankle score was 77 (range, 42-96), and the average BP ankle score was 81 (range, 53-95). On the postoperative subjective questionnaire, all patients reported a distinct and immediate difference in their symptoms following gutter debridement. Twenty-five of the 30 patients (83%) would have the debridement operation again, and 5 of 30 (17%) would not have the procedure again. These 5 patients all went on to another procedure after the gutter debridement. Nine of 30 patients (30%) had no recurrence of pain. Of the 21 patients who answered âyesâ to persistent pain in the ankle, the average level was 3.5 (range, 2-6) on the VAS pain score. Twelve patients (40%) reported no limitations. There were 18 patients (60%) who reported persistent limitations after gutter debridement, with difficulty on uneven surfaces and stairs as the most prevalent response. However, 10 of them had subtalar joint fusions. Overall, 8 of 30 (27%) reported excellent outcomes, 13 of 30 (44%) reported good outcomes, 7 of 30 (24%) reported fair outcomes, and 2 of 30 (5%) had poor outcomes.</p>
<p>Seven of all 34 patients (21%) had additional surgery related to the ankle replacement after SGR (3 had repeat debridement, 3 had formal component revision, and 1 had a subtalar fusion revision). The 3 patients with repeat debridements had their second SGR at 5, 15, and 32 months later, respectively. One patient was noted to have had a loose talar component during the open gutter debridement. This patient and 2 others went on to formal revision surgery of the components. Another patient had modest relief after gutter debridement and was later discovered to have a nonunion of the subtalar joint fusion. The 7 patients who had a subsequent operative procedure after the initial gutter surgery generally had lower scores than the cohort with a single debridement. Two of the 3 patients with repeat gutter debridement rated their outcome as fair or poor and the other rated the outcome as good: average AOFAS ankle score 67 (range, 42-87) and BP score 73 (range, 53-88). The average scores of the other 4 patients with formal revisions were 70 (range, 63-73) for the AOFAS and 75 (range, 65-84) for the BP scales. These 4 patients had difficulty on hills and uneven ground but also had fusion of the subtalar joint. Six of the 7 patients reported residual ankle pain with average pain scale rating of 3 of 10 (range, 0-5) on the modified VAS pain scale.</p>
<p>Correlative analysis of postoperative radiographs of those patients who had SGR to the clinical outcome scores was difficult because of inconsistent positioning of the ankle at the time of exposure. However, in order to assess gutter patency after SGR, all patients were evaluated fluoroscopically as part of the routine postoperative protocol. In all cases, the intraoperative postdebridement fluoroscopic images demonstrated clear evidence of bone resection at the affected gutters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712466850">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712466850">E</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712466850">G</xref>). There was little correlation with clinical scores and patency of gutter at the time of final analysis except in the 3 patients with recurrent bone formation who required a second debridement. As expected, the outcomes in these 3 patients were lower. Additionally, the fluoroscopic images were not weight-bearing and may have affected the overall assessment of the adequacy of resection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this investigation confirm that gutter impingement is a relatively common sequelae of total ankle replacement. Despite the commonality of the condition, there is inconsistent reporting and classification of the condition. In the Harborview series on Agility complications, the authors noted gutter impingement requiring debridement as their most common complication at 18.9%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1071100712466850">27</xref></sup> Conversely, Glazebrook and associates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712466850">4</xref></sup> conducted an evidence-based analysis of complications but did not specifically recognize gutter impingement as a complication. In another report on total ankle replacement complications, Krause and associates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712466850">12</xref></sup> acknowledged gutter impingement as a complication but classified it as a technical error that required reoperation in 15% of the cases in their series. Although we did not consider gutter impingement as a technical error, there was a 7% reoperation rate for all ankles. When the Agility patients were excluded, there was an 18% reoperation rate when the gutters were not preemptively widened. Similarly in our series, 4 patients required component revision because the diagnosis was unmasked after SGR. These discrepancies may be indicative of the complexity of the genesis of gutter impingement and overlapping complicating factors that can cause classification ambiguity and potential underreporting.</p>
<p>The emergence of symptomatic gutter impingement can occur at various intervals following implantation. In part this may be explained by the specific prosthesis design. In the case of the Agility implant, subsidence of the talar component and premature polywear was common.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712466850">11</xref></sup> As these processes progressed, the undersides of the tibial component columns would encroach upon the underlying native talar bone. This exposes the remaining talomalleolar articular surfaces and talar bone mass to increasing axial loads and further degeneration and gutter-component impingement. The insidious development of this process may explain the rather long interval between implantation and the emergence of gutter symptoms in the Agility implant. Last, the effect of syndesmotic fusion on the occurrence of gutter disease is unknown.</p>
<p>The average interval in the Agility was 31 months, whereas in the Inbone, Salto-Talaris, and STAR systems the symptoms occurred closer to implantation, with average intervals from implantation to symptoms of 19, 17, and 10 months, respectively. The low incidence of talar subsidence with these other 3 implants further supports this concept.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1071100712466850">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1071100712466850">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1071100712466850">40</xref></sup> In all of the implants over time, with significant thinning of the polyethylene component from wear, there may be an increased incidence of gutter impingement as the talus and talar component further recede into the mortise. This may occur in the form of boneâimplant or talomalleolar impingement. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1071100712466850">Figure 4</xref> depicts various morphological features of gutter impingement in the specific implants.</p>

<p>In 2 of the total ankle replacement systems (Salto-Talaris and STAR), the sides of the talus are partially resurfaced at the superior aspect. This places a cobaltâchrome component surface against an often degenerative malleolar cartilage surface. Furthermore, there may also be talomalleolar impingement of the remaining native bone distal to the actual sides of the talar component. Interestingly, none of the technique guides for any of the available implant systems recommend any resection of bone either at or distal to the footprint of the talar component. In our series, there was a distinct decrease in the incidence of gutter impingement when there was preemptive resection of bone during the original implantation procedure. In particular, only 1 of the patients with an Inbone prosthesis who had prophylactic gutter resection required an additional gutter resection. Seven of 44 patients (16 %) with an Inbone implant without preemptive gutter resection went on to have a later gutter resection. Fourteen of the 15 Salto-Talaris patients who had subsequent gutter debridement did not have any additional bone resected from either the malleoli or talus. These 14 cases were from the group of 61 cases that did not have prophylactic gutter resection (23%). All 3 of the STAR implant cases of post-implantation gutter debridement were from the group of 34 cases that did not have gutter debridement at the time of implantation (9%). Collectively, excluding the patients with the Agility implant, 18% of the patients without PGR had an SGR compared with only 2% who did not have PGR. This evidence suggests that preemptive gutter resection at the time of implant deserves strong consideration.</p>
<p>The disparity in the frequency of gutter impingement between implants is most likely not due to implant design, for several reasons. First, the selection of implants was based on availability in the United States at the time of surgery. In effect, the series of Agility implants was done first, followed by the Inbone, Salto-Talaris, and STAR, respectively, over the duration of the study. Accordingly, this sequential use of the specific implants provided for a longer period of follow-up for those implant brands done earlier in the study. Perhaps a higher percentage of symptomatic gutter impingement would be realized in the patients implanted later in the study period if followed longer. A second factor was a more frequent use of the Inbone prosthesis with frontal plane deformity. It has been shown that prophylactic resection of the gutters at the time of implantation is usually required for correction of large frontal deformities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100712466850">21</xref></sup> However, we do not believe that the success rate for correction of frontal plane deformity is implant-dependent. At the time of the Inbone series, we believed that it was better suited than the Agility prosthesis for this purpose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712466850">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although it is clear that gutter impingement can cause symptoms in the otherwise successful ankle replacement, the true incidence is probably higher primarily because we included only patients who had subsequent gutter debridement. Yet, empirically there were many patients in this series who had residual symptoms after implantation with equivocal radiographic impingement. These symptoms were often obtuse and without clear clinical indications; those patients were not offered decompression. Conversely, the presence of clear radiographic gutter impingement does not universally correlate with residual postoperative complaints. In 3 of the patients in this series, ultimate relief of symptoms was not realized until additional procedures unrelated to the gutters were performed. These situations highlight the observation that radiographic determination of true gutter impingement is often obscure, subjective, and difficult to correlate with clinical examination. More definitive criteria are necessary to provide surgeons with guidelines to reduce the incidence of impingement including the establishment of intraoperative maneuvers that can be used to this end.</p>
<p>Intuitively, one might expect a higher incidence of gutter-related complications in those patients with PTA because of the high incidence of heterotopic bone following injury. Yet there was no difference in the incidence of symptomatic gutter impingement across all diagnoses in the entire series. Moreover, there was no difference in the distribution of the specific diagnoses when comparing those patients who had SGR (n = 34) with the entire group of 478 patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1071100712466850">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1071100712466850">4</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the functional results of gutter decompression have not been studied. Twenty-three of the 30 patients who were followed for more than a year were reasonably satisfied with the results of the gutter debridement. These 23 patients would have had the surgery again, and they reported no pain at the time of final follow-up related to the SGR procedure. The other 7 had additional surgery after gutter debridement. In 3 of these patients, a repeat gutter decompression was performed. Although not a formal part of this investigation, we determined that all 3 patients were satisfied after the second procedure. However, in the remaining 4 patients, a different diagnosis evolved in the course of treatment, including nonunion of the subtalar joint, a loose talar component, and varus thrust (in 2 patients). Although there was clear radiographic and clinical evidence of gutter impingement prior to gutter debridement, the postoperative scores were compromised as expected primarily because additional problems became unmasked. These cases underscore the difficulty in sorting out residual symptoms after ankle arthroplasty. Other confounding variables include postoperative heterotopic bone formation, bone on bone versus metal on bone, component subsidence, and oversizing of the talar component.</p>
<sec id="section10-1071100712466850">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>One of the limitations of this study was that the outcomes instruments were administered at variable intervals after surgery. Although this extended the period of follow-up, some of the answers were reliant on the patientsâ memory. These outcome instruments were administered by the surgeon of record, and thus the scores may have been inflated. Furthermore, the incidence of gutter impingement was calculated by including only those patients who had subsequent surgery. There were probably more patients who had symptoms related to gutter disease but may have responded to nonoperative measures or chose to forego surgery. Accordingly, the incidence of gutter impingement following total ankle arthroplasty is probably higher than reported herein. We were not able to determine the impact of component positioning and sizing on the incidence of this entity or the impact of preemptive gutter resection on the final position of the implants or clinical outcome. Perhaps a more tightly controlled comparative investigation in the future will be able to determine the direct effects of preemptive gutter decompression.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this is the first report of the relative incidence of gutter impingement in 4 implant systems. The results have provided a better understanding of gutter disease and causative factors. Since most cases of end-stage ankle arthritis are posttraumatic, gutter disease often prevails at the time of joint replacement. As such, the talomalleolar joints should not be expected to carry any axial loads, and frontal plane thrust should be neutralized. We believe that preemptive measures should be initiated when performing total ankle replacement to reduce the incidence of symptomatic impingement. Specifically, operative decompression and widening of both gutters will eliminate accumulated debris, osteophytes, and/or loose bodies. Future longitudinal investigations need to provide more accurate analysis of gutter-related abnormalities.</p>
