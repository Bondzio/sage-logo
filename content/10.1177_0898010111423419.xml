<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> This study examined the effect of peppermint spirits on postoperative nausea in women following a scheduled C-section. <bold>Design:</bold> A pretest-posttest research design with three groups was used. The peppermint group inhaled peppermint spirits, the placebo aromatherapy control group inhaled an inert placebo, green-colored sterile water, and the standard antiemetic therapy control group received standard antiemetics, usually intravenous ondansetron or promethazine suppositories. <bold>Methods:</bold> Women were randomly assigned to a group on admission to the hospital. If they became nauseated, nurses on the mother-baby unit assessed their nausea (baseline), administered the assigned intervention, and then reassessed participants' nausea 2 and 5 minutes after the initial intervention. Participants rated their nausea using a 6-point nausea scale. <bold>Findings:</bold> Thirty-five participants became nauseated post-operatively. Participants in all three intervention groups had similar levels of nausea at baseline. The nausea levels of participants in the peppermint spirits group were significantly lower than those of participants in the other two groups 2 and 5 minutes after the initial intervention. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Peppermint spirits may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of postoperative nausea. This study should be replicated with more participants, using a variety of aromatherapies to treat nausea in participants with different preoperative diagnoses.</p>

<body>
<p>Women often experience the discomfort of nausea during the postoperative period following a cesarean section (C-section). Vagal or sympathetic stimuli, severe pain, visceral trauma, medications, and anesthesia can stimulate receptors in the medulla resulting in postoperative nausea and vomiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898010111423419">McCance &amp; Huether, 2010</xref>). Nausea is frequently treated with pharmacologic therapies to improve patient comfort and decrease the incidence of vomiting, which may place stress on the surgical wound. Standard drug therapies for nausea can be problematic in postpartum women because they can result in sedation, which can interfere with breast feeding or may not be effective in short-term nausea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010111423419">Karch, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical treatments are often associated with unpleasant side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898010111423419">Springhouse, 2003</xref>). Peppermint aromatherapy provides a potential alternative therapy for management of nausea without the side effects of sedation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0898010111423419">Springhouse, 2005</xref>). However, lack of research on aromatherapy and essential oils has been a barrier to their use in the hospital environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0898010111423419">Stevensen, 2001</xref>). Peppermint oil, like a variety of natural remedies, has not been adequately studied using large randomized controlled trials. Two challenges of studying herbs using the medical model are that herbal preparations typically contain a variety of ingredients making them more difficult to study compared with singular ingredients and that herbs are not usually financially appealing to drug companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010111423419">Freeman, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898010111423419">Springhouse, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898010111423419">Micozzi (2011)</xref> acknowledges the challenges of applying the biomedical model to explain alternative medicine. He suggests that the current biomedical paradigm will need to evolve in order to adequately study the effects of alternative medicine. In addition, the different methods and products that are used to administer aromatherapy in studies have made it difficult to conduct systematic reviews of the literature.</p>
<sec id="section1-0898010111423419">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Traditionally, in our community hospital promethazine (Phenergan) had been used intravenously to treat postoperative nausea. However, promethazine was removed from the hospital formulary for intravenous use due to concerns about phlebitis (D. Copelan, personal communication, December 1, 2009). This resulted in the use of ondansetron (Zofran) for the treatment of postoperative nausea. Zofran’s safety has not been established in breast-feeding women, it is not indicated in acute short-term nausea, and its effect can last up to 8 hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010111423419">Karch, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The lack of effective medications for short-term acute nausea that did not cause sedation or interfere with breast-feeding presented a challenge to the nurses on the postpartum unit; this resulted in a search for alternative ways to relieve nausea. A registered nurse on the postpartum unit who specializes in holistic therapies suggested that aromatherapy with peppermint spirits be explored as an alternative intervention that might quickly and safely relieve nausea without the side effects of sedation.</p>
<sec id="section2-0898010111423419">
<title>Significance</title>
<p>The problem addressed in this study is the lack of effective, economical, safe, and nonsedating therapeutic measures for nausea in women post C-section. This study is significant to holistic nursing because it evaluates the use of peppermint aromatherapy as an alternative therapy for the treatment of nausea without the side effects of traditional medications. Treatment of nausea takes on extra significance in women post C-section since its treatment with traditional pharmaceutical methods can cause sedation, which can interfere with breast-feeding and are often contraindicated in breast-feeding. The use of a natural product such as peppermint spirits also meets a growing consumer desire to use natural products that have potential to relieve unpleasant symptoms with fewer occurrences of side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898010111423419">Sierpina, Gerik, Miryala, &amp; Micozzi, 2011</xref>). A review of the literature revealed three studies that used peppermint oil aromatherapy for treating postoperative or intrapartum nausea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010111423419">Anderson &amp; Gross, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010111423419">Burns, Blamey, Ersser, Barnetson, &amp; Lloyd, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898010111423419">Tate, 1997</xref>). As cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010111423419">Buckle (2009)</xref>, there are three additional unpublished reports where Figuenick, Chalifour, and Piotrowski successfully used peppermint aromatherapy to relieve the nausea of 10 oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy, inpatients withdrawing from opiate and crack cocaine, and 17 hospitalized patients, respectively. No adverse treatment effects were reported for any of the participants in the studies by Anderson and Gross, Chalifour, Figuenick, Piotrowski, or Tate. Burns et al. were unable to determine whether the very minor complaints experienced by about 1% of the women in labor participating in their study were caused by the peppermint aromatherapy or by the labor and delivery (L&amp;D) itself.</p>

<title>Purpose</title>
<p>No studies were found that used a product described as peppermint spirits, which combines peppermint with an aromatic ethyl alcohol base. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of peppermint spirits aromatherapy on postoperative nausea in women following a scheduled C-section. A pretest–posttest research design with random assignment to three intervention groups was used. The three levels of the independent variable, intervention, were peppermint spirits aromatherapy, sterile water placebo aromatherapy, and standard antiemetic therapy. The dependent variable was nausea.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Peppermint (Mentha piperita) is an aromatic herb that is classified as a carminative that can relieve stomach and intestinal disorders and relieve nausea and vomiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010111423419">Fundukian, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0898010111423419">Sweetman, 2009</xref>). Peppermint is also commonly used as a flavoring in food, teas, lotions, and medications. The menthol in peppermint is thought to calm the stomach through relaxing the stomach muscle and acting as an anesthetic to the stomach wall, which decreases or reduces nausea and vomiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010111423419">Fundukian, 2009</xref>). Peppermint is also thought to have an emotional calming effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010111423419">Cassileth, 1998</xref>). In the Herbal Medicine Handbook, sedation is not listed as a property or side effect of peppermint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0898010111423419">Springhouse, 2005</xref>). Information on peppermint aromatherapy’s physiological effect to decrease nausea and vomiting is primarily historical and anecdotal. Peppermint is generally thought to be a relatively safe aromatic herb for treating gastrointestinal discomfort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010111423419">Ebadi, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010111423419">Buckle (2009</xref>, p. 402) asserts that “peppermint, spearmint, and ginger are the classic essential oils to inhale for nausea” and notes the effect from these oils is immediate if they are going to work. Since peppermint is not regulated as a drug by the FDA, scientific studies on pregnant and nursing women appear to be absent. A limited number of controlled studies have evaluated peppermint’s effect using the administration technique of aromatherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898010111423419">Springhouse, 2003</xref>). Buckle believes that, used correctly, essential oils are safe in pregnancy and asserts that both inhaled and topically applied essential oils are safer for pregnant women than the pesticides they ingest with their food. However, she asserts that undiluted essential oil of peppermint may cause respiratory distress in infants, so it should not be used near their nostrils.</p>
<p>Aromatherapy uses the essential oils of plants for therapeutic purposes. Aromatherapy can be divided into aesthetic, holistic, and clinical aromatherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010111423419">Harris, 2011</xref>). Clinical aromatherapy tends to be implemented by nurses, is episodic, and focuses on a specific discomfort. The essential oils affect the body–mind connection through interaction with the olfactory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010111423419">Harris, 2011</xref>). Aromatherapy is thought to have an emotional as well as a physiological effect, which further complicates evaluation of its impact. The aroma from the essential oil binds with the receptors in the nasal epithelium. The resulting neurochemical reaction is transmitted to the olfactory bulb in the brain, the limbic system, and the thalamus, which causes a release of endorphins and serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010111423419">Buckle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010111423419">Kuhn, 1999</xref>). Very small amounts of essential oils are needed due to the acuteness of the smell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010111423419">Buckle, 2009</xref>). Aromatherapy with peppermint is thought to be relatively safe although lacking substantial clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898010111423419">Ernst, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010111423419">Guba, n.d.</xref>).</p>
<p>Herbs that have been traditionally used without harm for minor discomforts have been commonly thought to have demonstrated safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010111423419">Ebadi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010111423419">Freeman, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898010111423419">Springhouse, 2003</xref>). As a result, most of the information on the actions and safety of herbs such as peppermint are primarily anecdotal. Less “causal” research methods should not be dismissed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898010111423419">Ives &amp; Jonas, 2011</xref>); however, this has resulted in difficulty when it comes to making guidelines for alternative medicines in the clinical setting.</p>
<p>The practitioner who administers essential oils should be aware of potential side effects such as allergies, photosensitivity, dermatitis, and mucous membrane irritation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010111423419">Harris, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010111423419">Kuhn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898010111423419">Springhouse, 2003</xref>). Individuals with lung conditions, asthma, or pregnancy should avoid inhalation of oils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010111423419">Kuhn, 1999</xref>). Also, peppermint should not be used in people with gallbladder disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0898010111423419">Springhouse, 2005</xref>). There is limited information on the safety of peppermint aromatherapy in pregnant or lactating women; however, for many years aromatherapy with essential oils has been used to treat nausea and other symptoms in these women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010111423419">Harris, 2011</xref>). It is generally thought that ingestion of peppermint in amounts usually found in food products or medications is generally safe for these women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898010111423419">National Institutes of Health, 2011</xref>). However, it should be noted that the level of evidence for recommendations and restrictions for peppermint and other essential oils requires further development.</p>
<p>Two of the three studies that examined the use of peppermint oil aromatherapy to treat postoperative/intrapartum nausea were conducted in different countries—two in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010111423419">Burns et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898010111423419">Tate, 1997</xref>) and one in the northeastern United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010111423419">Anderson &amp; Gross, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898010111423419">Tate (1997)</xref> compared the effect of no therapy, peppermint essence aromatherapy (the components of peppermint essence were not defined) that she defined as a placebo therapy, and peppermint oil aromatherapy in an experimental study of postoperative nausea in 18 gynecological patients, who were randomly assigned to one of the three groups. Although Tate reported that most patients “only inhaled from the bottle when feeling nauseous postoperatively” (p. 546), she did not report the specific breathing instructions given to study patients. Tate used a 5-point descriptive ordinal scale to measure nausea and assessed nausea levels every 4 hours. The scale ranged from 0 (I am not experiencing any nausea) to 4 (I am so nauseated I feel I am about to vomit). She found a significant difference in average per person per day levels of nausea between the experimental and placebo groups on the day of operation. No adverse effects were reported during this study. Subjective data and the decreased use of antiemetics in the experimental group suggested that the peppermint oil aromatherapy might be useful as a nausea treatment in women following a gynecological procedure.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010111423419">Burns et al. (2000)</xref> conducted an observational study comparing aromatherapy using one or more of 10 essential oils, including peppermint (Mentha piperita), by 8,058 women in labor to 15,700 women who were not given aromatherapy. Routine data that had been collected on women in labor who were seen between 1990 and 1998 were analyzed and compared with data on a comparison group of 15,799 women in labor obtained from a unit audit. Peppermint oil aromatherapy was used to treat nausea and/or vomiting in 1,104 of these women in labor. Forty-nine percent of these women rated the effectiveness of peppermint oil in reducing nausea and vomiting as helpful, 37% rated it as equivocal, and 14% rated it as not helpful. Only 1% of the 8,058 women who received aromatherapy reported any undesired associated effects. These effects were reported only for the total group of 8,058 women and included nausea (n = 60), itchy rash (n = 15), headache (n = 13), and rapid labor (n = 9). Since these were usually very minor symptoms that are often reported during labor, their actual causality is not known. There were no reports of adverse outcomes to the mother or baby associated with any essential oils aromatherapy used in this study. This study demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of aromatherapy and its integration into midwifery practice at a maternity unit in Oxford, United Kingdom.</p>
<p>In a randomized controlled trial, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010111423419">Anderson and Gross (2004)</xref> compared the effect of aromatherapy using peppermint oil (n = 10), isopropyl alcohol (n = 11), and placebo isotonic saline (n = 12) on nausea in 33 surgical patients in a postanesthesia care unit who were randomly assigned to one of the three groups. Inhalation of isopropyl alcohol is believed to disrupt the emetic response by affecting the transmission of nausea sensations along neural pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898010111423419">Wang, Hofstadter, &amp; Kain, 1999</xref>). All patients in the three groups were instructed to take three slow deep breaths and inhale the vapors deeply through their noses and exhale them through their mouths. Nausea was measured using a visual analogue scale at baseline and again 2 and 5 minutes after the initial intervention. All three therapies were found to be equally effective. No adverse effects were reported. The researchers attributed the decrease in nausea levels among the three interventions to the deep breathing that the subjects were instructed to perform during the inhalation of the peppermint oil, isopropyl alcohol, or isotonic saline. This contradicts the earlier findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010111423419">Langevin and Brown (1997)</xref>, who conducted a double-blind crossover study of 15 consecutive patients. They found that saline did not relieve postoperative nausea or vomiting in any patient (n = 15), whereas isopropyl alcohol inhalation relieved postoperative nausea or vomiting in 12 of 15 patients.</p>
<p>In addition to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010111423419">Anderson and Gross (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010111423419">Langevin and Brown (1997)</xref>, other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898010111423419">Merritt, Okyere, &amp; Jasinski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898010111423419">Smiler &amp; Srock, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898010111423419">Wang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0898010111423419">Winston, Rinehart, Riley, Vacchiano, &amp; Pellegrini, 2003</xref>) also studied the effectiveness of aromatherapy using isopropyl alcohol to treat nausea. There have been few reports of side effects and no reports of toxicity from the inhalation of isopropyl alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010111423419">Cotton, Rowell, Hood, &amp; Pellegrini, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898010111423419">Merritt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898010111423419">Pellegrini, DeLoge, Bennett, &amp; Kelly, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898010111423419">Spencer (2004)</xref> focused on the effectiveness of isopropyl alcohol inhalation in reducing postoperative nausea/vomiting, describing the physiology of postoperative nausea and vomiting, reviewing the above studies, and recommending that nurses use isopropyl alcohol inhalation as a complementary treatment for postoperative nausea/vomiting. Later studies found that the inhalation of isopropyl alcohol was an effective treatment for postoperative nausea/vomiting in home as well as hospital settings as well as in patients at high risk for developing postoperative nausea/vomiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010111423419">Cotton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898010111423419">Pellegrini et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This review of the literature revealed a very limited number of studies on the use of peppermint aromatherapy in postoperative nausea. No study of aromatherapy for the treatment of nausea using the product labeled as “peppermint spirits” was found. Three studies investigated peppermint oil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010111423419">Anderson &amp; Gross, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010111423419">Burns et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898010111423419">Tate, 1997</xref>). Tate also investigated peppermint essence, and Anderson and Gross also investigated isopropyl alcohol. Tate used peppermint essence as an inert placebo, but did not specify the constituents of the peppermint essence she used. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010111423419">Kress (2010)</xref> stated that essences only differ from spirits in strength, with essences usually being three times stronger. She provided a formula for peppermint essence, a mixture of 1 fluid ounce of peppermint oil with 4 fluid ounces of rectified spirit, that she stated is in accordance with the British Pharmacopoeia. Isopropyl alcohol inhalation has been shown to decrease nausea/vomiting in several studies. However, there were no studies that used ethyl alcohol to treat postoperative nausea. This experimental study was built on the previous studies and was unique in that it focused on aromatherapy using peppermint spirits, capturing the synergistic effect of both peppermint and ethyl alcohol, which has not been done in previous studies. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of peppermint spirits aromatherapy on postoperative nausea in women following a scheduled C-section.</p>

<title>Design</title>
<p>Based on the previous studies and the call for scientific studies of alternative therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898010111423419">Koop, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898010111423419">Lundberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898010111423419">Micozzi, 2001</xref>) and evidence-based practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010111423419">Guzzetta, 2005</xref>), an experimental pretest–posttest research design with random assignment was used to examine the treatment effects. The three groups consisted of peppermint spirits aromatherapy, placebo aromatherapy, and standard antiemetic therapy groups.</p>
<p>The initial interventions were administered immediately after participants’ baseline nausea levels were assessed. Each participant in the peppermint spirits aromatherapy group (experimental group) received aromatherapy using pharmacy grade peppermint spirits (HUMCO Peppermint Spirit USP: ethyl alcohol 82%, peppermint oil, purified water, peppermint leaf extract). Each participant in the placebo aromatherapy control group (inert placebo control group) received aromatherapy using sterile water mixed with green food coloring. Each participant in the standard antiemetic therapy control group (usual care control group) received standard antiemetic therapy in accordance with physicians’ orders and hospital policy/protocol. The staff nurse reassessed the nausea level of participants in all three intervention groups 2 and 5 minutes after administering the initial intervention.</p>
<p>Specific research questions were identified to compare each group’s nausea levels at 2 minutes and 5 minutes after the initial intervention to their nausea levels at baseline and to compare the nausea levels between groups at the same time points.</p>

<title>Participants and Setting</title>
<p>Women were recruited for this study consecutively using the hospital’s list of scheduled C-sections. Women were eligible to participate in this study if they were scheduled for a nonemergency C-section, English speaking, at least 18 years of age, nonsmoker, and became nauseated post C-section. Women were invited to participate in this study by phone. Those who agreed to participate were sent an enrollment package and consent form. Women were excluded from the study if they had an allergy to peppermint or food colorings, had been diagnosed with persistent vomiting such as hyperemesis, or had a condition in which the contraction of abdominal muscles during vomiting would have been contraindicated such as an infected wound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898010111423419">McCance &amp; Huether, 2010</xref>). Women were also excluded from the study if they were receiving magnesium sulfate therapy since patients on magnesium sulfate are at greater risks for aspiration due to its effects of decreased muscle tone and diminished reflexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898010111423419">Lippincott, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The setting for this study was a women’s center of a community hospital located in the metropolitan area of a large city in the southeastern United States. This hospital primarily provides services to an underserved minority community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0898010111423419">
<title>Ethical Protections and Safety Considerations</title>
<p>Approval to conduct this study was obtained from the medical center’s institutional review board. There is a lack of literature on the use of peppermint aromatherapy in postpartum women and nursing mothers. The study was therefore presented to the Women’s Center Medical Committee, composed of obstetricians, anesthesiologists, and midwives, for review and approval. The peppermint spirits contained some of the common ingredients that individuals might be exposed to in daily life, such as peppermint food and beverages—flavorings in an alcohol base. The alcohol in the peppermint spirits was 82% compared with the alcohol in a commonly available form of peppermint used in cooking—peppermint extract that contains 89% alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898010111423419">McCormick &amp; Company, 2010</xref>). An additional layer of safety was ensured with the use of pharmacy-grade peppermint spirits, which contained ethyl alcohol instead of the isopropyl alcohol used in previous studies for the treatment of nausea. Several safety factors were instituted to reduce exposure of the babies to the peppermint spirits. The babies were not allowed in the mother’s arms when the aromatherapy was administered, a staff nurse supervised the administration of the aromatherapy, the aromatherapy was inhaled from a small bag rather than a diffuser to limit exposure to the surrounding air, and only 3 inhalations at 3 times (baseline and 2 and 5 minutes postbaseline) were allowed under the direct supervision of the nurse. There appears to be very limited scientific information on the effect of peppermint spirits aromatherapy with regard to its components of peppermint oil or its ethyl alcohol base on breast milk. Peppermint oil aromatherapy has been used to treat nausea in women in labor with no adverse outcomes to the mother or baby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010111423419">Burns et al., 2000</xref>). However, it should be noted that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898010111423419">American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Drugs (2001)</xref> only cautions the avoidance of alcohol oral ingestion in “large amounts” in their policy on the transfer of drugs and other chemicals into human milk, and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898010111423419">La Leche League International (2010)</xref> provides information from multiple sources indicating that breast-feeding mothers can drink some alcohol occasionally without harming themselves or their babies. Alcohol leaves the breast milk as soon as it leaves the bloodstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898010111423419">La Leche League International, 2010</xref>). According to Dr. Thomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898010111423419">Hale (2006)</xref>, author of Medications and Mothers Milk, adults usually metabolize 1 ounce of alcohol in 3 hours.</p>
<p>The mothers who received peppermint spirits aromatherapy in this study were exposed to the alcohol in 1 mL of peppermint spirits by inhalation, not ingestion. Since the effects of alcohol on the baby are directly related to the amount of alcohol the mother consumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898010111423419">La Leche League International, 2010</xref>), the researchers, pharmacy department, and the institutional review board considered the administration of peppermint spirits aromatherapy intervention used in this study to be safe for mothers and their babies.</p>
<p>The telephone recruitment nurse followed a script that explained the purpose of the study. No deception was used—potential participants were informed about the three intervention groups and agreed to be randomly assigned to one of them as part of the informed consent process. Using a placebo intervention adds an element of control to experimental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010111423419">Burns &amp; Groves, 2009</xref>). Informing the participants beforehand regarding the potential use of a placebo in the study avoided ethical concerns regarding deception. No monetary or other compensation was given to participants. It should also be noted that a participant could opt out of the study at any time during the intervention as indicated in the study consent signed by the participants. Also, if a participant requested a traditional antiemetic, it would immediately be prepared regardless of the participant’s assigned treatment group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0898010111423419">
<title>Study Processes and Procedures</title>
<p>Recruitment flyers were sent to obstetricians’ offices and posted in classrooms used for child birthing classes. The project recruiter telephoned women who were scheduled for a C-section and followed a recruitment script to invite them to participate in the study. The recruitment goal was set at 84 participants, 28 per intervention group with complete data collected. Participants were told they would be assigned to one of three intervention groups. An enrollment package was then sent to the women. The enrollment package contained a study description sheet, consent form, and background form. Women brought the signed consents and background forms to the hospital admissions department (AD) when they came on the day of their admission to the hospital.</p>
<p>The coordination of three departments was used to enhance the validity of the study while assuring inclusion of the participants in the study. The AD staff performed random assignment, nursing staff in the L&amp;D unit verified participation, and nurses on the mother/baby (M/B) unit conducted the assessments and implemented the interventions. Staff in the AD assigned participants to intervention groups per protocol using a blocked systematic random assignment method. Participants were assigned to intervention groups in blocks of three, one to each group, to foster equal sample sizes in the three groups. At this time a color-coded round label designating participants’ intervention group assignment was placed on the front of each participant’s chart.</p>
<p>Staff in the L&amp;D unit asked each participant if she was participating in the peppermint study. If the participant said yes, the L&amp;D staff verified that the participant understood the purpose of the study and that the consent form was signed and on the chart. They also verified the placement of the color sticker on the chart.</p>
<p>When each of the post C-section patients was transferred to the M/B unit the assigned nurse checked to see if the patient was participating in the study and noted the label color on the chart, indicating the participant’s intervention group assignment. Whenever a participant first became nauseated, the nurse assessed her nausea level using the nausea scale (baseline), administered the assigned intervention, and reassessed her nausea level at 2 and 5 minutes after the initial intervention. Each participant in both aromatherapy groups received a second and third aromatherapy intervention immediately after the second and third nausea assessments. Nurses assessed each participant’s nausea by asking her to rate it using a 6-point ordinal nausea scale. If the participant was still nauseated after the 5-minute assessment, she was offered a standard nausea medicine. Also, each participant had the right to request standard treatment at any time during the study. If the participant wanted the standard nausea medication the nurse prepared it immediately.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0898010111423419">
<title>Administration of Aromatherapies and Standard Antiemetic Therapy</title>
<p>When a participant in either the peppermint spirits aromatherapy or placebo aromatherapy group became nauseated, the staff nurse went to the medication room and obtained an administration packet. Each packet consisted of a cotton ball inside of a mini ziplock bag and a syringe containing either the peppermint spirits (1 mL) or sterile water with green food coloring (1 mL). In the medication room the nurse inserted the contents of the syringe into the cotton ball and closed the ziplock bag. The ziplock bag was taken to the participant’s room where the nurse used the nurse script to instruct the participant to hold the open ziplock bag 2 inches under her nose and to take three slow, deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth. In accordance with the script, the nurse supervised the participant for 5 minutes, reassessing the participant’s nausea level after 2 minutes and then administering the aromatherapy intervention for the second time. The nurse assessed the participant’s nausea level for the third and final time 5 minutes after administering the initial intervention and then administered the third aromatherapy intervention to the participant. The mother did not hold her baby during the inhalations.</p>
<p>When a participant in the standard antiemetic therapy group stated that she was nauseated, the staff nurse administered the nausea scale and asked the participant if she wanted to receive the antiemetic prescribed by her physician. The staff nurse administered the prescribed antiemetic, usually intravenous ondansetron or promethazine suppository, and then reassessed the participant’s nausea level 2 minutes and 5 minutes after administering the medication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0898010111423419">
<title>Instruments/Measurements</title>
<p>An ordinal nausea scale adapted from one used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898010111423419">Tate (1997)</xref> was used to measure the participants’ subjective perceptions of nausea and vomiting. The 6-point descriptive ordinal rating scale ranged from 0 to 6 with the following descriptors next to each number, respectively: “I am not experiencing any nausea,” “I feel slightly nauseated,” “I feel moderately nauseated,” “I feel extremely nauseated,” “I feel so nauseated I feel I am about to vomit,” and “I vomited.” It took participants less than 5 seconds to identify their nausea levels. A background form developed by the researchers was used to collect demographic, alternative therapy use, and pregnancy-related information. Participants were asked to fill out the background form and bring it to the hospital on admission.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0898010111423419">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and/or frequencies, were used to analyze data from the background form and nausea scale. Inferential statistics, specifically Fisher’s exact probability tests, were conducted to test the hypotheses due to the ordinal nature of the nausea scale and low cell frequencies (less than 5). This required comparing two groups at a time and recoding the nausea scale as a dichotomous variable. Nausea scores were recoded from 6 levels to 2 levels: scores of 0 to 1 were recoded as “none-low” and scores of 3 to 5 were recoded as “high.” Since it was deemed neither low nor high, the score of “2” was not recoded. Difference from baseline nausea level was computed by categorizing participants’ postintervention nausea level as “decreased” (changed from high to none-low) or “remained high” (high baseline level did not decrease).</p>
<p>The overall significance level for this study was set at p = .05. Since only two groups could be tested at one time and multiple hypotheses (5) were being tested for each of the two group comparisons (peppermint spirits aromatherapy–placebo aromatherapy and peppermint spirits aromatherapy–standard antiemetic therapy), the Bonferroni correction was used, and the significance level for each of the 10 hypothesis tests was set at .005 (.05/10).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Thirty-five of the eligible participants became nauseated during the study, 22 (63%) in the peppermint spirits aromatherapy group, 8 (22%) in the placebo aromatherapy group, and 5 (14%) in the standard antiemetic therapy group. Many participants (n = 24) did not become nauseated while they were on the M/B unit and thus did not meet the inclusion criteria. Many other participants were excluded for a variety of other reasons. Some participants were missed by the AD and were not assigned to an intervention group; others were not confirmed by L&amp;D personnel. A small number of participants refused to participate when they could not be in the peppermint group. Attrition numbers were also affected by participants who delivered early or had an emergency C-section or related complications. Also, not all nurses on the nursing unit implemented the research protocol. Some nurses did not implement the research protocol at all; others did not implement the research protocol for participants in the placebo aromatherapy group. No participants were excluded due to untoward effects of the aromatherapy interventions—there were no reports of sedation or other problems in the mothers or babies receiving either of the two aromatherapy interventions. Another problem was that data were incomplete and could not be used if the nausea scale had not been completed at all three nausea assessment points. The data for many participants were destroyed because their study forms were not removed from the chart before the participant’s discharge and were subsequently discarded and shredded by medical records personnel per hospital policy. Although data collection for this study was extended from originally established 12 months to 18 months as researchers worked to increase the sample size, the recruitment goal of 84 participants who became nauseated was not met. Time commitment from the involved departments was not available beyond this extended 18-month time frame. As a result of all these challenges, the resulting sample sizes in each group are smaller than planned (less than 28 participants in each group).</p>
<p>The mean age for the participants was 31.3 years and ranged from 22 to 43 years (n = 34). Of the 25 participants who reported their race and marital status, 60% were Black, 12% were Hispanic, and 28% were Caucasian, and the majority of these participants were married (72%). The usual method of anesthesia used for the C-section was spinal (93%, n = 27). Forty-eight percent (n = 12) reported they were often or always nauseated during their pregnancy. Most of the participants were between 38 to 39 weeks gestation (74%, n = 20). Slightly more than half delivered male babies (54%, n = 13). Fourteen male babies (82% of the 17 reported) were also delivered by participants who never became nauseated and were therefore excluded. The majority of participants reported that they had used some form of alternative therapy for nausea (68%, n = 17).</p>

<title>Within-Groups Comparisons of Nausea Levels (Research Questions 1 to 3)</title>
<p>Peppermint spirits aromatherapy group (experimental). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898010111423419">Table 1</xref>, at baseline participants in the peppermint spirits aromatherapy group experienced nausea levels ranging from slight to about to vomit. Almost all these participants, 19, felt that they were either extremely nauseated or about to vomit at this time point. At 2 minutes after the initial intervention more than half of these participants, 14, experienced none-slight levels of nausea. Another 6 were experiencing moderate levels of nausea at this time point, yielding 20 of 22 participants experiencing none to moderate nausea at this time point. At 5 minutes after the initial intervention more than half of these participants, 12, experienced no nausea, and another 5 experienced slight nausea. This yields 17 of 22 participants experiencing none-slight levels of nausea 5 minutes after the intervention. Therefore, the answer to the first research question, will participants in the peppermint spirits aromatherapy group report a decrease in nausea, is yes.</p>

<title>Placebo aromatherapy group (control)</title>
<p>At baseline 4 of the 8 participants in the placebo aromatherapy group felt that they were either extremely nauseated or about to vomit, and 3 reported feeling moderately nauseated (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898010111423419">Table 1</xref>). At 2 minutes after the initial intervention, 6 of these participants felt that they were either extremely nauseated or about to vomit and 1 woman vomited. At 5 minutes after the initial intervention, 7 of these 8 participants continued to experience either extreme nausea or thought that they were about to vomit. None of the participants in the peppermint aromatherapy group had their nausea reduced to none or slight levels at either 2 or 5 minutes after the initial intervention. The nausea levels of 6 of these participants remained the same at all three time points. Thus, the answer to the second research question, will participants in the placebo aromatherapy group report a decrease in nausea, is no.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0898010111423419">

Their nausea was unchanged at 2 minutes. At 5 minutes, the nausea level of 1 of these 5 participants had decreased from “about to vomit” to “moderately nauseated.” Similar to participants in the placebo aromatherapy control group, none of these participants had their nausea reduced to none or slight levels at either 2 or 5 minutes after the initial intervention, and 4 of the 5 participants in this group experienced no change in their nausea levels from one assessment time to another. Therefore, the answer to the third research question, will participants in the standard antiemetic therapy control group report a decrease in nausea, is no.</p>

<title>Overall results</title>
<p>Participants in all three intervention groups had similar levels of nausea at baseline (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898010111423419">Table 1</xref>). When their levels of nausea were measured again, 2 and 5 minutes after the initial intervention, their levels of nausea were significantly different. The nausea levels of participants in both the placebo aromatherapy and standard antiemetic therapy control groups did not decrease much (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898010111423419">Table 2</xref>). For example, 0 of 8 participants in the placebo aromatherapy group and 0 of 5 participants in the control group experienced either no or slight levels of nausea at 2 and 5 minutes after the initial intervention, respectively. This is very different from the 14 and 17 participants in the peppermint spirits aromatherapy group (n = 22) who experienced either no or slight levels of nausea at 2 minutes and 5 minutes after the initial intervention, respectively. Since staff nurses gave the same instructions regarding breathing using the assigned aromatherapy to participants in both the peppermint spirits aromatherapy and placebo aromatherapy groups and the standard antiemetic therapy group used no breathing technique, the data do not support the breathing technique used to inhale the aromatherapy as an effective method to reduce nausea. In addition to supporting the within group comparisons, the data supported the research hypotheses—9 of the 10 hypothesis tests were significant. Thus, the peppermint spirits aromatherapy was effective in reducing postoperative nausea, whether comparing participants in this group to themselves or to participants in either of the two control groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings of this study supported the effectiveness of peppermint spirits aromatherapy in participants who became nauseated post C-section whether comparing participants in this group to themselves or to either of the two control groups. Our findings support those of Tate of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898010111423419">1997</xref>), who found peppermint oil aromatherapy effective and peppermint essence ineffective in 18 postoperative gynecological surgery patients, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010111423419">Burns et al. (2000)</xref>, who found peppermint oil aromatherapy effective in reducing nausea during childbirth. These findings are different from those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010111423419">Anderson and Gross (2004)</xref>, who found reduced nausea scores but no differences between peppermint oil, isopropyl alcohol, and saline aromatherapy groups of ambulatory surgery patients. The findings of our study, like those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010111423419">Langevin and Brown (1997)</xref>, did not support the use of placebo aromatherapy.</p>
<p>In this study, participants in both the peppermint spirits aromatherapy and the placebo aromatherapy groups received the same staff nurse-provided instructions and supervision regarding breathing to inhale the assigned aromatherapy, and yet the results were different between these two groups. Although using aromas that have been shown, through their historical use and/or study, to reduce nausea, can take advantage of the placebo effect, using the positive expectations of both the participants and nurses to potentiate the effects of the aromatherapy, this did not occur in our study. It should be noted that the placebo effect may not have occurred in the placebo aromatherapy group if participants in this group, knowing that there was a placebo group in this study, may have deduced that they were members of that group because they could not smell a “peppermint” aroma when they inhaled the treatment. This knowledge may have prevented the placebo aromatherapy from eliciting the placebo effect in these participants. The placebo effect, a manifestation of the close relationship between the mind and body, occurs when the expectation of an effect by itself causes the effect to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010111423419">Freeman, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010111423419">Guzzetta, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898010111423419">Rodgers &amp; Micozzi, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>There were several differences between our study and the previous three studies. Although participants in two of these three studies were postoperative patients, the types of surgery varied: ambulatory surgery patients in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010111423419">Anderson and Gross (2004)</xref>, gynecological surgery patients in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898010111423419">Tate (1997)</xref>, and C-section patients in our study. Participants in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010111423419">Burns et al. (2000)</xref> study, women in labor, and included women who had C-section and vaginal as well as spontaneous and induced deliveries. Different treatments were given to patients on different units in the study by Tate. In the study by Anderson and Gross, participants were randomly assigned to treatment groups after they spontaneously reported nausea, and in our study, participants were randomly assigned to intervention groups when the hospital AD personnel admitted them to the hospital and the study, before their surgery and experience of postoperative nausea. The study by Burns et al. was an observational one that used routinely collected and audited data.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898010111423419">Tate (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010111423419">Burns et al. (2000)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010111423419">Anderson and Gross (2004)</xref> studied peppermint oil aromatherapy. Tate also used peppermint essence (undefined composition) as a placebo control, whereas we used peppermint spirits, which contains both peppermint oil and ethyl alcohol. The peppermint spirits used in our study may have had a synergistic and more soothing treatment effect than the peppermint treatments used in the other two studies. The participants in the standard antiemetic therapy group in our study did not receive any instructions regarding their breathing, whereas all groups in the study by Anderson and Gross received aromatherapy using the prescribed breathing technique.</p>
<p>Although these studies focused on patient-reported nausea on a nausea rating scale, different rating scales were used. A 100-mm visual analogue scale was used in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010111423419">Anderson and Gross (2004)</xref>, and nausea was measured at baseline and 2 and 5 minutes posttreatment. A 5-point descriptive ordinal rating scale was used to measure nausea every 4 hours, and the average per-person nausea scores per day were analyzed in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898010111423419">Tate (1997)</xref>. A 3-point descriptive ordinal rating scale was used to measure the overall effectiveness of peppermint oil aromatherapy on nausea in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010111423419">Burns et al. (2000)</xref>.</p>
<p>The total sample size, 33, in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010111423419">Anderson and Gross (2004)</xref> study was similar to the final sample size in our study, 35; these two sample sizes were almost double the sample size of 18 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898010111423419">Tate’s (1997)</xref> study. The sample size in our study was also more than that of two studies described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010111423419">Buckle (2009)</xref>—more than triple that of the study by Figuenick (n = 10) and double that of the study by Piotrowski (n = 17). Although Tate did not report the samples sizes for each treatment group, the group sample sizes reported by Anderson and Gross were approximately equal, unlike those of our study. It seems likely that the number of participants who received the placebo aromatherapy or standard antiemetic therapy in our study was similar to those who received the placebo aromatherapy or no treatment in the study by Tate. In contrast, the number of participants who received peppermint spirits aromatherapy in our study was more than the entire sample size in the study by Tate and twice that of the peppermint oil aromatherapy group in the study by Anderson and Gross. One or more of these differences may explain the differences in the results of these three studies.</p>
<sec id="section27-0898010111423419">
<title>Lessons Learned</title>
<p>Our study was affected by some of the typical challenges experienced by nurse researchers when attempting to study alternative therapies using the traditional medical model. The major methodological limitations were the small and unequal sample sizes that resulted from problems with selection and attrition of participants. This was also a problem in the two experimental studies of peppermint oil aromatherapy to treat postoperative nausea discussed in the literature review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010111423419">Anderson &amp; Gross, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898010111423419">Tate, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Many of the challenges encountered in our study occurred because this was an unfunded research study conducted in the real world of hospital and clinical nursing practice instead of a laboratory setting. As a result, much less control could be exerted over the study, and unanticipated events hindered the implementation of the study as designed. There were no dedicated study personnel to implement the protocol, administer the interventions, and collect the data, or even to monitor the study to ensure appropriate tracking and enable the early identification of problems; instead, multiple people in multiple departments implemented assigned parts of the study, including regular unit staff nurses who added study interventions and data collection to their already heavy workloads. If we were to replicate our study, rather than forcing it into the medical model with control groups and placebos, we would use peppermint spirits aromatherapy as a complementary therapy rather than an alternative therapy to the traditional therapies that are currently being used in our hospital. This may increase the buy in of nursing staff and patients involved in the study.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The study results provide additional support for the use of peppermint spirits aromatherapy as a useful adjunct intervention for postoperative nausea following a C-section. Our study was unique because it used a combination product of both peppermint and ethyl alcohol, instead of the previous studies that examined peppermint oil and/or isopropyl alcohol as separate aromatherapy agents. Limitations of the study were related to the small sample size and methodological issues. Our study should be replicated with larger sample sizes at other facilities with male and female patients undergoing a variety of surgical procedures. Using the aromatherapy with different aromas, such as ginger, spearmint, and/or isopropyl alcohol, and as a complementary therapy in conjunction with standard therapies may help improve implementation of the protocol. The findings of the study are useful for nursing because peppermint spirits aromatherapy improved nausea symptoms without causing sedation, which can interfere with breast-feeding and bonding time with the baby. The lessons learned from the study involve the importance of staff buy in and involvement with a project. Many staff members did not want to administer a placebo. Patients also in general wanted to be in the intervention group that received peppermint aromatherapy. Involving fewer people and departments in the project and minimizing the number of data collection forms may have been useful in preventing lost information. The findings of our study add to the body of evidence from previous studies on the effectiveness of peppermint aromatherapy in reducing postoperative nausea and could be used as part of a proposal to request funding for a larger study.</p>
