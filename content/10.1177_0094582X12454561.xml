<p>Since the end of the civil war in the early 1990s, Peru’s tourist industry has been organized around an obsession with the Incan past. One rapidly growing segment of the industry aims to allow tourists to experience the Q’ero mysticism of the highlands in a somewhat “authentic” context. A case study of a center of this spiritual tourism in the Sacred Valley of the Incas that focuses on the transmission of energy healing rites raises questions about the possibility of real cultural exchange under conditions of asymmetry and about the impact on indigenous communities of this appropriation and commodification of their spirituality.</p>
<p>Desde el fin de la guerra civil a principios de la década de los noventa, el turismo peruano se ha organizado alrededor de una obsesión con el pasado inca. Un segmento de esta industria que surge rápidamente propone permitir a los turistas una experiencia del misticismo de la sierra Q’ero en un contexto algo “auténtico.” El caso de un centro de turismo espiritual en el Valle Sagrado de los Incas que se enfoca en la transmisión de energías curanderas plantea cuestiones sobre las posibilidades del auténtico intercambio cultural bajo condiciones asimétricas y el impacto en las comunidades indígenas de esta apropiación y materialización de su espiritualidad.</p>

<p>The present-day fascination with the shaman has a strong foothold in the colonial past. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0094582X12454561">Michael Taussig (1987)</xref> has argued, in the dichotomous schema of good and evil, order and chaos, civilization and barbarity that colonialism produced, the wild man was a necessary figure. The shaman, constructed by Europeans as a figure of alterity, became the repository for all kinds of colonial fantasies and structural violence. Tracing the effects of colonialism on contemporary native communities in Colombia, Taussig points to the constitutive relationship of colonial terror and shamanistic healing, with new forms of healing emerging to resist and counteract the violent imposition of European models. In the era of modernity, outsiders’ pursuit of healing through native spirituality has been criticized as misappropriation and commodification and as disconnected from the realities of native communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X12454561">Aldred, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X12454561">Jenkins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X12454561">Snavely, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0094582X12454561">Valaskakis, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the end of the civil war in the early 1990s, local and national tourism in Peru has been organized around an obsession with the Incan past. Coupled with the Peruvian state’s promotion of Incan sites as sacred and mystical, this obsession has produced a segment of the tourist industry that has exploded over the past 20 years. This branch of the industry is particularly engaged with the Q’ero mysticism of the higher Andes, where the indigenous groups are said to be the direct inheritors of the Incan royal past. Known as shaman, mystical, or spiritual tourism, it is designed to allow tourists from the “First World” to experience indigenous cultural forms in a somewhat authentic context. The use of medicinal plants from the lowland jungle region like ayahuasca and San Pedro has become central to the tourist offerings in Cuzco and the surrounding Sacred Valley of the Incas. An ever-increasing number of tourist companies has prospered by offering mystical tours and expanding into increasingly remote areas so that patrons can conduct vision quests.</p>
<p>Examination of the spiritual tourist industry raises interesting questions about its material and symbolic impact on regional development and on the native people who participate in it. In this article I focus on Diane Dunn’s Centro Paz y Luz, located in the heart of the Sacred Valley (the Urubamba Valley, at the foot of Machu Picchu), which has become one of the region’s main tourist destinations. Dunn’s center is one of the first such centers in the valley and one of the best-known internationally. Because of her entrepreneurial success, many other foreigners have followed her example, creating retreat spaces based on a New Age rendition of native principles. In the past 15 years hundreds of tourists have come to the center to participate in workshops on Q’ero spiritual practices led both by indigenous shamans and by Dunn and other Euro-American practitioners. In turn, Dunn has been invited to travel to dozens of nations to train hundreds of students in energy healing rites based on Andean concepts. Thus, the work of the center represents a phenomenon of broad interest in the Andes, especially with regard to the appropriation of indigeneity.</p>
<p>This article is based on several field research trips to Pisac, the Sacred Valley, and Cuzco, and in what follows my observations are based on interviews, ethnographic notes, and secondary sources. While I discuss the political economy and the land question in a broad framework, the main questions turn on the affective dimension of spiritual tourism and its significance for local/global exchange. What occurs between natives and spiritual tourists, and what is the effect of this on native communities? What roles do North American cultural mediators play in such exchanges? What forms of inequality emerge in the process? A complex set of negotiations between communities, foreign actors, and mediators like Dunn affects material outcomes. I explore the exchanges that occur between native healers, spiritual tourists, and the mediator and raise questions about their material effects and affective power.</p>
<p>Peru’s tourist industry depends in large measure upon the marketing of its native cultures. In the Andean setting, the representational appropriation of history has been described as a kind of “de-ethnicization of ethnicity” and as the “de-Indianization” of Cuzco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X12454561">de la Cadena, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X12454561">Hill, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0094582X12454561">Motta, 2001</xref>). Though the literature on the tourist industry has described its marketing apparatus and its appeal, the shaman and the foreign mediators who negotiate these cultural and economic exchanges also deserve scholarly attention. The spiritual tourists who seek healing and emotional and spiritual cleansing in the Sacred Valley draw upon Andean cosmologies and indigenous practices that are often already hybridized with many other spiritual traditions. The desire to learn from indigenous healers, to absorb their local knowledge from a position of Western melancholy, is an affective dimension of this tourism.</p>
<sec id="section1-0094582X12454561">
<title>Andean Discoveries</title>
<p>Recent research underscores the centrality of power in the dynamics of tourism by defining it as “the discursive machinery that produces representations of the nation that have important consequences on the ways in which history and cultural identity are conceptualized” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0094582X12454561">Vich, 2007</xref>: 2). National governments are keen to promote tourism as the motor of economic development, in the process branding their nations in a competitive global market. Although tourism generates millions of dollars of foreign capital, the trickle-down of this wealth is often much less than anticipated. Profits are often siphoned off by multinational companies that are based in the United States and Western Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0094582X12454561">Urry, 2002</xref>). Whatever benefit there is for the local population tends to go to the wealthier classes, leaving for the vast majority of the working class employment that is generally unskilled, low-paid, and reproductive of the “servile labor” of the colonial regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0094582X12454561">Urry, 2002</xref>: 57–58).</p>
<p>In the Cuzco region, the landscape of tourism can be described as a matrix of “working misunderstandings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094582X12454561">van den Berghe and Flores Ochoa, 2000</xref>) in which foreign capital, the economic strategies of the Peruvian state, native people, tourists, spiritual seekers, and Cuzqueño culture collide. There is an obvious clash between native ontologies, which are traditionally organized around collective subjectivity, and a late-capitalist model organized around the celebration of the self. Despite the radical impact of Spanish colonialism on land tenure and dynamic modes of cultural exchange, Andean views about land continue to resist a capitalist model of accumulation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X12454561">Mario Arguedas (1977</xref>: 25) describes the irreconcilable difference between the Western model of property ownership and the religious relationship to land and work that organized Andean life prior to Spanish colonization. Despite the fact that more than 500 years have passed and cultural interchange has occurred on many levels, this starkly different relationship to the land, work, and religious belief persists as a salient feature of Andean indigenous rural epistemologies.</p>
<p>Another epistemological difference and one that the state has capitalized upon as a tool of nation building is a radically different approach to the meaning of cultural patrimony. The densest symbol of Incan culture and its royal past is Machu Picchu, officially discovered in 1911 by Hiram Bingham of Yale University. In three expeditions in the following years, collaboration between the university and National Geographic produced over 10,000 photographs that came to structure the national and foreign public’s imagination about the site. The April 1913 issue of <italic>National Geographic</italic> incorporated an unprecedented 250 black-and-white photos and illustrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X12454561">Bingham, 1913</xref>). An editor’s note in the issue called Bingham’s discovery “one of the most remarkable stories of exploration in South America in the past fifty years.” Ironically, a recent <italic>National Geographic</italic> online article compares Bingham’s “discovery” to that of the Spanish conquerors: “Bingham wrote that ‘Machu Picchu might prove to be the largest and most important ruin discovered in South America since the days of the Spanish conquest.’ He was right.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094582X12454561">1</xref></sup> Captivated by these images, tourists began to arrive in the Cuzco region in the 1920s, but it was only after the Peruvian government invested in the needed infrastructure in the 1950s that they arrived en masse, transforming the nation’s heritage into raw material for tourist consumption. With the establishment of the National Institute for Culture in 1971, the government gained more control over Machu Picchu and the way it would be marketed to the world. During the 1970s an elaborate infrastructure of hotel, road, and train accommodations was built to accommodate the increase in numbers of international visitors in what would become a multibillion-dollar tourist industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0094582X12454561">Mendoza, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The current representation of indigeneity in Peru has been informed by the transnational flow of ideas and capitalist trends in the Americas. “Incanismo became a marketable commodity, with much of the marketing under the control of the Cuzco urban elite that spawned the ideology in the first place” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094582X12454561">van den Berghe and Flores Ochoa, 2000</xref>: 8; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094582X12454561">Flores Ochoa, 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X12454561">1995b</xref>). <italic>Incanismo</italic> is the neoliberal form of <italic>indigenismo</italic>, the ideology that was influential in the resurgence of an Incan identity during the twentieth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X12454561">de la Cadena, 2000</xref>). Over the past three decades neoliberal economic development that appropriates authenticity for material gain, especially through a particular notion of cultural patrimony, has worked in tandem with the global tourist industry to transform the meaning of indigenismo as a cultural and historical formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0094582X12454561">Hill, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The tourist trade depends on a mystification of the Incan past that has taken a number of forms, particularly in national politics and in the marketing of representations. Invention and commodification have been used by cities and regions to reinvent their pasts, build up a sense of “uniqueness,” display a coherent and competitive image, and boost their economies and tourist industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12454561">Cartier and Lew, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094582X12454561">Fainstein and Judd, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0094582X12454561">Irazábal, 2005</xref>). Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo orchestrated a strategic deployment of images of his Incaic ancestry through his adoption of a coastal and urban <italic>cholo</italic> status. What makes the Cuzco region unique for the purpose of foreign tourism is the sacred sites spread across the Sacred Valley, but most tourists simply dip into Cuzco and then go on to Machu Picchu. As the tour operator and guide Roger Valencia commented, out of dozens of possible tourist destinations the guidebooks promote only a few. Locations such as Ollantaytambo and Pisac, in particular, have become important destinations of spiritual tourism.</p>
<p>In Cuzco, exchanges between local men and women and foreigners are often mediated by the Incan figure of the <italic>brichero</italic>, someone who can bridge cultures (or, more cynically, is after a foreign passport). Some of this exchange is organized around a sexual economy involving foreigners and local mestizo men and women in Cuzco bars, hotels, and restaurants. Novels and short stories describe attempts by mostly male mestizos to attract U.S. and European women by playing the role of the mystical Incan. A secondary area of encounters between local residents and foreigners is organized around the shaman as the embodiment of ancient culture and spiritual authority. As such, the image of “the spiritual Inca” has become a trope of Peru’s global tourist market.</p>

<sec id="section2-0094582X12454561">
<title>The Era of Peace</title>
<p>While scholars and local guides describe the limited circuit of tourist sites as the result of marketing schemes, Diane Dunn accounts for the appeal of Peru differently: “It is the time before the <italic>Taripay Pacha</italic>, or the dawn of a new age of peace, that is referred to as the time of meeting ourselves again. Visitors from all over the world now converge on Peru to take in its spiritual energy and learn the secrets of the Andean path.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0094582X12454561">2</xref></sup> In 2000, on a piece of land in the Pisac Valley near the Urubamba River, at the foot of four mountains considered sacred, Dunn established a healing center and bed-and-breakfast. The mission of the Centro Paz y Luz, as stated on its web site is,
<disp-quote>
<p>to expand our consciousness, amplify our awareness and help others to do the same. To provide a haven for travelers and seekers from around the world to rest in the refined energy of the Sacred Valley surrounded by powerful mountains. To offer opportunities for healing, balance, restoration and transformation. To develop the goal of United Visions Unlimited, which is to bring this planet Earth and its inhabitants into balance with each other and with the cosmos itself.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The web site promotes a kind of univocal vision of transformation that centers Andean traditions as essential to establishing a new peaceful world order.</p>
<p>Dunn says that she had envisioned a center where leaders from around the world would come together to train, plan, and educate each other regarding their spiritual concerns. The center never came to fruition, and so Dunn organized a series of workshops for those she referred to as more ordinary spiritual seekers. Soon after, she decided to build a home on a small piece of land that used to be farmland to establish a spiritual center. At a local restaurant called Urika’s Place that is frequented by foreigners who live in the area, she responded to a notice by a woman writer from the Lonely Planet inquiring about possible new destinations in the area to include in her guidebook. Despite the fact that she had only one room to offer at the time, Dunn invited the writer to visit the property. When the updated version of the guidebook came out it included a line that referred to the center as a “special place” run by a North American who conducted “spiritual tours.”</p>
<p>After its publication, many travelers suddenly arrived on Dunn’s doorstep, and the center became a well-known destination for those seeking mystical adventures in the region. Soon Dunn was attracting much larger groups and offering training and workshops to interested foreigners. In this new workshop format, she included native Q’eros who taught a hybrid version of their own practices to groups of visiting foreigners. In her autobiography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094582X12454561">2006</xref>) she reports that “visitors from all over the world now converge on Peru to take in its spiritual energy and learn the secrets of the Andean path.”</p>
<p>As a North American with theological training, Dunn has played a central if contentious role in the Sacred Valley. Despite questions about her commitment to local land politics and her interpretation of native spirituality, many of my informants credited her book and her presence at the center as the single most important factor in increased tourism to the Pisac region. In Dunn’s mind there are very specific reasons for bringing international travelers there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094582X12454561">2006</xref>: 129–131):
<disp-quote>
<p>In the secret recesses of my being I knew, or rather had been reminded, that I had chosen (and been chosen) to be a healer and transformer at this wonderful time in history, to help bring about the <italic>taripay pacha</italic> described in the Inka prophecies. . . . The vision Regis [Dunn’s mentor] had was to create a large center where people from all over the world, from all different religions and faith traditions could gather together for spiritual practice and social service. The Sacred Valley near Cuzco was an ideal location because of the strong energy vortex there, which would naturally attract people and assist in our efforts for unity and transformation. . . . Intention is everything, I reminded myself. I figured if I was being led to Peru to help develop the <italic>Centro Espiritual</italic>, then the ways and means would be provided.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In her hybridized version of the Q’ero vision of a time of peace, which she had learned from two prominent mestizo practitioners, she represents herself as a chosen subject for the work of healing the globe in a particularly crucial moment of “human evolution.” Elsewhere in her book she positions herself as someone who was often in the right place at the right time, working as a spiritual counselor for a few years in the transition to post-apartheid South Africa. However, her positionality as a white North American in that transition is left without comment, foreshadowing the split between spirituality and politics that underlies much of Dunn’s story in the Andes. What is notable in her narrative is that the individualized spiritual journey replaces any broader social and cultural understanding of the local situation.</p>
<p>Q’eros live in the highlands of the surrounding Andes, not in Pisac, and so many travel eight to ten hours on foot to market in the town’s center. Though many Q’ero communities were historically remote, they have been pushed even farther away by real estate trends, civil war, and the local impact of global climate change. In the Sacred Valley and in Cuzco, many Q’eros working in the tourist industry, for instance, as shamans in spiritual adventure tours. Jorge Flores Ochoa sees this incorporation into the tourist market as leading to the full “assimilation” of native Q’eros in the coming generation. At the Hotel Rio Sagrado, Q’ero women sit on manicured lawns by the Urubamba offering their crafts to tourists who stop there, and a similar scene is repeated throughout the Sacred Valley. It is in this broader context of the incorporation of native people as symbols of authentic purity that the appeal and the impact of the Centro Paz y Luz must be understood.</p>
<p>Using money borrowed from her parents, Dunn doubled and then tripled her landholdings within a few years, and at the same time other Europeans and North Americans acquired land in the area. This has contributed to a sharp increase in property values in the area, making land prices prohibitive for many local residents, and even Dunn herself has had a hard time keeping up with the ever-rising costs.</p>
<p>I first encountered Dunn in a photograph on the Internet, where she was wearing the headgear of an Andean healer—an almost surreal form of colonial appropriation. She positions herself in her books and workshops as an initiated Andean priestess, a mediator of indigenous knowledge, and a teacher of energy rites, but in conversation she recognized the importance of including indigenous people:
<disp-quote>
<p>A local taxi driver asked me to do a <italic>despacho</italic> [an offering to Mother Earth} in her house, but I felt awkward dressed up in my poncho and <italic>chuyo</italic>. There was something a little amiss here. When I started working on my own, instead of making the <italic>despachos</italic> I have the Q’ero come to make it, because I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to do it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this instance she appeared to be becoming self-reflexive about her role as a mediator between two cultural worlds. At the same time, her mediation has contributed to several other similar businesses’ emerging as part of the local spiritual tourist economy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0094582X12454561">
<title>The Munay-Ki Healing Rites</title>
<p>At a weeklong workshop in which I participated in August 2008, Dunn spoke little Spanish or Quechua despite the fact that she had invited two Q’ero healers to run the event with her. Further, there was no one formally assigned to do the translation for the more than 30 U.S., European, and South American participants who had gathered at the center to learn the nine Munay-ki healing rites. These rites, said to be drawn from ancient traditions of healing, were first taught by Four Winds, a company based in Palo Alto, California, and owned by a white North American, Alberto Viollda, a former anthropologist turned spiritual guru. It was Viollda who had “downloaded the rites from the universe,” as Dunn put it. She explained that, as a student of many spiritual traditions based in Andean cosmology, “Viollda was able to receive this information and share it with the world.” It is fairly simple, it seems, to pass the Munay-ki rites on to others as energy transmissions, and the “laying on of hands” was at the heart of Dunn’s workshop sessions. With everyone lying on the floor in a circle, the transmissions were passed in silence from Q’ero healers and Dunn to the participants.</p>
<p>The two healers, Francisco and Juana, were present throughout the eight days of the workshop, but from the beginning it was unclear what their role was or how authentic it was from the point of view of Q’ero tradition. Juana spoke only Quechua, while Francisco spoke Spanish and Quechua; neither spoke English. Dunn was comfortable to a certain degree communicating in Spanish but seemed to prefer speaking in English. Most of the participants were monolingual English-speakers and understood little if any Spanish. Quechua was, however, heard and used at one of the four sacred sites that we visited. In the transmissions of energy rites that happened at these locations, Francisco and Juana often used Quechua as the ceremonial language, creating a soundscape of chanting and bells. These experiences were the most memorable for the ceremonial work that was done with the four elements of earth, fire, water, and air. At the same time, we spent days in silence in the “experience” of meditation without being offered any Q’ero context for this experience.</p>
<p>In the absence of translation of Quechua as both language and religion and its mysticism, the weeklong seminar recreated the distinction between narration as “mind knowledge” and experience as “heart knowledge.” New Age discourses involving code words such as “heart center” and “higher intention” replaced any study of Q’ero culture, tradition, epistemology, and material reality. Q’ero approaches were reduced to a simplified and consumerist model of spirituality that was familiar to the participants.</p>
<p>The cultural gap between the Q’ero and the workshop participants was most evident during the <italic>despachos</italic>, offerings to Pachamama (Mother Earth), a standard Q’ero religious practice. The traditional <italic>despacho</italic> ritual takes several hours, has multiple layers, and is accompanied by music and dance. For the workshop the ceremony was conducted in under an hour. Devoid of an accompanying narrative, the ceremony lent itself to mystical objectification rather than the meaningful and layered ritual that is essential to this native practice. Thus engagement with local culture and religion was replaced by ethnicized spectacle. Perhaps the only exception to this was the moments of direct experience at waterfalls and rock formations that were said to be sacred to the Incas. Here the initiations quietly offered by Francisco and Juana produced an uncanny sensory experience for participants. Under certain conditions created by Q’ero practitioners, the potential for meaningful affective exchange was made possible by the elision of narrative and the direct experience without need for translations.</p>
<p>On the last day of the workshop, Francisco spoke to the group, conveying that the Q’ero elders had passed down teachings that were traditionally granted to initiates only after years of intensive spiritual study and praxis. In the face of increasing global despair and environmental degradation, however, the elders had decided that it was time to unlock these secrets and pass them on far beyond their own local communities so as to increase consciousness about Pachamama. In conversation with him afterward I asked about Juana’s role in this work, as a woman shaman who supposedly was not sanctioned by convention. Francisco stated that Juana’s role was indeed part of the opening up of Q’ero tradition so that everyone could be more involved in these practices. This idea of spreading the word is reflected in Diane Dunn’s excitement that more people were learning and even teaching the Munay-ki rites, and recently, perhaps in part prompted by a series of events that included my interview with her, Dunn published a book precisely on this topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X12454561">2012</xref>). As an authenticating figure, Francisco implicitly gave participants permission and encouragement to teach the energy rites in their own cities around the globe. Indeed, several of the participants said that they planned to “teach the tradition,” saying that they felt honored to take on this role. Dunn seemed particularly pleased with the fact that this work would be globally disseminated.</p>

<title>Seeking, Settling, and Melancholy</title>
<p>The search for meaning and the story of settling in the Sacred Valley as a journey of healing, transformation, and interfaith connection forms the narrative arc of Dunn’s autobiography. The early part of the book details a life filled with angst and a sense of insufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094582X12454561">Dunn, 2006</xref>: 6):
<disp-quote>
<p>Still there was something missing, something pulling, something prodding. It always seemed to be just around the corner. If I could only get there I knew I would be happy. What was it, that illusive something? Was it a big theatrical hit? Was it fame and fortune? Was it a man to love me? Or something more?</p>
<p>I was yearning, a deep wide yearning that had no name. It felt like a sense of destiny calling me, a puzzle that had only a few missing pieces. If I could only find them and put them into place then I would be complete, then I could rest, then I could live happily ever after. At that time, the search for a soul mate came closest to embodying this mixture of longing, mystery and destiny, this thing that eluded me.</p>
<p>It kept me moving along a path of discovery that led me to an even greater understanding of love. Eventually I realized that I was searching for my highest self, not another person or soul mate. I was seeking the oneness I felt with God and all creation that I first glimpsed on the swing. I was longing to discover my deepest calling, my life’s destiny, a sense of purpose and meaning one can only find by expanding consciousness.</p>

<p>The search for one’s higher self as an arduous process that ultimately leads to more purposeful living is a familiar trope of the New Age genre. Scores of books explore the human-potential or self-actualization aspect of these spiritual journeys, which promise the fulfillment of the human condition through detachment from the ego in order to achieve connection with the universe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094582X12454561">Heelas, 1996</xref>: 5). Dunn’s search for her “deepest calling” permits her to suggest that she was predestined and perhaps even had the right to establish herself in Andean sacred lands.</p>
<p>Mestizo and white shamans like Dunn have established themselves as teachers of ancient spiritual traditions and mysticism, embodying and mediating native cosmological principles for mostly Euro-American audiences. Elizabeth Wilcox (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X12454561">Hill, 2008</xref>: 258) maintains that learning these energy rites increases one’s energy and spiritual consciousness but continues: “I always caution spiritual seekers to understand how belief systems must be translated from culture to culture, and that we cannot, as North Americans, ever ‘become’ [an Andean priest], even though we can be initiated to these levels of mystical ‘priesthood’ and have access to the same energies associated with them.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X12454561">Hill (2008</xref>: 258–259) argues that rhetoric like this works to empty Andean religious culture of meaning “while still relying on racial essentialisms to market an authentic ‘reconstructed ethnicity’ available for tourist consumption.”</p>
<p>I remain skeptical about the possibility that these gatherings will translate into any benefit for indigenous communities beyond a few chosen representatives who gain access to dollars and travel possibilities conducting workshops outside of Peru. I also remain skeptical about the possibility of real cultural exchange that is not symmetrical, since cultural appropriation often leads to assimilation and incorporation. Intercultural forms of communication and interaction can produce something new, but, as Mario Arguedas asks, “How can the force of religious belief be turned into political action in the modern world? How do men become both paralyzed and moved into action by the force of belief?” Though melancholy is part of the search for belonging to the land and sacred places, foreign visitors are not the only ones experiencing loss and nostalgia. Melancholy may also describe the relationship of Q’ero people to changing traditions in a neoliberal landscape.</p>
<p>The tourist economy reveals the underbelly of the embodied performances of consumer capitalism, in which economic transactions fail to meet the need or desire for cultural memory on both sides. The spiritual tourist industry offers rituals as an escape from the existential problem that late-capitalist economic and cultural formations pose—the loss of connection that comes from the fragmented experience of capitalist subjectivity. A self-oriented search for meaning is projected onto native people and their imagined purity. In this context, Q’ero mediators find a way of addressing the anxieties of foreign seekers while also carving out spaces for experience of the region through the call for a more communal relationship to the land.</p>

<title>Toward Closure</title>
<p>Within the commercial circuits that are impacted by foreign culture, what kind of authenticity is sought? What is the impact of these exchanges? While the search for meaning through a spiritual connection to the land is probably an authentic one on the part of the spiritual tourist, in the short term such exchanges often lead to improved economic conditions for local communities, while in the long term they may make the position of indigenous peoples more precarious. Moreover, they reproduce the colonial “wild man” as other, this time within a global economic frame of New Age spirituality and tourism.</p>
<p>Juana was often the only Q’ero female present at most ceremonies, and, though I spent more than a week in her presence, I hardly heard her speak. As I have pointed out elsewhere (2009), muteness can have many meanings (consider, for example, the silence of those who have been disappeared in political violence or queer silence in contexts of heteronormativity). In some ways, it is a strategy that resists dominant representations and rejects the possibility of a faithful translation. The hybridized version of Q’ero culture taught to foreign spiritual tourists as a form of survival, business, or cultural exchange is an example of creative resistance to neoliberal encroachment on communal lands. A Moche woman in the Pisac marketplace told me that there were many in the area who used indigenous tradition to lure tourists with coca leaf readings and fortunetelling with crystals. Spiritual tourism produces a kind of subject constitution of indigeneity that is “firmly inscribed in Anglo-American liberal humanism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X12454561">Chow, 1993</xref>: 330). There is a fantasy of Q’ero culture and subjectivity that works within a well-defined representational terrain. Perhaps we can read Juana’s silence as resistance to the notion of interculturality that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X12454561">Miguel Rodrigo Alsína (1997)</xref> proposes as a response to incommensurability. In fact, silence may be the only proper answer in the face of New Age appropriations of Andean cultural memory.</p>
