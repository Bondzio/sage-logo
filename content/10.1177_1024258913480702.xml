<p>In Hungary, collective bargaining processes and outcomes have been comprehensively restructured since the start of the economic crisis. This article presents two channels through which the crisis has affected collective bargaining in the country: direct economic challenges and political change. The economic challenges intensified processes that had started before 2008, leading to further polarization of the labour force in the private sector and further austerity in the public sector. The shift in the political environment, on the other hand, has had a more fundamental transformative impact, shaking the institutional underpinnings of collective bargaining. The findings presented here suggest that the Orbán government has been pursuing an ambiguous course in labour relations, combining elements of radical neoliberal reform and state interventionism. Following Bohle and Greskovits’ 2012 framework, these developments are interpreted in the context of broader political-economic contradictions that embedded neoliberal regimes have to confront.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article presents the effects of the current crisis on the processes and outcomes of collective bargaining in Hungary. It is argued that, apart from the direct economic impact, the political changes that were triggered by the crisis have had an even more important role in shaping industrial relations processes and outcomes. The direct economic challenges arising from the crisis have led to a polarization of labour, meaning that partly with the help of concession bargaining, the core workforce in high-end multinationals avoided mass unemployment, while unskilled workers in more precarious positions rapidly lost their jobs. This process shares some resemblance with the dualization of continental western European labour markets, described most aptly by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1024258913480702">Palier and Thelen (2010</xref>). Nevertheless, instead of dualization, I prefer to use the term polarization, because it more clearly reflects the negative consequences of this process for those who are left out from the deals struck in the core segments of the economy. By crisis-related political change I refer to the landslide victory of the FIDESZ party led by Viktor Orbán in the 2010 general elections. The new government initiated fundamental changes in the legal and institutional environment of collective bargaining, bringing further decentralization and degradation of union and employee rights. At the same time, these moves towards decentralization and liberalization were to some extent counterbalanced by direct government intervention in wage setting.</p>
<p>The structure of this article reflects this duality of direct economic impact and government-induced changes. The first part deals with the direct economic impact and focuses on the auto industry as a best practice case of negotiated crisis responses. Nevertheless, this industry is a positive outlier, and its bargaining processes and outcomes should be interpreted in the context of a wider environment that is much more hostile to organized labour. The second part of the article focuses explicitly on the government-induced restructuring of industrial relations after 2010. The Orbán government continued austerity and embarked on restructuring the institutional background of collective bargaining. Besides the employer-friendly provisions of the new Labour Code and the curtailment of union rights, the government directly intervened in wage setting even in the face of employer protests. The effects of continuing austerity and ambiguous political reforms are more closely demonstrated through the example of the hospital sector. Based on the general processes presented and the two sectoral cases, this article establishes that the direct economic effects of the crisis have been limited in the sense that they have only strengthened existing trends of polarization and austerity – they have produced more of the same. On the other hand, the current government’s proactive stance on labour issues has had a transformative impact on the nature of collective bargaining. At this point, the radical neoliberal agenda is more pronounced than the statist ‘noise’, but the long-term balance between these two opposing sets of policies is hard to assess. </p>
<p>The findings of this article support Bohle and Greskovits’ (2012) propositions about the contradictory nature of industrial relations in an embedded neoliberal country such as Hungary. Embedded neoliberal regimes established formal tripartite institutions in the early 1990s, one feature that set them apart from the pure neoliberal Baltic countries. But, in contrast to Slovenia, they were incapable of using these institutions to hammer out corporatist solutions answering the major challenges of transition. Subsequently, formal central-level bargaining was hollowed out by the rapid structural transformation of the economy and the resulting dramatic decline in trade union and employer organization power. In the face of international competition, governments in embedded neoliberal countries embarked on further liberalization of the labour market. However, as Bohle and Greskovits’ (2012) general framework and also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1024258913480702">Meardi’s (2007)</xref> interpretation of post EU-accession labour politics suggest, excesses of the neoliberal project can propel nationalist and populist forces into a government that re-installs stricter state control of the labour market.</p>
<p>This article contends that the peculiarity of the Hungarian case arises from the fact that the Orbán government unites the two opposite poles of neoliberal reform and interventionist countermovement. The government accelerates the neoliberal project by attacking the remnants of labour incorporation and by flexibilizing employment relations, but it partly compensates for the effects of liberalization by intervening in wage setting. Therefore, current developments in the Hungarian bargaining system represent the contradictions of the embedded neoliberal model pushed to the extremes. This paper explores these contradictions, treating them as part of the broader political-economic regime.</p>

<title>Direct economic effects of the crisis on private sector bargaining – more of the same</title>
<p>The global financial crisis arrived in Hungary in October 2008 in the form of sudden current account imbalances. The government had to turn to the IMF and the EU for a bailout package and introduced austerity measures in return. It is worth adding that Hungary had already since 2006 been struggling to bring its public finances under control. Financial troubles were quickly followed by a slump in the export-oriented real economy. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1024258913480702">Table 1</xref> demonstrates, industrial output dropped by 17.8 per cent from 2008 to 2009, and, despite record-breaking export performance since then, it has not fully recovered. GDP exhibits similar trends, with an even more modest recovery since 2010. It is not only modest but also jobless growth, an alarming fact in the Hungarian context. With only 55.4 per cent of the 15–64 population in employment, Hungary has one of the lowest employment rates in the entire EU (Eurostat). Wages show more ambiguous developments, with the government sector bearing the brunt of cuts, but real net wages in the private sector increasing every year since 2008. </p>

<p>This part of the article analyses collective bargaining within the macroeconomic context described above. At this stage, the processes in the private economy will be treated separately from the public sector and from the central-level changes in the institutional and legal background of bargaining. Focusing on the decisions of company-level actors, we found that rather than producing an overall decrease in the importance of collective bargaining, the crisis magnified existing differences. Already before the crisis, the Hungarian industrial relations system was characterized by fragmented, company-level, single-employer bargaining, with limited bargaining coverage. </p>
<p>Continuity in bargaining processes is captured through the stability of bargaining coverage rates. According to the collective agreement database of the Ministry for the National Economy (MKIR), bargaining coverage has remained low, but has exhibited remarkable stability throughout the period. In 2007, collective agreements covered 35.8 per cent of the workforce in the private sector. While this number fell to 32 per cent in 2008, it quickly rebounded to 34.8 per cent in 2009, climbed to 37.6 per cent in 2010 and stayed at the same level in 2011. These numbers imply that the majority of employers did not use the crisis as a pretext to withdraw from collective agreements. At the same time, this stability represents a low-level equilibrium, where the majority of the workforce is left out of collective bargaining altogether. These outsiders were also those who most likely lost their jobs in the wake of the crisis. </p>
<p>In a crisis situation, collective bargaining ideally aims at a compromise between unions and management to preserve employment, while doing the least possible damage to wages and working conditions. Bargaining outcomes are to be judged by these standards. Hungarian unions recognized very early on that they would have to change strategy and concentrate on saving jobs instead of demanding higher wages: they were willing to engage in some form of concession bargaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1024258913480702">Neumann and Boda, 2011</xref>). Given the very low collective action capacities of Hungarian unions, the presence of negotiated responses depended entirely on management’s discretion. Luckily for unions, employers had a clear interest in keeping the core, highly skilled workforce. Companies tried to weather the first waves of the crisis by not hiring new employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1024258913480702">Köllő, 2011</xref>: 57). If later on lay-offs became unavoidable, they usually targeted agency workers and employees on temporary work contracts, who were not covered by collective agreements in the first place. As a result, the crisis led to a growing gap between skilled, unionized insiders with employment stability and unskilled outsiders losing their job. </p>
<p>However, the core workforce also had to endure concessions in the form of more flexible working time rules and wage losses. For working time rules, the crisis served as an accelerator for processes that had started before 2008. For example, working time accounts were introduced in most of the larger Hungarian firms before the onset of the crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1024258913480702">Neumann and Boda 2011</xref>: 84). In terms of remuneration, direct wage cuts were very rare, but the new working time rules allowed a drastic cut in the amount of paid overtime. </p>

<title>Crisis responses in the car industry – best practices?</title>
<p>The case of the car industry demonstrates that a core, high-skilled workforce emerged as a ‘winner’ from the crisis. The automotive industry was the only segment of the Hungarian economy in which negotiated responses played a visible role in protecting employment. At the same time, it is also evident that practices varied widely even within the sector, depending on management attitudes towards collective bargaining, as there is no sectoral agreement in place. To understand why the car industry is an exception rather than the rule in terms of negotiated crisis responses through collective bargaining, we have to take into consideration that, legally, the management is not obliged to negotiate with unions on special measures with regard to work time rescheduling. According to the Labour Code (also the former version) even the most typical corporate adjustment strategy, working time reduction, requires only individual work contract amendments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1024258913480702">Neumann and Boda, 2011</xref>: 92).</p>
<p>Despite the lack of legal obligations to do so, several automobile companies signed agreements with unions on crisis relief measures. As described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1024258913480702">Neumann and Boda (2011</xref>), the management of a German-owned car manufacturer cooperated with unions across the spectrum of employment-related decisions, striking a deal based on safe jobs at the price of working time and variable pay rescheduling. At the end of 2008, after a series of negotiations, an agreement was reached that contained the extension of the Christmas shutdown and introduced 10 days of compulsory paid holiday and a wage freeze. The management maintained the right to specify the date of the extra holidays but it had to comply with certain provisions, for example, a 30 days’ notice period. A second deal was also agreed which limited the end-of-year bonus to one month’s pay and gave 12 days off in return. The exact timing of these holidays was entirely at the management’s discretion with no obligation of advance notice. Finally, the working time account’s reference period was extended until 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1024258913480702">Neumann and Boda, 2011</xref>: 94). Apart from these long-term arrangements, a day-to-day connection was established between employers and employee representatives as three managers and three unionists meet ‘every Monday to evaluate the company’s position and discuss the necessary actions’. Even more importantly, regular negotiations took place between Hungarian and German unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1024258913480702">Neumann and Boda, 2011</xref>: 95). This example was followed by other German-owned companies in high value-added sectors. Another Germany-based car manufacturer, which launched its Hungarian branch in 2012, also shows a positive attitude towards unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1024258913480702">Komiljovics, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>While the above-mentioned carmakers provide best practice examples in terms of crisis management through collective bargaining, the biggest car manufacturing multinational in Hungary adds a strong negative case to the overall picture. The Japanese-owned company has a long history of trying to prevent trade unions from organizing its workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1024258913480702">Komiljovics, 2011a</xref>). This company – partly due to its size – relied heavily on agency workers and dismissed 1 200 out of its 5 900 employees at the onset of crisis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1024258913480702">
<title>The restructuring of bargaining institutions by the Orbán government – changing rules of the game</title>
<p>The crisis also triggered fundamental political changes in Hungary that had clear repercussions for bargaining processes. Socialist premier Ferenc Gyurcsány, who had been in office since 2004 and who started to take the first anti-crisis measures, resigned in early 2009. The succeeding caretaker government pushed on with austerity and some liberalization of the labour market but it also maintained the institutional status quo, consulting with social partners and making some concessions. For example, the 13th month wages of public sector workers were phased out in a way that tried to minimize the damage done to those on the lowest wages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1024258913480702">Tóth et al., 2009</xref>). The elections in 2010 gave conservative FIDESZ a two-thirds majority in the parliament, enabling it to reshape fundamental institutions, including the domain of labour relations. By abandoning tripartism, changing the strike law and introducing a new Labour Code, the new government has rewritten the rules of the game, making it more difficult for unions to stand up for employees’ interests. The government also caused conflict in wage setting by introducing a flat tax system favouring high earners. Subsequent measures aiming to offset the new system’s negative effects for low income groups, on the other hand, were unfavourable to employers.</p>
<p>Concerning the bargaining process, the most important government-initiated change was the abolition of the tripartite National Interest Reconciliation Council (OÉT) and its replacement by the toothless National Economic and Social Council (NGTT). OÉT had an important role as the only peak-level institution where labour policy issues could be discussed and recommendations on annual wage increases could be agreed. Besides, between 2002 and 2010, the government was obliged to reach an agreement with bargaining partners represented in the OÉT on annual minimum wage levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1024258913480702">Komiljovics, 2011b</xref>). The new forum (NGTT) does not have a tripartite structure – it does not include government representatives, but features various ‘non-economic’ civil society organizations – and it has only an advisory instead of a consultative function. The institutional setting of wage bargaining and the power balance between unions and employers was also altered by the amendment of the strike law. The modified legislation stipulates that in case of a dispute on minimum service requirements, industrial action can be launched only with the prior consent of a labour court. The new terms seriously curtail the right to strike in public services, where strikes had been most frequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1024258913480702">Rindt, 2012</xref>). </p>
<p>While the abolition of OÉT and the new strike law altered the bargaining process by decreasing trade union bargaining power, the new Labour Code has direct effects on individual employees as well. Already during its drafting, the new legislation received heavy criticism, not only from national unions but also from the ILO (2011). The government was eventually willing to consult with unions and abandoned the most radical changes in the new law, which came into full effect on 1 January 2013. The new Labour Code undermines employee rights by reconceptualizing the labour contract as a civil law relationship, assuming equal power relations between employers and employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1024258913480702">Tóth, 2012</xref>: 9). According to the new legislation, individual work contracts and collective agreements can now set lower (‘more flexible’) standards than the Labour Code. For example, employers and employees can now agree on basically any distribution of paid holidays in individual contracts and collective agreements. Annual overtime of 250 hours will be allowed in the future, up from the current 200 hours. In addition, the number can even reach 300 hours, if the employer and employees agree on it in the collective agreement or individual contracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1024258913480702">Komiljovics, 2012a</xref>). There are several areas in which employers can lower work standards even without the rubber stamp of individual work contracts or collective agreement modifications. For example, the new legislation clearly stipulates less favourable overtime compensation for employees, and employers can now dismiss employees on sick leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1024258913480702">Tóth, 2012</xref>: 5). </p>
<p>In sum, the new Labour Code is a direct step towards liberalizing bargaining processes and lowering labour standards. At the same time, its supporters frame it as a tool that can help find the way out of the crisis as lower standards will encourage firms to hire more people. The exact effects of the new Labour Code on company-level collective bargaining are difficult to predict. On the one hand, the new law delegates a lot of responsibilities to local-level collective agreements, so that unions could in theory counteract negative national-level trends by being more proactive on the shop floor. Nevertheless, this is a fairly unlikely scenario for at least three reasons. First, the majority of Hungarian workplaces are non-unionized and are not covered by collective agreements at all. Secondly, unions at the workplace have been substantially weakened by the new Labour Code. The number of union officials with guaranteed legal protection and statutory working time exemptions has been reduced and the consultation and information obligation of employers towards unions has been abolished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1024258913480702">Tóth, 2012</xref>: 7, 8). Finally, the new Labour Code gave employers a ‘secret weapon’ by entitling works councils to negotiate collective agreements if there is no union at the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1024258913480702">Komiljovics, 2012a</xref>). Employers can now even set up ‘puppet’ works councils and sign a collective agreement with them, thereby putting a rubber stamp on declining working conditions.</p>
<p>While the new Labour Code altered conditions for collective bargaining, the introduction of a flat tax system directly disrupted wage setting. As a central element of its economic and social policy, the new government introduced a 16 per cent flat-rate personal income tax, benefiting top earners (previously, the tax rate in the top bracket was 32 per cent). To counteract the regressive effects of the new system, the government directly intervened in wage setting by developing a compensation scheme for low earners. In the public sector, this took the form of direct subsidies from the central budget to service providers, whereas in the private sector the cost of compensation was expected to be borne by employers. The government tried to pressure employers to comply in three ways: by increasing the statutory minimum wage, by excluding from public procurement those firms which did not compensate and by providing subsidies to those firms who lacked the means to compensate. Each of these mechanisms achieved only partial success. From 2011 to 2012, the minimum wage was increased by 19 per cent, from 78 000 to 93 000 forints. The increase harmed employers who use low-skilled labour and also caused wage compression problems in some sectors, as we will see from the example of hospitals. The second and third mechanisms are much weaker. By 2012, it turned out that the government would not use the sanction mechanism at all: it will not exclude non-compensating firms from public procurement. Whether employers compensate for the negative effects of the new tax system depends on their financial situation, local management decisions and bargaining practices. Several news sources reported on the absence of wage compensation and the resulting industrial conflict in the retail sector and at a tire-manufacturing multinational (Világgazdaság Online, 2 March 2011). It is plausible to infer that smaller firms were even less likely to make the compensatory wage increases. </p>
<p>As is evident from the examples presented above, in Hungary not only the process but also the outcomes of collective bargaining have been shaped fundamentally by the broader political environment. The government disbanded the tripartite consultative forum and favoured employers with the new Labour Code. Unions were forced to direct their limited capacities towards challenging government measures: instead of tackling the direct economic effects of the crisis through company or sector-level bargaining strategies, unions had to engage in a state-centred struggle to save the legal foundations of labour incorporation. However, the government also intervened in wage developments in a way that is detrimental to employer interests. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1024258913480702">
<title>The impact of crisis-driven austerity and government decisions on the hospital sector</title>
<p>The way in which crisis-driven austerity and unilateral government decisions altered bargaining processes and outcomes in the public sector will be illustrated by the case of the hospital sector. Hospitals were selected for analysis because they form a relatively homogenous, publicly financed sub-sector of health care. Similar trends are observable in public education, but it is harder to get a grip on them because of the more dispersed nature of the school system. Our findings suggest that, as in the private sector, the economic side of the crisis did not bring qualitative change: it only intensified the austerity situation that has been present in the sector since 2006. In terms of bargaining processes, however, the government’s new policies are fundamentally reshaping the institutional set-up. </p>
<p>Collective bargaining traditionally plays a minor role in determining employment relations in the Hungarian health care sector. The most important aspects of health care employment are regulated by laws which are often modified by the governing parliamentary majority. The basic elements of remuneration until 2012 were settled by the law on public service employees, featuring a pay scale based on qualifications and seniority. The law also set a baseline for variable pay. From July 2012 onwards, the public sector pay scale was replaced by separate pay scales for different health care employee groups (nurses and doctors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1024258913480702">Kőszegfalvi, 2012</xref>). However, the principles of pay determination based on qualifications and seniority remained intact.</p>
<p>Before the changes introduced by the current government, unions had two ways to influence wage setting and working conditions in the hospital sector. First, the government was obliged to consult with public sector trade unions on wage developments at a peak-level consultative forum (OKÉT). Secondly, as the owners of hospitals were local governments, collective agreements were concluded at every local hospital establishment. Depending on local power relations and the financial capacities of local governments, these agreements could go beyond the centrally set minimum. Now, both of these channels of union influence were impeded by the government. OKÉT’s influence on public sector wage setting has weakened substantially as the pay scales in different branches of the public service are separated and, from 2012 on, the central government is taking over ownership of hospitals from local governments. The first move is clearly to the detriment of unions’ bargaining capacities. However, the ‘re-centralization’ of hospitals might turn out to be less destructive in the long run. Under the decentralized system, an ill-defined distribution of responsibilities between the central government and local administrations led to the obfuscation of employer responsibilities. The new, centralized system will have the advantage that employees will at least know exactly to whom to address their claims.</p>
<p>In terms of bargaining outcomes, the crisis led to a further shrinkage of government resources, necessitating wage cuts in health care. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that austerity did not arrive with the global crisis. From 2006 on, health care became the target of cost-cutting reforms at the central level and local-level collective agreements were unable to act as a counterbalance. Although bargaining coverage remained very high in the hospital sector (around 80 per cent), real net wages dropped or stagnated throughout the period 2007–2011. The year 2007 already marked a 6.2 per cent real wage drop, which was practically followed by stagnation (+0.8 per cent) in 2008 and one more significant cutback (–5.1 per cent) in 2009. The balance of the years since the new government came into power is also negative (+2.2 per cent in 2010 and –5.4 per cent in 2011). (MKIR, KSH)</p>
<p>In addition, government interventions in wage setting since 2011 have also created conflicts in the health care sector. The introduction of the flat tax left the majority of health care employees with falling net wages, which had to be compensated from the public budget (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1024258913480702">Dreissiger, 2012</xref>). Minimum wages are also of relevance for health care employees, as the lowest categories of the public service pay scale fall from time to time below the minimum wage, and therefore they need to be topped up. The recent drastic hike in the minimum wage and the parallel stagnation of the public service pay scale caused serious wage compression problems, leaving qualified nurses close to the same wage level as the cleaning staff. </p>
<p>It seems that the main health care union (EDDSZ) is incapable of meeting these challenges as it is riven by internal conflicts and faces a continuous membership decline. On the other hand, the relatively new interest organization for resident physicians has managed to obtain concessions from the government by highlighting the issue of medical staff emigration. In early 2011, around 2 500 resident physicians handed in their resignations, signalling a clear intention to leave the country for much higher wages in ‘old’ EU Member States. In response, the government started to take steps to improve remuneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1024258913480702">Komiljovics, 2012b</xref>). According to the agreement signed in March 2012, 30 billion forints (around €110m) were allocated to wage increases for 86 000 medical workers. This measure is seen as a first step in aligning Hungarian hospital sector wages to the European average, as currently they are low even by regional comparison (the lowest gross basic salary of a doctor in Hungary is €475, while the same figure in Slovakia is €1 494) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1024258913480702">Reginato and Grosso, 2012</xref>). The increase for 2012 was implemented by law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1024258913480702">Kőszegfalvi, 2012</xref>), but it remains a question how this process can be sustained in the face of continuously rigorous public budgets. Besides, it is dubious how campaigns of new interest groups can substitute the traditional channels of interest representation through unions and doctors’ associations.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In Hungary, collective bargaining processes and outcomes have been reshaped fundamentally since the outbreak of the economic crisis in 2008. This restructuring was not so much the direct result of the economic crisis, but rather followed indirectly from crisis-related political changes. As has been demonstrated with the two sectoral cases, the economic effects of the crisis intensified processes that had started before 2008: they led to more polarization in the private sector and more austerity in the public sector. These effects are largely identical to what occurred in many other EU countries. The shift in the political environment, however, caused a rapid change in the institutional underpinnings of collective bargaining, making Hungary a special case within the EU. Therefore, the article has paid particular attention to how the new political environment has affected bargaining processes and outcomes. The findings presented here suggest that the Orbán government pursued a radical neoliberal and statist agenda simultaneously. Radical neoliberal reforms included the flexibilization of employment relations, the curtailing of union rights and the dissolution of the national tripartite consultative forum. On the other hand, the government also took an activist stance in industrial relations by directly intervening in wage policy and centralizing public sector services.</p>
<p>When weighing the relative importance of these two sets of opposing policies, the scale tilts towards neoliberalism. While the attack on union rights and bargaining institutions is enshrined in a new Labour Code and indicative of a coherent approach, the interventionist measures lack coherence, are often transitory and difficult to implement. Rather than stopping the polarization process, they have only created uncertainty among employers and tensions in the labour force. We also have to keep in mind that even though statist policies compensate certain employee groups for the negative effects of neoliberal reforms, they do this by circumventing bargaining institutions and representatives of organized labour. At the same time, it would be also too easy to dismiss the statist measures as plasters on a purely neoliberal project. At this point, the government seems determined to continue this contradictory course and to flex its muscles against employers as part of its broader agenda of building a strong state in Hungary. </p>
<p>Recent developments in the country’s industrial relations system fit Bohle and Greskovits’ description of Hungary as a case of crisis-related political destabilization within central and eastern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1024258913480702">Bohle and Greskovits, 2012</xref>: 242). According to their framework, embedded neoliberal regimes (represented by the Visegrad countries) are in general prone to political instability. Governments have to balance the provision of social protection, the maintenance of fiscal stability and re-election considerations. Due to several coinciding factors, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland have managed to coordinate these tasks relatively successfully during the crisis, whereas in Hungary the reconciliation task became close to impossible, even for the seemingly all-powerful Orbán government. </p>
<p>The changes in collective bargaining institutions and outcomes are connected to this political instability. The Orbán government is dismantling the remaining institutional guarantees of labour incorporation, but it also directly performs tasks which under a better functioning collective bargaining system could be carried out by unions and employer associations. Thus an overloaded and contradictory government agenda arises, which feeds back into political instability. </p>
