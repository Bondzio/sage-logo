<p>In his <italic>Climate Change &amp; Society</italic>, John Urry offers social theory as an alternative form of explanation and description of problems surrounding climate change, compared against currently dominant analyses by economists and natural scientists, since “climate change and resource scarcity are the result of social processes” (p. 2). Taking the <italic>Stern Review</italic> as an exemplar of the way that social scientists have viewed the problem, Urry contends that economics is unable to explain, much less promote, the preference transformation necessary for transition to low-carbon societies, claiming that it thus “needs to be displaced from its preeminent or imperialist role in examining and explaining the ‘human’ causes and consequences of climate change” (p. 5). Of other leading sociological treatments of climate change, Urry criticizes Ulrich Beck for being “unsatisfactorily vague” (p. 13) on prescriptions and Anthony Giddens for being “not sufficiently sociological” (p. 15) in his emphasis on politics and policy rather than social practices, and makes no mention of recent works by political scientists and philosophers that address much of the same social phenomena that he examines here. While perhaps overstating the novelty of his contribution to a growing interdisciplinary field by ignoring or too hastily dismissing much of that field, Urry’s analysis nonetheless engages various social drivers of and responses to climate change in a fresh and accessible manner, displaying wide-ranging command of his subject.</p>
<p>Urry promises to elaborate a “post-carbon sociology” (p. 16) that is appropriate to the task at hand, in contrast with post-Fordist and postmodern sociologies that presumably are not. To this end, he identifies “three major discourses” on climate change in <italic>skepticism</italic> (or denial of the predictions of climate science), <italic>gradualism</italic> (based on the claim that changes are slow and societies can adjust in time, and identified with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), and <italic>catastrophism</italic> (cast as critical of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s failure to account for feedback effects of temperature increases on ice sheets, but generally more alarmist that mainstream climate science), suggesting that contests over the science have been between gradualists and catastrophists. Constructions of global warming, he argues, have not been significantly shaped by skepticism—a claim that may be true of the United Kingdom but which would certainly not apply to debates in the United States or in Australia, where skeptics have played a more prominent role. He goes on to detail the issue’s emergence onto the social and policy agenda, suggesting that “there is something missing” in scientific analyses of climate change: namely, that these accounts omit the “very nature of the ‘human activities’ seemingly responsible for generating increased GHG emissions” (p. 35). While perhaps true that scientific explanations of climate change only note the drivers of climate change in fossil fuel combustion and deforestation rather than exploring the social roots of these phenomena, and that economists typically view these as “the consequence of individual behavior and preference” rather than seeing them as resulting from historically and socially embedded norms and practices, Urry again overstates the paucity of existing scholarly analyses by omitting mention of a significant and growing literature on consumerism and consumption that does what he finds lacking in the literature that he does survey. Nonetheless, he builds on what he terms the “new catastrophism” literature on ecological collapse, coming largely out of political geography and anthropology and in which as he notes “sociology does not figure much” (p. 38), in exploring the social roots of climate change, as well as of its potential remedies.</p>
<p>Some parts of Urry’s analysis cover well-trodden ground: For example, he reminds his readers that ecological limits render impossible the export of the American Dream, that consumerist norms and neoliberal ideology are implicated in high-carbon lifestyles and that population growth exacerbates global carbon footprints. Those familiar with the social science of ecological limits will find relatively few novel insights here. He also gets a few facts wrong, as with his claim that NASA climatologist James Hansen was George W. Bush’s “main climate change adviser” (it was James Connaughton—Hansen had no role in the Bush White House and was a frequent critic of its climate policies). But much of the work is original and insightful, and all is accessible and highly readable. Not surprisingly, given his prior work in the area, Urry’s chapter on mobilities is among the stronger ones. Since 20% of global carbon emissions come from transport, which is highly dependent on the social organization of urban spaces and transit systems, close attention to mobility as a social aspect of existing carbon dependency and potential low-carbon futures makes sense and has been little explored elsewhere at this level of detail, and so closely and coherently linked to other related social phenomena.</p>
<p>Perhaps most poignant in capturing the challenge of reorienting existing societies toward more sustainable forms of energy use is Urry’s portrayal of Dubai as a “place of energy excess” (p. 72), which he compares to other “places of high carbon” like Macao, Las Vegas, and Abu Dhabi, and situates within a desire for mobility and detachment from the conventional rules of nature and place, as well as the “casino capitalism” of rampant borrowing and speculation in developing rootless villages built on cheap oil and real estate bubbles. As illustrations of the ongoing ability to deny the catastrophism that Urry surveys, and indeed to defy the logic of ecological limits along with the basic geological and ecological facts of the terrain on which such places are constructed, Urry’s descriptions here simultaneously fascinate and terrify. Also strong is Urry’s vision for a “post-car” (and low carbon) world, where alternative forms of mobility both drive and be driven by sustainability imperatives, with obstacles to their widespread deployment more social than technological. After suggesting that electric vehicles might “contest the dominant high carbon car system” (p. 134), he describes yet more futuristic personal transport technologies, including “de-privatized” and driverless pods that would move persons from place to place within urban spaces, personal carbon allowances as currency, and elaborate tracking technologies for both humans and goods in motion. Here, as elsewhere, such powerful observations are more episodic than systematic, but the book’s compelling parts nonetheless add up to a satisfying, if not always unified or comprehensive, whole.</p>
