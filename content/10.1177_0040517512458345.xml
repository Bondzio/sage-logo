<abstract>
<p>Polylactic acid (PLA) has received considerable attention as a biomass material in the textile industry. To use PLA fiber in the textile industry, suitable post-processing is needed. To establish enzymatic finishing of PLA fibers, we evaluated the hydrolytic activities of two representative lipolytic enzymes; lipase and esterase. In addition, we established the optimal hydrolytic treatment conditions of each enzyme. Results showed that the optimal lipase and esterase treatment conditions are a pH of 8.0, a temperature of 40°C, a concentration of 10% owf, and a calcium chloride concentration of 10 mM. PLA fabrics experienced a weight loss of about 0.7% from enzyme treatment with no loss of tensile strength. Biodeterioration due to enzymatic hydrolysis were observed in scanning electron microscopy images. There was an approximately twofold improvement in moisture regain by enzymatic hydrolysis. Finally, X-ray diffractometry identified a new peak localized at 2θ = 18.5° after enzyme treatment. The degree of crystallinity was increased and the crystallite size was decreased.</p>

<body>
<p>Polylactic acid (PLA) has received considerable attention as a biomass material in the textile industry. PLA is linear aliphatic thermoplastic polyester made of lactic acid (2-hydroxy propionic acid) building blocks and can be derived from 100% renewable sources such as corn.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517512458345">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512458345">2</xref></sup> PLA fibers are highly marketable owing to the low unit cost of their raw materials and are biodegradable. Therefore, they have the potential to replace conventional petrochemical-based polymers in industry.<sup>3</sup> With the increasing interest in environment, the usage of PLA has expanded to not only technical textile such as nonwoven, plastic paper, packing material or films, but also clothing textiles.<sup>3</sup> In addition, PLA fiber is similar to polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fiber in terms of the Young’s modulus, glass-transition temperature, and density. Hence, PLA has received attention as a possible alternative to PET fibers in the garment industry because its ability to regain moisture is superior to that of PET, having good hand of drape and feel, and its excellent shape retention and crease resistant.<sup>4</sup> However, its resistance to hydrolysis is worse than that of other synthetic fibers such as polyesters, nylon, and polypropylene (PP). In general, PLA fabrics are dyed with disperse dye, however, when treated with PET conditions, PLA fabrics could be damaged since PLA has a low glass-transition temperature.<sup>5,6</sup> Therefore, suitable conditions of dyeing or finishing PLA fiber must be done carefully and confirmed because of its limited solubility in other chemicals.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Among the suitable finishing for using PLA fibers in the textile industry, enzymatic processing, one of the more popular eco-friendly processing methods, is suggested.<sup>7</sup> This method was first proposed and introduced as a biotechnology option because it is compatible with existing equipment and hence can be expected to have reduced costs, energy requirements, and water pollution. Enzymatic processing does not cause environmental pollution, and it is beneficial to the fiber because it minimizes fiber damage. It has been particularly encouraged for use with natural, synthetic, and recycled fibers, and it has proven to be effective and environmentally friendly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512458345">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0040517512458345">14</xref></sup> Unlike pre-treatments such as alkaline treatment on PLA fabrics, when treated with enzymes, there will be no fiber damage, but some properties such as hydrophilicity will be increased. However, there have been few comprehensive studies presented to show the improvement in the properties of PLA fibers when they are subjected to enzyme hydrolysis. Furthermore, there are a few studies on lipases;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512458345">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0040517512458345">15</xref></sup> however, there are no studies on esterase, which has characteristics similar to lipases for the hydrolysis of PLA fabric. In addition, to enhance the effect of enzyme hydrolysis, special additives such as dissociable cofactor or metal ions may be involved in the catalytic reaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512458345">16</xref></sup> These are enzyme activators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512458345">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517512458345">12</xref></sup> Metal ions associated with enzyme hydrolysis are Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>; enzyme activators in the area of textile processing include L-cysteine, sodium sulfite, sodium chloride, and calcium chloride.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0040517512458345">17</xref></sup> In general, lipolytic enzymes show higher activation when Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are added,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0040517512458345">18</xref></sup> so CaCl<sub>2</sub> must also be added to ensure an appropriate lipase performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0040517512458345">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of enzymatic hydrolysis on PLA fabrics by lipase and esterase. For this, commercial lipase from <italic>Candida cylindracea</italic> and esterase from <italic>porcine pancreas</italic> were used and compared for their effectiveness as enzymes on the hydrolysis. These two lipolytic enzymes are known to have outstanding capacity to hydrolyze ester bonds in PLA fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512458345">3</xref></sup> In addition, CaCl<sub>2</sub> was added to the enzymatic solution and evaluated its effect as an activator when PLA fiber is subjected to enzyme hydrolysis. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of the enzyme-treated PLA fibers were determined based on weight loss, tensile strength, and X-ray scattering diffractometry results, and then surface morphologies of the PLA fibers were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Finally, the effects of the surface modification of PLA fibers were assessed by measuring the moisture regain and surface wettability.</p>

<p>One hundred percent PLA yarn of 84 dtex with 72 DTY-type filaments was supplied by Huvis. PLA fabrics were woven to the specification listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0040517512458345">Table 1</xref> for the experiments. As the enzyme, a lipase from <italic>C. cylindracea</italic> and esterase from <italic>P. pancreas</italic> manufactured by Sigma was used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0040517512458345">Table 2</xref>). Tris (hydroxymethyl) amino methane (pKa = 8.06 at 20°C; Sigma Chemical Co., USA) was used as a buffer for the enzyme. p-Nitrophenlybutyrate (p-NPB, Sigma Chemical Co., USA), sodium phosphate monobasic (pKa = 7.2, Sigma Chemical Co., USA), sodium phosphate dibasic (pKa = 7.2, Sigma Chemical Co., USA), Triton X-100, and sodium chloride were used for measuring the hydrolytic activity of the enzymes. Calcium chloride (Junsei Chemicals, Japan) was used as an enzyme activator. Ethyl alcohol (Duksan Pure Chemicals, Korea) was used for enzymatic inactivation of the samples.

<p>All enzymatic treatment of the PLA fabrics was performed in a 50 mM buffer with a liquor-to-fabric ratio of 100:1. Hydrolytic activity was measured at different pH, temperatures, enzyme concentrations, and CaCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations for 60 min. PLA fabrics were treated with enzyme at 150 rpm using a shaking water bath (BS-21, Jeio Tech., Korea). Following treatment, the residual enzyme in all of the treated samples was inactivated and denatured using 70% ethanol. After inactivation, the samples were thoroughly washed by sonication for 15 min, washed with distilled water at a liquor-to-fabric ratio of 100:1, and then dried at room temperature.</p>

This is because the enzyme is very sensitive to alkaline pH and is denatured at higher temperatures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512458345">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512458345">16</xref></sup> At the same temperature, the hydrolytic activity was the highest at pH 8.0, followed by at pH 9.0 and 7.0. In addition, hydrolytic activity decreased by 40% at pH 10.0 and 11.0. In general, for most of the enzymes, the optimum pH is in the neutral range of 7.0–9.0, and an alkaline medium destroys the overall structure of the enzyme.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512458345">16</xref></sup> Thus, the dependence of enzyme activity on pH often takes the form of a bell-shaped titration curve with the maximum usually in the neutral range (pH optimum).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512458345">16</xref></sup> In this study, the hydrolytic activity was the highest at pH 8.0 and a temperature of 50°C; however, the activity was unstable depending on the pH levels. In contrast, the hydrolytic activity at a pH of 8.0 and temperature of 40°C indicated similar values to that under the previous conditions but was stable regardless of the various pH values.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512458345">Figure 1(b)</xref> shows the hydrolytic activity of the esterase depending on various pH levels; the highest activity was at pH 8.0 for most temperatures and showed the lowest activity at pH 7.0. The hydrolytic activity by esterase at pH 8.0 and 40°C was twice as high as that treated at pH 7.0 and 40°C. The hydrolytic activity shaped the fluent increase curve as temperature increased until 40°C. Over 40°C, the hydrolytic activity rapidly decreased and showed a bell curve at pH 8.0 and 8.5. At pH 7.0, 9.0, and 9.5, the hydrolytic activity plateaued from 30 to 50°C and then increased until 60°C. Above 60°C, the hydrolytic activity decreased rapidly. Enzyme activity increases with temperature up to the optimum temperature, beyond which hydrolytic activity decreases sharply as the tertiary structure is disrupted through thermal agitation leading to denaturation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0040517512458345">26</xref></sup> The hydrolytic activity decreased sharply when treated at a temperature of 60°C at all pH levels. When treated with esterase under 60°C, the gap in hydrolytic activity was bigger depending on pH levels than on temperature values. In other words, the effects of pH on esterase hydrolysis are important, and the optimum pH must be established when esterase treatment. Therefore, the optimal conditions for maximum hydrolysis were identified to be pH 8.0 and temperature of 40°C.</p>

The hydrolytic activity demonstrated a linear increase as the enzyme concentration increased. However, it coagulated at 50% owf. As coagulation occurred, the hydrolytic activity became unstable. Hydrolytic activity dependent on enzyme concentration is unstable because the enzyme reacts with the substrate and results in a state of equilibrium; however, some of the denatured enzyme protein produces coagulation in the solution when excess enzyme is used. That is, when measuring enzymatic activity, the turbid solution made from coagulation effects the absorbance of enzymatic activity, so the solution absorbance could be increased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512458345">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0040517512458345">27</xref></sup> In this study, we generally discretized the enzyme concentration at 10% owf for lipase and esterase before solidification.</p>

However, when 30 mM of CaCl<sub>2</sub> was added, turbidity occurred in the solution. This is because at low salt concentrations, the solubility of an enzyme increases; however, the high level of interaction between the added ions and aqueous solvent reduces the interaction between the protein and water, leading to precipitation of the enzyme from the solution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0040517512458345">27</xref></sup> Therefore, CaCl<sub>2</sub> promotes the hydrolytic activity of lipase and esterase, and the optimum concentration is 10 mM.

<p>The physical changes in enzyme-treated PLA fabrics were measured based on the weight loss, tensile strength, and surface morphology. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512458345">Figure 4</xref> shows (a) the weight loss and (b) the tensile strength of PLA fabrics treated by enzyme under optimum hydrolytic activity conditions. As shown in the figure, enzymatic treatments made no big differences in tensile strength of PLA fabrics. In addition, all data were analyzed statistically at a 95% confidence interval. With enzyme treatment, the weight loss of the PLA fabrics was 0.62% by lipase and 0.75% by esterase, respectively, since the ester bonds of the PLA fiber were hydrolyzed; at this level of weight loss, the tensile strength did not decrease significantly. Considering that the weight loss was by about 0.7%, few decrease in tensile strength in a 95% confidence interval was a reasonable result.

This implies that the hydrolysis of the PLA fabrics was concentrated on the cleavage of the ester bond of the polymer; hence, some weight loss occurred; however, no noticeable degradation such as cracks and fibrils was detected. At 10,000× magnification, the untreated surface was clear; however, the enzyme-treated surface had fine particles, microbubbles, on the surface of the fiber.

<p>The structural change of PLA fiber was evaluated using XRD. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517512458345">Figure 6</xref> shows the XRD spectra of PLA fabrics treated by enzymes under optimum hydrolytic activity conditions.

<p>In addition, as shown by the highest crystal peak near 16°, the integral width was narrowed by enzymatic treatment; this means that the crystallite size of the polymer was decreased. In addition, enzymatic treatment caused a third peak at 18.5° to appear, indicating morphological changes. The new peak indicates a physical change in the short chains of polymers that are more mobile due to hydrolysis of the amorphous region of PLA polymer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0040517512458345">31</xref></sup> Enzymes, especially those originating from the <italic>porcine pancreas</italic>, <italic>Candida cylindracea</italic>, and <italic>Rhizopus arrhieus</italic> hydrolyze the amorphous region of the PLA polymer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0040517512458345">32</xref></sup> The new peak was detected significantly by lipase which has 25% increase of crystallinity, hence, by esterase, although the third peak was indicated at 18.5, the intensity of peak are smaller than by esterase treatment because of there is few change of crystallinity. Therefore, through experimental XRD, we concluded that structural changes were caused by enzyme treatment that produced the highest hydrolytic activity of the PLA fibers.</p>
<p>We confirmed through experimentation that the appearances of the PLA fabrics were changed and the hydrophilic properties were improved after enzymatic hydrolysis. Also, the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme resulted in structural changes to the fiber.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-0040517512458345"><title>Hydrophilic properties</title>
<p>The hydrophilic properties were evaluated on the basis of moisture regain and surface wettability, including the water contact angle (WCA). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517512458345">Figure 7</xref> shows the moisture regain of PLA fabrics treated with enzymes under optimum hydrolytic activity conditions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517512458345">Figure 7</xref>, the moisture regain was improved by enzymatic treatment. The moisture regain of untreated PLA fabric was 0.72% ± 0.03%; enzymatic treatment resulted in an approximately twofold improvement in moisture regain. The moisture regain of PLA fabrics was 1.49% ± 0.03% by lipase and 1.53% ± 0.16% by esterase. In spite of increasing crystallinity by enzymatic hydrolysis, moisture regain of enzyme-treated PLA fabrics was increased. This can be explained by some factors. First, the increase in moisture regain with enzymatic treatment indicated that enzymatic hydrolysis is concentrated on ester linkages and facilitated by the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups produced in PLA fabrics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0040517512458345">19</xref></sup> Increasing of carboxyl concentration due to polymer hydrolysis made PLA fabrics hydrophilic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0040517512458345">26</xref></sup> Second, microbubbles from weak biodeterioration by enzymatic hydrolysis resulting in increase of moisture regain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0040517512458345">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0040517512458345">29</xref></sup> Even though amorphous region of PLA fiber were decreased, the surface of the fiber could be hydrophilic because of microorganisms formed on the fiber surface by biodeterioration. Third, crystallinity was influenced by the fiber; however, the moisture regain was measured by the fabric form. Therefore, moisture regain did not only relate to crystallinity unconditionally, but also the pore size of the fabric or space between the weave. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517512458345">Figure 8</xref> indicates the surface wettability through the WCA of PLA fabrics treated by enzymes under optimum hydrolytic activity conditions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517512458345">Figure 8</xref>, the WCA of untreated PLA fabric was 85° ± 4°. The WCA decreased to 79° ± 2° after lipase treatment and 84° ± 6° after esterase treatment. In general, the WCA decreased with hydrolysis of the fiber surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0040517512458345">33</xref></sup> In this study, even though the moisture regain increased drastically, the WCA showed a decrease. It is due to the difference in moisture particle sizes which are used to measure the moisture regain and the WCA. The moisture regain examined conditioning in 65% of relative humidity for 24 hours, so fine particles of moisture could permeate into the hydrolyzed PLA fabrics; however, the WCA was measured with larger particles, 3 μl of water drops. Thus, it causes the significant difference between the moisture regain and the WCA results. From the results based on the moisture regain and WCA, the hydrophilic properties of PLA fabrics are improved after enzymatic treatment.

<p>To establish a bio-refinery of PLA fibers, we evaluated the hydrolytic activities of lipase and esterase for PLA fibers. We also established the optimal hydrolytic treatment conditions for the enzymes, which are pH 8.0, a temperature of 40°C, and an enzyme concentration of 10% owf for 60 min. Calcium chloride is an effective activator of lipase and esterase and the optimal concentration is 10 mM.</p>
<p>PLA fabrics experienced weight losses of about 0.62% and 0.75% from lipase and esterase treatment, respectively, but there was no significant decrease in tensile strength. In SEM images, we confirmed that hydrolysis on the fiber surface begins with microbubbles.</p>
<p>There was an approximately 2.0-fold improvement in moisture regain as a result of the enzyme treatment, and the WCA was decreased. The XRD pattern results revealed a new peak localized at 2θ = 18.5° after enzymatic treatment. The degree of crystallinity was increased and the crystallite size was decreased.</p>
