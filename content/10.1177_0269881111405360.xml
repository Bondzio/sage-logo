<abstract>
<p>To evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin in facilitating taper off chronic benzodiazepines, outpatients (<italic>N</italic> = 106) with a lifetime diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (current diagnosis could be subthreshold) who had been treated with a benzodiazepine for 8–52 weeks were stabilized for 2–4 weeks on alprazolam in the range of 1–4 mg/day. Patients were then randomized to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with either pregabalin 300–600 mg/day or placebo while undergoing a gradual benzodiazepine taper at a rate of 25% per week, followed by a 6-week benzodiazepine-free phase during which they continued double-blind study treatment. Outcome measures included ability to remain benzodiazepine-free (primary) as well as changes in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM)-A and Physician Withdrawal Checklist (PWC). At endpoint, a non-significant higher proportion of patients remained benzodiazepine-free receiving pregabalin compared with placebo (51.4% vs 37.0%). Treatment with pregabalin was associated with significantly greater endpoint reduction in the HAM-A total score versus placebo (−2.5 vs +1.3; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and lower endpoint mean PWC scores (6.5 vs 10.3; <italic>p</italic> = 0.012). Thirty patients (53%) in the pregabalin group and 19 patients (37%) in the placebo group completed the study, reducing the power to detect a significant difference on the primary outcome. The results on the anxiety and withdrawal severity measures suggest that switching to pregabalin may be a safe and effective method for discontinuing long-term benzodiazepine therapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Benzodiazepines continue to be the most widely prescribed class of drugs for anxiety, used by an estimated 2.5% of the adult population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881111405360">Paulose-Ram et al., 2004</xref>). Compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants, the speed of onset and potent anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines have ensured their continued use despite significant problems with abuse, dependence, withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881111405360">Woods et al., 1992</xref>) and regulatory efforts to limit prescribing in the United States and other countries. Safety concerns related to benzodiazepine therapy include impairments in cognition, memory, attention, reaction time and psychomotor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881111405360">Buffett-Jerrott and Stewart, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881111405360">Curran, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881111405360">Woods et al., 1992</xref>). Benzodiazepine-related psychomotor impairment is associated with a threefold increase in the risk of being involved in a traffic accident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881111405360">Engeland et al., 2007</xref>) and a 50% increase in falls among individuals aged 60 years and older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881111405360">Leipzig et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Treatment guidelines recommend that use of benzodiazepines should be limited to short-term treatment; however, surveys indicate a median duration of use of almost 2 years among adults currently using a benzodiazepine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881111405360">Paulose-Ram et al., 2004</xref>). Among individuals with a DSM-IV diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, tranquilizer abuse and/or dependence occurred in 10.2%, increasing to 34.4% when a comorbid depressive disorder was present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881111405360">Conway et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Chronic treatment with benzodiazepines results in <bold>γ</bold>-aminobutyric acid A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptor downregulation characterized by reduced allosteric coupling between benzodiazepine and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and a reduction in the expression of genes encoding the α1, α5 and <bold>γ</bold>2 GABA subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881111405360">Holt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881111405360">Hu and Ticku, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111405360">Klein and Harris, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881111405360">Wu et al., 1994</xref>). It has been hypothesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881111405360">Schweizer and Rickels, 1998</xref>) that the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome results from a relative loss of inhibitory modulation in neurotransmission due to the reduction in GABA receptor sensitivity. Overactivity in downstream receptors (e.g. noradrenergic, serotonergic) are thought to contribute to withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, insomnia, irritability, tremor, diaphoresis, diarrhea and derealization. The CNS hyperexcitability occurring during benzodiazepine withdrawal may, in rare instances, result in a seizure. Preliminary studies suggest that treatment with the benzodiazepine agonist flumazenil may upregulate the GABA receptor and reduce withdrawal symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881111405360">Gerra et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881111405360">Saxon et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Switching from benzodiazepines to other anxiolytic drugs has not been well studied and is complicated by the risk of a withdrawal syndrome, which is more likely to occur as the duration of benzodiazepine treatment increases beyond eight weeks and as the alprazolam dose increases above 2 mg/day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881111405360">Schweizer and Rickels, 1998</xref>). A variety of medications, from multiple different classes, have been studied as potential treatments for benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms and to facilitate discontinuation in patients who are benzodiazepine dependent. The results have been generally disappointing, including treatment with agents such as β-blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111405360">Cantopher et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881111405360">Hallstrom et al., 1988</xref>), the 5HT1A partial agonist buspirone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881111405360">Ashton et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881111405360">Chiaie et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881111405360">Lader and Olajide, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881111405360">Rickels et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881111405360">Schweizer and Rickels, 1986</xref>), anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine and valproate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881111405360">Rickels et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881111405360">Schweizer et al., 1991</xref>), various antidepressants including dothiepin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881111405360">Tyrer et al., 1996</xref>) and trazodone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881111405360">Ansseau and de Roeck, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881111405360">Rickels et al., 1999b</xref>), the α2 adrenergic agonist clonidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881111405360">Roy-Byrne et al., 1993</xref>), and the neuroactive steroid progesterone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881111405360">Schweizer et al., 1995</xref>). Some preliminary benefit in treating benzodiazepine withdrawal has been reported using the antidepressants imipramine and paroxetine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881111405360">Nakao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881111405360">Rickels et al., 2000</xref>). It should be noted that the sample sizes and methodologic rigor of available studies are generally low, as suggested by a Cochrane meta-analysis that found only 8 studies that met minimal quality criteria out of 753 studies identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881111405360">Denis et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Pregabalin has demonstrated efficacy in the management of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in seven randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881111405360">Kasper et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881111405360">Montgomery, 2006</xref>) with minimal evidence for dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881111405360">Montgomery, 2006</xref>) or cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881111405360">Hindmarch et al., 2005</xref>). Although pregabalin is the <italic>(S)</italic>-enantiomer of 3-isobutylgaba, it has no direct activity at GABA<sub>A</sub> or GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor sites. Pregabalin does not act indirectly to augment GABAergic function, either via GABA reuptake or via a benzodiazepine-type mechanism, by binding to one of the allosteric modulatory sites located at the interface between the <bold>γ</bold>
<sub>2</sub> subunit and either an α<sub>1</sub>, α<sub>2</sub>, α<sub>3</sub> or α<sub>5</sub> subunit of the GABA receptor complex. Instead, pregabalin is presumed to act by binding to the α<sub>2</sub>δ subunit of N-type and P/Q-type calcium channels. The α<sub>2</sub>δ subunit binding reduces the influx of calcium triggered by an action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881111405360">Dooley et al., 2007</xref>). As a result, the ability of synaptic vesicles to fuse with the presynaptic membrane and release neurotransmitter is reduced, thus damping down further propagation of the action potential. Thus, while benzodiazepines augment activity in the inhibitory GABAergic system, pregabalin reduces excitatory activity in stimulated neuronal systems. This unique mechanism is associated with a broad-spectrum activity in treating conditions characterized by neuronal hyperexcitability such as epilepsy, neuropathic pain, anxiety and fibromyalgia.</p>
<p>Since benzodiazepine withdrawal is characterized by overactivity in neuronal systems released from inhibitory GABAergic modulation, we hypothesized that pregabalin might be effective in facilitating discontinuation, reducing withdrawal severity and treating residual anxiety. Preliminary case series have reported positive results in discontinuing patients from chronically administered benzodiazepines using pregabalin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881111405360">Oulis et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881111405360">2008b</xref>).</p>
<p>The primary objective of this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin in maintaining the benzodiazepine-free state in patients with prior stable alprazolam use. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin in reducing the severity of GAD symptoms and symptoms of rebound anxiety and benzodiazepine withdrawal, in comparison to placebo, after switching from a stable therapeutic dose of alprazolam to treatment with pregabalin or placebo.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>Adult outpatients aged 18–65 years were enrolled if they met DSM-IV criteria for a primary lifetime diagnosis of GAD, and if they were receiving stable treatment with a benzodiazepine in daily doses of 1–4 mg/day (in alprazolam dose equivalents) for 8–52 weeks. A primary diagnosis of GAD was made, based on predominant clinical presentation, using the module P form of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)-Plus version 5.0.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881111405360">Sheehan et al., 1997</xref>). The current diagnosis of GAD could be sub-threshold due to treatment.</p>
<p>Patients were excluded if: (1) they were women who were pregnant, lactating or of childbearing potential who were not using a medically approved form of contraception; (2) they had 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) total score ≥15; (3) they had a history of anxiolytic non-response to benzodiazepines or pregabalin, or hypersensitivity to either class of drug; (4) they met DSM-IV criteria in the past 6 months of major depressive disorder, dysthymia, social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, body dysmorphic disorder or eating disorder; (5) they met DSM-IV criteria in the past 5 years of schizophrenia, psychotic disorder, bipolar affective disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, substance dependence (excluding nicotine), or in the past year for substance abuse; (6) they were currently receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy for GAD or other anxiety disorder; (7) they had a history of seizure disorder, except febrile seizures of childhood; (8) they had a history of neuropathic pain or narrow angle glaucoma; (9) they were receiving treatment with fluoxetine (in past 5 weeks) or any psychotropic other than benzodiazepines (in past 2 weeks), or electroconvulsive therapy (in past 6 months); (10) they had positive urine drug screen for amphetamines, barbiturates, ethanol, narcotics, non-benzodiazepine sedatives and hypnotics, cocaine, phencyclidine, cannabinoids or other illegal or illicit drugs; (11) they were considered by the investigator to be at risk for suicide or aggressive behavior; (12) they had any serious or uncontrolled medical illness in the opinion of the investigator that would render the patient unsuitable for the study; or (13) they had creatinine clearance ≤60 mL/min.</p>
<p>The study was conducted at 20 investigational sites in Spain, Mexico, France, Italy, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic and Guatemala. The protocol was approved at each site by the appropriate institutional review board (ethics committee), and study conduct was consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient before enrollment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269881111405360">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>All patients currently receiving alprazolam completed a 2-week, open-label, alprazolam stabilization phase. Patients receiving a benzodiazepine other than alprazolam were first switched to the equivalent daily dose of alprazolam over a 2-week period prior to completing the same 2-week stabilization phase. Equivalent doses were based on a standard table (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881111405360">Mueller et al., 2005</xref>) and consisted of the following: alprazolam 0.5 mg, chlordiazepoxide 10 mg, clonazepam 0.25 mg, clorazepate 7.5 mg, diazepam 5 mg, lorazepam 1 mg, ozazepam 15 mg and triazolam 0.25 mg. At the completion of the stabilization phase, patients returned for the baseline visit. Patients who continued to meet eligibility criteria were randomized on a one-to-one basis to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with either pregabalin or placebo. Patients were started on a dose of 75 mg b.i.d. and then titrated over 2 weeks to 150 mg b.i.d. pregabalin. After that, pregabalin could be titrated, based on tolerability and efficacy, in increments of 150 mg/week, in the dosing range of 150–600 mg/day. At the same double-blind baseline visit, patients were instructed to begin tapering off their alprazolam at a dose reduction rate of 25% per week. Patients were permitted up to 6 weeks to complete the alprazolam taper. Benzodiazepine-free patients were then continued in double-blind treatment with pregabalin or placebo for the remaining 6 weeks, at which point they were tapered off study medication over a 1-week period. During the taper phase, patients were provided with a ‘rescue medication’ packet consisting of their current dose of alprazolam, which they were instructed not to take unless they developed severe or intolerable symptoms of withdrawal or rebound anxiety. They were also required to contact their study physician before taking rescue medication. During the benzodiazepine-free phase, the rescue medication packet consisted of 1-mg tablets of alprazolam. Patients who needed more than one dose of rescue medication at any point during the alprazolam taper or benzodiazepine-free phases were discontinued from the study.</p>
<p>This study was designed to detect a 40% difference in the proportion of patients able to achieve benzodiazepine-free status between placebo and pregabalin (30% vs 70%) with 80% power (two-tailed) at an alpha level of 0.050 (two-sided).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269881111405360">
<title>Assessments</title>
<p>At the screening visit a structured MINI was performed by a trained clinician rater. A medical and psychiatric history, a battery of psychiatric assessments (as detailed in the following), clinical laboratory evaluations (hematologies, blood chemistries, thyroid function tests, β-HCG in women, urinalysis and urine drug screen, serum benzodiazepine and alcohol assays) were obtained. A physical examination was performed, and weight and vital signs were obtained. Physical examination and laboratory assessments were repeated at the last study visit.</p>
<p>The primary efficacy parameter was the absence of benzodiazepine as determined by a urine drug screen at each assessment visit. Serum benzodiazepine and alcohol assays were performed at the last study visit. Secondary efficacy parameters consisted of the following: (1) the 14-item HAM-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881111405360">Hamilton, 1959</xref>), which was completed at each assessment throughout the study; (2) the 17-item HAM-D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881111405360">Hamilton, 1960</xref>), which was completed at screening and baseline visits and at each assessment visit post-benzodiazepine taper (i.e. the benzodiazepine-free phase); (3) the 20-item Physician Withdrawal Checklist (PWC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881111405360">Rickels et al., 1990</xref>), which was completed at every visit after baseline; (4) the Clinical Global Impression Severity scale ((CGI-S) completed at baseline and all post-baseline assessment visits; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881111405360">Guy, 1996</xref>); (5) the Clinical Global Impression Improvement scale ((CGI-I) completed at every post-baseline visit); (6) the Digit Symbol Substitution Test ((DSST) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881111405360">Wechsler, 1955</xref>), a symbol coding task designed to assess cognitive performance and psychomotor speed, was completed at the baseline and final study visits; and (7) the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire ((PHQ-9) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881111405360">Kroenke and Spitzer, 2002</xref>), a patient-rated depression screening instrument, was completed at the baseline and final study visits.</p>
<p>Spontaneously reported or observed adverse events were recorded regardless of causality in terms of time of onset, severity and outcome. Use of concomitant medications was recorded in terms of daily dose, stop and start dates, and reason for use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269881111405360">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>The primary endpoint for this study was the proportion of patients free of benzodiazepine and other psychoactive drugs from the end of the alprazolam taper phase until the end of study. Being benzodiazepine-free was defined as having a negative urine benzodiazepine/psychoactive drug assay (done at each visit of the benzodiazepine-free phase) and a negative serum benzodiazepine/alcohol assay (done at endpoint). If a patient withdrew prematurely from the study without having a final urine drug screen, it was decided a priori that the urine drug screen would be rated as positive. A Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test was performed to compare the proportion of benzodiazepine-free patients in each study treatment group.</p>
<p>Assessment of the severity of symptoms of GAD, rebound anxiety and benzodiazepine withdrawal were determined: (1) by mean change in HAM-A total score from baseline to each study visit; (2) by mean PWC total score at each study visit; (3) by mean change from baseline in CGI-S score at each study visit; (4) by mean Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI)-I and CGI-I score at each post-baseline study visit; (5) by time until first use of rescue medication; (6) by time until discontinuation of benzodiazepine; and (7) by mean change from baseline in DSST score to last observation carried forward (LOCF) endpoint. For the HAM-A, mean change scores were evaluated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with country and baseline as covariates. For the PWC, mean total scores at each visit were compared using ANCOVA models with study center as a covariate. In addition to the visit-wise analysis during the taper phase, a post hoc analysis of HAM-A and PWC data was performed on patients at 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% reduction from pre-taper baseline.</p>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical package (version 8 or higher; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisting of all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication. All efficacy analyses were two-sided with α = 0.05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 138 patients met study entry criteria at the screen visit and entered the alprazolam stabilization phase. All eligible patients receiving a benzodiazepine other than alprazolam were switched to an equipotent dose of alprazolam (<italic>N</italic> = 41; mean ±SD daily dose, 1.8 ± 1.0 mg) and stabilized on this dose for 2 weeks. Patients being treated with alprazolam at screen (<italic>N</italic> = 65; mean daily dose, 1.4 <italic>±</italic> 0.6 mg) also remained at the stabilized dose for 2–4 weeks. Thirty-two patients discontinued the trial during the stabilization phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881111405360">Figure 1</xref>), resulting in an ITT sample of 106 patients.</p>

The HAM-D showed minimal endpoint change in either treatment group. Similarly, there was no significant difference at LOCF endpoint in the PHQ-9 score among patients treated with pregabalin compared with placebo (−1.0 ± 1.0 vs +0.4 ± 1.1; <italic>p</italic> = 0.18). Based on a priori relapse-free criteria (&lt;1 dose of rescue medication, negative urine toxicology) at the end (week 6) of the benzodiazepine-free phase, the proportion of patients that were relapse-free was non-significantly higher on pregabalin compared with placebo (95.5% vs 80.0%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.12).</p>
<p>A Kaplan–Meier analysis, showed a non-significantly longer time to discontinuation of study treatment among patients randomized to pregabalin compared with placebo (log-rank <italic>p</italic> = 0.063). The median time to discontinuation was not able to be estimated for pregabalin and was 54 days for placebo. Time to use of rescue medication was significantly longer among patients randomized to pregabalin (log-rank <italic>p</italic> = 0.015).</p>
<p>During the 6-week alprazolam taper phase, rescue medication was taken significantly less frequently by patients treated with pregabalin versus placebo (4.3% vs 22.0%; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). During the 6-week benzodiazepine-free phase, rescue medication was taken less frequently (but not to a significant degree) by patients treated with pregabalin versus placebo (21.4% vs 30.0%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.41; OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.67, 1.18).</p>

Overall, 51% of patients treated with pregabalin, compared with 37% receiving placebo, completed the 6-week benzodiazepine-free phase of the study and were able to successfully discontinue daily use of their benzodiazepine; however, this primary benzodiazepine-free outcome failed to reach significance versus placebo owing to a high attrition rate that reduced the power of the study. Compared with placebo, treatment with pregabalin significantly reduced symptoms of withdrawal severity during both the taper phase and the benzodiazepine-free phase, and resulted in a modest but significant reduction in anxiety symptomatology as measured by the HAM-A at study endpoint.</p>
<p>Among the subgroup of study completers, 95.5% of patients receiving pregabalin were relapse-free at the end of the study, as confirmed by a negative urine drug screen, compared with 80% receiving placebo. It should be noted that the relatively low (51%) overall success rate on pregabalin was largely attributable to patients dropping out of the study prematurely: 14 (53.8%) during the taper phase and 12 (46.2%) during the benzodiazepine-free phase. However, only 12.5% of patients treated with pregabalin (compared with 32.0% treated with placebo) discontinued the trial prematurely due to lack of efficacy in treating anxiety and withdrawal symptoms. In contrast, 24% of patients cited that they were no longer willing to participate in the study as the reason for discontinuation. Similarly high rates of premature discontinuation are commonly reported in benzodiazepine taper studies. Unfortunately, specific reasons for premature discontinuation are uncertain, since the current study did not evaluate baseline patient variables such as drug-liking and degree of motivation to stop benzodiazepine. Drug-liking in particular has been shown to be associated with benzodiazepine dependence and abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881111405360">Griffiths et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881111405360">Woods et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Benzodiazepine dependence has been reported to be associated with impairment of cognitive and psychomotor function, which improves after benzodiazepines are successfully discontinued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881111405360">Rickels et al., 1999a</xref>). Consistent with this, in the current study, successful discontinuation of benzodiazepines was associated with a notable (13-point) improvement in performance on the DSST in both the pregabalin and placebo treatment groups. The finding that pregabalin did not have a negative effect on DSST is consistent with the results of a previous study in normal volunteers that found pregabalin to be associated with a significantly more favorable cognitive and psychomotor profile compared with alprazolam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881111405360">Hindmarch et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of a logistic regression analysis identified use of high potency benzodiazepines as the only clinical variables that significantly reduced the ability to achieve a benzodiazepine-free state. The high-potency benzodiazepines used in the current study mostly consisted of the short-to-intermediate half-life drug alprazolam. Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881111405360">Schweizer and Rickels, 1998</xref>) have reported that higher daily doses and use of short half-life drugs are associated with significantly greater withdrawal severity and a lower likelihood of being able to successfully discontinue from long-term benzodiazepines.</p>
<p>The benzodiazepine discontinuation strategy used in the current study required a stepwise switch from alprazolam to pregabalin. Pregabalin was started at a dose of 150 mg/day and increased to 300 mg/day by week 2. As the dose of pregabalin was titrated up, the dose of alprazolam was tapered down at a rate of 25% per week from a mean (SD) baseline dose of 1.2 (0.6) mg. Concurrent administration of pregabalin and alprazolam was well tolerated. NNH values for pregabalin versus placebo were &lt;10 for only two adverse events, dizziness (NNH = 6.5) and paresthesias (NNH = 9.3). A lower proportion of patients receiving pregabalin compared with placebo reported having a ‘severe’ adverse event.</p>
<p>The main limitation of the current study was the high attrition rate that further reduced a relatively small initial sample size. As noted above, treatment studies in benzodiazepine-dependent populations frequently report high attrition rates. In the current study 36% of overall attrition occurred during the stabilization phase prior to being randomized to pregabalin or placebo and initiating benzodiazepine taper. As a result, the study was under-powered on the primary a priori endpoint, the proportion of patients free of benzodiazepine at the end of the study.</p>
<p>In summary, this study demonstrated that patients with GAD on therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines for up to 52 weeks can be safely and effectively switched to pregabalin using a dosing strategy that involves a gradual, stepwise reduction in the daily dose of benzodiazepine, while the dose of pregabalin is increased from 150 mg/day to 300 mg/day. Successful discontinuation of benzodiazepine therapy, facilitated by treatment with pregabalin, was associated with a reduction in the severity of anxiety and withdrawal symptoms, and an improvement in cognitive function as measured by an increase in the DSST score.</p>
