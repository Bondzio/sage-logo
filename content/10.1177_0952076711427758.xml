<abstract>
<p>Narrative stories offer insight into political agency and constructed reality. They are also part of the armoury for maintaining political ascendancy. The UK Cameron–Clegg Coalition government’s public service reform narrative juxtaposed its open, transparent and decentralized approach with the top-down configuration of institutional power attributed to New Labour. The more complex reality of public service reform is exemplified particularly from the criminal justice arena. From a structuralist perspective, the Coalition’s reform trajectory has been related to emergent realities of networked governance. But here too more ambiguous influences were at work with reform again proving more problematic than anticipated.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0952076711427758"><title>Public service reform: Agency and structure</title>
<p>The UK Cameron–Clegg Coalition government, formed following the May 2010 general election as a result of successful negotiations between the Conservative and Liberal Democrat political parties, embarked on what looked like a radical reconfiguration of the state – whether the reference point be individual protection of freedoms (civil liberties), neighbourhood communities (civil society), or the local state (decentralization). Departmental business plans unveiled in November 2010 marched to the consistent theme of a ‘power shift’, enhancing the influence of people and communities at the expense of Whitehall, alongside a ‘horizon shift’ to longer term objectives. In the words of one of these business plans: ‘For too long citizens have been treated as passive recipients of centralized, standardized services. This Government is putting citizens back in charge … ’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0952076711427758">Home Office, 2010a</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>It doesn’t take much leap of imagination to realize this entailed a major restructuring of public services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0952076711427758">Taylor-Gooby and Stoker, 2011</xref>) (though many of the changes discussed below do not apply throughout the UK because of the devolved administrations now established in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales). It can be construed as a second phase in the ‘politics of recession’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0952076711427758">Gamble, 2009</xref>), fiscal austerity in response to rising sovereign debt superseding an initial reaction of more centralized economic management on the part of the Brown Labour government during the unfolding financial crisis from mid-2007. The Coalition’s reform project may also be regarded as an adaptation to emergent realities of ‘networked community governance’, as the centre of gravity moves from state not only to markets but towards civil society, a context in which services are increasingly ‘co-produced’ through a variety of informal and formal configurations, rather than being provided hierarchically through state bureaucracies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0952076711427758">Benington, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>That is to place emphasis on <italic>structural</italic> imperatives. But the beliefs and meanings through which political elites make sense of and construct their world also have to be taken into account – human <italic>agency</italic> – and the overarching narratives through which such meanings cohere, including opportunities for major crises – not least economic ones – to be so defined that they advance preferred political agendas (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0952076711427758">Bevir et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0952076711427758">Peters, 2011</xref>). The Cameron–Clegg Coalition government was no exception. Apart from making the case for rapid deficit reduction, its compelling narrative story depicted the New Labour modernization project as too enamoured with centralized, bureaucratic targets. This top-down configuration of power had to be prised open and made more transparent, strengthening channels of local accountability and embracing ‘big society not big government’ as a guiding mantra. There was a presumption that not only should public services be delivered at the lowest possible level, but also in favour of competitive diversity, along with increased choice for users (including further extension of personal budgets), that would provide a potent brew through which to achieve value for money and better quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0952076711427758">Cameron, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The new opposition Labour leadership partially conceded this critique of the ‘bureaucratic state’, accepting that in office the New Labour regime had been too technocratic and managerial, encapsulated by a target culture, generally too seduced by the attractions of state power. Nonetheless, the narrative clarity necessary for effective political communication fails to do justice to the complexities of temporal reform processes. There is also a fundamental paradox in the Coalition’s stance, for another contention is that they were completing the Blairite reform agenda, following through the logic of previously established institutional innovations such as school academies and foundation hospital trusts. In this version of events the statist mantle is attached instead to proclivities of the 2007–10 Brown administration; this had been portrayed as a long-standing brake on the public service reform modernization project by capitalizing also on what was tantamount to a ‘bi-polar’ political leadership structure from 1997–2007<bold>.</bold></p>
<p>The central purpose of this article is therefore to develop a critique of the veracity of the Coalition’s public service reform narrative which, as with any narrative story, is an exercise in unravelling political mythology. This will be done especially with reference to developments since 1997 in the criminal justice sphere, used as an exemplar, albeit placed in the context of the wider public service reform agenda. The first stage is to examine the internal consistency of the Coalition’s own reform programme, in the process accounting for the constraints that, on past evidence, make public services reform so problematic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0952076711427758"><title>Narrative and substantive coherence</title>
<p>The lesson many members of the Coalition government derived from the journey followed by their predecessor was the desirability of hitting the ground running with reform and modernization. Already three years into office, the then Prime Minister noted in 2000 that ‘we needed to become … more groundbreaking in our approach to the whole post-war settlement around public services’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0952076711427758">Blair, 2010</xref>: 267). Indicative of Blair’s impatience with the scale and ambition of reform, raising standards – he increasingly believed – required major institutional change. The pattern emerging, in fact, seems to be one where successive governments raise the stakes on the speed and scope of public service reform. Blair’s own approach to office had been described as ‘re-energized managerial reform’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0952076711427758">Raine, 1999</xref>: 4), an ethos entrenched in the public sector during the previous Thatcher and Major Conservative governments. The pace at which the Coalition government decided to tackle the ‘structural’ financial deficit added to pressures for innovation in the organization and delivery of public services. The circumstances were reminiscent of the ‘big government in hard times’ syndrome associated with the public expenditure crisis of the mid-1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0952076711427758">Hood and Wright, 1981</xref>), but responses to the predicament of the early 2010s may turn out to be more dramatic, with the UK setting the trend in both the European Union and the USA for stringent fiscal consolidation.</p>
<p>David Cameron revealed to the Royal Society of Arts an ambition to preside over ‘complete modernization’ of Britain’s public services, convinced that the Coalition has a ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ transformative opportunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0952076711427758">BBC, 2011</xref>). An <italic>Open Public Services</italic> white paper would signify ‘the decisive end of … the top-down, take-what-you’re-given model’ of delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0952076711427758">Cameron, 2011</xref>). This raised philosophical conundrums given an influential historical legacy of Cameron’s own Conservative Party – gradual adaptation of established institutions as opposed to root-and-branch reform based upon rational first principles: ‘Conservatives are suspicious of political change as society develops organically as an infinitely complex and subtle entity; precipitate change could damage irreparably things of great value’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0952076711427758">Jones, 2010</xref>: 74).</p>
<p>An intrinsic danger of proceeding with haste is that reforms are ill-conceived and clumsily executed. This applied to the latest spasm of ‘quango-culling’ only months into the Coalition government. Yet the institutional intricacies spawned by its own tweaked health-care reforms, discussed below, became difficult to encapsulate in any comprehensible organizational chart. In the criminal justice sphere precipitate closure of the Forensic Science Service caused problems of service continuity. The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review became characterized by rushed decisions to meet arbitrary deadlines, tailored to the fiscal policy imperatives of that autumn’s comprehensive spending review. It was manifestly a settlement unlikely to stand the test of time.</p>
<p>The root-and-branch restructuring of the National Health Service (NHS), dispensing with established primary care trusts and transferring their health-care commissioning responsibilities to general practitioner-led consortia, came to be regarded in many quarters as an extraordinarily risky venture. Indeed, the NHS Future Forum of experts that the prime minister conceded mid-stream to review the Health and Social Care Bill cast a jaundiced eye over the practicality of the reforms and whether those who would be entrusted with commissioning powers necessarily possessed the requisite skills. The government came under pressure to recalibrate both pace and content, including multi-professional and lay involvement in new commissioning bodies, rather than confining them largely to family doctors.</p>
<p>Envisaged benefits of reorganization have, in any case, generally failed to materialize, while transitional disruption takes a long while to subside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0952076711427758">Elcock et al., 2010</xref>). It is inevitable moreover that ‘as the scale of change goes up, the complexity of the management task escalates, the uncertainties … multiply’ as well as explicable why successive waves of structural reform should be conceptualized as ‘re-disorganization … washing over an increasingly exhausted and sceptical army of front-line staff’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0952076711427758">Pollitt, 2009</xref>: 290). The fact is there has been a lack of systematic evaluation of the relationship between structural change and institutional success, with disappointing progress made in relating a proliferation of performance information to other key variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0952076711427758">Hood, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0952076711427758">2011</xref>). Conditions under which each strategy will generate positive pay-off are consequently imperfectly understood, political reform ideas instead commonly formulated ‘through a process of reaction against what we see as an unsatisfactory status quo’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0952076711427758">Hood, 2000</xref>:11). Lesson drawing from other jurisdictions has also become more prevalent, with transatlantic policy transfer notably conspicuous in the criminal justice arena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0952076711427758">Jones and Newburn, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0952076711427758">Rose, 2005</xref>), a pattern replicating itself under the UK Coalition government.</p>
<p>Despite its tarnished record, institutional tinkering nonetheless continued to present irresistible temptations. Symptomatic is the formation of a new National Crime Agency (NCA), superseding the Serious and Organized Crime Agency (SOCA) set up under legislation enacted as recently as 2005. But even the Coalition’s position on structural change sent mixed messages. ‘Nudge’ theory struck a chord, favouring light-touch policy instruments to modify social behaviour (as in public health and commuter travelling), in contrast to the heavy-handed institutional lifting characteristic of other elements of the Coalition’s public service reform programmes. From this vantage point, choice architecture steers people in directions that benefit both themselves and society. It is a creed of ‘libertarian paternalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0952076711427758">Thaler and Sunstein, 2008</xref>). A Behavioural Insight Team was accordingly established in the Cabinet Office to pursue such prescriptions.</p>
<p>And if Blair had regrets about not pursuing public service reform with more urgency, he readily acknowledged the difficulties encountered in transforming complex public service institutional structures, confiding at the Labour Party Conference how ‘for eight years I have battered the criminal justice system to get it to change’ (<italic>The Guardian</italic>, 2005). This echoes long-standing issues of implementation deficits and cosmetic institutional change management. Given the scale and duration of the public spending cuts, unprecedented for the post-1945 period and planned by the Coalition government over its full parliamentary term, budgetary pressures for reform were to be unrelenting. However, these are precisely the circumstances in which change can be badly mishandled, especially when strategic financial management skills in Whitehall still leave much to be desired. Managing change at the best of times is a contested and negotiated process, borne out by the quest for a more service-oriented focus in UK police forces which posed a threat to deeply ingrained policing identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0952076711427758">Davies and Thomas, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0952076711427758">2008</xref>). Sometimes there is simply no substitute for building rapport with stakeholders; such deliberative processes are pivotal to the quest for ‘public value’, with its focus on changes in relationships between government and wider society, suggesting that heroic models of leadership warrant a degree of scepticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0952076711427758">Benington and Moore, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0952076711427758">Stern, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>But most significant of all was the Coalition’s lack of consistency in adhering to its fundamental reform narrative of reversing top-down, centralizing tendencies. Net annual migration targets are a classic top-down solution. Drawn more deeply into higher education micro-intervention to regulate implementation of increased tuition fees, prior to ministers realizing their ambition of ‘freeing up’ user choice and provider entry, what emerged – as with much public service reform – was a curious hybrid of bureaucratic control and market competition. The NHS reforms referred to earlier were in contradiction to the terms of the Coalition agreement: ‘We will stop the top-down reorganizations … that have got in the way of patient care’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0952076711427758">HM Government, 2010</xref>: 24). The centrepiece of the government’s welfare reforms, the universal credit, could also be construed as a ‘one-size-fits-all’ initiative.</p>
<p>While ‘free schools’ unleashed faddism with experimentalism one of the issues with them, financial incentives for a rapid acceleration in the number of schools converting to academy status created a potentially centralizing dynamic, by undermining local education authorities and placing such ostensibly autonomous state schools more firmly within the orbit of the Department for Education (DfE). In classic top-down style, the education bill published in January 2011 also provided the education secretary with further powers for tackling ‘failing’ schools. This is a policy area therefore where practitioners in the field are experiencing tension between claims of increased local autonomy and assumption of powers centrally fuelled by direct DfE intervention. Indeed, the long-term goal is a national funding formula under which money will go directly from Whitehall to schools, bypassing local authority control altogether. And the target culture certainly remains alive and well in this sector<bold>.</bold></p>
<p>Having regard for these tensions, the Coalition’s reform narrative will now be tested against ‘modernizing’ trajectories in the criminal justice field under New Labour, bearing in mind that Cameron set his sights on raising the level of trust and confidence in criminal justice as much as on education, health and welfare reforms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0952076711427758"><title>New Labour’s top-down performance management model</title>
<p>The argument for depicting New Labour’s approach to performance management as top down is not difficult to make. Nor is the scale of the then prime minister’s reform ambition for the criminal justice sector: ‘Crime and the fear of crime will only be tackled if we have a fully modernized police force and criminal justice system’ (<italic>The</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0952076711427758"><italic>Guardian</italic>, 2002</xref>). A predilection to micromanage the reform and performance of public services from the centre seemed endemic. Part of the regular public spending reviews put in place under Gordon Brown’s chancellorship, performance targets were incorporated into public service agreements (PSAs) negotiated by the Treasury with Whitehall spending departments. It remained unclear to what extent successive spending allocations were affected by performance against targets. Nonetheless, public service providers with underlying performance problems were to have action taken against them. New Labour’s arrival in office accordingly led to a proliferation of national performance standards.</p>
<p>Centrally set targets became a prominent feature of policing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0952076711427758">Loveday, 2006</xref>), generating increased Home Office recording and reporting requirements. There was mounting concern about the parallel growth of police bureaucracy attributable to the demands of performance management, highlighted by an independent review of policing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0952076711427758">Flanagan, 2008</xref>). A corollary of this apparatus of top-down control was to be central intervention in ‘poorly-performing’ forces. Influence over local policing became correspondingly tighter as Home Office powers increased.</p>
<p>There was the first ever national policing plan for which chief police officers were obliged to have regard in their local plans. A Policing Performance Assessment Framework (PPAF), introduced in 2004, was harnessed by the Home Office and Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) to monitor achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0952076711427758">Hunton et al., 2009)</xref>, succeeded by Assessments of Policing and Community Safety (APACS) so that policing and community safety plans became more joined up. Performance assessments of police forces carried out on an annual basis by HMIC rated each force ‘excellent’, ‘good’, ‘fair’ or ‘poor’ with reference to several criteria. A Home Office Police Standards Unit was also established in 2001, specifically to focus upon ‘under-performing’ forces, subsequently renamed the Police and Crime Standards Directorate. The 2002 Police Reform Act became of symbolic importance, providing the Home Secretary with significantly increased powers of intervention over individual forces and chief officers. The implications for police governance were profound, with the hitherto tripartite relationships between local police authorities, chief constables of the 43 individual forces in England and Wales and the Home Office tilted decisively in favour of the latter.</p>
<p>These centralizing tendencies were by no means confined within criminal justice to the police service. The year 2001 saw the establishment of a National Probation Service directly accountable to the Home Office. It became part of the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) in 2004, creating a single hierarchy for the probation and prison services stretching downwards from the Home (and post-2007 Justice) Secretary. The national target-driven approach therefore became as much a bone of contention in the probation service as in the police service, regarded as detrimental to a local focus, with criticism extensive too of the centralized bureaucracy fostered by over-reliance on such targets in the prison service. Moreover, prior to the general election of May 2010, legislation had been planned to enable the Justice Secretary to use expert teams to tackle failing local youth offending teams, established under the national leadership of the Youth Justice Board following the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0952076711427758"><title>Coalition’s bottom-up performance management model</title>
<p>Following formation of the Coalition government in May 2010 the new Chancellor, George Osborne, dismantled the PSA regime through which government departments had been bound to performance targets negotiated with the Treasury. In the criminal justice context, the Coalition Home Secretary, Theresa May, was highly critical of the previous government’s micromanagement of local policing, contending that targets and standards had become too Whitehall driven. With its heavy burden of data demands, centralized performance management had become overprescriptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0952076711427758">Home Office, 2010b</xref>), a critique heralding the arrival of a ‘post-target culture’. Nonetheless, the (regularly updated) departmental business plans unveiled in November 2010, including those for the Home Office and Ministry of Justice, placed considerable emphasis on ‘milestones’ against which to determine departments’ success in delivering commitments, with reporting structures leading directly to Downing Street. This potentially created another apparatus for strategic central oversight of progress, comparable to the delivery unit established by Blair in his second term to drive forward public service improvements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0952076711427758">Barber, 2007</xref>). In his first months as Prime Minister, Cameron established a reputation for being more of a light-touch chairman than hands-on chief executive. By February 2011, however, a reinvigorated Number Ten policy and implementation unit, complemented by a Cabinet Office efficiency and reform group, replicated more closely the centre’s operation under his Labour predecessors. Much of the makeover under the Coalition therefore appeared to involve changes of nomenclature, with managerialist ‘performance triggers’ entering the lexicon and business plans replete with input and impact indicators.</p>
<p>The overarching context, in criminal justice as elsewhere, was the fiscal austerity plan set out in the October 2010 comprehensive spending review. It entailed a 20% real terms reduction in central funding for the police service by 2014–5 (compared to an increase of 24% in real terms since 2000–1), although precepts on local council tax also had a bearing on the overall budgetary situation. This formed part of a 23% cut in the Home Office’s budget. It meant police forces in England and Wales having to make significant savings while striving to maintain frontline capacity to fight crime and antisocial behaviour. The Ministry of Justice also faced 23% cuts in its budget, with implications for court, prison and probation staff. A cut in the inexorably rising prison population in England and Wales was to be facilitated by sentencing reforms and reduction in reoffending rates through a ‘rehabilitation revolution’, signposted by the Justice Secretary in a consultation document published in December 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0952076711427758">Ministry of Justice, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>But particularly germane to this paper is how Coalition criminal justice reforms exemplify its wider ambition of decentralizing and localizing public service delivery. Hence the commitment to US-style elected police and crime commissioners from autumn 2012, assuming responsibility for police-force budgets and strategies, and replacing existing appointed local police authorities deemed too invisible to the public. However, new police and crime panels acting in a scrutiny capacity to prevent powers of the new commissioners from becoming overweening bore a remarkable (downgraded) resemblance to those police authorities<bold>.</bold> The declared objective of this structural reform is to enhance local responsiveness, in the words of the Home Secretary ‘replacing bureaucratic accountability [to the Home Office] with democratic accountability’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0952076711427758">Home Office, 2010b</xref>: 3). It would thus restore balance to police governance, notwithstanding strong reservations from representative associations of both the police and local government, shifting the focus of responsibility for police performance management.</p>
<p>The Coalition pursued a complementary information strategy, disseminating performance data so that public services could be held more effectively to account. As one of the departmental business plans noted: ‘We will use transparency to facilitate the choice and democratic accountability which will replace top-down targets and micro-management’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0952076711427758">Ministry of Justice, 2010b</xref>: 26). An early application in criminal justice provided website access to maps detailing crime and antisocial behaviour in England and Wales down to street level, followed by reoffending rates for probation services and prisons, along with court sentencing data.</p>
<p>Another related theme integral to the Coalition’s approach, albeit one struggling to gain policy traction, was that of ‘big society’ taking up the running from ‘big government’, though at times Cameron seemed to conflate this idea with public service reform, downgrading the ‘social action’ dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0952076711427758">Cameron, 2011</xref>). Initiatives such as the big society bank and a new training scheme for community organizers were meant to provide substantive content. In the criminal justice sector this was driven by the premise that it is not just the state that can fight and prevent crime. It was important to provide incentives and training for local communities to be actively involved in policing themselves. Apart from further promotion of neighbourhood-watch type and community crime-fighter programmes, there was to be greater emphasis on formal volunteering schemes such as civilian special constables, all fostering the notion of ‘do-it-yourself’ (DIY) policing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0952076711427758">Travis, 2010</xref>). This is a step beyond community influence, to shared community responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0952076711427758">Painter, 2011a</xref>). Public service operatives were also encouraged to reconstitute themselves as employee-led spin-offs, thereby becoming staff-owned mutual organizations or cooperatives and as such not-for-profit social enterprises. Opportunities available for ‘DIY providers’ in the criminal justice field applied most readily to probation services.</p>
<p>Financial instruments for investing in social progress, known as social impact bonds, were embraced too. They offered a means of funding voluntary organizations doing rehabilitative work with prisoners to break reoffending cycles. Social finance is also to be raised, utilizing this mechanism, to fund early intervention projects aimed at dysfunctional families. A number of related pilot projects which are starting to feature in contracts for running prisons provided a testing ground for payment-by-results (PBR). The combination of innovative financial products for social investment and PBR was consequently a strategy to be adopted by the Coalition in pursuit of a number of social policy objectives<bold>.</bold></p>
<p>The Coalition’s reform narrative, therefore, was that rather than attempting to performance manage from the centre, public space should be created for local priorities, with individuals and communities also empowered to forge their own solutions, enabling civil society to have a greater stake in what happens. The big society concept at least is congruent with the Conservative Party’s traditional views on society’s organic nature, though for others it seemed a convenient rationale for fiscal retrenchment. Indeed, many voluntary, charitable and community bodies themselves became victims of austerity measures, depleting their capacity – and associated social capital – to be in the vanguard of this project. Opportunities provided by ‘open’ public services for more state contracts were meant to counteract this effect. But the political tide against central micromanagement had been turning even before the change of government in May 2010. It is therefore to changes in public service reform emphasis under New Labour that we now turn.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0952076711427758"><title>Evolution of the New Labour public service modernization project</title>
<p>That the New Labour modernization project was something of a voyage of discovery during Blair’s three terms in office from 1997 to 2007 there can be little doubt (Painter, 2007–8). The limits to what could be achieved through a top-down approach to public service reform and performance management came to be acknowledged, inducing an alternative focus upon choice and diversity:<disp-quote>
<p>it became clearer to me that only so much could be done by driving improvement from the centre through targets … even with significant extra funding coming through. I … came to see centralized systems themselves, and the disempowerment of front-line managers and the denial of user choice which they entailed, as a fundamental part of the problem. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0952076711427758">Blair, 2010</xref>: 211)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A user or customer-focused ethos was therefore part of this evolving reform project, taking the form in criminal justice of a victim-centric philosophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0952076711427758">Needham, 2009</xref>). Competition or its credible threat (contestability) also came much more into the reckoning as a means of raising service quality and encouraging delivery innovation. In criminal justice – building upon the precedent of privatized prisons – this pointed to creation of a market in offender management and supervision, with services to be solicited from competing public, private and voluntary sector suppliers. The organizational medium for this commissioning strategy was to be NOMs, with its logic further capitalized upon by the Coalition.</p>
<p>There was recognition too of the desirability of passing greater influence and control over services to local people, strengthening engagement with communities, something not without significance given the subsequent Coalition government’s ‘localism’ agenda. The neighbourhood policing initiative was conceived so that those communities could have more say in local policing priorities, with opportunities for residents to attend regular meetings with neighbourhood policing teams. Local people were to have more input into how low-level offenders should pay back the community through influencing community punishments administered in their area. There were related experiments with community courts, modelled on a scheme pioneered in Brooklyn, New York, embedded in local communities and empathetic to their problems. The former Justice Secretary, Jack Straw, also supported prison governors adopting higher profiles in their localities.</p>
<p>The direction of reform in the latter phases of the Blair premiership was therefore moving away from top-down control. In policing, a point was reached under New Labour where all central targets but one had been scrapped. The exception related to people’s confidence that the crime and anti-social behaviour issues that mattered to them locally were being effectively tackled. The approach had consequently been shifting to ‘bottom-up’ incentives for ‘self-improving’ public services through customer focus, diversity of provision and increased local community influence. As previously noted, the Coalition consequently, for the purposes of their public service reform narrative, emphasized the impact of the transition to the Brown premiership in June 2007.</p>
<p>Initial impressions were indeed that he might back-track on Blairite reforms, not least given Brown’s reputation for micromanaging and his belief in the virtues of centralist administrative action, seemingly at odds with the evolving ‘new localism’. Blair himself had come to the conclusion that Brown was not fully signed up. Much had depended on the state of internal power play and tactical manoeuvring within the Labour leadership, others bearing testimony to the corrosiveness of interpersonal rivalry: ‘Gordon wasn’t necessarily against reform; he was against any reform proposed by Tony [Blair]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0952076711427758">Rawnsley, 2010</xref>: 78). So, again the contingencies of agency have to be considered. But Brown himself had been one of the original architects of the New Labour project. His policy line as premier therefore soon reverted to the urgency of ‘deepening’ and ‘widening’ reform, anything else regarded as a failure of political leadership, with the momentum of reform in education and health to be emulated in criminal justice.</p>
<p>Documentary evidence to sustain the continuity thesis comes from a spate of official publications. In <italic>Working Together: Public Services on Your Side</italic> the principles of reform were articulated as ‘placing power in the hands of those who use our public services … and … services that respond to local priorities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0952076711427758">HM Government, 2009a</xref>: 3). Shortly afterwards <italic>Building Britain’s Future</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0952076711427758">HM Government, 2009b</xref>) made much of entitlements for individual service users, which were to replace dependence on central targets as guarantors of core service standards, exemplified by the 2008 National Policing Pledge, although enforceability and redress mechanisms remained a work in progress. Then in <italic>Putting the Frontline First: Smarter Government</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0952076711427758">HM Government, 2009c</xref>), three reforming themes were singled out: making public services more user-driven and locally accountable; recasting the relationship between the centre and frontline service delivery to allow flexibility of response; and correspondingly streamlining central government to release value to the frontline. This was all to be underpinned by service user entitlements and empowered local communities, as well as by increased availability of locally focused comparative performance information.</p>
<p>It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the public service reform trajectory prior to the spring 2010 general election – under <italic>both</italic> Blair and Brown – paved the way for the direction in which the new Cameron–Clegg administration wished to go. A change of government was less of a rupture than the Coalition’s reform narrative would have us believe.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0952076711427758"><title>Revisiting the May 2010 watershed</title>
<p>Questions remained, of course, about whether New Labour could really let go. There were still threats of ‘swift remedial action’ in the event of persistent underperformance, highlighted by intentions regarding local youth offending teams. Moreover, measures had been announced by the Home Office in April 2009 for police forces to be set targets as part of a drive to increase persistently low rape conviction rates, with comparative performance to be monitored by the police inspectorate<bold>.</bold> As Prime Minister, Brown was in his element proactively using the powers of the central state to deal with the financial crisis and subsequent economic recession. The ‘old centralism’ had not been entirely consigned to the dustbin of history.</p>
<p>Moreover, reform blueprints of the kind put forward by three partners at the professional services firm KPMG, one of whom subsequently became head of policy development for David Cameron at Number Ten, signalled differences in kind from anything that had gone before. They called for adoption of payment by results without exception in the public sector, supported by provider liberalization, even though in many instances PBR would initially be based on crude output measurements rather than more elusive longer term outcomes: ‘over time, this should create an enterprising, flexible and fluid market place for public services’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0952076711427758">Downey et al., 2010</xref>: 14). The formidable opposition to marketizing health care, in particular by imposing a regulatory obligation to promote competition, underlined the political difficulties of pursuing such a reform strategy. Universal prescriptions of this kind were also difficult to reconcile with the cause of localism.</p>
<p>None of this detracts from the fact that for public services the transition to the Conservative–Liberal Democrat government in May 2010 was less dramatic than the reform narrative of the Coalition suggested. It was more of a continuum than a dichotomy, giving explanatory force to structural determinants of policy trajectory. In the criminal justice sector, continuity was sometimes explicitly lauded, as in partnership working: ‘Policing cannot be effective if it is working in isolation … [it] needs to be delivered in partnership … with key agencies at the local level and across the criminal justice system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0952076711427758">Home Office, 2010b</xref>: 13). The Coalition therefore endorsed such multi-agency forums as community safety partnerships (CSPs) and local criminal justice boards (LCJBs), respectively established in the late 1990s and 2003. With planned cuts in funding of 25% for CSPs there were nonetheless doubts about the sustainability of this partnership infrastructure.</p>
<p>Lip service was also paid to the well worn path of ‘ensuring that … an understanding of the best evidence available underpins everything we do’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0952076711427758">Home Office, 2010b</xref>: 40), a principle, however, honoured more in the breach than the observance. At least the new Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke’s sentencing and prisoner rehabilitation reforms had provided some semblance to the contrary, with doubts about the ‘prison works’ mantra corroborated by high reoffending rates. Unlike the populist stance prevailing since the 1990s, this pointed to a penal policy more in keeping with ‘liberal progressive’ than ‘conservative traditionalist’ values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0952076711427758">Benyon, 2011</xref>). Yet conditions of fiscal austerity are not exactly conducive to investing commensurately in community-based alternatives to prison. Clarke’s political vulnerability on sentencing reform also became evident, putting at risk the aim of stabilizing the prison population, accentuated by hard-line repercussions for the administration of justice in response to the August 2011 urban civil disturbances.</p>
<p>Some of the criminal justice policy instruments deployed by the Coalition in succession to those used by New Labour also seemed more like rebranding exercises than real changes of substance, notably those replacing anti-terrorist control orders and antisocial behaviour orders. Gang injunctions too were to be more widely applied following the aforementioned civil disturbances. And as previously noted, much of the nomenclature contained in departmental business plans was hardly incompatible with New Labour’s ‘managerial state’. The focus remained on extracting greater value; except in a radically changed fiscal environment it was a question of achieving ‘more-from-less’ rather than ‘something-for-something’ in the circumstances of increasing public service investment that had hitherto prevailed. In this respect, the imperative was not just for a ‘smaller state’ but also a ‘smarter state’ with more selective targeting of public resources. But corresponding judgements about effectiveness were hampered by evaluative research projects themselves becoming casualties of cuts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0952076711427758"><title>Conclusion: Struggling to maintain momentum</title>
<p>A vital tool in the art of successful governing is achieving control of the political narrative. Such narratives tell us much about the self-perception of political elites and the meanings they weave around their behaviour. But a bottom-up narrative cannot disguise the fact that the Coalition partners were not averse to top-down <italic>hierarchical governance</italic> when politically expedient – notwithstanding rhetoric about a ‘post-bureaucratic age’ emanating from Cameron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0952076711427758">Bogdanor, 2011</xref>). In important respects public service reform discontinuities were more evident during the New Labour era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0952076711427758">Painter, 2006</xref>) than during the transition to the new political regime after May 2010.</p>
<p>As noted at the outset, a structuralist interpretation of the Coalition’s reform project, in so far as it has internal coherence, is the necessity of adjusting to an emerging pattern of <italic>network</italic> relationships, with government ‘but one part of the overall process of social governance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0952076711427758">Moore and Benington, 2011</xref>: 257). A paradigmatic realignment of state, markets and civil society is being remorselessly driven by a changing environment. The themes of open data, local accountability and big society are all consistent with such an interpretation, reform trajectories evident not least in the criminal justice sector. Indeed, ‘big society’ goes one stage further, enshrining not only network governance but various forms of community <italic>self-governance</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0952076711427758">Painter, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>To the extent that this perspective is insightful, pointing as it does to a ‘reinvented state’ based on more decentralized performance management, it too had ultimately become a direction of travel under New Labour. Nonetheless, there was a tendency for the Coalition’s public service reforms to possess an ‘off-the-shelf’ quality at variance with processes associated with network modes of governance, driven not least by fiscal retrenchment. Fundamental issues had been excluded from wider discussion, or only token attempts made to elicit support from key stakeholders, notwithstanding statutory public consultation duties. Yet what adds ‘public value’ is ultimately a normative issue that should be the object of ongoing debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0952076711427758">Mulgan, 2011</xref>). This unilateralist style was subject, however, to the exigencies of sustaining coalition inter-party agreement, or build up <italic>ex post facto</italic> of compelling opposing political pressures, as evidenced by the mid-legislative review of health reforms, or second thoughts on penal policy that had the effect of undermining the intentions behind the Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill.</p>
<p>An alternative interpretation of the underlying logic behind public service reforms saw another decisive shift taking place in favour of <italic>market governance</italic> (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0952076711427758">Beech, 2011</xref>). With regard to clinical health-care commissioning, there was an expectation that many of the new consortia would become dependent on private health companies to discharge their responsibilities, such companies also being poised to take over the running of some underperforming NHS hospital trusts. A competition driven model of health care clearly was pivotal to the Coalition’s original NHS reform plans. School academies and ‘free’ schools are likely to provide additional opportunities for involvement of private education companies. In the criminal justice sector the process of putting out to competitive tender the running of prisons further accelerated.</p>
<p>Adopting the ‘any willing provider’ (or variations thereupon as in ‘properly qualified provider’) nostrum as part of a ‘commissioning state’ also raised profound issues of public accountability, given associated fragmentation of service delivery responsibilities. Even proposals for new commissioning bodies, as in health care, had raised principles of sound governance, only belatedly addressed, because of transparency issues surrounding commitment of public money. Also, there are complex relationships to be navigated by these consortia with both professional ‘clinical senates’ and local authority statutory health and wellbeing boards; nor was sufficient heed being taken of the separation of purchaser and provider roles, so critical to earlier phases of public management reform.</p>
<p>There were paradoxes for the Coalition’s reform narrative in another respect in this interpretation. Growing pervasiveness of market exchange relationships could be at the expense not only of ‘big government’ but also of ‘intermediate’ civic institutions, let alone inhibiting development of a ‘big society’. Creative destruction is, after all, intrinsic to the functioning of competitive markets. That gave further force to critiques levelled at Cameron’s ‘big society’ agenda for being far too narrowly conceived to stand a realistic chance of enriching the fabric of civil society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0952076711427758">Diamond, 2011</xref>). The Coalition aspired to mutualizing swathes of public services through employee-owned ‘spin-outs’. Contractual opportunities were also to be opened up to charitable, voluntary and community bodies. But competing successfully against private outsourcing companies was another matter, raising the spectre of corporatization of public services. In selecting predominantly big private providers as prime (payment-by-results) contractors to find employment for the long-term jobless the Department for Work and Pensions lent credence to that scenario. A different outcome depended on a much more supportive infrastructure to build the capacity of third sector bodies.</p>
<p>With alarm bells ringing, in the Coalition’s reconfigured health reforms the demands of integrated (health and social) care were to temper the role delineated for alternative providers in improving patient care and choice, though more NHS services were opened up to competition from April 2012. Reconciling these two considerations presented real dilemmas and the potentially destabilizing consequences of the reform principles for local health economies continued to be a bone of contention. Ambiguities remained too under the revised proposals regarding maintenance of the health secretary’s direct ministerial responsibility for NHS provision; but the central surveillance powers of the national commissioning board are likely to be greater than would have been the case with the original health reform blueprint.</p>
<p>Institutional and political pressures were consequently beginning to take a toll on reform ambitions. Those pressures were further exacerbated by regulatory exposure of services failures and financial instability in the private residential social care sector<bold>.</bold> Early warning systems were provided by the experiences of ‘outrider’ conservative municipalities. There, public opposition and impact on staff morale of radical outsourcing plans led to more pragmatic re-evaluation of reform strategies.</p>
<p>Moreover, with political agency again rearing its head, the Coalition’s dynamic changed following the poor performance of the Liberal Democrats in the May 2011 local and devolved government elections and voting reform referendum. Although narrowing political and ideological differences between the new generation of conservative and liberal democrat leaders prior to the May 2010 coalition agreement were generally underestimated (Lee and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0952076711427758">Beech, 2011</xref>), a synergistic relationship moved on to one more akin to countervailing forces as the latter sought to reassert a distinctive identity. In the criminal justice sphere, even the delayed pivotal reform of elected police and crime commissioners as the preferred means of enhancing accountability became a matter for dissension. Alternative models for achieving the same goal were widely canvassed, with doubts persisting about the efficacy of a reform to a system of police governance in existence in essence since the 1964 Police Act and divorced from any wider re-evaluation of the changing role of policing in contemporary society.</p>
<p>The <italic>Open Public Services</italic> white paper, eventually unveiled in July 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0952076711427758">Painter, 2011b</xref>), reiterated the fundamental principles of reform outlined at the outset in this article. The onus in future would be on justifying retention of state monopoly rather than on defending commissioning services from a range of providers. Picking up on Gordon Brown’s earlier notion of user entitlements, but focusing now on process, the government was to explore the scope for enacting a legislative right of individual choice when accessing services. Its denial should come to be regarded as a form of maladministration, with redress available through appropriate ombudsmen. Yet by only the Coalition’s second year in office, not only had some of its criminal justice policies proved politically vulnerable, so had its health and higher education reforms, with its consequent struggle to construct a coherent public service market paradigm. Certainly a new air of caution could be detected, as timescales for reform looked increasingly problematic: ‘The government will have to prioritize and pace its reforms to ensure that it balances the … need for change with the capacity of public service providers to deliver those changes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0952076711427758">HM Government, 2011</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>So, we return to that ‘hitting the ground running’ metaphor. If the Blair New Labour administrations took time to get into their stride in pursuit of public service modernization, the Cameron–Clegg Coalition government sprinted out of the starting block only to quickly hit the pain barrier! In the final analysis, this was clearly not unconnected with implementation challenges arising from the impact on individual programme areas of the fiscal conservatism driving the Coalition’s rapid deficit reduction plan. But it was also another demonstration, in line with experience of the earlier New Labour administrations, that institutional change management is a learning and therefore iterative process.</p>
