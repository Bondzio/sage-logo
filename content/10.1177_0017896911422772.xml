<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the past two decades, American Indian children and adolescents have become increasingly at risk for obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, elevated cholesterol, and smoking, all of which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. These alarming trends parallel those seen in American Indian adults, who have the highest age-adjusted prevalence rates of any racial or ethnic group for obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911422772">1</xref></sup> For example, a large study conducted in nine Indian Health Service (IHS) areas found that the overall prevalence of overweight (body mass index, BMI over 85th percentile for the reference population) for American Indian school children aged 5–18 years was 39%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911422772">2</xref></sup> A more recent National Survey for Children’s Health found overweight prevalence of 42% in 2003 and 38% in 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911422772">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Physical inactivity levels among Native youth are also cause for alarm. As in the majority culture, television watching is strongly associated with physical inactivity and obesity among Native youth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911422772">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896911422772"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911422772">6</xref></sup> In parallel, type 2 diabetes rates in Native youth have been rising, and diabetes is being diagnosed at increasingly younger ages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911422772">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911422772">8</xref></sup> Equally disturbing, and foreshadowing even higher rates of diabetes, Pima youth 6–19 years of age have higher fasting insulin levels than their White counterparts, even after controlling for age, glucose, and relative weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911422772">9</xref></sup> In a seven-year study, the IHS observed a 6% increase in diabetes in American Indian children under 15 years of age, and a 28% increase among those 15–19 years of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911422772">10</xref></sup> High blood pressure and high cholesterol are additional factors found in increasing numbers in American Indian youth,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911422772">11</xref></sup> and both are linked with increased BMI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911422772">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911422772">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Tobacco abuse among American Indian youth is another growing concern. Because Indian lands are not subject to state laws prohibiting the sale and promotion of tobacco products to minors, American Indians and Alaska Natives have access to tobacco products at an early age, and are more likely to smoke than their peers in other racial/ethnic groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896911422772">13</xref></sup> As with adults, the highest rates of smoking are seen among adolescents of the Northern Plains tribes:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911422772">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911422772">15</xref></sup> one study found that over 45% had started smoking before age 13, and 74% of the tribes’ adolescents smoked at least once a week.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911422772">14</xref></sup> Surveys in Washington State public schools have shown that 18% of Native eighth graders, 31% of tenth graders, and 44% of twelfth graders smoked at least one cigarette during the past 30 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911422772">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the 1990s, a three-year multi-component school-based intervention to prevent obesity was implemented in 41 schools serving 1,704 American Indian children. Known as the Pathways Study, this randomized, controlled trial was introduced in grades 3 through 5 on seven reservations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896911422772">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896911422772"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911422772">19</xref></sup> Although a post-intervention assessment found significant changes in participating students’ knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding healthy eating and lifestyle, percentage of body fat (the primary outcome) and amount of physical activity remained unchanged.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911422772">19</xref></sup> The high cost of Pathways, its lack of effect on the primary outcome, and the inability of Indian communities to sustain the program after the trial ended suggest that it did not address key elements. However, in another project using a culturally tailored curriculum, the goals of tobacco prevention and increased nutrition knowledge were achieved in a cohort of American Indian youth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896911422772">20</xref></sup> The FACETS program was implemented at six intervention and two control sites in Northeastern Native communities with 86 children in grades 4 through 6. On post-intervention tests, intervention participants showed increased rates of knowledge and of ability to resist peer pressure and offers of tobacco use. The authors of the study acknowledged, however, that their findings were ‘suggestive’ only, given that data from the control sites were not available and results from some survey questions were contradictory. The small number of participants is another limitation of the FACETS project.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896911422772">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>We therefore developed, pilot-tested, and evaluated a culturally appropriate cardiovascular disease curriculum called ‘In Our Voice’ for American Indian students in grades 7 through 12 at five sites in two western states. We based our program on Discovery Education’s Youth Matters, a successful prevention and character education curriculum that promotes positive youth development for students in grades 4 through 6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896911422772">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0017896911422772">22</xref></sup> In a randomized trial of 28 Denver, Colorado, elementary schools, bullying behavior was reduced 50% for boys who participated in Youth Matters. Congruent with the approach of Youth Matters, our curriculum consisted of modules in which students explored critical developmental concerns (e.g. tobacco use, body image, weight, and nutrition), learned social competency and social resistance skills to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease, and developed and implemented projects to promote pro-social norms in their schools and communities. The purpose of this paper is to communicate lessons learned from the ‘In Our Voice’ project.</p>

<title>Theoretical model</title>
<p>The curriculum was based on the Social Development Model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896911422772">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896911422772">24</xref></sup> which grew out of a systematic review of experimental and longitudinal studies identifying risk and protective factors that predict healthy and unhealthy behaviors. This model integrates perspectives from social control theory,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896911422772">25</xref></sup> social learning theory,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0017896911422772">26</xref></sup> and differential association theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0017896911422772">27</xref></sup> to understand health and behavioral problems and elucidate the interaction of risk and protective factors in causing various behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896911422772">23</xref></sup> The model proposes that three broad categories of protective factors inhibit the development of unwanted behaviors in youth: (1) healthy beliefs and clear standards; (2) bonding and shared values; and (3) individual characteristics and skill sets. These social, cognitive, and emotional skills provide protective tools for youth to solve problems, assertively and confidently perform in social situations, and resist influences and impulses to violate their norms for behavior.</p>
<p>Our curriculum addressed three content areas found most effective in earlier research on prevention curricula: norm setting, social resistance, and social competence. Instructional programs aimed at changing normative beliefs can counteract social pressure by changing the social norms surrounding a behavior, such as tobacco, alcohol, or other substance use (e.g. perceptions of peer disapproval, estimates of frequency of a behavior). Social resistance curricula teach youth specific skills to resist the pressure to engage in the problem behavior. Social skills instruction seeks to enhance personal competence, thereby undermining psychological reasons for the problem behavior (e.g. reducing anxiety that leads to eating). These approaches are most effective when used in combination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0017896911422772">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0017896911422772"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0017896911422772">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our curriculum also emphasized visual, experiential, and interactive elements to ensure cultural relevance. Research suggests that a culturally appropriate curriculum may empower American Indian students and enhance their education.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0017896911422772">31</xref></sup> Research on learning styles of American Indian adolescents suggests that they have a holistic style of organizing information and a visual style of mentally representing it. Several studies have demonstrated that Native students more often process information visually than verbally,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0017896911422772">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0017896911422772"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0017896911422772">34</xref></sup> and others have observed that they respond better to visual than to verbal instruction and prefer a collaborative approach to tasks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0017896911422772">35</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section9-0017896911422772">
<title>Development</title>
<p>Each grade’s curriculum had a particular health emphasis. Lessons for all grades used a variety of teaching strategies, including exploration of critical developmental concerns related to health; analysis of the role of media in promoting unhealthy behaviors; reading; writing in journals; and group projects. The curriculum developer worked with content specialists and focus groups comprising middle school students, high school students, and teachers to ensure that the final curriculum was accurate, culturally appropriate, engaging for students, and user-friendly for teachers. Based on previous findings, the materials for our curriculum were tailored to Native culture. Program materials included lessons, DVDs, and magazines, and incorporated Native stories, legends, and art from specific tribes, with approval from the cultural consultants and focus groups. Content was distributed in 16 modules, each intended to fill 50 minutes of classroom time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0017896911422772">
<title>Implementation</title>
<p>In the 2007–2008 school year, the curriculum was implemented at five sites that accurately reflect the types of environments in which American Indian students live today: a Bureau of Indian Affairs school in a large metropolitan area, with a combined middle and high school enrollment of 305; three public schools located within the boundaries of rural Indian reservations, with combined middle and high school enrollments of 1,400, 325, and 168; and a rural tribal school with an enrollment of 150. In four of the five schools, most students were American Indian; however, in the public school with an enrollment of 1,400, approximately 80% of the students were Hispanic, 15% were Native, and the remaining 5% were White.</p>
<p>A total of 13 teachers at five sites received one day of intensive training in using the curriculum. Because of the varying sizes and environments of the five schools, each site was given flexibility in details of implementation. For example, in the Bureau of Indian Affairs school, the curriculum was taught only in grades 7 and 8. In four of the schools, the curriculum was taught by physical education or health teachers, while the fifth school used history teachers as well as physical education teachers. Teachers were also permitted to determine the teaching schedule that worked best for them. The curriculum’s 16 modules were taught two or three days a week by most teachers, daily by two teachers, and once a week by one teacher.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0017896911422772">
<title>Measurements</title>
<p>The curriculum included pre-curriculum and post-curriculum surveys with questions adapted from several instruments used in previous health research with youth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0017896911422772">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0017896911422772"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0017896911422772"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0017896911422772"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0017896911422772"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0017896911422772">41</xref></sup> Teachers administered the surveys in class to students of all races who participated in the curriculum. Toward the end of the curriculum, focus groups were held with participating students at two schools to elicit further qualitative feedback. As part of the healthy living component, all students were given free pedometers, and pedometer activities involving step record-keeping were incorporated into the curriculum in grades 7, 9, and 12. Height and weight were also recorded for each student by the teacher or the school nurse, depending on the school’s preference. Teachers and some school administrators also completed post-curriculum surveys. Results will be reported elsewhere (D. Sprague et al., in preparation).</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section12-0017896911422772" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Post-curriculum survey results and student focus groups indicated that the students preferred a multicultural perspective, inclusive of Hispanic, African-American, and other cultures, rather than an exclusive focus on Native culture. This finding was true for the schools with almost 100% Native enrollment as well as for the school with 80% Hispanic and 15% Native enrollment.</p>
<p>Most students also stated that the curriculum and the individual teaching materials should be more interactive. In the development phase, we were mindful of the limited resources of the public and tribal schools and chose DVDs as the media component to be usable by all schools. Nevertheless, the curriculum also incorporated group projects, discussions, and other group activities that would be considered interactive by educators. We did not measure how closely teachers followed the curriculum, but in a post-curriculum survey, most teachers indicated that they had modified the curriculum in some way. Even if the teachers retained the interactive components of the curriculum as designed, it is possible that the students had different concepts of interactivity – for example, one that encompasses instantaneous feedback.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section14-0017896911422772">
<title>Challenges</title>
<p>Implementing health research activities in a school setting is challenging. When we designed our curriculum, we did not take into account the political and organizational context within which the teachers and principals were working. As in other schools across the United States (US), all five of our sites were struggling to make adequate yearly progress among all racial and ethnic groups in all of the content areas required by the No Child Left Behind Act, which was passed in 2001 by Congress and implemented in 2003. As a result, teachers did not have enough classroom time to ensure that students were able to pass state achievement tests in reading, writing, mathematics, and science while adequately covering other subject areas (health, physical education, art, music and, in some cases, social studies or history). These other areas, therefore, were given less time and priority, even for students who were already meeting expectations for state achievement tests, a criticism that has been made of the No Child Left Behind Act.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0017896911422772">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>The low priority of health and physical education classes was evident in all of our schools. In the middle school of the largest rural public school, the curriculum was taught by physical education teachers, but they did not have regular classrooms, and despite their best efforts, they were able to complete only four of the 16 lessons. In the high school of the same large rural public school, curricula for grades 11 and 12 were taught by history teachers. Although they made extensive adaptations, they were unable to complete all 16 lessons. In another of the rural schools, students from grades 9 through 12 were grouped together for physical education classes; as a result, the teacher used the grade 9 curriculum for all students. In the end, the curriculum was completed in only three of the five schools.</p>
<p>Another problem is more specifically related to cultural norms and racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities. All of our school sites experienced the difficulties that result from underfunding and populations in flux. Across all schools, we were typically able to match only 50% to 60% of the pre-curriculum surveys with post-curriculum surveys. Teachers in the four schools with predominantly Native students attributed this mismatch to absenteeism as well as to actual movements of students in and out of each school district. Earlier studies have shown a history of residential mobility or circular migration of Native populations for economic, cultural, and medical reasons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0017896911422772">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0017896911422772">44</xref></sup> Some teachers reported that students were often involved in cultural activities, such as powwows, fishing, or hunting, that kept them away from school for as long as several weeks at a time.</p>
<p>Methodological decisions may also have contributed to the low rate of matching for pre- and post-curriculum surveys. Some students chose not to complete the surveys, an option that was open to them as mandated by our guidelines for research with human participants. Additionally, the coding system used to link pre- and post-curriculum surveys incorporated the last letters of students’ names. Although this system was used successfully in previous research in schools with mainly Caucasian students,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0017896911422772">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0017896911422772">46</xref></sup> it resulted in some confusion in our project because of common surnames and familial relationships within schools. Perhaps this kind of coding system is inappropriate in schools with ethnic populations sharing common surnames or in small schools where many students are related, as is often the case on rural reservations.</p>
</sec>

<title>Lessons learned</title>
<p>The five schools participating in this pilot project were located in two western states, with a distance of 1,200 miles between the two most outlying schools. The site closest to our Seattle research center was an hour away by car, but three of the sites required almost a full day of travel for researchers to visit. Low levels of funding permitted only limited travel to our study sites. Communication by telephone and email might have compensated for the lack of face-to-face contact between researchers and teachers, but in practice teachers had little free time for these efforts, and connecting with a particular teacher might require a week or more of telephoning and emailing. The lack of researcher presence on site meant that we did not have a clear sense of how closely teachers adhered to the curriculum. For future projects, we recommend allocating more funds for travel to school sites; choosing school sites closer to the research center; and/or collaborating with researchers at institutions in the vicinity of school sites. More time and funding should also be allocated to developing an ongoing relationship with the administration and teachers at each research site before implementing a curriculum, as well as to observing and measuring teachers’ actual implementation of its modules.</p>
<p>Closely related to providing a researcher presence on site is the need for an internal champion or advocate within each school. Prevention researchers have argued that, in order for prevention programs to work, they require certain characteristics in a school (e.g. a strong principal, an internal champion within the administration, involvement of such stakeholders as teachers and students).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0017896911422772">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0017896911422772"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0017896911422772"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0017896911422772">50</xref></sup> We calculated that, because our project was a simple curriculum intervention rather than an attempt to address the educational climate of an entire school, these factors would not be essential to our success. We believed that the commitment of individual teachers, financial support, and free innovative materials would be enough to motivate the teachers to successfully teach the curriculum as written. Unfortunately, we underestimated the importance of systemic factors (e.g. ensuring that classrooms were available to teach the curriculum and that teachers had enough time in their schedules to complete it). Administrators and principals were supportive of the project, but could not give it priority when faced with the exigencies of making adequate yearly progress toward the goals mandated by No Child Left Behind. Individual teachers expressed varying degrees of enthusiasm about the curriculum but had too many demands placed on them. Although they were paid to attend the training, they were not paid extra to teach the curriculum or administer the surveys. Future projects would benefit from allocating more funds to reward teachers and to support a part-time position at each site that would be devoted specifically to the curriculum project and would serve as liaison to the research staff. Our experiences suggest that the continuous presence of a researcher or research advocate in each participating site is critical for project success.</p>
<p>Our experience with curriculum development also indicates that using focus groups to develop curriculum components is insufficient to ensure that the results will engage the intended audience. We recommend the use of advisory boards comprised of participating students to provide ongoing feedback about curriculum elements, along with efforts to incorporate, when possible, the insights gleaned from these student boards. In the five schools included in our intervention, students preferred a multicultural perspective over a focus on Native cultures and traditions. This might not be the case for other Native students or for students of other ethnicities and cultures, but an active student advisory board can keep curriculum developers aware of the most effective approaches. Although few schools can afford to change curricula annually, a flexible curriculum that allows incorporation of new research findings and feedback from students has the potential to produce the desired outcomes.</p>

<p>Providing an effective cardiovascular disease curriculum is crucial to combat the increasing incidence of obesity, diabetes, physical inactivity, and high blood pressure and cholesterol in American Indian children and adolescents. Our findings suggest that research to develop the most effective curriculum requires sufficient funding for researchers to sustain an ongoing on-site presence and to provide support for at least one internal champion in each school.</p>
<p>However, educators face policy issues that are much broader than the quality and effectiveness of individual health curricula. Even an ideal curriculum will be unsuccessful if it is not fully implemented. Because none of our participating schools were able to make adequate yearly progress according to the criteria of the No Child Left Behind Act, any new curriculum whose content went beyond the skills assessed by compulsory standardized tests would most likely face significant barriers to success in these settings. Ultimately, we could not assess the efficacy of our culturally tailored curriculum because teachers could not teach it with any degree of fidelity. The Obama administration’s recent announcement of a nationwide campaign to combat childhood obesity is an encouraging sign that it recognizes the importance of physical health for the well-being of American children. Another avenue for increased emphasis on health curricula is the potential collaboration between public health organizations and schools, such as partnerships between the US Centers for Disease Control and national, state, and local organizations to develop strategies to prevent chronic disease risks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0017896911422772">51</xref></sup> Possible partners in Native communities include state-level Indian education groups and national institutions such as the Indian Health Service. It may be that the most effective approach for improving the health education of all students will be a combination of school curricula and community programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0017896911422772">52</xref></sup></p>
