<p>In his award-winning So!apbox essay, Donald Hambrick observed that the strategic management field ‘is rapidly being pulled apart by centrifugal forces. Like a supernova that once packed a wallop, our energy is now dissipating and we are quickly growing cold’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476127012457977">2004</xref>: 91), and included dynamic capabilities as one of the constructs that appeared to be most detrimental to the field’s stability. At first sight, as scholars interested in dynamic capabilities, we conceded that Hambrick appeared to be right. Navigating the literature we encountered a plethora of dynamic capability definitions, a countless number of capability types (e.g. R&amp;D, marketing, etc.) labelled as ‘dynamic’ and a variety of formulaic expressions under the generic umbrella of ‘to adapt and change firms need dynamic capabilities’. Yet, after nearly two decades, a rising number of over 100 articles, special issues and conference presentations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476127012457977">Di Stefano et al., 2010</xref>) seem to suggest that dynamic capabilities were, instead, one of the centripetal forces that helped keep the field together. So we were faced with a puzzle: were dynamic capabilities the last flash of the dying supernova, or could they rather save strategic management from its anticipated self-destruction?</p>
<p>More recently, dynamic capability research appears to have become an academic conversation polarized between equally passionate critics and supporters. Perhaps a paramount example is the exchange between Arend and Bromiley (A&amp;B) and Helfat and Peteraf (H&amp;P) on the future of dynamic capabilities published in <italic>Strategic Organization</italic> in 2009: whereas A&amp;B suggested that the dynamic capability construct should be abandoned due to its weak theoretical foundations and inconsistencies, H&amp;P called for further developmental efforts given the infancy of the field and its growing relevance. Not surprisingly, this paradigmatic match between advocates of rigour and defendants of relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476127012457977">Hirsch and Levin, 1999</xref><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1476127012457977">1</xref></sup>) has regularly appeared in <italic>Strategic Organization</italic>’s<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1476127012457977">2</xref></sup> ‘Most-Read’ rankings, together with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476127012457977">Hambrick’s (2004)</xref> call for the consolidation of strategic management. How to solve this dilemma, then: should we discard dynamic capabilities or persist with them?</p>
<p>In the face of the possibility of either the demise of strategic management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476127012457977">Hambrick, 2004</xref>) or the discovery of its ‘Holy Grail’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476127012457977">H&amp;P, 2009</xref>: 99), we decided to let the evidence speak for itself. In this essay, we intervene in the debate between A&amp;B and H&amp;P to propose that a specific developmental process of conceptual and empirical work might explain their different assessment of dynamic capabilities. A remarkable number<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1476127012457977">3</xref></sup> of prior reviews on dynamic capabilities have focused on conceptual inconsistencies and contradictions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476127012457977">Barreto, 2010</xref>), but have not taken fully into account the effects of a process which often leads researchers to cease ‘to specify the assumptions that underlie the concept or construct and treat it like a general-purpose solution to an increasing range of problems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012457977">Lane et al., 2006</xref>: 835). Labelling this process ‘reification’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012457977">Lane et al. (2006)</xref> developed a rigorous assessment methodology based on the analysis of a construct’s usage by and within its research community.</p>
<p>In what follows, we investigate the reification of dynamic capabilities by systematically considering the evidence from an extensive sample of 578 articles published in 132 journals from 1997 to 2009. We argue that understanding reification is critical, since it represents the underlying process that makes the construct both particularly attractive and profoundly divisive at the same time. This assessment is therefore of special importance in strategic management, a field plagued by ‘parochialism and disjointedness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476127012457977">Hambrick, 2004</xref>: 97) and by ‘pressures to jump on emerging research bandwagons, to publish quickly, and to avoid replication’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012457977">Lane et al., 2006</xref>: 859). We start by using Lane et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012457977">2006</xref>) methodology, via which we corroborate A&amp;B’s characterization of the state of dynamic capabilities. We next discuss the unfolding of the reification process, confirming H&amp;P’s recognition that the construct’s development path is far from complete, and that there are promising early signs of consolidation. We then build on our findings to offer actionable indications for reconciling the divergent views and producing ‘cumulative, valid, and useful’ knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012457977">Lane et al., 2006</xref>: 859) about dynamic capabilities. We conclude with an important reflection on reification.</p>
<sec id="section1-1476127012457977">
<title>Evidence for A&amp;B’s view: Dynamic capabilities are reified</title>
<p>A&amp;B concluded that the dynamic capability construct ‘serves mainly as a label for an area of study . . . a label with an implied coherence it does not possess’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476127012457977">2009</xref>: 86). Dedicating a substantial amount of time to reviewing whether dynamic capabilities have become a reified (i.e. taken-for-granted) construct, we have relied fully on Lane et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012457977">2006</xref>) methodology, assessing reification as being reflected by three concurring indicators: (a) the importance of a construct in a paper’s core topic; (b) the closeness of each paper’s usage of a construct to its original conceptualization; and (c) the level of cohesion about the construct within the research community.</p>
<sec id="section2-1476127012457977">
<title>The importance of dynamic capabilities in each paper</title>
<p>We first assessed whether the construct was of central importance to each paper’s core topic or whether it was simply ‘a grace note that embellishes a paper without adding substance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012457977">Lane et al., 2006</xref>: 834). To define the notion of ‘substantial usage’, we counted articles in three categories (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1476127012457977">Table 1</xref> for our sampling methodology). The first category contains papers where the authors claim, as their central contribution, to extend the theory or definition of dynamic capabilities: examples include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476127012457977">Eisenhardt and Martin (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476127012457977">Winter (2003)</xref>. In the second, we included papers where the construct was directly incorporated in authors’ hypotheses, propositions and/or models, or where it was clearly instrumental in developing them: examples here include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476127012457977">Blyler and Coff (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476127012457977">Salvato (2009)</xref>. We coded the remaining papers into a third category, where dynamic capabilities were used in other substantial ways, embracing such studies as those by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476127012457977">Newbert (2007)</xref>, whose review of the resource-based view formally covered dynamic capabilities, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476127012457977">Nightingale (2008)</xref>, who discussed the construct within the theme of meta-paradigm change and the theory of the firm. Despite attempting to be very inclusive (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012457977">Lane et al., 2006</xref>), we nonetheless ended up with only 104 articles that made substantial use of the dynamic capability construct.</p>

<p>Second, we considered the extent to which prior research built incrementally on the seminal conceptualization of dynamic capabilities.

To verify the extent to which later studies ‘have sought to make incremental improvements’ (H&amp;P, p. 94), we compared how our sample’s substantial papers built on Teece et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1476127012457977">1997</xref>) components. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1476127012457977">Table 2</xref> summarizes the findings of our two criteria and shows that only the 79 papers (13.6%) in the first seven columns directly discussed processes, paths or positions (or their synonyms such as routines, trajectories and strengths) in relation to the dynamic capability construct.</p>

<title>The cohesion of the dynamic capability research community</title>
<p>The taken-for-grantedness of a construct reflected by the first two indicators is not sufficient to determine its reification: the third critical determinant is a low degree of cohesion within a research community, with different studies or authors sharing labels but not meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012457977">Lane et al., 2006</xref>). We assessed the degree of cohesion by analysing the citation patterns in our final sample, and by verifying whether the literature presented a strong and interdependent citation network. Put differently, the less tightly interlinked the 104 papers in our final set were, the more the dynamic capability construct’s reification would be signalled.</p>
<p>Using two software tools (SITKIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476127012457977">Schildt, 2006</xref>] and UCINET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476127012457977">Borgatti et al., 2002</xref>]), we created a database of the references in the final sample’s substantial papers, and then determined how often each paper had cited (‘Citations Sent’) or been cited by others (‘Citations Received’) in the sample, and the average annual numbers of such links (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012457977">Lane et al., 2006</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1476127012457977">Table 3</xref>). We found that nearly half (51 articles) of the final sample papers had not been cited by any other sample article and that over half (53 articles) produced less than 0.5 average links per year.

<title>Reification’s implications</title>
<p>It is hard to deny that our reification assessment casts a shadow on the construct’s past development. Only a rather limited number of papers used dynamic capabilities in substantial (i.e. non-ritual) ways and ‘the cross-citations between the papers in this body of literature show little evidence of an accumulated body of knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012457977">Lane et al., 2006</xref>: 858). Taken together, it appears dynamic capabilities have become a reified construct in strategic management, surely adding grist to A&amp;B’s (and Hambrick’s) mill.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1476127012457977">
<title>Evidence for H&amp;P’s view: The effects of reification are retrenching</title>
<p>Given this evidence of reification, A&amp;B’s suggestion that the construct should be abandoned seems justified. However, H&amp;P argued that ‘theory concerning dynamic capabilities has had little time to develop . . . as a field of inquiry, it is still in its infancy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476127012457977">2009</xref>: 92) and claimed to see ‘strong signals in terms of scholarly interest regarding dynamic capabilities potential’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476127012457977">2009</xref>: 99). Whereas the attractiveness of dynamic capabilities is a matter of fact (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476127012457977">Di Stefano et al., 2010</xref>), this very attractiveness may carry the risk of confining the construct to the realm of academic fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476127012457977">Abrahamson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476127012457977">Bort and Kieser, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476127012457977">Starbuck, 2009</xref>). While H&amp;P’s argument that time would rectify the construct’s defects seemed compelling, it was supported by little evidence. Probing our data, we found two elements which imply that the effects of the reification of dynamic capabilities are not irreversible.</p>
<sec id="section7-1476127012457977">
<title>Evolution of the usage of the dynamic capability construct</title>
<p>A curious aspect of Lane et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012457977">2006</xref>) methodology was the definition of reification as a dynamic process but its assessment as a static outcome, a drawback which they addressed by proposing a thematic analysis and a reconceptualization of their focal construct, i.e. absorptive capacity. Given the nature of the debate on dynamic capabilities, we looked instead at the reification of dynamic capabilities as a process, exploring how it unfolded over time, and found that, far from being unidirectional, it passed through at least four phases (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1476127012457977">Figure 1</xref>). Crucially for our purposes, this suggests that, at the time of A&amp;B and H&amp;P’s debate, a static assessment of past literature would have produced the ‘mirage’ of a problematic conversation about dynamic capabilities, which was actually the persistent lagged consequence of the earlier excitement about the construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476127012457977">Hirsch and Levin, 1999</xref>). However, a closer look at the diffusion of dynamic capabilities shows that the proportion of substantial contributions had grown significantly by 2009, and had already climbed beyond its worryingly low earlier levels (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476127012457977">Hirsch and Levin, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>The influential role of leading authors in the research community</title>
<p>The second piece of evidence which concurs with H&amp;P’s view is that dynamic capability literature has built a strong and recognized core of several fundamental papers over time. Despite the literature’s general lack of cohesion, the construct has been nurtured by many influential scholars, who have helped the community to better understand specific aspects. From those who have focused on routines (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476127012457977">Helfat and Peteraf, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476127012457977">Winter, 2003</xref>) to those who have paid attention to path dependence and cognitive boundaries (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476127012457977">Posen and Levinthal, 2012</xref>), to mention just a few streams, we can observe successful efforts towards incrementally specialized research on dynamic capabilities. More specifically (as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1476127012457977">Figure 2</xref> shows) the collective reputation of such important voices as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476127012457977">Eisenhardt and Martin (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1476127012457977">Zollo and Winter (2002)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476127012457977">Helfat and Peteraf (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476127012457977">Winter (2003)</xref> has helped shape the diffusion of dynamic capabilities within academic circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476127012457977">Bort and Kieser, 2011</xref>). We found that the cumulative influence of these important contributions, coupled with the appearance of the first published reviews on dynamic capabilities (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1476127012457977">Wang and Ahmed, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1476127012457977">Zahra et al., 2006</xref>), constituted a retrenchment after 2006, which began to counterbalance the negative effects of reification.</p>

<title>The implications of retrenchment</title>
<p>H&amp;P pointed out that ‘emerging and evolving theories develop slowly, over long periods of time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476127012457977">2009</xref>: 92), reinforcing this defence in their essay title. But, while devoting much effort to addressing A&amp;B’s conceptual issues, H&amp;P offered little support for their temporal argument. Nonetheless, our close examination of the reification of dynamic capabilities seems to substantiate their claim in two ways. First, we found that ritual use of the construct appears less prominent recently than at earlier stages of its diffusion. Second, in contrast to the lack of cohesion that signals a truly reified construct, the dynamic capability research community recognizes a strong group of intellectual touchstones, and its leading authors have proactively engaged in driving the construct’s consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476127012457977">Hirsch and Levin, 1999</xref>). Considering this evidence carefully, it seems that the construct’s reification has retrenched over time, and is now less obviously a reason for abandoning it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1476127012457977">
<title>‘So-what’: At the crossroads between abandonment and persistence</title>
<p>In our essay, we have investigated the dilemma of a construct, i.e. dynamic capabilities, facing the tension between the search for relevance and the requirement for rigor. We have demonstrated how this tension may be explained by seeing conceptual reification as an unfolding process, and our findings make us lean, albeit cautiously, towards suggesting the construct deserves more focused research, rather than to be prematurely abandoned. We argue that, in the early days of excitement about dynamic capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476127012457977">Hirsch and Levin, 1999</xref>), research on the construct suffered from ‘a scattered pattern of knowledge accumulation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012457977">Lane et al., 2006</xref>: 859) which led to its relatively extensive but ritual usage. Increasing perceptions of the detrimental effects of reification led to widespread concerns in the academic community and to early attempts to review the construct (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1476127012457977">Zahra et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1476127012457977">Wang and Ahmed, 2007</xref>), culminating in A&amp;B openly throwing down the gauntlet and challenging its very validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476127012457977">Hirsch and Levin, 1999</xref>). At the same time, however, we have found evidence of the dynamic capability construct as becoming consolidated ‘along a developmental path’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476127012457977">H&amp;P, 2009</xref>: 91), and believe that, if their argument had not been grounded in a static picture of past reification phases, A&amp;B might have tempered their overall condemnation.</p>
<p>By shedding light on how the reification process has helped shape the diffusion of dynamic capabilities, we have arguably resolved one dilemma, but opened up another, more significant one. Once a validity challenge starts, its outcome may be quite uncertain. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476127012457977">Hirsch and Levin (1999</xref>: 205) suggest, ‘scholars either make the construct coherent (override of challenges), agree to disagree over its definition (permanent issue), or call for its demise (construct collapse)’. We caution the community that dynamic capabilities are at the crossroads between establishing itself as a robust strategic management theory and being abandoned, just as innumerable fashionable constructs have been in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476127012457977">Bort and Kieser, 2011</xref>). But A&amp;B’s rigorous criticisms cannot just be ignored, as they are important warnings of the potential detrimental effects of reification, such as a loss of significance and theoretical fragmentation. We view the growing number of articles aiming to develop and refine the construct as a promising sign, but nonetheless counsel scholars to pay careful attention when engaging with dynamic capabilities, as they are still affected by many inconsistencies and much confusion. In this respect, we believe dynamic capability research would benefit if authors adopted one or more of three basic safeguards against reification:</p>
<sec id="section11-1476127012457977">
<title>1. Striving for clarity of definition(s)</title>
<p>First and foremost, avoiding the effects of reification requires definitional clarity, which helps build incremental knowledge and facilitates the establishment of a ‘winning path’. In practice, we encourage researchers to state openly and upfront which definition their papers follow and why, and, more importantly, to incorporate specific components of their chosen definition into their proposed theoretical and/or empirical structure. Recent instances of exemplary practice include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476127012457977">Danneels (2010)</xref>, who clearly builds on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476127012457977">Eisenhardt and Martin’s (2000)</xref> work, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476127012457977">Hodgkinson and Healy (2011)</xref>, who expand on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1476127012457977">Teece’s (2007)</xref>. Independent of which definition researchers choose, we strongly believe continuous theoretical cherry-picking and mixing sub-elements from competing definitions will be the surest route to the construct’s collapse. In addition, given the construct’s burgeoning definitional complexity, ‘perhaps the largest source of confusion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476127012457977">Cepeda and Vera, 2007</xref>: 426), we consider dynamic capability researchers would be well advised to engage in a profound scrutiny of the numerous underlying meanings that have been attached to the construct over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476127012457977">Suddaby, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1476127012457977">
<title>2. Standing on the shoulders of ‘engaged giants’</title>
<p>With the caveat that the central definition should be transparently selected, we suggest future research would benefit from directly engaging with the foundational core of the dynamic capability construct (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1476127012457977">Table 3</xref>). In practice, we call for authors (and reviewers) to discuss openly how their work confirms, extends, refines or challenges the key papers in the field. At worst, by encouraging critical reviews of the core literature, this will reduce the number of ritual contributions; at best, this route can foster the construct’s consolidation and substantial incremental refinement. In either case, we suspect the threat of the collapse of the dynamic capability construct becoming a permanent issue will be reduced. At the same time, however, counterbalancing reification pleads for ‘engaged giants’ (such as those in our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1476127012457977">Figure 2</xref>) to continue their integrative theorizing effort. If it is probably too much to expect dynamic capabilities to develop ‘like Athena springing forth from Zeus’s forehead fully armed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476127012457977">H&amp;P, 2009</xref>: 92), it seems reasonable to demand Zeus to nurture his other children a bit more. Contributions such as Helfat et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476127012457977">2007</xref>) book have clearly shown an impact, but reification requires constant attention on how the dynamic capability construct develops.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1476127012457977">
<title>3. Engaging in empirical research</title>
<p>Despite the construct’s progress, we need much more empirical research on dynamic capabilities. A&amp;B and H&amp;P both placed considerable emphasis on arguing about the empirical support of a discussion which had not yet been fully theorized. Our investigation found excellent pieces of empirical research, but only few (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1476127012457977">Table 2</xref>), making it difficult to assess dynamic capability research’s empirical support. We maintain that an increase in carefully crafted empirical work would enhance the chances of challenges to the construct’s validity being overcome by both strengthening the recognition of dynamic capabilities in academia and supporting its relevance for external practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476127012457977">Hirsch and Levin, 1999</xref>). We suspect we need not call for more theoretical contributions: in proportion to other constructs, dynamic capabilities seem to be naturally fruitful in this respect.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section14-1476127012457977">
<title>Reflections on reification</title>
<p>The reification of academic constructs poses an intriguing question that goes beyond the dynamic capability case and relates to fashions in management research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476127012457977">Abrahamson, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476127012457977">Bort and Kieser (2011)</xref> recently demonstrated that fashionable constructs are predominant and, to a certain extent, unavoidable in organization theory. Building on earlier work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476127012457977">Blumer (1969)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476127012457977">Starbuck (2009)</xref>, they speculate whether ‘fashion is negative or positive for the development of science’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476127012457977">Bort and Kieser, 2011</xref>: 672), but, sticking to a bird-eye perspective on academic constructs, stop short of localizing the underlying processes which shape fashion-like diffusion.</p>
<p>With signs of faddishness already suggested for such successful strategic management ideas as the resource-based view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476127012457977">Arend, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476127012457977">Newbert, 2007</xref>), absorptive capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012457977">Lane et al., 2006</xref>) and dynamic capabilities, as well as for research streams including transaction cost economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476127012457977">David and Han, 2004</xref>) and entrepreneurship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476127012457977">Aldrich, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476127012457977">Ogbor, 2000</xref>), we wonder too whether fashions really constitute necessary yet fundamentally detrimental phenomena. More specifically, in this essay we have provided granular evidence that reification may accurately represent a critical process behind academic fashions. So we ask explicitly: <italic>Is reification merely an evil?</italic></p>
<p>Prior research warns of the damaging impact of reification on the production of valid and cumulative knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012457977">Lane et al., 2006</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476127012457977">Arend and Bromiley (2009)</xref> have voiced similar concerns in observing that dynamic capabilities may be ‘susceptible of [<italic>sic</italic>] halo effects . . . [they] may become a talisman’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476127012457977">2009</xref>: 83). Yet, noticing that breakthrough ideas often take a long time to develop (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1476127012457977">Williamson, 1999</xref>), Helfat and Peteraf suggested that ‘terms that are vague and elastic may offer the advantage of facilitating a more flexible developmental path’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476127012457977">2009</xref>: 92). In the same vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1476127012457977">Green (2004)</xref> has observed that, when rapid diffusion brings acceptance and taken-for-grantedness, conceptual innovation may become institutionalized, producing theoretical stability. If reification clearly carries this risk of conceptual fuzziness, it is perhaps time for future research to explore its brighter side more thoughtfully.</p>

<title>Postscript</title>
<p>We do not yet know if dynamic capabilities will ultimately become a fully formed theory or will be abandoned. Irrespective of what eventually happens, it is probably fair to observe at the end of this essay that the construct has not yet extinguished <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476127012457977">Hambrick’s (2004)</xref> supernova. Nearly another decade has gone by, and strategic management seems still to be in shape: to date, we can at least argue that the reports of its imminent demise have been greatly exaggerated.</p>
