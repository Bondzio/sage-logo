<p>The major theories of International Relations (IRT) differ significantly as far as their concepts of conflict and cooperation are concerned. However, they share one common denominator: They are deeply rooted in Western experiences and intellectual history. Recently, a growing literature on the possibilities and benefits of a non-Western IRT has emerged. This article proposes a ‘via media’: a theoretical approach that can be applied to Western and non-Western IR alike, taking into consideration the specific historical, ideational and cultural contexts. Based on social constructivism as developed by Alexander Wendt, it is argued that the existence of a collective identity among states in a given region can manifest itself in distinctive logics or cultures of anarchy. These are based on norms of conflict or cooperation that can be established through interaction, can be proposed by outside agents and localized, or can be affected by the re-negotiation of state identity caused by domestic events. In addition, there are cultural path dependencies: norms rooted in the cultural memory or consciousness of a region which tend to be ignored by interpretations that merely focus on current events or established Western models of cooperation. Area studies can contribute to provide this context.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, a major debate has emerged on the existence or absence of Non-Western International Relations Theory/ies (IRT), prompting one scholar to speak of the ‘booming non-Western IRT projects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010836711433125">Chen, 2011</xref>: 17). Among those involved, some agreement seems to have been reached regarding the starting point of the endeavour: ‘the current parochialism and ethnocentrism of “International Relations” as a field of study, especially its dominant theoretical approaches, are unacceptable and perhaps untenable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010836711433125">Acharya, 2011</xref>: 621). There is less unity when it comes to the consequences of this observation. Is there a need for genuine non-Western IRT, i.e. a distinctive Chinese or Indian IRT? What ideational sources would these theories be based on? Would such an approach be ‘inviting nativism’ or end up in a mere ‘mimicry’ of Western-centric approaches – and would we need a ‘democratization’ of IRT and a re-orientation towards a post-Western era instead? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010836711433125">Chen, 2011</xref>)</p>
<p>Several important articles and volumes on the topic have been published, but the current research seems to be still mostly in the stage of stock-taking, i.e. reports organized along country lines, discussions of non-Western traditions of thinking on international politics and the question how structural factors in the academic environment even today hinder the development of such theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010836711433125">Acharya and Buzan, 2007b</xref>: 427). While there is disagreement about the benefits, more consent can be found regarding the notion that these impulses must emerge from within the non-West. This article<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0010836711433125">1</xref></sup> suggests that scholars socialized in the ‘West’ do not have to be excluded from this important debate, but can contribute to it by incorporating the expertise of area studies into such a necessary ‘theoretical decolonization’ process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010836711433125">Ayoob, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010836711433125">Barnett, 2002</xref>: 49) within IR studies. Obviously, such an endeavour would not lead to a specific non-Western IRT nor would it have to: It is argued that the main quest should be for a theoretical approach that can take into consideration the specifics of IR in the non-Western world – without merely imposing an Eurocentric view of the state system. This is in accordance with the conclusion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010836711433125">Acharya and Buzan (2007b</xref>: 437), in which the authors call for a wider rooting of Western IR concepts rather than for their wholesale replacement.</p>
<p>The approach proposed here is informed by three notions in particular: First, questions of culture and identity are important sources for theorizing on IR outside the West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010836711433125">Tickner, 2003</xref>), pointing towards constructivism as a suitable starting point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010836711433125">Acharya, 2011</xref>: 623). Second, analysis should be based on the regional level – since existing IRT has been almost exclusively based on the ‘Western’ experience and the European Union has been set as a benchmark against which other regional organizations are measured, different regions may yield different ways of thinking about IR. And third, the debate on non-Western IRT has so far been predominantly an ‘Asian affair’. This may have to do with the scholars involved as well as the fact that academics and policy-makers in Asia have been particularly outspoken in countering Western approaches to IR and regionalism, reaching back to the ‘Asian values’ debate in the early 1990s. In connecting with this state of affairs, this article focuses on Southeast Asia and its regional organization, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which has emerged in the past two decades as a busy playing field for all major IR theories.</p>
<p>Based on these notions, the adaptation of an already existing IR theory is proposed: a <italic>via media</italic>, where the basic concept may have been based on Western thoughts, but where the application itself can draw from identities, norms and ideas that are rooted in the regional political culture and history. The social constructivism as developed by Alexander Wendt with his concept of specific ‘cultures of anarchy’ seems to lend itself especially well to this modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010836711433125">Wendt, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0010836711433125">2003</xref>). First, constructivist approaches are, by their very nature, more flexible and less based on preconceived notions than the other major schools in IR. In contrast, the core characteristics and behaviour of states are not seen as given (usually deducted from Western historical experiences) but socially constructed. And, second, even though Wendt operates with terms rooted deeply in Western thinking by labelling certain cultures of state interaction as ‘Hobbesian’ or ‘Lockean’, he acknowledges the possible existence of other logics of anarchy.</p>
<p>Therefore, by applying this concept to ASEAN, this article aims to identify distinctive ASEAN cultures of conflict and cooperation. In that sense, the <italic>Arthaśāstra</italic>, an Indian manual on statecraft by Kautilya, defines a political culture which parallels the Hobbesian culture of Europe. In contrast, early roots of ‘regionness’, as found in the 14th and 15th centuries Majapahit Empire, could be seen as a base for early stages of cooperation. In an extension of Wendt, norms that constitute a collective identity are not only constructed through interaction, but also through identity change at the domestic level and through localization of norms prevalent in the existing international system or as promoted by outside actors.</p>
<p>Both area studies and IR theory could benefit from such an approach: area studies would be provided with a theoretical instrument that takes into consideration the specific political cultures of their respective fields of study. And the constructivist school of IR could gain deeper insight into the dynamics of change between logics of anarchy, and, by identifying specific forms in different regions, could add a comparative approach to their theory. Thus, the ‘false promise of Area Studies (which succeeded in neither “universalising” nor “de-parochialising” the social sciences)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010836711433125">Bilgin, 2008</xref>: 11) may come true after all: By making the findings of social sciences more universal through including data about ‘non-Western’ parts of the world.</p>

<title>Southeast Asia and International Relations Theory</title>
<p>The relationship between Southeast Asia and International Relations Theory has certainly undergone a remarkable change during the past two decades. From being two nearly completely separate entities up to the end of the Cold War, Southeast Asia has now become a highly contested experimental field for the application of the major Theories of International Relations. Until the late 1980s, authors writing about the region confined themselves mostly to atheoretical descriptions; if they chose to apply a theoretical framework, they usually picked neorealism. The 1990s, on the other hand, suddenly witnessed a very lively debate between the various schools of IR. What had caused this change? A change in world politics, a new dynamic in the region and a ‘proliferation of theories in IR’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010836711433125">Acharya and Stubbs, 2006</xref>: 126).</p>
<p>The end of the Cold War had shattered the foundation of the dominance of realist approaches to IR. All of a sudden states seemed to behave in unpredictable ways, <italic>Balance of Power</italic> did not necessarily seem to be the main variable in IR, and cooperation seemed possible. These changes in the international environment had a profound impact on the Southeast Asian region, which by then had experienced its ‘economic miracle’ for a decade. This led to rising confidence among the politicians in the region, tracing this success to a specific set of ‘Asian values’, which they claimed to be the guiding principle behind their regional organization, ASEAN:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0010836711433125">2</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote><p>We in ASEAN have created a community of Southeast Asian nations at peace with one another and at peace with the world, rapidly achieving prosperity for our peoples and steadily improving their lives. Our rich diversity has provided the strength and inspiration to us to help one another foster a strong sense of community.<sup>3</sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>ASEAN started to receive increasing attention among scholars with an IR background; in the early 1990s, institutionalists challenged the prevailing dominance of realistic models which mostly focused on security issues in the region. Those liberal-institutionalist authors introduced <italic>cooperation</italic> and <italic>institution-building</italic> as new paradigms to the study of International Relations in Southeast Asia. Most authors shared the optimistic outlook prevailing in the region, based on the efforts of the ASEAN member states to play a more active role in regional and trans-regional cooperation. The eventual withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia allowed the organization to overcome one of the main obstacles for closer cooperation, and the creation of the Asian Regional Forum (ARF) in 1994 was seen as a promising response to the new uncertainty that was prevalent after the end of the bipolar world order. Still, formal institutionalization remained rather weak – a fact that was actually interpreted as an advantage by some authors. Thus, the <italic>ASEAN Way</italic> was praised as a unique code of conduct for inter-state behaviour and a decision-making process based on consultations and consensus. Principles attributed to the <italic>ASEAN Way</italic> were non-interference in the domestic affairs of member countries, non-use of force, peaceful settlement of disputes, respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the ASEAN states. This set code of conduct, Amitav Acharya noted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010836711433125">1997</xref>, was ‘not so much about the substance or structure of multilateral interactions, but a claim about the <italic>process</italic>, through which such interactions are carried out’ (1997: 329); emphasis added by Acharya). Still, its norms can be found in several official political documents, such as the ASEAN Declaration (1967) and the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia (1976).</p>
<p>Another unique attribute that ASEAN member states claimed was their aforementioned set of ‘Asian values’, which were never clearly defined but said to give economic development priority over democratization. Critics saw the value debate, which was pushed forward by authoritarian leaders like Malaysia’s Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad or Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew, as an attempt to use the rapid economic success as an excuse for the poor performance in the area of democracy and human rights.</p>
<p>This euphoria came to a sudden halt with the Asian financial crisis in 1997/1998, which witnessed ‘everybody for themselves’ reactions instead of regional cooperation, prompting some theoretical reassessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010836711433125">Katzenstein and Sil, 2004</xref>: 22). While institutionalist interpretations of the region seem never to have fully recovered from the blow of the financial crisis, new reflexivist/constructivist theory models that contributed to the aforementioned ‘proliferation of theories in IR’ stepped in and were increasingly applied to the region. Different sets of norms, state actors and collective identities were some of the key categories with which scholars tried to analyse what they considered to be ‘one of the most successful regional organizations in the developing world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010836711433125">Acharya, 2001</xref>: 208).</p>
<p>Some of these constructivist interpretations ambitiously aimed for the status of a meta-theory that subsumes and supplants realism and liberalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010836711433125">Peou, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010836711433125">Rother, 2004</xref>). This is most certainly yet to be achieved, and the perception of See Seng <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0010836711433125">Tan (2006</xref>: 239, 240) that a ‘new constructivist orthodoxy’ is in place now seems rather farfetched. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010836711433125">Acharya and Stubbs (2006</xref>: 130) identify ‘only a handful’ of constructivist writers on ASEAN and see realism as still being the dominant approach in the region. Writers such as Tsuyoshi Kawasaki have taken up the challenge posed by constructivism and characterize the approach as applied in the region as ‘romantic and intellectually naïve’ (as quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010836711433125">Acharya and Stubbs, 2006</xref>: 130). In another sharp attack, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010836711433125">David Martin Jones and Michael L. R. Smith (2007)</xref> claimed that when looking at hard empirical facts as opposed to Acharya’s approach of ‘thick description’, it would become apparent that ASEAN was ‘making process, not progress’.</p>
<p>While some authors support theoretical pluralism rather than the dominance of one theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010836711433125">Acharya and Stubbs, 2006</xref>: 125, 126), others predict something short of a showdown where realism and constructivism are ‘the key intellectual competitors in Southeast Asian security studies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010836711433125">Peou, 2002</xref>: 120). Meanwhile, Shaun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010836711433125">Narine (2006</xref>: 199, 200) makes the point that ‘the English School remains a distinct approach to understanding IR’ and is ‘more in accordance with the realities in the Southeast Asian region’. Other authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010836711433125">Alagappa, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0010836711433125">Roberts, 2011</xref>) have applied the regional security complex theory developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010836711433125">Buzan and Wæver (2003)</xref> to Southeast Asia, identifying two separate security complexes that ‘have historically existed where one covered the continental/mainland subregion (Indochina plus Thailand and Myanmar) and the other embraced the Malay/maritime archipelago’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0010836711433125">Roberts, 2011</xref>: 371). Regardless whether one subscribes to this distinction, the fact that Thailand was part of the ASEAN-5 shows that the distinction was at least not as clear-cut anymore at the time of the founding of the association.</p>
<p>In short, the current debates in IR have markedly influenced the analytical discourse in the region, but does the same apply the other way around as well? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010836711433125">Acharya (2005</xref>: 7) criticizes that ‘theoretical work on Asian regionalism continues to ignore local, national, or regional political context central to those writing on Asian regionalism’. Although some adaptation has taken place, most theories still heavily carry with them their European or North American background and references. The results are legitimate and fruitful, of course, but discourses from within the region have been mostly absent ever since the <italic>Asian Values</italic> debate, which produced only very limited academic output anyway. Only recently, there appears to be some sort of revival of the <italic>Asian Values</italic> debate, led by Kishore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010836711433125">Mahbubani (2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0010836711433125">b)</xref>, but this time the goal of the ‘Singapore school’ seems to be to reject uniform Western concepts of democracy instead of praising genuine Asian approaches.</p>
<p>One notable exception has been the debate started by David C. Kang. In his article ‘Getting Asia Wrong: the need for new analytical frameworks’ he criticized the Eurocentric background of IR studies, and stated that ‘these theories do a poor job as they are applied to Asia’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0010836711433125">2003</xref>: 4). The author has been applauded for his statement, yet his answer – which is a kind of reductionist realism with a focus on <italic>bandwagoning</italic> and the absence of <italic>balancing</italic> in Asia – is not convincing either, due to a highly problematic praise of the stabilizing potential of Chinese hegemony. In a rejoinder, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010836711433125">Acharya (2003/4</xref>: 156) characterized the approach as a dangerous attempt in ‘Asian cultural historicism’.</p>
<p>While interdisciplinarity has many proponents, the exchange between area specialists and mainstream IR scholars has been very limited so far. This article argues that IR research can learn a lot from regional specialists but should sidestep diminishing the explanatory power of IR theorizing if at one point each region might claim its own genuine framework. Instead, an approach could be helpful that can make a number of universal assumptions, and is at the same time open for regional cultural peculiarities. In this regard, a first step would be a fusion of regional historical experiences and discourses and strains of IR theory, which take such roots into account but have drawn so far almost exclusively from Western experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010836711433125">Acharya and Buzan, 2007a</xref>: 288). Thus, the objective of this article is to contribute to the transitional and hybrid scholarship that Alan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010836711433125">Chong (2007)</xref> called for as an answer to the absence of non-Western theorizing upon Southeast Asian international relations.</p>
<p>Realist and liberal-institutionalist theories that base their often broad claims of universality almost exclusively on Western thought seem ill-equipped to perform such a task. The <italic>subaltern realism</italic> proposed by Mohammed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010836711433125">Ayoob (2002)</xref> promised to be a notable exception. But while raising a number of important points, among them the fact that IR theory is based on the experiences of only a minority of states in the international system, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010836711433125">Barnett (2002</xref>: 55) rightfully criticizes that Ayoob’s approach follows in the ‘decade-long tradition of injecting auxiliary assumptions into realism to explain empirical anomalies’. Furthermore, while designed by the author as a ‘perspective’ to fill the gaps in realist theory, subaltern realism rather seems to contradict the theory it aims to supplement, for example in stressing the role of domestic politics. Finally, the high praise of the Westphalian system could be seen as part of exactly the Western bias Ayoob wants to overcome.</p>
<p>Instead, an approach based on the social constructivism as developed by Alexander Wendt can be a promising starting point for linking IR theory and area studies, as isargued in the following section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0010836711433125">
<title>The constructivism of Alexander Wendt I, II and III and his potential for adaption to Southeast Asia</title>
<p>The selection of ‘Social Theory of International Politics’, published in 1999, for the ‘International Studies Best Book of the Decade Award’ in 2006 clearly shows the marked impact Alexander Wendt’s ‘opus magnum’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010836711433125">Drulák, 2006</xref>: 140) has left on IR debate. Praise, discussion and criticism of Wendt’s concepts have been frequent and passionate, implementation much less so. Especially among the constructivist approaches analysing regionalism in Southeast Asia, many authors have implemented norms or ideas in their research, but very few explicitly derive their theoretical foundation from Alexander Wendt.</p>
<p>While constructivism has been accused of being more method than theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010836711433125">Checkel, 1998</xref>: 325), readers of ‘Social Theory’ encounter much theory, yet very little methodological help. Wendt’s apparent lack of interest in a ‘real world’ equivalent to his concepts, such as ‘logics of anarchy’, has not helped to promote an empirical application either: ‘Readers looking for detailed propositions about the international system, let alone empirical tests, will be disappointed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010836711433125">Wendt, 1999</xref>: 6). Furthermore, two recent turns in his theory – one <italic>teleological</italic>, one <italic>quantum</italic> – have added some confusion. This article goes straight to the points considered most relevant in ‘Wendt I, II and III’ in order to derive a model that is useful in bringing insights from area studies into the Theory of International Relations.</p>
<p>The article uses the distinction between ‘Wendt I’ and ‘Wendt II’ introduced by Petr Drulák and adds ‘Wendt III’ for his more recent work. Under ‘Wendt I’ a highly influential set of articles (1992, 1994) is subsumed, culminating in the aforementioned book <italic>Social Theory of International Politics</italic>. Wendt II refers to the ‘teleological turn’ in the article ‘Why a World State is Inevitable’ (2003). Wendt III refers to the ‘quantum turn’ in ‘Social Theory in Cartesian Science’, which is a fascinating challenge to the basic assumptions of classical thinking and is based on the ‘heretical’ thought: ‘What if the limitations of contemporary social science and philosophy of mind alike lie in their common assumption that relationship of mind (ideas) to body (the material world) must be compatible with classical physics?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010836711433125">Wendt, 2006</xref>: 183). Challenging as this turn may be, it is still in an early stage of theory development.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0010836711433125">4</xref></sup> Considering those recent turns in his theory, the article proposes an approach for the study of ASEAN which is not ‘Wendt all the way down’ but more something of a ‘rump social constructivism’ with added features. This is based on the three main assumptions.</p>
<p>First, nation-states are still considered the main level of analysis. While this has been one of the most criticized aspects of Wendt’s theory, and there is no denying the growing importance of civil society, the development of new ‘transnational political spaces’, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0010836711433125">Rother, 2009</xref>), the criticism is in a way beside the point. Wendt is looking at the systemic level of states, where change can be achieved mainly through the actors who constitute this system – ‘as such it makes no more sense to criticize a theory of international politics as ‘state-centric’ than it does to criticize a theory of forests for being “tree-centric”’ (1999: 9). In the case of Southeast Asian security, for example, See Seng <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0010836711433125">Tan (2006</xref>: 252) goes to great lengths in his article to demonstrate the misguided underlying assumptions of constructivist researchers that treat agency as essentially pre-given, and accuses Wendt in making a ‘mockery out of human agency’, only to come to this conclusion:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Importantly, constructivists help to undermine the rationalist myth, maintained by neo-realists and neo-liberals alike, about international anarchy as given. Constructivists also show how regions and regional identities come about. Thanks to constructivism, we are able to see how states and norms work to produce anarchy, regions and/or states. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0010836711433125">Tan, 2006</xref>: 255)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>One might argue that with the prospect of gaining such insights as described by Tan, taking states as given entities and as central actors is a price well worth paying. Considering the early stage of research in this area, it is certainly legitimate to make use of the new possibilities of this state-centric approach first and save including additional levels or applying a ‘thicker’ constructivism, as Tan seems to postulate, for later.</p>
<p>Second, states interests and identities are not exogenously given, but constructed. Several studies on Southeast Asian security are characterized by listing accurately, yet somewhat excessively states’ military capacities. The ‘arms race’ in the early 1990s in the region has been interpreted as a sign of continuing or growing mistrust, but the more interesting question, Wendt might argue, would be: what perception of the <italic>Other</italic> (state) provides these weapons with their frightening potential? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010836711433125">Jepperson et al. (1996</xref>: 59) define identity simply as ‘the basic character of states’, but acknowledge the possibility of identity change by referring to a concept common in social psychology: ‘It refers to the images of individuality and distinctiveness (“selfhood”) held and projected by an actor and formed (and modified over time) through relations with significant “others.” Thus the term (by convention) references mutually constructed and evolving images of self and other.’ This identity is based on norms, commonly defined as collective expectations about proper behaviour for a given identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010836711433125">Jepperson et al. 1996</xref>: 54). But what scholars applying or describing a constructivist approach often seem to neglect is what can be called the ‘non-normative’ quality of norms: They may limit as well as strengthen cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010836711433125">Rother, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010836711433125">Wendt, 1999</xref>: 253, 254).</p>
<p>Besides norms, interest of states can be generated or redefined by collective identities. These collective identities can take up a life of their own and develop even if they are not congruent with the identities of some of the members. Wendt III uses the quantum approach to define social systems as ‘super-organisms with collective consciousness’, which seems plausible even if one does not subscribe to the underlying view that this consciousness is constituted by ‘wave functions’ which collapse by the process of inter-action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010836711433125">Wendt, 2006</xref>: 200).</p>
<p>The third and central assumption is that anarchy has more than one logic, which is not necessarily based on Western thought. Starting point of Wendt I is the frequently quoted article ‘Anarchy is what states make of it: the social construction of power politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0010836711433125">Wendt, 1992</xref>). The main point in which Wendt distinguishes his reflexive approach from what he calls the rationalist approaches is his view on agency. Both neorealism and neoliberal institutionalism assume that the interests of states like the primacy of <italic>self-help</italic> are exogenously given, due to the anarchical structure of the international system. Wendt on the other hand argues that neither <italic>self-help</italic> nor <italic>power politics</italic> follow either logically or causally from the state of anarchy. Thus, there is no given ‘logic’ of anarchy apart from the practices that create and instantiate one type of structure of identities and interests: ‘Anarchy is what states make of it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0010836711433125">Wendt, 1992</xref>: 392–395). If the identity and central interest of a state are not given <italic>a priori</italic>, as especially realism assumes, there is a possibility that these variables can change through interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010836711433125">Wendt, 1994</xref>: 386): ‘Constructivist optimists assume that what is, need not always be’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010836711433125">Mercer, 1995</xref>: 229).</p>
<p>In the monograph with the title that refers to Waltz’s ‘Theory of International Politics’, but adds a ‘Social’ dimension, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010836711433125">Wendt (1999</xref>: 6) gives his central actors a new definition by claiming ‘states are people too’ and attesting them similar attributes – intentionality, rationality, interests, etc. The internal process of identity formation is of no interest to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010836711433125">Wendt (1999</xref>: 12) – his level of analysis is systemic or the macro-structure of international politics. This is where interaction can bring change about, resulting in several ‘logics’ of anarchy which Wendt also calls ‘cultures’.</p>
<p>In Wendt I, the author uses the concept of the multiple realizable logics of anarchy and defines three distinctive <italic>cultures of anarchy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010836711433125">Wendt, 1999</xref>: 246). This is where his social constructivism plays out his ‘almost frightening potential as meta-theory subsuming all others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010836711433125">Guzzini and Leander, 2001</xref>: 317), because realist analysis could be seen as one particular <italic>culture of anarchy</italic> which may be dominant in the world as we know it, but does not have to remain in this position for an infinite amount of time. Wendt I argues that anarchy can take at least three different structures at the macro-level – <italic>enemy, rival, friend</italic> – which he calls, in accordance with the English school, <italic>Hobbesian, Lockean</italic> and <italic>Kantian</italic> cultures. Wendt II adds two new cultures, the <italic>World Society</italic>, which is situated between the Lockean and Kantian culture and, more controversially, an end state – the <italic>World State</italic>, which is constitutive for the whole system. By drawing from <italic>self-organizing theory</italic>, Wendt implements the tendency of structured systems to develop towards a state <italic>of completed development</italic> in his theory. This claim might make a practical adaptation difficult, but since it is a goal set in a nondescript future, an empirical analysis would only clash with the concept if no change happens at all. The relative instability of early cultures of anarchy in Southeast Asia (which is discussed later), could, on the other hand, be attributed to the tendency to develop towards more stable states, whether one believes this will be a <italic>World State</italic> in the end or not.</p>
<p>How can this complex model drawing almost exclusively on Western experiences be used in a Southeast Asian context? This article argues that social constructivism is a theory well equipped to be applied in a different regional context because it can take into consideration various ideational sources: <italic>Cultures of anarchy are what regional organizations make out of them</italic>. Thus, as argued above, while Wendt has observed or predicted cultures based on Western philosophers like Locke or Kant, this still leaves room for different anarchies based on different identities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010836711433125">Katzenstein and Sil (2004</xref>: 23) pointed out that in Asia the nature of collective identity ‘may be affected substantially, in ways that contemporary theories of international relations have not yet begun to analyse, by the historical experiences and legacies of the Sinocentric world, which differ in many ways from the Greco-Roman world’.</p>
<p>One aspect in which Wendt has been persistently vague is the question whether his <italic>cultures of anarchy</italic> refer to the system of all states, or whether this concept can be applied to subsystems like regional organizations as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0010836711433125">5</xref></sup> Since he uses the European Union as an occasional example, it can be assumed that different assortments of states might yield different cultures of anarchy. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0010836711433125">Wunderlich (2007</xref>: 138) observes in a comparison between the EU and Southeast Asia, ‘the nature of regions is, therefore, determined by the ideas and beliefs extra- and intra-regional actors have about themselves and the region in question’. Plus, the often overlooked attributes of Wendt I – change is actually difficult if norms are deeply internalized; norms can be good or bad; collective identities do not necessarily lead to cooperation – seem quite adequate in light of the empirical evidence from the region of Southeast Asia. This is in accordance with the ‘realist constructivism’ proposed by J. Samuel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010836711433125">Barkin (2003)</xref>, which can be read less like a new theoretical approach than a – necessary – clarification that constructivism need not be idealist in nature, as many of its US proponents imply.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0010836711433125">6</xref></sup> Finally, the aforementioned regional security complex theory stresses the importance of the regional level where one can find a ‘set of units whose major processes of securitization, desecuritization, or both are so interlinked that their security problems cannot reasonably be analysed or resolved apart from one another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010836711433125">Buzan and Waever, 2003</xref>: 144).</p>
<p>One way to apply social constructivism to the Southeast Asian – and any other – region, would be to look at norms and collective identities that have been constructed by interaction in the region (interactive norms), brought in from the outside and have been successfully localized<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0010836711433125">7</xref></sup> (external norms) or are the result of the redefinition of identity because of internal change of an actor (internal/domestic norms). Here, area studies can contribute significantly to the research by providing the historical and cultural context which IR researchers are often lacking. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0010836711433125">Spivak (2008</xref>: 212) puts it: ‘What inclusive cultural matrix exists in the history of the present for producing a region-think here?’ Based on these assumptions, the objective of the following section is to identify specific Southeast Asian <italic>cultures of</italic> anarchy in the early stages of regional integration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0010836711433125">
<title>The ASEAN cultures of anarchy</title>
<p>One of the rather vague aspects of the concept of the <italic>cultures of anarchy</italic> is their starting point. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010836711433125">Wendt (1999</xref>: 266) argues that it might be hypothetically possible that in an early stage there was no common knowledge among the states at all, but deems this condition highly unlikely. In his Hobbesian culture there is common knowledge, or in a sense common <italic>lack of</italic> knowledge, which leads to the assumption that the other states are enemies and cannot be trusted. While this may be initially based on missing information, states might actively reproduce and enforce such a view by acting ‘as if’ the <italic>Other</italic> is an enemy, thereby making it a self-fulfilling assumption. Southeast Asia is an especially interesting case to study these initial cultures of anarchy, since in a way most of the states in the region entered the arena of international politics as new actors within a short period of time – as newly born nations or, in a form of rebirth, overcoming colonial rule.</p>
<p>In this process of identity formation characterized by high uncertainty about the role of <italic>Self</italic> and <italic>Others</italic> in the region, one might expect a high degree of mistrust and enmity among the actors. This expectation could be enforced by the fact that there was a century-old <italic>culture of conflict</italic> – or norm – prevalent in the region resulting in states’ interests that were far from cooperation and bore some resemblance to the European teachings of Machiavelli:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0010836711433125">8</xref></sup> The Kautilya’s Arthaśāstra, ‘a book of political realism, a book analyzing how the political world does work and not very often stating how it ought to work, a book that frequently discloses to a king what calculating and sometimes brutal measures he must carry out to preserve the state and the common good’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0010836711433125">Boesche, 2003</xref>: 3). The Arthaśāstra (literally meaning Science of Polity) was written approximately in the 2nd to 4th centuries CE and has served as a manual of statecraft and influenced generations of Indian and South Asian thinkers and politicians such as Jawaharlal Nehru.</p>
<p>While not widely known in the Western academic discourse, Max <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010836711433125">Weber (1978</xref>: 220) referred to the Arthaśāstra in his work ‘Politics as a vocation’: ‘Truly radical “Machiavellism,” in the popular sense of that word is classically expressed in Indian literature in the Arthaśāstra of Kautilya (written long before the birth of Christ, ostensibly in the time of Chandragupta): compared to it, Machiavelli’s The Prince is harmless.’</p>
<p>The Arthaśāstra uses the idea of the <italic>mandala. The mandala</italic> is a circle with a centre or nucleus and is often translated as the Circle of States. This concept is of great importance both in Hindu and Buddhist writings; for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0010836711433125">Modelski (1964</xref>: 554) the connection between the <italic>mandala</italic> and international politics has been best developed in the Arthaśāstra, describing it, in contemporary terms, as the model of a loose bi-centric system. The states in the <italic>mandala</italic> system are encircled by allies and enemies, middle states and neutral, indifferent powers. Thus, in the <italic>mandala</italic> system relationships are prone to be interpreted and reshuffled. This means new opportunities and dangers. To cope with these, Kautilya advises the use of diplomacy, a practical art whose aim was the attainment of practical results for the state. Modelski ascribes to the Arthaśāstra a <italic>laissez-faire</italic> conception of the international system, where order occurs as a by-product: ‘Each king is his own and his friend’s policemen’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0010836711433125">Modelski, 1964</xref>: 557).</p>
<p>Jürgen Rüland has demonstrated that the norms proposed in the <italic>Arthaśāstra</italic> have been passed on in Southeast Asia not only through intellectual discourses but also through popular art genres, such as the <italic>Ramayana</italic> and <italic>Mahabharata</italic> epics, and have been internalized by the elite political class – and thus the states – in the region until the present day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0010836711433125">Rüland, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0010836711433125">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010836711433125">2006</xref>). The figures from the epics are discussed as models of leadership in national leadership trainings, military academy, National Resilience Institute (Lemhannas) of the Republic of Indonesia, etc. Since the Suharto era, Indonesia’s foreign policy has followed the doctrine <italic>of concentric circles</italic>; as in Thailand, were the <italic>Arthaśāstra</italic> had been already reinvigorated in the 19th century, current political issues tend to be explained by referring to episodes from pre-colonial empires.</p>
<p>This can be explained in terms of ‘cultural memory’ as proposed by Jan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010836711433125">Assmann (2002</xref>: 52 ff.) or even, in using the quantum terms of Wendt III, by the surviving ‘collective consciousness’ of the super-organism formed by the states or their precursors in the region. Kuniyuki Nishimura has pointed out recently that the role of memory, an in-between, has been discussed only marginally in the agent–structure debate with IRT: ‘Agents’ intersubjective understanding of these structures necessarily entails a particular interpretation about to what extent and in what respect these conceptual entities have been continuous or discontinuous in history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010836711433125">Nishimura, 2011</xref>: 97).</p>
<p>This fits well with the observations by McCloud, who refers to the ‘neotraditionalization’ of political leadership in the region, where traditional, indigenous elements of belief and behaviour are reinvigorated within modern organizations. In their analysis of IR teaching in Southeast Asia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0010836711433125">Chong and Hamilton-Hart (2009</xref>: 2) raise the question of how particular national legitimating myths are reproduced and in what way ‘the transmission of collective historical memories’ affects the academic curriculum. Thus, ‘it is increasingly evident that the states of Southeast Asia are defining their own approaches to both domestic and international politics and that much of the substance of these definitions is drawn from the traditional cultural and political heritage of the region itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010836711433125">McCloud, 1995</xref>: 15). This could also be seen as a response to the major impact European colonization has had on the region in normative and cultural terms.</p>
<p>The prevalence of the <italic>Arthaśāstra</italic> teachings notwithstanding, war and chaos did not immediately commence after the end of the Pacific War and the beginning of decolonization in the region. This might be attributable to a competing norm which could have led to an – albeit instable – ‘Majapahit’ <italic>culture of cooperation</italic>, referring to the 1293–1500 kingdom in Eastern Java that dominated other kingdoms in the southern Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra, Bali, and the Philippines at its 14th century peak. In his pointedly titled article ‘<italic>The Roots of ASEAN: Regional Identities in the Strait of Melaka Region Circa 1500 C.E.</italic>’, the historian Kenneth R. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010836711433125">Hall (2001</xref>: 87) argues that there was ‘less dislocation and isolation in the region at that time than is supposed by many twentieth century scholars’. He claims that, notwithstanding the number of political and religious transitions underway in the Southeast Asian archipelago and mainland, there still was ‘a sense of regional self-confidence and progress among societies who had enjoyed over two hundred years of widespread socio-economic success’. Hall states that these successes were ‘the product of the functional international, regional, and local networks of communication, as well as a common heritage that had developed in the Strait of Melaka region during the pre-1500 era’.</p>
<p>While Hall acknowledges the significant influence of India’s culture in the region (including the aforementioned teachings of the <italic>Arthaśāstra</italic>), he opposes the view established by early 20th century historians that the ‘Hinduized’ states of pre-1500 Southeast Asia were merely extensions of India’s culture as a by-product of the colonial period. The indigenous sources used by Hall draw a mixed picture of the empire; in the <italic>Nagarakertagama</italic>, written by a Buddhist priest, the ruler of the <italic>Majapahit</italic> court is praised for his righteous conduct. As a consequence, his moral purity drew outlying regions to participate in his court. This high ethical standard was coherent with the Indian notion of the Cakravartin as a ‘universal monarch’ who ruled the centre of a resulting ‘circle of kings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010836711433125">Hall, 2001</xref>: 95). The <italic>Pararaton</italic>, on the other hand, a 15th century chronicle poem, links <italic>Majapahit’s</italic> aggressive initiatives as more appropriate to the <italic>Arthaśāstra</italic> tradition, resulting in the subordination of neighbouring rulers and the incorporation of their territories in the <italic>Majapahit</italic> state.</p>
<p>The conflicting readings of the essential characteristics of the <italic>Majapahit</italic> Empire are less important for a constructivist reading of the region than its attributes that have survived in the ‘collective consciousness’. Hall demonstrates how in the course of the 20th century the <italic>Majapahit</italic> was meaningfully employed in the construction of a ‘national history’ – first, to support the Dutch colonial rule, but later also by the earliest Indonesian nationalist organization Budi Utomo, which applied the legacy initially to Java and then to the region as a whole. In the 1940s, the Indonesian poet, historian, playwright and politician, Muhammad Yamin, later President Sukarno’s principal ‘myth-maker’, started to transform Majapahit from the foundational <italic>bangsa budaya</italic> (‘Folk, cultural nation’) into the <italic>bangsa negara</italic> (‘political nation’), which he conceived to include Irian Jaya, Malaysia, Thailand and Portuguese Timor. This construction was used to promote ‘a new Indonesian nation that unified a diverse, widespread region under a singular leadership’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010836711433125">Hall, 2001</xref>: 105); traces of the image can still be found in fourth-grade national (<italic>Pancasila</italic>) textbooks. Similar observations can be made with Srivijaya, a Buddhist trade empire (7th to 13th century) predating Majapahit, but almost forgotten until its rediscovery by French scholar Georges Coedès in the early 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010836711433125">Coedès, 1968</xref>). Srivijaya stretched out to the Malay peninsula; some temple ruins in Thailand and Cambodia are testimonies. After its rediscovery it was used in Indonesian nationalist rhetoric, but cultural ‘reinvention’ also took place in Southern Thailand.</p>
<p>Thus, if the anarchical logic in the constitutional stage of the Southeast Asian region after the Pacific War is seen as a <italic>Majapahit culture</italic>, it is characterized by highly contesting norms and identities. <italic>Majapahit</italic>, especially as reconstructed in the 20th century narrative, carries with it a strong <italic>Arthaśāstra</italic> set of norms that includes a hostile attitude towards direct neighbours and in a way foreshadows the <italic>konfrontasi</italic> policy used by Sukarno in the 1960s. From this perspective, it could be seen as the notion of a centralized empire on which Indonesia based its claim to dominance in the region and later on in ASEAN. However, it could also have laid the foundations for a concept or at least sense of ‘regionness’ in Southeast Asia. Anthony Reid does not explicitly trace the view of the ten states that make up ASEAN today as some kind of ‘natural’ unit to <italic>Majapahit</italic>, but to the Malacca Straits area as a traditional place of ports and portages, and therefore communication, which has contributed to the indigenous origin of the Southeast Asian idea. He argues that there are ‘profound commonalities in Southeast Asia, essentially arising from a similar environment, a long history of maritime interaction among themselves, and a somewhat similar pattern of influences from their neighboring civilizations – China, India and Japan’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0010836711433125">Reid, 1999</xref>: 8).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0010836711433125">Reid (1999</xref>: 13) adds that the Malaka sultanate ‘was intensely aware that it was part of a Southeast Asian world – between Siam, Pegu, Sumatra, Java, Manila and Maluku’. And for Hall and Read, the rulers of the Ayudhya Thai kingdom in the 15th century cultivated a cosmopolitan outlook as well; not only as self-perceived heirs to the mainland administrative and cultural legacy of the Angkor realm, but also by a ‘new collective sense of community among those realms that shared the Bay of Bengal and Theravada Buddhism on the one hand, and the Malay Peninsula trading realm on the other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010836711433125">Hall, 2001</xref>: 108).</p>
<p>While a lot more research has to go into these historical and cultural contexts, the aim was to demonstrate that there are several indigenous sources that could have contributed to the formation of the first ‘collective identity’ among the states in Southeast Asia. They may also have contributed to the decision not to accept interested countries like Sri Lanka or Papua New Guinea into ASEAN. Obviously, the newly independent nations did not enter a vacuum but rather a full-fledged international system of states with dominant norms like sovereignty. These identities were perceived as internalized to such a high degree that they were seen largely as given. However, to assume that Southeast Asian states simply adapted the given norms of the international system, as is still argued among realist interpretations of ASEAN, does not do justice to the complexity of their specific regionalism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010836711433125">Acharya (2005)</xref> has observed that IR scholars still generally assume that ‘the history of sovereignty is largely the history of Westphalia’s geographic extension’, but argues that these scholars thereby ‘ignore the crucial agency of local actors in the developing world in translating the idea of sovereignty into norms of conduct in a regional setting’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0010836711433125">Reid (1999</xref>: 17) sees the struggle against returning colonialism as a common theme for the countries of Southeast Asia and a first step to a ‘Southeast Asian’ identity. This identity was also influenced by the development in the state system and the role of major powers in the wider Asian region. While early calls for anti-imperial unity were of the pan-Asian type, Reid observes, looking at the examples of India and China, that by 1947 there was ‘a widespread view that Southeast Asia’s interests could best be served by keeping the big players out’.</p>
<p>This does not mean that these states were not influential in establishing distinctive and highly influential norms for the region. By studying the widely under-researched 1955 Asian–African Conference in Bandung and the dominant role of the Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010836711433125">Acharya (2005</xref>: 46) identifies normative resistance from within Asia to the idea of regional collective defence: ‘These interactions, while not creating a regional organization, created a durable normative framework which undermined the prospects for regional collective defence through subsequent decades.’ This ‘Nehru norm’ can be seen as a case of norm localization on two levels – first into the wider South and Southeast Asian context, where it was prevalent from the 1950s on, and then into the specific ASEAN <italic>culture of anarchy</italic>, where the refusal of a regional collective defence became one of the dominant norms and the basis for declarations like the 1971 ‘Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality’ (ZOPFAN).</p>
<p>Still, while the <italic>Nehru norm</italic>, as Acharya argues, has contributed to the decline of the Southeast Asian Treaty Organization (SEATO), an inclusive and indigenous regional organization manifesting a collective identity did not immediately emerge. Instead, the 1960s saw the <italic>konfrontasi</italic> policy of Indonesian president Sukarno, where Indonesia and to a lesser extent the Philippines challenged the legitimacy of Malaysia and Singapore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010836711433125">Narine, 2006</xref>: 201). From a constructivist point of view, this could be traced to the low level of internalization of the community norms of the <italic>Majapahit logic of anarchy</italic>, while the already internalized <italic>Arthaśāstra</italic> norms with their aggressive stance towards direct neighbours and the specific national interpretation of Indonesian supremacy became dominant.</p>
<p>The end of the <italic>konfrontasi</italic> policy and the following foundation of ASEAN is a hard case for a strict reading of state identities according to Wendt I, because the rather radical change in Indonesia’s state identity came about not through interaction or the systemic level, but through a coup d’état (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010836711433125">Rother, 2004</xref>: 56). In a way, this fact could be used to extend the Wendt I model by including a level of identity formation within a state, thus acknowledging the important role of domestic politics in identity formation and allow more of the reflexivity, which Drulák sees as lacking in Wendt I and II. Discussing the new stance Indonesia took towards human rights after the political change in the late 1990s, Manea speaks of the ‘domestic re-negotiation of its political identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010836711433125">Manea, 2009</xref>: 38); this term is also suitable for the change in state identity some 30 years earlier.</p>
<p>When the <italic>konfrontasi</italic> period is seen as a collapse of the regional <italic>logic of anarchy</italic> into an <italic>Arthaśāstra culture</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0010836711433125">9</xref></sup> the founding of ASEAN could be seen as a return to the <italic>Majapahit culture</italic>. This transition was due to an independent and internal change of identity and interest of one of the states in the region: Indonesia projected a different picture of <italic>Other</italic> to the states with which it would associate in ASEAN soon after. As already acknowledged, the <italic>Majapahit culture</italic> continues to include the <italic>Arthaśāstra cultural norm</italic> which is still valid until the present day, but to a lesser degree of internalization. In addition, the community elements of this culture and localized norms like the rejection of a regional collective defence provided the basis for the institutionalization of ASEAN. It became evident that a norm change had occurred a mere six months after the birth of ASEAN, when the conflict over Sabah re-emerged and escalated between Malaysia and the Philippines. While in no way solving the crisis and restraining from taking the role as negotiator, ASEAN members nevertheless ‘through direct and indirect measures of restraint, pressure, diplomacy, communications and trade-offs, did succeed in <italic>preventing</italic> any further escalation of the crisis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010836711433125">Acharya, 2001</xref>: 50).</p>
<p>This can be seen as the birth of the <italic>ASEAN Way</italic>, which played a decisive factor in the further evolution of the association and might be a good term to describe the <italic>logic of anarchy</italic> prevalent in Southeast Asia until today. In an earlier analysis, the author (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010836711433125">Rother, 2004</xref>: 95) has positioned ASEAN in a highly internalized <italic>Lockean culture</italic> (Wendt I), respectively moving towards <italic>World Society</italic>, the new culture of anarchy introduced in Wendt II. Moving away from these Western ideational sources, an <italic>ASEAN Way logic of anarchy</italic> seems to have guided the evolution of the regional organization, the vagueness of the concept notwithstanding. This logic is characterized by several norms. The <italic>Majapahit</italic> norm provided the sense of <italic>regionness</italic> that made development and expansion of a regional security complex possible, but – in its reconstructed form – can also be seen as a source of Indonesian aspirations for hegemony. The <italic>Arthaśāstra</italic> norm might help us to explain the more or less open hostilities that have erupted within the region. But both these conflicting norms have been held in check by the dominant norm of an ASEAN Way which localizes ‘outside’ norms like the Westphalian norm in the light of the colonial experiences.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>International Relations approaches to Area Studies are diverse, but often neglect the historical and cultural context. Area Studies on the other hand can provide that context and be the right location for sub-systemic and exceptionalist theorizing, but are ‘generally dominated by disciplines that have a low interest in theorizing, effectively taking exceptionalism to be a reason <italic>not</italic> to theorize’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010836711433125">Acharya and Buzan, 2007b</xref>: 291, 292). In order to bridge the gap between these two research fields, this author proposed a model based on the social constructivism as developed by Alexander Wendt that can be adapted to the analysis of regions with a cultural and ideational background different from the European or North-American experience: A collective identity among states in a region can manifest itself in distinctive <italic>logics</italic> or <italic>cultures of anarchy.</italic> These are based on norms that can be established through interaction, can be proposed by outside agents and localized or can be affected by an identity change of a state caused by domestic events. In addition, there are cultural norms rooted in the cultural memory or <italic>consciousness</italic> of a region, which are often ignored by interpretations that merely focus on current events or established Western models of cooperation.</p>
<p>This article has sought to identify <italic>cultures of anarchy</italic> in the early stages of Southeast Asian regionalism and described them with the ‘working terms’ of <italic>Arthaśāstra, Majapahit and ASEAN Way</italic>. Obviously, there is no straight line leading from the times of the <italic>Arthaśāstra</italic> or the <italic>Majapahit</italic> Empire to modern day ASEAN, but there certainly are cultural path dependencies that have a significant effect even on today’s politics in the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0010836711433125">Jetschke and Rüland, 2009</xref>). The preceding analysis has shown that cultures of anarchy can collapse if there is a change in the prevalent norms or if these are only internalized weakly. This can lead to an interpretation very different from the existing constructivist readings of the region, which are often characterized by a deterministic bias that equals <italic>collective identity</italic> with <italic>cooperation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010836711433125">Busse, 1999</xref>; still prevalent in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0010836711433125">Simon, 2008</xref>). The approach also challenges the notion that the states of Southeast Asia are merely doing world politics in a form of ‘mimicry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010836711433125">Bilgin, 2008</xref>: 5) or have founded ASEAN as an ‘Imitation Community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010836711433125">Jones and Smith, 2002</xref>) but ascribes them with a full sense of agency, based on the region’s own history, ideas and cultures.</p>
<p>For an empirical application of this model, all the relevant norms and their level of internalization within a <italic>culture of anarchy</italic> would have to be identified and used for the explanation of change between two cultures. If this concept is to be applied to regions with varying cultural memories, a comparative approach can provide much deeper insights, as opposed to one that only compares, say, guns or the levels of institutionalization. The potential of this approach can be seen in Acharya’s work on the Bandung conference, where he elaborates that the norm of non-intervention had very different consequences in the Latin-American region with the cultural background of settler societies – and thus in a different <italic>culture of anarchy</italic>.</p>

<p>The author is indebted to several European and Asian colleagues who provided valuable input for this article. The manuscript also benefited from discussions with colleagues of the Freiburg Southeast Asia Area Studies Program supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). Additional material was gathered during research stays in Manila and Hong Kong. Thanks are also extended to the anonymous referees who provided numerous important suggestions.</p></fn>

<p>These claims can also be seen as a defensive reaction to the challenges imposed by the end of the Cold War: The ‘victorious’ West was seen to more openly promote its liberal values, exemplified in the ‘New World Order’, proposed by then-US-president Georg Bush Sr.</p></fn>

<p>There has also been considerable debate about Wendt’s latest offering ‘Sovereignty and the UFO’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0010836711433125">Wendt and Duvall, 2008</xref>), which might be classified as ‘Wendt X’.

<p>There seems to be some general uncertainty or vagueness about whether IR theory needs to be universal in scope or can also be exceptionalist, cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010836711433125">Acharya and Buzan, 2007a</xref>: 291.</p></fn>

<p>Being less Eurocentric, one should rather proclaim Machiavelli ‘the European Kautilya’.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn9-0010836711433125">
<label>9.</label>
<p>While Wendt names his cultures of anarchy according to the relevant philosophers, in this case this article chooses the opus as eponym, since (a) it is the only writing attributed to Kautilya and (b) authorship has not been established indisputably.</p></fn>
