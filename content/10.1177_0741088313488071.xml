<abstract>
<p>As the scope of rhetorical inquiry broadens to cover intersemiotic and intertextual phenomena, scholars are increasingly in need of new, defensible analytic procedures. Several scholars have suggested that methods of discourse analysis could enhance rhetorical criticism. Here, I introduce a discourse-based method that is empirical, delicate, and adaptive to the complexities of intertextual and multimodal rhetoric. Specifically, I argue that rhetorical scholars can productively integrate systemic-functional linguistics, multimodal text analysis, and micro-intertextual comparison. I illustrate how this micro-rhetorical toolkit can be employed to investigate the recontextualization of written political discourse in video journalism.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741088313488071">Eisenhart and Johnstone (2008)</xref> argue that the “close, rigorous attention to language” called for in discourse analysis (DA) can “pay off” for rhetoricians (p. 14) as they grapple with issues of “context, agency, and the relationship between style and argument” (p. 5). In this article, I confirm this “payoff” as I show how a mix of DA procedures can expand the critical apparatus of rhetoric and writing. I argue that analysts can benefit from employing a “micro-rhetorical toolkit,” a three-pronged analytic framework combining techniques of systemic-functional linguistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741088313488071">Halliday &amp; Matthiessen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0741088313488071">Martin &amp; White, 2005</xref>), multimodal text analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741088313488071">Baldry &amp; Thibault, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741088313488071">Kress &amp; Van Leeuwen, 2006</xref>), and micro-intertextual comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741088313488071">Fahnestock, 1986</xref>). These techniques enrich rhetorical analysis, illuminating how rhetors choose to construe reality and constitute putative audiences. Moreover, they provide scholars with systematic methods for discerning how rhetors combine verbal-visual resources in dynamic video texts and how they recontextualize prior written discourse in new multimodal environments.</p>
<p>I begin by explaining the general value of discourse-based methodologies. I examine possible reasons why rhetoricians have been reluctant to adopt these methods, and suggest that there are few grounds for dismissing them. Next, I contextualize the rhetorical event I use to illustrate the value of DA methods: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0741088313488071">George Tenet’s 2002</xref> letter and its subsequent recontextualization in a CBS News broadcast. After articulating research questions, I explain my own repertoire of procedures, examining Tenet’s letter to show how aspects of the micro-rhetorical toolkit work. These procedures can help sharpen rhetorical analyses and deepen our understanding of rhetorical discourse.</p>
<sec id="section1-0741088313488071" sec-type="methods">
<title>The Value of Discourse-Based Methods for Rhetorical Analysts</title>
<p>It is an open question as to why scholars of rhetoric and writing have not fully embraced DA approaches. Perhaps some believe that DA—with all its talk of “data” and “empirical evidence”—is overly scientific, even antihumanistic. Historically, rhetorical analysts have worried that systematic methods might lead rhetoric to become the “handmaiden of quasi-scientific theory” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741088313488071">Black, 1978</xref>, p. xi). Some have even argued that rhetorical scholars should not pay “too much attention to methodological concerns,” since “creative insights are constrained by the systematicity of method” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0741088313488071">McKerrow, 1989</xref>, p. 102).</p>
<p>When it comes to DA, such worries are unfounded. DA approaches do not constrain creativity. They simply ensure that findings are based on empirical observation and that scholars generate claims inductively by returning again and again to the texts they wish to understand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741088313488071">Eisenhart &amp; Johnstone, 2008</xref>, p. 3). DA techniques are not formulae that analysts blindly apply, but heuristics that they adopt based on features of the data. The goal of DA, then, is not scientific replicability, but detailed, warranted accounts of how discourse functions.</p>
<p>Rhetoricians may also worry that DA is incommensurable with rhetorical study because DA is seemingly fixated on the formal features of texts—apparently ignoring context, audience, culture, and history. While it’s true that DA tends to focus on the micro-linguistic aspects of texts, this doesn’t mean that DA approaches are purely “formal.” DA practitioners are less interested in linguistic forms and more interested in the “micro-rhetorical” <italic>functions</italic> of language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741088313488071">Hopper, 2007</xref>) since even small (and sometimes subconscious) language choices have an enormous rhetorical impact. DA practitioners believe that analysts <italic>must</italic> account for social context and history—that communication cannot happen without context and history. Granted, some DA methods are more “text heavy,” including the DA methods that I endorse. But many DA methods are specifically designed to account for historical development and macro-sociological forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0741088313488071">Reisigl &amp; Wodak, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0741088313488071">Wodak, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0741088313488071">Wodak &amp; Weiss, 2004</xref>). And even the approaches that focus on textual analysis are deeply concerned with context. In fact, these approaches are especially equipped to reveal how discourse <italic>constitutes and enacts</italic> context (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741088313488071">Andrus, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, rhetoricians may simply believe that DA methods are unneeded in rhetoric and writing because existing methods already accomplish what DA offers to achieve. These rhetoricians may reasonably wonder: “Why should we bother learning new technical jargon from DA when we already have methods that are sufficient?” Learning DA approaches—particularly systemic-functional approaches—can entail learning an extensive technical vocabulary. But learning ancient rhetorical figures requires a similarly extensive technical vocabulary (and some knowledge of Greek). The real question is whether DA methods add anything valuable. The answer is, unmistakably, yes.</p>
<p>This article showcases some of the benefits of DA, but I also encourage scholars of rhetoric and writing to try DA for themselves and see how it can be productively employed in their studies. My aim is not to suggest that rhetoricians <italic>replace</italic> existing research paradigms with DA approaches. My aim is to persuade rhetoric and writing scholars to more fully include DA in their analytic apparatus. Indeed, I look forward to the day when DA is recognized as a legitimate part of the “rhetorical tradition”—a methodological option that has its place alongside other approaches. I am confident this day is coming, especially since so many rhetoricians already embrace DA techniques—whether they are interested in style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741088313488071">Fahnestock, 2011</xref>), ethos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741088313488071">Cheng, 2012</xref>), controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741088313488071">Cramer, 2011</xref>), “textual silences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0741088313488071">Huckin, 2002</xref>), the rhetoric of futurity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741088313488071">Dunmire, 2011</xref>), or a host of other topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741088313488071">Barton &amp; Stygall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741088313488071">Huckin, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0741088313488071">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741088313488071">Huckin, Andrus, &amp; Clary-Lemon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0741088313488071">Johnstone &amp; Eisenhart, 2008</xref>). For those already familiar with DA, some of what I address here will be familiar—though the combination of procedures is original. For everyone else, I hope this article serves to underscore the value of DA. As I argue below, rhetorical scholars can benefit from integrating three DA methods—linguistic discourse analysis, multimodal text analysis, and micro-intertextual analysis. Embracing this three-part micro-rhetorical toolkit can help analysts produce research that is creative, rigorous, and sensitive to the complexities of rhetorical phenomena. Before I develop this argument further, however, let me introduce the rhetorical event I study to showcase these DA techniques.</p>

<sec id="section2-0741088313488071">
<title>Case Study: George Tenet’s Letter on CBS News</title>
<p>I focus on a letter written by former CIA director George Tenet on October 7, 2002 (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0741088313488071">Appendix A</xref>). Specifically, I examine how a portion of this letter was recontextualized in a CBS Evening News broadcast. Tenet wrote the letter the same day President Bush addressed the public in Cincinnati, Ohio, arguing that the United States would probably need to undertake a “preemptive” war in Iraq. By this time, members of the Bush administration had been promoting war for many months—and relevant debates were raging in the United Nations and the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>During the war campaign, U.S. journalists tended to include in their stories only the viewpoints expressed in mainstream government debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741088313488071">Bennett, Lawrence, &amp; Livingston, 2007</xref>, p. 49). Since there was so much bipartisan agreement about the need for war, the majority of sources that appeared on television news supported an invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741088313488071">Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, 2003</xref>). Occasionally, however, apparent inconsistencies emerged among “authoritative sources,” inconsistencies that might have been fodder for more critical news coverage. Arguably, Tenet’s letter indexed a major discrepancy between the CIA and President Bush on the crucial question of whether Saddam Hussein presented an immediate danger to the United States.</p>
<p>Tenet addressed his letter to Senator Bob Graham, a Florida Democrat who chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee. In September 2002, Graham asked Tenet to provide more information about Iraq and the possible impact of a U.S. invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0741088313488071">Woodward, 2004</xref>, p. 195). Tenet supplied an intelligence report, but refused to answer key questions: Would Saddam use WMD? And how would Iraq respond to a U.S. attack? On October 3, 2002, with a congressional vote looming, an impatient Graham publicly criticized Tenet, suggesting that the CIA was preventing Congress from making an informed decision about the need for war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741088313488071">MacKay, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Tenet finally capitulated, sending Graham a letter on October 7. He wrote that Baghdad for now appeared to be “drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks,” adding that if Saddam concluded “a US-led attack could no longer be deterred, he probably would become much less constrained in adopting terrorist actions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0741088313488071">Tenet, 2002</xref>). The letter went on to quote a “Senior Intelligence Witness,” who similarly asserted that Saddam Hussein would be unlikely to initiate an attack “in the foreseeable future,” unless the United States attacked him first.</p>
<p>The letter was potentially groundbreaking, since it seemed to contradict the position taken by the White House. Bush had been arguing that Iraq presented an immediate threat to the United States, insisting that war was necessary to <italic>prevent</italic> a WMD attack. But Tenet’s letter suggested the opposite: Iraq presented no immediate threat, and would apparently consider attacking the United States only as a last resort in the face of a U.S. invasion.</p>
<p>Tenet’s letter was added to the <italic>Congressional Record</italic> on the evening of October 8, but Americans who learned about it probably did so from journalists. Thus, it is important to examine how news reports recontextualized Tenet’s letter. CBS was the first and, on October 8, the only television network to air a story about the letter (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0741088313488071">Appendix B</xref>; Video is present as Data Supplement at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wcx.sagepub.com/">http://wcx.sagepub.com/</ext-link>). It broke the story a full day before all other news outlets. At least temporarily, then, CBS had an exclusive “scoop,” and unparalleled ability to define Tenet’s discourse for the public.</p>
<p>For our purposes, I am posing two research questions.</p>
<list id="list1-0741088313488071" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>First, how is Tenet’s written political discourse transformed as it is recontextualized in the multimodal news narrative?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Second, how does the report about Tenet’s letter reposition audiences, implying new responses and actions?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Below, I address the mix of analytic techniques I employed to answer these questions, explaining why these techniques are warranted, how they are performed, and how they help rhetoricians answer questions important to the field.</p>
<p>The micro-rhetorical toolkit I advocate consists of three interrelated methods: linguistic discourse analysis, multimodal text analysis, and micro-intertextual analysis. The first component of the toolkit is <bold>linguistic discourse analysis</bold> since rhetorical meanings are ultimately realized in and through microscopic features of language. An intense study of grammar and lexis enables analysts to better understand how rhetors construe the world and design their audiences. Since rhetorical discourse is inherently multimodal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741088313488071">Kress, 2010</xref>), I complement this intense linguistic analysis with a similarly rigorous analysis of other semiotic modes. Thus, the second component of the toolkit, <bold>multimodal text analysis</bold>, aims to systematically describe nonlinguistic resources as well as the meaningful interaction of verbal, visual, and sound data. Collectively, these first two components of the toolkit clarify how different elements of a given text combine to represent reality, align putative audiences, and achieve internal coherence. The final component of the toolkit draws together the other two, but extends the analysis <italic>across texts</italic> in order to investigate how language and other semiotic resources are implicated in processes of recontextualization. More specifically, <bold>micro-intertextual analysis</bold> examines how the meaning of one text is transformed when it is recontextualized in a new discursive environment. As I describe below, this analysis is well equipped to illuminate the small, but meaningful, changes that occur as written political discourse is recontextualized in broadcast news.</p>
<sec id="section3-0741088313488071">
<title>Component 1: Linguistic Discourse Analysis</title>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741088313488071">Halliday and Matthiessen (2004)</xref>, I adopt a <bold>systemic-functional</bold> (SF) view of discourse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0741088313488071">1</xref></sup> SF scholars view language (and other symbols) as <italic>social semiotic resources</italic> that can be drawn upon to make meaning in specific situations and for specific rhetorical purposes. They posit that all semiotic resources realize context by performing three <italic>metafunctions</italic>: ideational, interpersonal, and textual. The ideational metafunction construes physical reality, including processes and the participants who execute them. The interpersonal metafunction enacts social relationships, including relationships between rhetors and audiences. Finally, the textual metafunction joins together elements of discourse, weaving separate parts into a coherent whole.</p>
<p>SF approaches provide a sophisticated critical apparatus, one capable of revealing how lexicogrammatical choices inform a text’s style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741088313488071">Halliday &amp; Matthiessen, 2004</xref>). In other words, analysts can examine word and grammar choices in each clause and determine how these choices function rhetorically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0741088313488071">Zdenek &amp; Johnstone, 2008</xref>). The advantage of such clausal analysis is that it offers “well-defined heuristic categories” that can account for those “mechanisms of persuasion [that] are not reducible to figuration” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0741088313488071">Ritivoi, 2008</xref>, p. 40). Not every text has figures or explicit arguments, but <italic>every</italic> linguistic text has grammar and lexis. So, it makes sense for rhetoricians to begin by analyzing these. SF-based linguistic analysis constitutes the first component of the micro-rhetorical toolkit, helping me see how rhetors use language to define reality, signal value commitments, and position putative audiences.</p>
<sec id="section4-0741088313488071">
<title>How Rhetors Define Reality: Transitivity Analysis</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741088313488071">Burke (1966)</xref> explains, language is never neutral: it is not a “reflection of reality” but a “selection of reality” and “a deflection of reality” (p. 45). Language defines and filters experience—directing audiences “to <italic>look at</italic> some things and <italic>overlook</italic> others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741088313488071">Herrick, 2005</xref>, p. 226). Systemic-functional linguistics (SFL) provides us with excellent tools for investigating how rhetors use language to construe and conceal human experience. Particularly useful are transitivity analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741088313488071">Halliday &amp; Matthiessen, 2004</xref>) and sociosemantic methods of DA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0741088313488071">Van Leeuwen, 2008</xref>). Using these tools, analysts see how rhetors choose to define events, participants, and circumstances—how they highlight and hide human agency. Let’s inspect an example from Tenet’s letter. The clause in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0741088313488071">Table 1</xref> appears in a bulleted list of talking points that Tenet supplies to Graham for public comments about “Iraq’s links to al-Qaeda.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0741088313488071">2</xref></sup> Boldfaced codes represent the functional components of Tenet’s expression.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>I begin by focusing on the verb process, the nucleus of the clause. Here, Tenet chooses a relational verb (<italic>have</italic>) that links together a possessor (<italic>we</italic>) and a possession (<italic>solid reporting</italic> . . .). Importantly, Tenet might have chosen a different kind of verb here. For example, Tenet could have easily construed this sentiment with an <italic>existential</italic> process, portraying the intelligence information as an existing reality: “<italic>There is solid reporting of senior level contacts.</italic> . . .” Such a construction would certainly deliver the message about Iraq’s purported contacts with al-Qaeda, but it would also erase the CIA’s role as possessor of this information.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0741088313488071">3</xref></sup> Indeed, by choosing a possessive process (<italic>have</italic>), Tenet focuses attention on the CIA’s privileged status as owner of a valued commodity. He establishes his organization with symbolic and material authority, that is, as an organization that possesses intelligence and, thus, the power to supply Congress with useful information. In fact, this construction is indicative of a larger pattern: whenever the CIA (“we”) is the grammatical subject in these talking points, the process is possessive-relational (e.g., “we <italic>have</italic> solid evidence”; “we <italic>have</italic> credible reporting”). The CIA is consistently portrayed as an organization that has “the goods.”</p>
<p>Using the technical apparatus of SFL, we can discern other important stylistic choices as well. Note, for example, that the <italic>possessor</italic> is represented by the first-person plural pronoun “we.” Here Tenet positions the audience to understand that he is speaking not as an individual (<italic>I</italic>), but as a representative of the CIA. Thus, accountability for the intelligence information rests not just with him but with his entire organization. Meanwhile, in the circumstantial portion of the clause, we find other noteworthy characters—“Iraq and al-Qaeda.” Of course, the words “Iraq and al-Qaeda” represent important stylistic choices. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0741088313488071">Van Leeuwen’s (2008)</xref> sociosemantic inventory, al-Qaeda represents a <italic>collectivized</italic> social actor, a homogenous and undifferentiated group. Meanwhile, Iraq represents an <italic>impersonalized</italic> social actor, an abstraction devoid of human qualities. Tenet might have <italic>named</italic> the individuals from Iraq and al-Qaeda who allegedly communicated, but this would have meant restricting the enemy to a few people with unique identities and social histories. By abstracting away from the details, Tenet keeps the audience focused on a “faceless enemy,” an enemy that is anonymous and monolithic.</p>
<p>Tenet also abstracts away from concrete details in the <italic>possession</italic> segment of his clause. Here, a noun phrase apparently refers to human actions in the world, yet includes no human agents and no verbs: “solid reporting of senior level contacts.” In fact, processes which might have been encoded as verbs have instead been <bold>nominalized</bold>, that is, converted into nouns (<italic>reporting, contacts</italic>). By performing a parallel analysis, one can unpack these nominalizations in full clauses (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0741088313488071">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>This “congruent” reading approximates the mental work required to fully understand Tenet’s discourse. But even this rewording is unsatisfactory. It includes a clumsy verb phrase (<italic>solidly reported</italic>) and leaves several questions unanswered: Who exactly reported this information? Was it one person or many people? Who contacted whom? Was it al-Qaeda who contacted Iraq, or was it the other way around? And was everyone “senior level” or only some people? It is impossible to answer these questions—and this has to do with Tenet’s stylistic choices. He conceals the source that divulged this intelligence and suppresses the details of this allegedly troubling event. In fact, by nominalizing his processes, Tenet transforms claims (Z <italic>reports</italic> that X <italic>contacted</italic> Y) into nonnegotiable things (<italic>reporting, contacts</italic>), “solid” things that seem to have their own autonomous existence. SFL helps analysts think about such mechanisms of style—the micro-linguistic choices that shape our understanding of the world.</p>

<title>How Rhetors Signal Value Commitments: Attitude Analysis</title>
<p>Rhetoricians recognize the importance of values in establishing bonds between speakers and audiences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0741088313488071">Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca (1969</xref>; hereafter P &amp; OT) argue that <italic>values</italic> are important objects of agreement capable of influencing an audience’s “disposition toward action” (p. 74). P &amp; OT’s theory of values is compelling, but it can be enriched with a more systematic analytic vocabulary. As it stands, rhetoricians may run into problems if they try employing P &amp; OT’s terms in their analyses. P &amp; OT do not provide any clear strategy for discerning values in texts, and, in some cases, their distinctions are downright confusing. For instance, it is difficult to understand why “justice” is an abstract value while “loyalty” is a concrete one (p. 77). Equally baffling is P &amp; OT’s insistence that concrete values, like solidarity, are characteristic of conservative discourse (p. 79). (Isn’t solidarity the cry of the “liberal” unions?) Similarly, while P &amp; OT’s notion of value hierarchies is intriguing, it is difficult to determine how a rhetor “ranks” values in a given text (pp. 80-83).</p>
<p>SF analysts have developed robust frameworks for identifying and differentiating types of value-based discourse. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0741088313488071">Martin and White (2005)</xref> taxonomize evaluative language distinguishing between three main regions of values. Their framework for <bold>attitude analysis</bold> allows analysts to investigate how rhetors display emotion (<italic>affect</italic>), assess human behavior (<italic>judgment</italic>), and appraise objects (<italic>appreciation</italic>) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0741088313488071">Table 3</xref>). This coding scheme clarifies when and how values are indicated as “objects of agreement” in a text. For instance, if I say, “Sadly, the clumsy boy broke my precious glass,” I convey attitudes that I expect my audience will share: negative affect (<italic>sadly</italic>, unhappiness), negative judgment (<italic>clumsy</italic>, capacity), and a positive appreciation (<italic>precious</italic>, valuation). By noting the frequency with which such attitudes are referenced, the analyst also better understands how rhetors “rank” values in an imagined hierarchy. This is consistent with P &amp; OT (1969), who note that “higher rank [in a hierarchy] corresponds to a larger quantity of the chosen [value] characteristic” (p. 81).</p>

<p>Below is the portion of Tenet’s letter that CBS ultimately recontextualized. I have underlined attitudinal discourse and supplied the appropriate codes in brackets:<disp-quote>
<p>Baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of <underline>conducting terrorist attacks</underline> [- judgment, propriety] with conventional or CBW against the United States. Should Saddam conclude that a US-led attack could no longer be deterred, he probably would become much less constrained in <underline>adopting terrorist actions</underline> [- judgment, propriety]. Such <underline>terrorism</underline> [- judgment, propriety] might involve conventional means, as with Iraq’s <underline>unsuccessful</underline> [- judgment, capacity] <underline>attempt at a terrorist offensive</underline> [- judgment, propriety] in 1991, or CBW. Saddam might decide that the <underline>extreme</underline> [- judgment, normality] step of <underline>assisting Islamist terrorists in conducting a WMD attack</underline> [- judgment, propriety] against the United States would be his last chance to <underline>exact vengeance by taking a large number of victims</underline> [- judgment, propriety] with him.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Obviously, this passage is teeming with negative judgments. Specifically, Tenet represents Saddam Hussein as an unethical social actor who is already capable of “conducting terrorist attacks,” and who may assist “Islamist terrorists” under the right circumstances. The value atop Tenet’s hierarchy is social (im)propriety, specifically the (un)lawful use of violence. He is interested in defining Iraq as an enemy and can do so only if his audience shares the normative belief that certain actions are inexcusably wrong: terrorism, assisting terrorists, exacting vengeance, and so on. And, of course, Tenet’s attitudinal discourse implies certain responses (e.g., antipathy) and predisposes audiences to accept certain actions (e.g., deterrence).</p>
<p>It is interesting to compare Tenet’s attitudes to the attitudes explicitly formulated by the CBS journalists. As you can see in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0741088313488071">Appendix B</xref> (underlined text), CBS also offers a negative judgment of Saddam Hussein’s propriety, when Dan Rather employs a comparative modifier (<italic>more dangerous</italic>) that presupposes Saddam’s “dangerousness.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0741088313488071">4</xref></sup> CBS also offers attitudinal comments about Tenet’s letter itself. For instance, CBS offers positive appreciations commenting on the impact and importance of Tenet’s discourse (<italic>new, newly</italic>). More significantly, CBS includes six inscriptions of negative affect indicating insecurity and disquiet about the content of Tenet’s letter and the potential actions of Saddam Hussein: “concern,” “chilling,” “frightening,” “warning” (2), “alarm.” Keep in mind that Tenet himself never said that he was “concerned,” “alarmed,” or “frightened.” Indeed, his letter is notable for its absence of explicitly emotional language. Thus, CBS ratchets up the “anxiety” in its report. Indeed, <italic>insecurity</italic> seems to be the supreme value for the CBS reporters. They imply that audiences should not only condemn Saddam, but fear him—now and in the future. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0741088313488071">Martin and White (2005)</xref> provide analysts with a grounded way of discerning how such values are encoded in discourse—and how attitudes about the world may shift from genre to genre (e.g., intelligence report vs. news report).</p>

<title>How Rhetors Position Putative Audiences</title>
<p>Scholars of rhetoric and writing have long been concerned with what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741088313488071">Black (1970)</xref> terms the “second persona,” that auditor who is “implied by a discourse” and who stands as “a model of what the rhetor would have his [<italic>sic</italic>] real audience become” (p. 113). Rhetoricians recognize the <italic>constitutive</italic> mechanisms of rhetoric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741088313488071">Charland, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0741088313488071">Thieme, 2010</xref>)—how rhetors design audiences and position them to respond to their utterances. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741088313488071">Cheng (2012)</xref> observes, DA is “especially suited for studying the constitutive functions of rhetoric,” especially given its focus on the social and interactive aspects of language use (p. 425). I have already discussed some of the ways that SF approaches can help analysts understand constitutive discourse. Analysts can investigate transitivity, observing how rhetors position audiences to see dynamic actions as obtainable commodities (e.g., <italic>we have solid reporting</italic>). Meanwhile, analysts can study attitudinal discourse to see how rhetors align audiences into communities of value, and predispose them to accept certain actions. But there are other forms of constitutive rhetoric that SF techniques can help analysts discern. Here, I focus on how rhetors position audiences through their choice of engagement resources.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0741088313488071">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>I start from the premise that every speech act “positions” some putative addressee, implying a “desired response” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741088313488071">Halliday &amp; Matthiessen, 2004</xref>, p. 108). For example, when you offer information, you prefer that your addressee will acknowledge (not contradict) that information (p. 108). Of course, audiences can defy our expectations—they may, for instance, disagree with information we offer. But if they diverge from “desired responses,” there is a social cost. After all, expressing disagreement can cause embarrassment, and interlocutors seek to avoid, or at least mitigate, such “face-threatening acts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741088313488071">Brown &amp; Levinson, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>With <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0741088313488071">Martin and White’s (2005)</xref> engagement analysis, a scholar can uncover the signals rhetors use to convey how they expect audiences to respond to their discourse. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0741088313488071">Martin and White (2005)</xref> explain, engagement resources may indicate that a rhetor presumes audience agreement, or suggest that a rhetor anticipates a proposition will be problematic, or imply that the audience still needs to be won over, and so on (p. 95). Ultimately, rhetors manage their relationship with putative audiences by signaling their “tolerance for alternative viewpoints” (p. 96). While monoglossic utterances signal “zero tolerance” for alternative perspectives, heteroglossic utterances acknowledge alternative points of view. These heteroglossic utterances may be <italic>dialogically contractive</italic>, as speakers seek to suppress, fend off, or challenge the expression of divergent viewpoints. Or they may be <italic>dialogically expansive</italic>, allowing for and even inviting different points of view (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0741088313488071">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<p>To get a sense of engagement analysis, let’s return to the excerpt from Tenet’s letter. This time, I have underlined <underline>monogloss presuppositions</underline> and bolded <bold>expansive engagement resources.</bold> Relevant codes appear in brackets:<disp-quote>
<p>Baghdad for now <bold>appears</bold> [expand: entertain] to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or CBW against the United States. <bold>Should Saddam conclude</bold> [expand: entertain] that a US-led attack could <underline>no longer be deterred</underline> [monogloss: presuppose], he <bold>probably would</bold> [expand: entertain] become much <underline>less constrained</underline> [monogloss: presuppose] in adopting terrorist actions.

Saddam <bold>might</bold> [expand: entertain] decide that <underline>the extreme step</underline> [monogloss: presuppose] of assisting Islamist terrorists in conducting a WMD attack against the United States <bold>would be</bold> [expand: entertain] his last chance to exact vengeance by taking a large number of victims with him. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0741088313488071">Tenet, 2002</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Observe first that this passage includes a number of presuppositions that Tenet assumes are beyond debate. Specifically, he positions his audience to accept as categorically true that (a) someone is currently trying to deter a U.S.-led attack against Iraq, (b) Iraq is currently being constrained from adopting terrorist actions, (c) Iraq unsuccessfully attempted a terrorist offensive in 1991, and (d) assisting Islamist terrorists in conducting a WMD attack against the United States represents an extreme step. Perhaps, the first two examples are most noteworthy, since Tenet actually represents the United States as a potential aggressor that needs to be deterred from attacking Iraq and Saddam as someone constrained from conducting terrorist actions. Tenet is projecting these presuppositions as <italic>common ground</italic> that he and his congressional audience shares—even as the Bush administration asserted that the United States had no desire for war and that Saddam could pass weapons to terrorists at any moment.</p>
<p>As noted, this excerpt is full of negative judgments about Iraq. But note that almost all of Tenet’s negative assertions are <italic>qualified</italic>—rendered dialogically open to debate—through modal auxiliaries, evidentials, and conditionals. If you look closely at Tenet’s negative judgments, you find certainty only about Hussein’s <italic>past</italic> wrongdoing—and a good deal of speculation about what he might do in the <italic>future</italic> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0741088313488071">Table 5</xref>).</p>

<p>When it comes to Iraqi aggression, Tenet is certain only that Iraq attempted a terrorist attack <italic>more than a decade ago</italic>—and <italic>failed</italic> at that attempt. At present, Tenet asserts, Saddam does not appear to be engaging in terrorism against the United States. In this case, the evidential <italic>appear</italic> marks Tenet’s assertion as an evidence-based interpretation. He is not fully committed to the assertion, but he is at least suggesting that his inference is based on observation. As Tenet projects the future, however, the representations of possible Iraqi wrongdoing become increasingly uncertain—even as they grow in severity. The worst possible scenario—Saddam assisting “Islamist terrorists” in a WMD attack on the United States—<italic>might</italic> happen or it <italic>might not</italic>. It’s <italic>more probable</italic>—<italic>if</italic> Saddam concludes a U.S.-led attack cannot be deterred, but, even in that hypothetical case, Saddam would remain somewhat “<italic>constrained</italic> in adopting terrorist actions.” Thus, while Tenet’s assertions portray Saddam Hussein as unethical and potentially aggressive, they are characterized by a high degree of doubt. In dialogic terms, Tenet is signaling to his audience that other viewpoints are allowable, that they have “space” to propose alternative views about Hussein’s future actions. Engagement analysis, then, is a valuable resource for understanding how rhetors seek to influence their putative addressees, pragmatically signaling how they can and should respond.</p>

<title>Component 2: Multimodal Transcription and Analysis</title>
<p>Rhetoricians have proven that their conceptual lexicon can be productively applied to image-based texts, illustrating how traditional linguistic concepts like argument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741088313488071">Blair, 2004</xref>) and parallelism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741088313488071">Fahnestock, 2003</xref>) can guide visual analysis. As useful as these concepts are, rhetoricians have yet to develop a standard approach to analyzing visual data: a set of clear, definable heuristic categories that can enable grounded interpretations of visual discourse. Moreover, rhetorical scholars need an analytic apparatus that allows them to integrate visual <italic>and</italic> verbal analyses, a cross-cutting vocabulary that can precisely describe the meaningful interaction of multiple semiotic modes. In this regard, social semiotic approaches to multimodal rhetoric have much to offer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741088313488071">Baldry &amp; Thibault, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741088313488071">Kress, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741088313488071">Kress &amp; Van Leeuwen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0741088313488071">Machin, 2007</xref>).

<title>How Rhetors Define Reality and Interact With Audiences Through Images</title>
<p>SF scholars posit that visual resources perform the same three metafunctions as verbal resources. Images construe reality by representing participants, processes, and circumstances (ideational). They enact relationships and social identities (interpersonal). And they achieve compositional coherence (textual). Rhetoricians can systematically analyze visual discourse along all three of these axes. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0741088313488071">Table 6</xref>, I lay out a basic framework for visual analysis drawn mainly from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741088313488071">Kress and Van Leeuwen’s (2006)</xref> work,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0741088313488071">7</xref></sup> but also from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0741088313488071">Machin (2007)</xref>.</p>

<p>Following this inventory can help us to think systematically about visual resources.

<p>To demonstrate the value of this analytic framework, let’s study an image from the CBS broadcast. For the sake of brevity, I focus primarily on the first two metafunctions: ideational and interpersonal. If you look closely at Shot 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0741088313488071">Appendix B</xref> (Video is present as Data Supplement at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wcx.sagepub.com/">http://wcx.sagepub.com/</ext-link>), you’ll see this image in the top-right portion of the screen (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0741088313488071">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The image appeared on screen for roughly 33 seconds during this broadcast,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0741088313488071">8</xref></sup> suggesting that viewers had sufficient opportunity to observe and interpret it. First, let’s analyze the ideational dimensions of the visual: what this image is about. As in our transitivity analysis, I start by identifying processes. I ask, is this a <italic>narrative</italic> image that tells a story about the represented participants (RPs), or is it a <italic>conceptual</italic> image that seeks to establish relationships among the RPs? In this case, there is a conceptual structure. Specifically, I observe what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741088313488071">Kress and Van Leeuwen (2006)</xref> refer to as an analytical process in which a Carrier (<italic>showdown</italic>) is linked to its Possessive Attributes (<italic>America</italic> and <italic>Iraq</italic>) (p. 91). That is, this image represents “America” and “Iraq” as part of a larger whole: a “showdown.” Of course, the Carrier in this process is specified verbally: it’s hard to miss the words “<sc>Showdown *With* Saddam</sc>” in bold yellow font. But, the Carrier is also defined visually through embedded symbolic processes. Specifically, the crosshairs of the rifle symbolically represent a violent activity (a <italic>war</italic> or <italic>showdown</italic>). And these crosshairs literally encircle other symbols (<italic>flags</italic>) that represent the two nations “in” the showdown (<italic>America</italic> and <italic>Iraq</italic>).</p>
<p>Shifting to the interpersonal metafunction, I can analyze how the image engages and positions the viewer. On the face of it, the image simply <italic>offers information</italic>: the showdown involving America and Iraq is presented for the viewer’s contemplation. On the other hand, this image enters the viewer into a kind of imaginary relationship with one of the RPs. Specifically, the viewer is positioned to “look through” the crosshairs of the rifle, and is invited to “aim at” the violent confrontation between the two countries. Through visual proxemics, the viewer is also positioned at a minimal <italic>social distance</italic> from the action, indeed close enough to press his or her face against the “rifle.” The frontal angle at which the viewer sees the RPs further suggests strong <italic>involvement</italic> with the depicted world. In short, the “showdown” is represented as psychologically close to the audience, a desirable goal that is “within the viewer’s sights.”</p>
<p>I can also examine this image in terms of <italic>modality</italic>, whether the image is represented as “real” or “fictional.” In this case, there are several visual cues indicating that this image represents a kind of fantasy. The colors are unmodulated; there is no background detail; and, of course, the RPs are symbolic abstractions—stylized illustrations of flags and rifle crosshairs. These features suggest that the viewer is not to regard this image as a “naturalistic” scene, and may instead adopt a <italic>sensory coding orientation</italic> (p. 165). In other words, this image is not designed to correspond faithfully to the real world, but to appeal to our senses. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0741088313488071">Machin (2007)</xref> suggests, vibrant and highly saturated colors, like the yellow and green in this image, create emotional intensity (p. 75) and lead us to understand that the depicted world is “more than real” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741088313488071">Kress &amp; Van Leeuwen, 2006</xref>, p. 154). In this sense, the “showdown” is construed as a kind of animated fantasy. Indeed, the image’s position at the top of the screen suggests that the “showdown” is an <italic>ideal</italic> that still “might be.” Thus, even though war isn’t actually happening, it is nevertheless presented as an exciting possibility, something to exhilarate and entertain us.</p>

<title>How Rhetors Create Intersemiotic Meanings</title>
<p>As I hope I’ve shown, SF scholars supply rhetoricians with nuanced vocabulary for analyzing images (highlighted throughout the previous section). This vocabulary permits analysts to ground their interpretations of visual texts on observable details (framing lines, camera angle, color saturation, etc.) and prevents them from devolving into impressionistic commentary. However, SF approaches are not limited to still images. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741088313488071">Baldry and Thibault (2005)</xref> provide systematic methods for analyzing video texts, elucidating how various semiotic modes interact: language, dynamic images, and sound. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741088313488071">Baldry and Thibault (2005)</xref>, I created a multimodal transcript for the CBS News video.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0741088313488071">9</xref></sup> I have shown an excerpt of this transcription in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0741088313488071">Table 7</xref>—an excerpt that accounts for 3 seconds of the CBS broadcast.</p>

<p>In the multimodal transcription, the different columns of the table do different analytic work. Column 1 displays the time in seconds. In columns 2 to 4, I account for visual meanings—including, among other things, the semiotics of the camera (e.g., position, angle, distance, etc.) and the kinesic actions of the depicted participants (gaze, facial expressions, movements, etc.). In column 5, I account for auditory data—including spoken language, pauses, emphases, and the ambient sounds of the depicted world.

<p>Examining Shot 5 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0741088313488071">Appendix B</xref> (Video is present as Data Supplement at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wcx.sagepub.com/">http://wcx.sagepub.com/</ext-link>), one can see that an image of a fighter jet is co-deployed with the word “war.” Here, the sense relation is one of meronymy: a fighter jet is <italic>part of</italic> “war.” Could CBS have chosen to symbolize war through some other sense relation? Perhaps not. War is a distributed activity involving multiple actors, events, and locations. As such, it is difficult to “repeat” war in an image, or represent its equally abstract “synonyms” (battle, combat, etc.) or its abstract “hyponyms” (civil war, guerilla war, etc.). CBS might have “antonymized” war, displaying a peace sign, but this could have suggested that the “lawmakers with second thoughts about war” were, in fact, antiwar. This helps to explain why CBS chose to represent the jet, a part of war that is relatively easy to display. However, CBS could have chosen to construe just about any meronym of war: soldiers, tanks, rubble, wounded civilians, and so on. Compared to some options, the jet is a rather sanitized, impersonal way of representing this activity. And, to those of us who have seen <italic>Top Gun</italic>, the jet may even glorify war and exalt the American military. In any case, “war” is not the only verbal meaning that CBS <italic>could</italic> have visually represented. For instance, CBS could have easily displayed the “lawmakers with second thoughts,” showing some representative “hyponyms” of this class (U.S. senators, for instance). By choosing to re-represent <italic>war</italic> in the visual mode, CBS renders it more available to the viewer, more <italic>present</italic> than other elements of the verbal text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0741088313488071">Perelman &amp; Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1969</xref>). Identifying intersemiotic sense relations, then, is not just a labeling exercise: it helps analysts consider the options and constraints that rhetors face as they combine verbal-visual resources to construe reality.</p>
<p>A multimodal transcription also helps analysts discern “verbal-visual thematic formations,” overarching meanings that are built up in a text through joint patterns of verbal and visual design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741088313488071">Baldry &amp; Thibault, 2005</xref>, p. 138). One key thematic formation developed in the CBS text can be glossed as a conditional assertion: <sc>If Saddam feels pressured, he may attack/endanger</sc>. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0741088313488071">Table 8</xref>, this overarching meaning is realized through several lexicogrammatical forms.</p>

<p>This thematic pattern is also developed in the visual aspect of the text. Notice the video image of Saddam Hussein in Shot 4 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0741088313488071">Appendix B</xref> (Video is present as Data Supplement at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wcx.sagepub.com/">http://wcx.sagepub.com/</ext-link>). Hussein is dressed in a military uniform, clothing that distinguishes him as a “general” with the power to launch an attack.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0741088313488071">11</xref></sup> Moreover, as Hussein directs his gaze at an unseen addressee, he holds his hands up in a “reactional” posture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741088313488071">Kress &amp; Van Leeuwen, 2006</xref>, p. 66), one that would strike American audiences as defensive, as if Hussein is under duress. Importantly, this <italic>fulfills</italic> the conditional element of the thematic formation: Hussein appears to be under pressure <italic>now</italic>—not in some hypothetical future. Arguably, this brings the “threat” even closer to the viewer, heightening the sense that Saddam Hussein may “lash out” at any moment. When analysts identify such multimodal thematic formations, they are better able to understand how a text layers together verbal and visual meanings to build an overarching picture of the world and provoke an overall audience response.</p>

<title>Component 3: Micro-Intertextual Discourse Analysis</title>
<p>In forming their own discourse, speakers necessarily draw upon, anticipate, and transform other discourse for persuasive ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741088313488071">Bakhtin, 1981</xref>). In this section, I discuss the final component of the micro-rhetorical toolkit, a micro-intertextual comparison. This represents my own technique for analyzing how written discourse is recontextualized in multimodal texts. Drawing on the approaches already discussed in this article (linguistic analysis and multimodal text analysis), I develop a grounded and systematic way of investigating an everyday event: What happens when television journalists re-present political speech?</p>
<sec id="section11-0741088313488071">
<title>How Rhetors Recontextualize and Transform Prior Discourse</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741088313488071">Linell (1998)</xref> points out, whenever an “original” utterance is recontextualized in a new discursive environment, it is <italic>transformed</italic>, “re-perspectivized” as demanded by a new situation (p. 151). Many scholars have shown that even small linguistic changes can have a significant rhetorical impact when some stretch of discourse is recontextualized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741088313488071">Fahnestock, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0741088313488071">MacDonald, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0741088313488071">Trew, 1979</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0741088313488071">12</xref></sup> These studies have tended to focus on print journalism, and have had less to say about multimodal journalism and the particular mechanisms by which it “realigns” putative audiences. Thus, I introduce what I term a micro-intertextual comparison, analyzing the lexical, grammatical, and cross-semiotic changes that written discourse undergoes as it is recontextualized in video journalism.</p>
<p>First, I examined the multimodal transcription of the news broadcast and identified those portions of the narrative that <italic>overtly indicated</italic> that a given meaning was being attributed to Tenet. Because I was studying television news, these attributions to Tenet were always co-deployed with some kind of visual data. Thus, the verbal-visual segment unfolding throughout Shot 4 was coded as a single overt recontextualization of Tenet’s letter. Once I had identified recontextualizations, I located “antecedent source material” in Tenet’s letter from which the recontextualizations were drawn. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0741088313488071">Table 9</xref>, I then placed Tenet’s original text (column 1) alongside the explicit verbal-visual recontextualizations in the news (columns 2-3).</p>

<p>Finally, I turned my attention to the rhetorical impact of these transformations. That is, I sought to examine the ways that rhetorical audiences were <bold>repositioned</bold> with regard to Tenet’s letter as elements of it were re-represented and transformed in the news. “Repositioning” is a term I employ to describe how the illocutionary effect of an assertion changes when it is recontextualized. Recall that every assertion “positions” some putative audience, implying a “desired response” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741088313488071">Halliday &amp; Matthiessen, 2004</xref>, p. 108). When an “original” assertion is recontextualized and transformed in a new context, the desired response changes and the audience hearing the re-represented utterance is positioned differently.</p>
<p>To account for this phenomenon, I added interpretive comments to the final column of the intertextual comparison (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0741088313488071">Table 9</xref>). These comments explain how given transformations resituated audiences vis-à-vis Tenet and his claims. In writing these comments, I inevitably drew upon my knowledge of rhetoric and DA. Thus, it was not uncommon for me to discuss how given transformations added or suppressed rhetorical presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0741088313488071">Perelman &amp; Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1969</xref>), legitimized or delegitimized certain actors or discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0741088313488071">Van Leeuwen, 2008</xref>), or altered the degree to which alternative viewpoints would be tolerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0741088313488071">Martin &amp; White, 2005</xref>). Using analytic induction, I coded these interpretive comments, labeling each with a brief gloss (e.g., <italic>enhanced presence</italic>). As I generated these codes, I operationalized them in memos, identifying salient features of the data that indicated each category.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0741088313488071">13</xref></sup> Ultimately, I discerned five subtypes of repositioning, organized under two general headings (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0741088313488071">Table 11</xref>).</p>

<p>The two main categories of repositioning were defined as follows:</p>
<list id="list23-0741088313488071" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Enhancement</italic>—news discourse positions audiences to regard Tenet’s claims as more salient, more certain, or more forceful than they otherwise would have. Journalists (a) assert how Tenet’s discourse influences the minds and passions of audiences, (b) endow Tenet’s claims with enhanced presence, or (c) close down dialogic space for alternative viewpoints.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Legitimation</italic>—news discourse positions audiences to regard Tenet and his discourse as legitimate (authoritative, justified, reasonable, etc.) in its own right and consistent with a pro-American, anti-Iraqi worldview. Journalists add evaluations (both visual and verbal) or other forms of legitimation discourse that <italic>comment positively</italic> on Tenet and his letter—or paraphrase Tenet’s letter in ways that promote the overall strategy of positive self-presentation and negative other-presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0741088313488071">Van Dijk, 1998</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Coding was nonexclusive since a given recontextualization could reposition audiences in multiple ways. While I quantified enhancements and legitimations, I was not primarily interested in counting frequencies. Instead, I sought to provide a detailed qualitative description of the mechanisms by which audiences were repositioned from moment to moment in the news text.</p>
<p>To see the value of this approach, let’s return to Tenet’s letter and examine how it was recontextualized in John Roberts’s report on CBS (Shots 3 and 4 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0741088313488071">Appendix B</xref>; Video is present as Data Supplement at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wcx.sagepub.com/">http://wcx.sagepub.com/</ext-link>). Roberts appears to have zeroed in on the following stretch of discourse from Tenet’s letter: “Should Saddam conclude that a US-led attack could no longer be deterred, he probably would become much less constrained in adopting terrorist actions.” As noted, Tenet is engaging in conditional reasoning, a kind of “if-then” logic where one proposition (<italic>Saddam would probably become much less constrained</italic> . . .) is construed as dependent on another (if <italic>he concludes a US-led attack could no longer be deterred</italic>). Note that the if-clause (protasis) represents Saddam as a “senser” engaged in a rational mental process. He is someone who reasons, that is, someone who will “conclude” what the evidence indicates before acting. Also, as noted before, the if-clause contains an important presupposition that some unnamed agent is trying to deter a “US-led attack.” This strongly suggests that America is behaving belligerently. Interestingly, then, Tenet represents Saddam Hussein as a <italic>thinker</italic>, but implicates the United States as the <italic>aggressor</italic>, a nation that is currently threatening Iraq and that may attack, unless it can be discouraged.</p>
<p>In shot 3, one can observe Roberts’s initial recontextualization of this discourse. Standing in front of the White House, Roberts reports, “As Congress opened its debate on Iraq today, it received a <italic>chill</italic>ing new warning that Saddam Hussein could lash out against the United States in <italic>fright</italic>ening <italic>fash</italic>ion if he feels his back is against the wall.” Here, Roberts recontextualizes Tenet’s assertion without directly sourcing it to him. In fact, Roberts initially focuses on the recipient of Tenet’s discourse—Congress—and its debate on Iraq. His opening phrase (<italic>As Congress debates</italic> . . .) adds context to Tenet’s “warning,” which is temporally “synchronized” with—and thus relevant to—the congressional debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0741088313488071">Van Leeuwen, 2008</xref>). Another important addition is the noun phrase that encodes Tenet’s discourse: “a chilling new warning.” As noted, this phrase evokes an affective response of insecurity, but it also suggests that the assertion itself is <italic>credible</italic>. People don’t refer to a statement as a “warning,” unless they believe the speaker issuing the warning is trustworthy. CBS subtly repositions the viewer to regard Tenet as a legitimate speaker.</p>
<p>As Roberts re-represents the actual content of Tenet’s assertion, he retains the conditional reasoning. However, both the if-clause and the then-clause (apodosis) are significantly transformed. In the if-clause, though Saddam is still engaged in a mental process, the nature of this mental process has changed. The original verb (<italic>conclude</italic>) has been relexicalized with the verb (<italic>feels</italic>). These are not synonymous: “conclude” is associated with logical judgment based on careful consideration; “feel” is associated with belief based on instinct or intuition. Saddam is characterized more like someone responding to stimuli (<italic>feeling</italic>), than someone making reasonable inferences (<italic>concluding</italic>). Moreover, in Roberts’s version, the condition that might lead Saddam to pursue violence has been altered. Audiences hear nothing about the threat of a “US-led attack,” or the efforts to deter such an attack. Instead, Saddam is apparently willing to hurt others, “if he feels <underline>his back is against the wall</underline>.” This idiomatic expression works on the basis of a metaphor rooted in the actual experience of being pressed against a wall with no option for escape. Thus, the viewer is invited to imagine Saddam as someone who has been cornered and who may need to “fight his way out.” Still, audiences get no sense of <italic>who</italic> is pressing Saddam’s back to the wall. So the audience is repositioned to “overlook” U.S. aggression and see only Saddam: a person moved by instinct rather than rational calculation.</p>
<p>This sense is only heightened in the then-clause, where audiences are told that “Saddam Hussein could lash out against the United States in frightening fashion.” The added circumstance of manner (<italic>in frightening fashion</italic>) once again betokens a negative affectual response of insecurity. Moreover, the material process (<italic>lash out</italic>) strongly evokes an animal attack, a sudden and uncontrolled violent outburst. This sense of Saddam’s “animalism” is simply not present in Tenet’s letter—and it positions the viewer to regard Saddam as a subhuman brute.</p>
<p>In shot 4, Roberts continues his report by explicitly citing Tenet’s letter, and quoting it directly (as indicated by the graphological symbols on screen [“”]). Here Roberts would seem to be remaining “faithful” to Tenet’s words, but even in this case one finds substantial transformations of Tenet’s discourse. Note that Tenet’s report is again encoded in narrative speech acts (<italic>raised the alarm, warning</italic>) that both enhance the “threatening” nature of Tenet’s statement and index Tenet’s legitimacy. To say that Tenet “raised the alarm” assumes that his assertion is something to be alarmed about. And a person who “raises the alarm” is a responsible person, interested in the safety and well-being of the community.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the quotation itself is <italic>not</italic> a verbatim account of what Tenet actually wrote (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0741088313488071">Table 9</xref>). For instance, one complete sentence from Tenet’s letter (<italic>Saddam for now appears</italic> . . .) becomes a dependent clause in Roberts’s report: “while Saddam for now appears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist acts. . . .” In order to form this clause, Roberts had to add the subordinating conjunction “while,” a token of <italic>counterexpectancy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0741088313488071">Martin &amp; White, 2005</xref>). This implies that while both Roberts and the viewer w<italic>ould have expected</italic> Saddam to continue “drawing a line short” of terrorism, “surprisingly” Saddam might become less constrained in “adopting terrorist acts” in the future. Adding the word “while” may seem like an innocuous change, but, in fact, Roberts has intervened in Tenet’s discourse to suggest that Saddam’s behavior—or rather his potential behavior—is somehow “exceptional.” This is yet another way of enhancing Saddam’s role as an “Other” who violates expected norms.</p>
<p>Also, the if-clause of Tenet’s letter is again paraphrased rather than quoted. Recall that in Tenet’s version, the protasis reads, “should Saddam conclude that a US-led attack could no longer be deterred.” Now, in Robert’s report, the protasis appears as follows: “if he thinks a military strike is inevitable.” In the recontextualized version, Saddam is construed as someone engaged in a mental process, but again Roberts’s verb (<italic>thinks</italic>) suggests a more tentative conjecture than the verb originally chosen by Tenet (<italic>conclude</italic>). While Saddam now reasons in Roberts’s version, it appears that he may “adopt terrorist actions” on the basis of unconfirmed beliefs rather than carefully considered conclusions. Also, as before, American culpability for a future assault on Iraq is lost, as “a US-led attack” is converted to “a military strike,” a noun phrase that retains a sense of violence but conceals the people responsible for it. Finally, Roberts’s version again conceals the notion that some unnamed actor is trying to deter a U.S.-led attack. Granted, Roberts’s attribute (<italic>inevitable</italic>) implies a point when war “could no longer be deterred,” but it does not assume that efforts to deter war are actually taking place—and certainly doesn’t suggest, as Tenet does, that these efforts are aimed at preventing <italic>American</italic> aggression.</p>
<p>Aside from these linguistic changes, CBS also adds visual data that greatly modify the meaning of Tenet’s writing. First, notice that Tenet’s words are not just uttered by Roberts, but also displayed on the screen. By presenting Tenet’s discourse in two modes, CBS enhances the salience of his assertions, endowing them with rhetorical <italic>presence</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0741088313488071">Perelman &amp; Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1969</xref>). Second, the visual images themselves imply a “dialogic relationship” between Tenet and Saddam Hussein, and suggest Tenet’s relative legitimacy. Note that Tenet appears in the top-left portion of the screen, above Saddam Hussein, who appears in the lower-left portion. Thus, Tenet is located saliently in the “ideal” position, indicative of his more reputable status, while Hussein is located less prominently in the “real” position, indicative of his less respectable standing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741088313488071">Kress &amp; Van Leeuwen, 2006</xref>, pp. 186, 198).</p>
<p>Both Tenet and Hussein speak inaudibly into microphones, moving in slow motion as they talk. I’ve already commented on Hussein’s “defensive” gesture and its contribution to this narrative. The image of George Tenet is also noteworthy. Dressed in a business suit, Tenet is framed head-on in a close-medium shot, sitting with his hands folded as he gazes directly at the viewer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0741088313488071">14</xref></sup> CBS’s portrayal of Tenet establishes maximal involvement with the audience and enacts a visual demand that requires the viewer’s attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741088313488071">Kress &amp; Van Leeuwen, 2006</xref>, p. 118). By contrast, Saddam is featured at an oblique angle and makes no eye contact with the viewer. Thus, while audiences do not engage with Saddam, they are positioned to “heed” Tenet’s warning. Circumstantial elements in the visual shot (table, microphone) suggest that Tenet is testifying before Congress, a sense that is supported by the picture of the U.S. Capitol on the right half of the screen. But Tenet did not actually <italic>read</italic> his letter to Congress. He sent it privately to a single U.S. senator, and only later did <italic>Congress</italic> decide to release the letter to the public. The CBS visual thus repositions the viewer to imagine Tenet as a public “witness,” one who altruistically comes to Capitol Hill to “warn” the people.</p>
<p>A micro-intertextual analysis enables rhetoricians to better understand recontextualization in multimodal environments, to specify verbal-visual transformations and account for their persuasive potential. Ultimately, rhetoricians can produce richer, deeper analyses when they take such a systematic, comprehensive approach.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>I have argued that scholars of rhetoric and writing should embrace analytic methods from linguistics and social semiotics. I introduced a micro-rhetorical toolkit consisting of three main components: linguistic discourse analysis, multimodal text analysis, and micro-intertextual comparison. Mostly, the toolkit combines existing techniques from SF scholarship. However, to complete a detailed intertextual study, I also developed novel coding categories using analytic induction. Ultimately, the constellation of discourse-based methods is empirical, delicate, and well equipped to account for the intricacies of intertextual and multimodal discourse.</p>
<p>I hope I have demonstrated how this systematic approach enables analysts to discern the small verbal-visual modifications that impact how audiences are repositioned to see an “original” discourse event. In this case, assertions in Tenet’s letter were meaningfully altered. For example, the CBS journalists concealed U.S. responsibility for aggression against Iraq, characterized Saddam Hussein as dangerous and irrational (contra Tenet’s letter), characterized Tenet as authoritative and committed to public welfare, and sought to “glamorize the danger” of Saddam’s potential actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741088313488071">Fahnestock, 1986</xref>, p. 281).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0741088313488071">15</xref></sup> I couldn’t have made these insights using traditional analytic techniques from rhetorical studies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0741088313488071">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of course, the toolkit has its shortcomings. Most of the procedures focus on micro-textual phenomena, without examining the processes by which texts are designed or interpreted by real audiences. The textual analyses should be complemented with a thorough qualitative study of textual production and reception, including “a thick description of the rhetorical situation that motivated” the discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0741088313488071">Selzer, 2004</xref>, p. 292). Another shortcoming is that some of the coding schemes—particularly schemes for micro-intertextual comparison—are tentative and need to be refined. Finally, the techniques outlined here can enable only relatively “small” claims about particular data. They cannot comment on macro-discursive or macro-cultural phenomena.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0741088313488071">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Still, a focused and rigorous inquiry of discourse can help us account for the nuances of multimodal recontextualization, to systematically chart transformations of meaning across verbal-visual intertexts—and explain how these transformations (re)define reality and (re)position audiences. For those of us interested in such things, this toolkit should be a welcome heuristic. Indeed, DA provides us with precise instruments for analyzing all kinds of micro-rhetorical phenomena. These techniques deserve to be incorporated into our methodological toolkits, explicated in our research accounts, and taught in our graduate programs.</p>

<p>Note: I focus my analysis on the <bold>bolded</bold> portion of the letter. However, in the course of my analysis, I sometimes highlight other parts of the letter in order to showcase particular methods of DA.</p>
<p>The Honorable Bob Graham</p>
<p>Chairman</p>
<p>Select Committee on Intelligence</p>
<p>United States Senate</p>
<p>Washington, DC. 20510</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Chairman:</p>
<p>In response to your letter of 4 October 2002, we have made unclassified material available to further the Senate’s forthcoming open debate on a Joint Resolution concerning Iraq.</p>
<p>As always, our declassification efforts seek a balance between your need for unfettered debate and our need to protect sources and methods. We have also been mindful of a shared interest in not providing to Saddam a blueprint of our intelligence capabilities and shortcoming, or with insight into our expectation of how he will and will not act. The salience of such concerns is only heightened by the possibility for hostilities between the United States and Iraq.</p>
<p>These are some of the reasons why we did not include our classified judgments on Saddam’s decision-making regarding the use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in our recent unclassified paper on <italic>Iraq’s Weapons of Mass Destruction</italic>. Viewing your request with those concerns in mind, however, we can declassify the following from the paragraphs you requested:<disp-quote>
<p><bold>Baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or CBW against the United States.</bold></p>
<p><bold>Should Saddam conclude that a US-led attack could no longer be deterred, he probably would become much less constrained in adopting terrorist actions. Such terrorism might involve conventional means, as with Iraq’s unsuccessful attempt at a terrorist offensive in 1991, or CBW.</bold></p>
<p><bold>Saddam might decide that the extreme step of assisting Islamist terrorists in conducting a WMD attack against the United States would be his last chance to exact vengeance by taking a large number of victims with him.</bold></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Regarding the 2 October closed hearing, we can declassify the following dialogue:<disp-quote>
<p>Senator Levin: . . . If (Saddam) didn’t feel threatened, did not feel threatened, is it likely that he would initiate an attack using a weapon of mass destruction?</p>
<p>Senior Intelligence Witness: . . . My judgment would be that the probability of him initiating an attack—let me put a time frame on it—in the foreseeable future, given the conditions we understand now, the likelihood I think would be low.</p>
<p>Senator Levin: Now if he did initiate an attack you’ve . . . indicated he would probably attempt clandestine attacks against us. . . . But what about his use of weapons of mass destruction? If we initiate an attack and he thought he was in extremis or otherwise, what’s the likelihood in response to our attack that he would use chemical or biological weapons?</p>
<p>Senior Intelligence Witness: Pretty high, in my view.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the above dialogue, the witness’s qualifications—“in the foreseeable future, given the conditions we understand now”—were intended to underscore that the likelihood of Saddam using WMD for blackmail, deterrence, or otherwise grows as his arsenal builds. Moreover, if Saddam used WMD, it would disprove his repeated denials that he has such weapons.</p>
<p>Regarding Senator Bayh’s question of Iraqi links to al-Qa’ida, Senators could draw from the following points for unclassified discussions:</p>
<list id="list24-0741088313488071" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Our understanding of the relationship between Iraq and al- Qa’ida is evolving and is based on sources of varying reliability. Some of the information we have received comes from detainees, including some of high rank.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We have solid reporting of senior level contacts between Iraq and al-Qa’ida going back a decade.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Credible information indicates that Iraq and al-Qa’ida have discussed safe haven and reciprocal non-aggression.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Since Operation Enduring Freedom, we have solid evidence of the presence in Iraq of al-Qa’ida members, including some that have been in Baghdad.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We have credible reporting that al-Qa’ida leaders sought contacts in Iraq who could help them acquire WMD capabilities. The reporting also stated that Iraq has provided training to al-Qa’ida members in the areas of poisons and gases and making conventional bombs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Iraq’s increasing support to extremist Palestinians, coupled with growing indications of a relationship with al- Qa’ida, suggest that Baghdad’s links to terrorists will increase, even absent US military action.</p></list-item>
</list>

<p>This clause in Tenet’s letter does not really concern the question of WMD in Iraq. Nevertheless, the clause directly speaks to one of the Bush administration’s chief justifications for war: Iraq’s alleged links to al-Qaeda. Thus, it is worth considering how Tenet formulated evidence for this claim. One might also consider why CBS ultimately chose not to reproduce this section of Tenet’s letter in its newscast—or even comment on the fact that Tenet had created ready-made political talking points for Congress. However, I have selected this clause primarily to showcase aspects of transitivity analysis.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0741088313488071">
<label>3.</label>
<p>I don’t mean to suggest that Tenet consciously compared the possessive clause and the existential clause, and then decided on the former. I cite only the alternative existential construction because it nicely shows what Tenet “adds” to the clause when he construes it in the language of possession.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0741088313488071">
<label>4.</label>
<p>Importantly, while Tenet may have implied that Saddam is dangerous, he never explicitly says this. Arguably, Tenet <italic>dismisses</italic> the notion that Saddam is dangerous since his letter includes testimony for a “Senior Intelligence” analyst who states that Saddam is unlikely to initiate any attack “in the foreseeable future.” Thus, Rather enhances the negative judgment of Saddam Hussein—transforming the Iraqi leader from “potential threat” to “current threat.” This is the kind of change that a micro-intertextual analysis (discussed below) is well equipped to perceive.</p>

Thus, when I say, “the dog <italic>might</italic> run away,” I not only indicate a lack of certainty, but also entertain and open up space for alternative viewpoints (e.g., “the dog might not run away”). Put another way, when we use modals and evidentials we reference the dialogic backdrop for our utterances, indicating that our proposition is just one among a host of competing propositions in the communicative context (p. 105).</p>

<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741088313488071">Fahnestock (1986)</xref>, rhetoricians have tended to use the term “accommodation” to refer to this process of modifying prior discourse for new audiences.

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0741088313488071">Appendix A</xref>, Tenet initially casts his gaze downward, indicating that he is reading, but he eventually lifts his head and makes sustained “eye contact” with the viewer.</p>

<p>In so doing, CBS likely “buried the lead.” That is, CBS concealed the major <italic>discrepancy</italic> between Bush and the CIA regarding the likelihood that Saddam Hussein would use his alleged WMD. At the same time, CBS probably accelerated the rush to war in Iraq. By highlighting the supposed danger of Saddam Hussein and obscuring American culpability for provocation, they likely made war seem like the only course of action, that is, the only way to remove an untrustworthy dictator. There are many possible reasons why CBS reported in ways that made war seem desirable and exciting—nationalism, profit motive, and the belief that war was inevitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741088313488071">Bennett, Lawrence, &amp; Livingston, 2007</xref>).</p>
