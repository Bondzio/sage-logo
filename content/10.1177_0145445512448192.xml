<abstract>
<p>Families served within child welfare settings evidence a wide range of emergencies or unexpected crises or circumstances that may lead to danger and make it difficult for them to focus on treatment planning. Mental health treatment providers are often unprepared to effectively manage emergencies during implementation of evidence-based prescribed therapy sessions. In this study, the authors empirically developed a standardized intervention to assist mental health providers in emergency prevention and management (EPM) with their clients. EPM includes assessment of emergent conditions and a self-control procedure that may be utilized by consumers to prevent or resolve emergencies. EPM responses of 26 mothers referred by Child Protective Services for 6 months of evidence-supported treatment were examined. Relevant to clinical utility, the results indicated that providers implemented EPM in a little more than half (56.9%) of their treatment sessions, and all emergencies assessed in EPM were endorsed by at least 8% of the sample throughout their treatment. EPM was implemented with fidelity according to service providers, and corroborated by blind raters. Participants were found to be compliant and satisfied with EPM. The average number of emergencies endorsed over the course of EPM administrations was negatively correlated with the frequency of EPM administrations, suggesting that EPM may have helped reduce emergencies. Pretreatment factors (e.g., household income, child abuse potential, family functioning, parental stress, child behavior problems, number of days child removed from home) and hard drug use (but not marijuana or alcohol) during treatment were associated with the number of emergencies reported by participants.</p>

<p>Families who are psychotherapeutically treated within the child welfare system, particularly those referred for child maltreatment and substance abuse, frequently evidence dangerous and unforeseen urgent conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445512448192">Grella, Hser, &amp; Huang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0145445512448192">Lussier, Laventure, &amp; Bertrand, 2010</xref>) that demand immediate attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145445512448192">Chrzanowski, 1977</xref>). Emergencies involve unexpected crises or circumstances for which treatment providers are often unprepared to effectively manage, distracting them from implementation of prescribed therapies and interrupting treatment planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145445512448192">Girvin, DePanfilis, &amp; Daining, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0145445512448192">Lutzker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0145445512448192">Navaie-Waliser et al., 2000</xref>). Primary emergencies (e.g., physical insults, ingesting poisons, exposure to electrical wires) require immediate action and are easily identified due to their acute onset and negative outcomes, whereas impending emergencies are often overlooked because their dangerous effects are delayed or relatively less severe. Impending emergencies include food shortages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0145445512448192">Messer &amp; Ross, 2002</xref>), filthy home conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145445512448192">Edwards &amp; Lutzker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145445512448192">Metchikian, Mink, Bigelow, Lutzker, &amp; Doctor, 1999</xref>), being unable to pay bills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445512448192">Beckman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445512448192">Clark, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445512448192">Copeland &amp; Hall, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0145445512448192">Rockhill, Green, &amp; Newton-Curtis, 2008</xref>), court hearings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0145445512448192">Larrieu, Heller, Smyke, &amp; Zeanah, 2008</xref>), and moving to new home environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145445512448192">Davey-Rothwell, Latimore, Hulber, &amp; Latkin, 2011</xref>). These impending emergencies may appear stressful but not potentially dangerous. However, in child welfare populations, these circumstances are often associated with trauma. For instance, a court hearing may result in the loss of child custody or incarceration, and moving to a new home may result in relocation to crime invested, dangerous living conditions, or discontinuance of treatment.</p>
<p>Reactions of family members to emergencies vary, but often include heightened and prolonged levels of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512448192">Bolen, McWey, &amp; Schlee, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445512448192">Depanfilis &amp; Zuravin, 1999</xref>) and emotional disturbance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0145445512448192">Sheppes, Meiran, Spivak, &amp; Shahar, 2010</xref>). Poor reactions to emergencies appear to be affected by financial instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145445512448192">Gapen et al., 2011</xref>), lack of social support systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445512448192">Kaniasty &amp; Norris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0145445512448192">Untas et al., 2011</xref>), anxiety and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445512448192">Leach, Christensen, Mackinnon, Windsor, &amp; Butterworth, 2008</xref>), substance abuse, domestic violence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0145445512448192">Kelley et al., 2010</xref>), social isolation, and poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0145445512448192">Smith &amp; Testa, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Emergencies have been found to perpetuate irrational thoughts that interfere with effective problem-solving strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145445512448192">Areán et al., 2010</xref>), influence premature treatment termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445512448192">Barrett et al., 2008</xref>), and lower treatment integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145445512448192">Carroll et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0145445512448192">Perepletchikova &amp; Kazdin, 2005</xref>). Therefore, because coping skills are associated with effective reactions to emergencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0145445512448192">Piko, 2001</xref>), it is possible that coping skill interventions may be effective in the management of emergencies among mothers in the child welfare system who abuse drugs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0145445512448192">Kelley, 1998</xref>). However, prescribed emergency prevention and management interventions have yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Mental health providers customarily address emergencies by first determining the immediacy of potential consequences and, based on informal assessment, attempt to spontaneously resolve emergent conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145445512448192">Greenstone &amp; Leviton, 1993</xref>). This approach is problematic when treatment providers lack confidence in their ability to spontaneously implement emergency management procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145445512448192">Baker &amp; Bissmire, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, this method does not teach family members how to prevent, identify, and manage future emergencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145445512448192">Flannery &amp; Everly, 2000</xref>). An alternative strategy is to refer clients to specialized service providers when emergencies are detected. Unfortunately, conflicting schedules, lack of transportation, child care, and other issues relevant to continuity of care are likely obstacles in the referral process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0145445512448192">Neale, Tompkins, &amp; Sheard, 2008</xref>). Thus, therapeutic management of emergencies can be time-consuming, dangerous, and stressful, and interfere with the amelioration of underlying treatment issues.</p>
<p>Given the absence of standardized emergency management interventions, we decided to (a) empirically develop an instrument to assist therapists in rapidly identifying emergencies and their antecedent conditions and (b) examine the utility of this instrument in conjunction with an empirically validated treatment. To assist in real-world application, we examined this approach within the context of a comprehensive evidence-based treatment program (i.e., 6 months of family behavior therapy [FBT]). FBT includes multiple directive interventions that are implemented comprehensively and cumulatively based on need, and has demonstrated positive outcomes in adult and adolescent substance abuse up to 9 months of posttreatment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512448192">Azrin, Acierno, et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445512448192">Azrin, Donohue, Besalel, et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445512448192">Azrin, Donohue, Teichner, et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145445512448192">Azrin, McMahon, et al., 1994</xref>). The study was conducted in a sample of 26 mothers referred from Child Protective Services (CPSs) for child neglect and drug abuse due to their very high risk of experiencing emergencies. We hypothesized that the targeted emergencies would be clinically relevant and that emergency prevention and management (EPM) would demonstrate strong clinical utility. We expected that treatment providers would be able to implement EPM with integrity and that participants would be compliant and satisfied with EPM. To preliminarily examine the efficacy of this intervention approach, we anticipated that the number of EPM administrations throughout treatment would be negatively associated with the average number of emergencies, or potential emergencies, reported during the EPM administrations. The nature of this study also permitted us to test predicted relationships between the number of emergencies reported to occur throughout treatment and various pretreatment factors (e.g., demographic variables, child abuse potential, parenting, family functioning), as well as substance use throughout treatment.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were mothers referred by Child Protective Services (CPS) caseworkers to a treatment outcome study after having evidenced an incident of child neglect and illicit drug use within the past 4 months. They were required to meet the following inclusionary/exclusionary criteria to be included in this study: diagnosed with substance abuse or dependence according to results obtained from the Structured Clinical Interview for <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed.; <italic>DSM-IV</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445512448192">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref> [SCID-IV]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512448192">First, Spitzer, Gibbon, &amp; Williams, 1996</xref>), residing with (or intention to reside with) the child referred for child neglect, household income less than US$5,000 per month (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512448192">Bolen et al., 2008</xref>), and indication by the caseworker that domestic violence and child victimization of sexual abuse were not the primary reasons for referral. After potential participants were assessed and determined to meet the aforementioned criteria, they were randomly assigned to FBT or treatment as usual (TAU). Those in the TAU condition were excluded from the current study to assure that participants were prescribed evidence-supported intervention. To assure participants had an opportunity to effect change in the average number of emergencies, they were required to have had at least two administrations of EPM. A total of 32 participants received at least one FBT session, with 5 of these participants being excluded due to having experienced less than two EPM sessions, and an additional participant being excluded due to having a monthly income greater than US$5,000. Thus, 26 participants were included in the study analyses.</p>
<p>The mean age of the participants was 30.12 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.70). The mean highest educational grade completed was 10.54 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.10). In all, 10 participants identified as Caucasian (38.5%), 7 as African American (26.9%), 4 as Latina (15.4%), and 5 as other (19.2%). A total of 12 women were single (46.2%), 12 were cohabitating (46.2%), and 2 were married (7.7%). A total of 19 participants were unemployed (73.1%), with 2 participants (11.5%) reporting full-time employment. In all, 15 participants (57.7%) were receiving some form of state or federal assistance (food stamps, social security, or rent assistance). The participants’ personal income (<italic>M</italic> = 175.0, <italic>SD</italic> = 342.13) and household income (i.e., personal income, income from other family members, state and federal service agencies) during the past month were relatively low (<italic>M</italic> = 1,471.92, <italic>SD</italic> = 1,435.51).</p>

<p>The TLFB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0145445512448192">Sobell et al., 1996</xref>) was used to assess the participants’ number of days of alcohol, marijuana, and “hard” drug use (i.e., illicit drugs other than marijuana). This measure was also used to assess how many days the children of participants were not residing in the participants’ home (i.e., in Department of Family Services custody). In doing so, a month-by-month calendar for the 4 months preceding treatment, and last 4 months of treatment, was utilized. Memorable events (e.g., birthdays, holidays) were marked on the calendars to facilitate recall. The TLFB has been psychometrically validated in several studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0145445512448192">Sobell et al., 1996</xref>).</p>

In this study, the Abuse, Loneliness, Unhappiness, Problems With Others, and Problems With Child and Self scale scores were derived. Higher scores are indicative of greater likelihood of child maltreatment potential. This scale has demonstrated extensive psychometric support (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0145445512448192">Walker &amp; Davies, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>On being referred for treatment by the CPS caseworker, participants were contacted by research assistants to complete phone screening relevant to study inclusion/exclusion criteria. If all criteria were met, eligible participants were scheduled for a pretreatment assessment in which they provided informed consent and underwent comprehensive evaluation to ensure they met study criteria. Participants were informed about the nature of the study, including that, with the exception of future harm to themselves or others, all information provided during the study would be kept confidential. A certificate of confidentiality was obtained from the Federal Government to protect disclosure of information associated with this study. Participants randomly assigned into the FBT condition were contacted by their therapists, and in-home sessions were scheduled for up to 6 months. To enhance generalizability of results, treatment providers were graduate students and advanced undergraduate students with no experience implementing FBT interventions prior to this study. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for the protection of human participants at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.</p>

<p>This family-based intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145445512448192">Donohue &amp; Allen, 2011</xref>) typically includes up to 20 sessions occurring within 6 months.

<sec id="section12-0145445512448192">
<title>EPM</title>
<p>This intervention component is designed to assist mental health treatment providers in teaching participants to (a) monitor antecedent conditions that have been found to increase risk of emergencies, (b) utilize self-control strategies to generate and imaginally practice solutions to emergencies (or potential emergencies), and (c) implement solutions to emergencies: all within the context of evidence-based treatment programs.</p>
<p>The intervention begins with the mental health provider administering the EPM Worksheet (available from the second author). This worksheet underscores a 15-item checklist of common emergencies. Participants are prompted to indicate whether each of the listed emergencies is present or may soon occur. The mental health provider reviews relevant contextual factors for endorsed items to ensure they are indeed emergencies or potential emergencies needing to be managed or prevented. For instance, needing food is only an emergency if the participant does not have the means to obtain it (e.g., money to purchase, transportation to get to the store). Thus, emergencies are complex and context specific, requiring judgment, and interpretation to determine the extent to which they warrant attention in therapy. Participants are then taught to utilize a self-control intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145445512448192">Donohue &amp; Allen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145445512448192">Donohue &amp; Azrin, 2011</xref>) that is consistent with problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145445512448192">Dzurilla &amp; Goldfried, 1971</xref>) to manage emergencies or prevent potential emergencies. Self-control includes several steps that are taught during imaginal trials. The first steps are recognition of antecedent stimuli leading to the emergency, thought stopping to engage positive focus, and stating negative consequences associated with the emergency to instill motivation. Thought stopping is utilized to assist participants in abruptly terminating thoughts that often occur when individuals are stressed in response to emergent conditions (e.g., anxious statements). Thought stopping is followed by stating several negative consequences that might result by permitting the emergent condition or impending emergent condition to continue without intervention. Indeed, family members evidencing extreme child neglect are often anxious about their ability to ameliorate emergent conditions, thereby lowering their motivation to prevent emergencies. The negative consequence review helps participants acutely improve motivation. The final steps are reviewing problem-solving steps to generate solutions to the emergent conditions, imagining successful performance of chosen solutions, and reinforcing effort. Participants also are taught to implement the generated solution(s) at home and monitor such implementation during subsequent therapy sessions until remediation.</p>
<p>Construction of the EPM item pool was developed consistent with procedures reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445512448192">Eyberg and Ross (1978)</xref>. Specifically, dangerous and unforeseen urgent conditions that disrupt behavioral treatment planning in child welfare were originated from literature reviews and group discussions with professionals. The response set (i.e., present, may soon occur) was subsequently established to facilitate rapid identification of emergencies, and potential emergencies. Because multiple emergencies are often present in the homes of substance-abusing mothers within child welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445512448192">Grella et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0145445512448192">Lussier et al., 2010</xref>), it was decided that the mothers would be able to prioritize the order and extent to which emergencies (and potential emergencies) were addressed with assistance from mental health providers. This approach is consistent with the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145445512448192">Metchikian et al. (1999)</xref> in the prevention of home accidents.</p>
<p>Treatment sessions lasted between 60 and 90 min. EPM was administered throughout treatment based on mutual agreement between the participant and mental health provider. EPM was administered when emergencies were spontaneously reported by participants or prescribed by mental health providers at the start of therapy sessions consistent with treatment planning. The number of emergencies addressed during EPM was determined based on the number of endorsed emergencies, potential danger of endorsed emergencies, treatment planning, time availability, and consumer interest.</p>

<title>Assessment of EPM protocol adherence</title>
<p>The extent to which providers implemented EPM as prescribed was assessed. For each EPM administration, service providers were prescribed to implement protocol instructions. Protocol adherence was determined by computing the number of protocol instructions reported to have been implemented during the EPM session, and dividing this number by the total number of prescribed protocol instructions. Therefore, if 13 of the 26 prescribed procedures were reported to have been implemented, 50% of the EPM protocol would have been implemented (i.e., 50% adherence to protocol). If EPM was not implemented during an FBT session, EPM protocol adherence was not assessed. All therapy sessions were audiotape recorded, and approximately 12% of the session audiotapes were assessed for protocol adherence by a blind rater. This method of protocol adherence assessment has been utilized in previous trials (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445512448192">Azrin et al., 2001</xref>), and is a reliable and valid method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0145445512448192">Sheidow, Donohue, Hill, Henggeler, &amp; Ford, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Protocol adherence</title>
<p>Overall, protocol adherence for EPM, as rated by the providers, was very high (<italic>M</italic> = 0.93, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.15). Thus, providers indicated that they implemented 93% of the EPM protocol when EPM was attempted. About 12% of the EPM sessions were randomly chosen to be additionally listened to by blind raters to permit examination of interrater reliability between EPM protocol adherence scores of the providers and blind raters. Intraclass correlations were high (all ICCs &gt; .96), indicating substantial agreement between raters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145445512448192">Barrett, 2001</xref>). Correlational analysis indicated that adherence to EPM was not associated with the average number of emergencies, or potential emergencies, reported by participants during EPM (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0145445512448192">
<title>Feasibility</title>
<p>EPM was administered 9.12 times per participant (<italic>SD</italic> = 6.21) throughout treatment, which was 56.9% of the total number of FBT sessions received by participants. Overall, EPM required only 21.23 min (<italic>SD</italic> = 20.22) to implement per administration, and participants reported 2.52 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.76) emergencies, and potential emergencies, each time EPM was administered throughout treatment. A Pearson product–moment correlation was performed to determine whether the number of emergencies/potential emergencies endorsed by participants during EPM increases the amount of time to implement EPM. As expected, the average number of minutes spent administering EPM was positively associated with the average number of emergencies/potential emergencies (present or may soon occur; <italic>r</italic> = .55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Thus, providers should expect to spend more time administering EPM when the number of emergencies and potential emergencies is determined to be relatively high.</p>

<sec id="section20-0145445512448192">
<title>Preliminary efficacy</title>
<p>To preliminarily assess efficacy of EPM, the number of EPM administrations was correlated with the average number of emergencies, or potential emergencies, endorsed by participants during EPM administration. As expected, the number of EPM administrations was negatively correlated with the average number of emergencies/potential emergencies endorsed during administration of EPM (<italic>r</italic> = −.33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), suggesting EPM may have assisted in reducing the number of emergencies and potential emergencies.</p>
<p>Utilizing the 7-point Likert-type scales, participants reported that they were <italic>very satisfied</italic> with EPM (<italic>M</italic> = 6.16, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.85), and providers reported that the participants were <italic>very compliant</italic> with EPM (<italic>M</italic> = 5.91, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.83).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Results of this study preliminarily support the use of EPM with mothers in treatment for substance use and child neglect, and have implications for the implementation of EPM within other evidence-supported therapies serving populations that are prone to evidence emergencies. Overall, strong protocol adherence by providers was maintained for EPM throughout FBT, suggesting that treatment integrity can be maintained when managing emergencies using a prescribed protocol. Protocol adherence for EPM was maintained even when the reported number of emergencies, or potential emergencies, by participants increased. Importantly, protocol adherence was high despite the limited therapeutic experience among treatment providers in this study.</p>
<p>Relevant to clinical utility, the average EPM administration usually required less than 22 min to implement, and EPM was administered in less than half of the FBT sessions for most participants. This finding is encouraging because providers were permitted to spend most of their time implementing other prescribed therapies. Moreover, when emergencies were addressed, they appeared to be relevant to treatment planning. For instance, all items representing emergencies or impending emergencies in the EPM Worksheet were endorsed at least once by at least 8% of the participants, and the number of emergencies, or potential emergencies, reported to occur during EPM administrations was expectedly associated with most of the child welfare relevant issues examined. Specifically, the average number of emergencies, or potential emergencies, reported to occur during EPM was significantly predicted by participants’ scores on measures of child abuse potential, behavior problems in their children, number of days children were removed from the home, family functioning (conflict, cohesion), and parenting stress.</p>
<p>Interestingly, substance use frequency assessed at the initiation of treatment was not associated with the number of emergencies, or potential emergencies, that were reported during treatment. However, illicit hard drug use, but not marijuana and alcohol use, during the last 4 months of treatment was significantly positively associated with the extent of emergencies/potential emergencies reported. In trying to interpret these findings, we examined the frequency of drug use during each of the 4 months prior to treatment. These observations indicated that most of the reported substance use occurred during the 3rd and 4th month prior to implementation of treatment. It appears that hard drugs (e.g., cocaine, heroin, methylenedioxymethamphetamine) may have an acute, but not predictive, relationship with emergencies. Therefore, as compared with marijuana and alcohol use, hard drug use may be especially harmful in child welfare when acutely determined. This finding is consistent with our anecdotal conversations with CPS investigators who appear to be especially concerned with the acute detrimental effects of hard drug use when determining removal of children due to child maltreatment.</p>
<p>Along a different line, the mothers’ monthly household income was the only demographic variable significantly associated (i.e., negatively) with the average number of reported emergencies or potential emergencies. This finding has considerable clinical relevance, as it suggests state, federal, and family-based financial support may assist in mitigating emergencies above and beyond the mothers’ personal monthly income, at least when emergencies are formally addressed in treatment. This finding may assist in explaining how substance-abusing mothers within the child welfare system may feel dependent on outside financial resources (e.g., abusive partners, social services) in the prevention of dangerous situations. This latter assumption is bolstered by the finding that frequency of emergencies/potential emergencies was positively associated with perceived loneliness, but not unhappiness or number of adult significant others in the home. That is, emotionally supportive systems with adequate financial resources appear to be very important in the prevention and management of emergencies.</p>
<p>Relevant to the type of emergencies that were reported to occur throughout EPM administration, court hearings, custody issues, plans to move, and bill payments were most commonly endorsed, which are all stressors that have been previously identified in mothers who present to CPSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512448192">Bolen et al., 2008</xref>). Although court hearings are not typically conceptualized as emergent situations, it warrants mention that many of the participants were visibly anxious about court hearings having the potential to result in loss of the custody of their children. It is also noteworthy that 81% of the participants indicated concern with plans to move from their home during the 6 months of treatment. This finding is particularly relevant to treatment planning, as new home environments may be associated with various factors affecting child welfare, including high levels of stress, reestablishment of social networks, changes in school for children, moving to neighborhoods where drug use is known to occur, and so on. By prescriptively addressing plans to move in therapy, treatment providers may assist in preventing these stressors, and influence the establishment of protective factors (e.g., utilizing the self-control strategy of EPM to reduce stress during the decision-making process and helping clients to find and engage in neighborhoods where drugs are more difficult to obtain and schools are highly regarded).</p>
<sec id="section28-0145445512448192">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>It should be emphasized that the number of participants in this study was relatively small. Therefore, some of the results may have been underpowered in the examination of relationships between variables. For instance, relationships between the average number of emergencies reported during each EPM administration and scores on several measures (CAPI Problems with others scale, <italic>r</italic> = .28; PSI Parent–Child Dysfunctional Interaction scale, <italic>r</italic> = .29; TLFB marijuana use prior to treatment, <italic>r</italic> = −.24, and TLFB marijuana use during treatment, <italic>r</italic> = .22) approached significance. It is also important to emphasize that there was no control group utilized in this study. Finally, generalizability to populations outside of substance abuse and child maltreatment is unclear.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>Despite study limitations, EPM appears to be a promising intervention that may be easily implemented within the context of various evidence-based intervention programs. Consumer satisfaction was reflected by participants’ reports that EPM was “very” helpful, and providers reported that participants were very “compliant” during EPM. This is important because participants were often distraught and upset during the initiation of EPM administrations due to their exposure to emergent conditions. Perhaps most important to EPM’s initial efficacy, the average number of emergencies, or potential emergencies, reported to occur throughout FBT treatment was negatively associated with the number of EPM administrations. Thus, EPM appears to be useful in decreasing the number of reported emergencies/potential emergencies and assisting CPS case management. Although controlled trials are warranted to make definitive conclusions, the self-control intervention within EPM appears to demonstrate good face validity, as it includes evidence-supported intervention components that focus on coping skill development specific to factors that have been shown to exacerbate child welfare outcomes, such as stress. Difficulties managing life emergencies have been described in various patient populations, including schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0145445512448192">Revheim et al., 2006</xref>), depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445512448192">Anderson, Goddard, &amp; Powell, 2011</xref>), borderline personality disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145445512448192">Bray, Barrowclough, &amp; Lobban, 2007</xref>), the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145445512448192">Kant, D’Zurilla, &amp; Maydeu-Olivares, 1997</xref>), developmental disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445512448192">Agran, Blanchard, Wehmeyer, &amp; Hughes, 2002</xref>), conduct disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0145445512448192">Waschbusch, Walsh, Andrade, King, &amp; Carrey, 2007</xref>), and brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145445512448192">Channon &amp; Crawford, 2010</xref>). Therefore, EPM may be a viable treatment component for interventions used in these populations. It is our hope that researchers will further examine EPM within the context of other evidence-based treatment programs in controlled trials.
