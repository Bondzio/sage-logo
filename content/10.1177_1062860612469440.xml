<abstract>
<p>The objective of this study was to determine whether the use of a knee immobilizer brace reduces patient falls associated with the recent use of femoral nerve blocks for pain control after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The authors conducted a retrospective study to investigate fall rates before and after the introduction of an immobilizer brace. The demographics of patients and total cost of care were examined. Of the 600 TKA patients who did not receive a knee immobilizer, 22 (3.7%) experienced a fall. In contrast, of the 502 patients who received knee immobilizers, only 8 patients (1.6%) fell. This difference achieves statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = .04). Given the considerable costs associated with hospital falls and the significant reduction of these falls related to knee immobilizer use shown in this study, the authors recommend that knee immobilizers be given to TKA patients as standard practice.</p>

<body>
<p>Surgeons began performing total knee replacement surgeries as early as 1968. Also known as a total knee arthroplasty (TKA), this procedure has become one of the most successful procedures in medicine. Patients can receive a TKA for many reasons, including deterioration or injury of the bones or ligaments of the knee. Arthritis (specifically osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and posttraumatic arthritis) is the top cause of chronic knee pain leading to total knee replacement surgery. The procedure involves replacing the surfaces of the knee joint with metal, polyethylene, or ceramic components. Surgeons first remove any damaged cartilage and the ends of the femur and tibia. Then they cement or fit the metal implants into both bones with a plastic spacer between them to recreate the joint. Often, the patella (kneecap) also is resurfaced. A TKA is recommended only after all other treatments, such as medicines or use of a walking support, have failed to relieve the pain or restore adequate function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612469440">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, approximately 581 000 primary TKA procedures were performed in the United States in 2009. Recent research suggests that by 2030, there will be close to 3.5 million TKAs performed annually.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612469440">2</xref></sup> Although female and white patients have the highest rates of knee replacement procedures, the burden of end-stage knee arthritis is experienced across all demographics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612469440">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most patients experience severe pain immediately following surgery, and pain control is vital to allow a patient earlier ambulation and a shorter recovery time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612469440">4</xref></sup> One recent, important change in the TKA treatment algorithm has been a shift toward utilizing femoral nerve blockade (FNB) instead of epidural analgesia for postoperative pain control. Studies show that although the 2 methods provide equivalent pain scores, the incidence of postoperative complications, including hypotension, urinary retention, and catheter-associated problems, is decreased in patients who receive FNB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612469440">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612469440">6</xref></sup> Furthermore, the rate of success in controlling postoperative pain is higher in patients who receive FNB, whereas the risk of long-term neurological complication is diminished.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612469440">6</xref></sup> Although there is conflicting evidence on whether single-shot or continuous FNB is the most efficacious delivery method,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612469440">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612469440">7</xref></sup> much evidence suggests that FNB is the optimal method for pain control in the postoperative period after TKA.</p>
<p>Despite its increased use, however, a notable problem associated with FNB is the increased rate of postoperative falls. The proposed mechanism underlying the increased propensity toward falling involves decreased quadriceps strength leading to unstable walking,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612469440">8</xref></sup> which is more significant with FNB than with epidural anesthesia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612469440">5</xref></sup> Multiple studies have detailed this association, with the incidence of falls after FNB ranging between 1.6% to 7.0%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612469440">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612469440"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612469440"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612469440">12</xref></sup> Another study reports that 0.7% of patients experienced falls in the hospital that caused complications in the recovery period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1062860612469440">13</xref></sup> With the importance of early ambulation after TKA for prevention of thromboembolic complications well described in the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1062860612469440">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1062860612469440"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612469440"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1062860612469440">17</xref></sup> there is a clear clinical benefit to decreasing the risk of falls in patients who receive FNB.</p>
<p>The economic cost of postoperative falls is substantial. Excess costs for hospital-acquired falls can be more than $4000 per hospitalization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1062860612469440">18</xref></sup> Because of the addition of patient falls to the list of hospital errors deemed to be “Never Events” by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the additional cost associated with patient falls will not be reimbursed by Medicare; private insurers are largely following this precedent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1062860612469440">18</xref></sup> Thus, the costs associated with additional imaging, increased length of hospital stay, and subsequent procedures and office visits must be defrayed by the hospital, physician, and patient.</p>
<p>One proposed solution to mitigate the risk of falls in TKA patients receiving FNB is the use of knee immobilizer braces during postoperative ambulation. Knee immobilizers have been shown to be effective in decreasing the incidence of falls and improving subjective feelings of stability and security in cancer patients with femoral neuropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1062860612469440">19</xref></sup> In this study, the authors retrospectively analyze the efficacy of a knee immobilizer (DeRoyal 24-in. knee immobilizer, foam, tripanel with contoured stays, and adjustable) in decreasing the incidence of falls in TKA patients who received FNB for postoperative analgesia.</p>
<sec id="section1-1062860612469440" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A retrospective cohort study design was used to evaluate the efficacy of a knee immobilizer device in preventing falls in patients receiving FNB for postoperative analgesia after TKA procedures. The institutional review board at the University of Virginia School of Medicine approved the study. All patients receiving elective TKA or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty at the institution between January 1, 2008, and May 1, 2011, were included in the study. The denominator for all procedures performed was determined using a hospital database, which also provided clinical and demographic data for the patient population treated at this hospital during the study.</p>
<p>A retrospective chart review of anesthesia progress notes verified that each patient included in the study did receive FNB. The use of a knee immobilizer device (DeRoyal 24-in. knee immobilizer, foam, tripanel with contoured stays, and adjustable) began at the institution on January 1, 2010, after which all patients received the brace and were instructed on its proper use as part of a standardized postoperative protocol. Thus, before 2010, TKA patients did not use a knee immobilizer brace, whereas patients undergoing a TKA during and after 2010 were given the brace. Patients who did not receive the brace were compared with those who did.</p>
<p>The primary outcome measured in this study was patient fall events, which were determined based on falls reported by the floor staff on the Orthopedic Surgery recovery floor at the medical center. These reports documented the date of the fall as well as a brief description of the circumstances surrounding the incident. The authors subsequently accessed the electronic medical records for each hospitalization and gathered demographic data, information about comorbidities (body mass index, diabetes, and hypertension), and details about the course of care.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all documentation from these hospitalizations were carefully reviewed, including but not limited to operative notes, radiology reports, and discharge summaries, to record any deviation from a normal postoperative course as a result of the fall. Specifically, evidence was documented of requirement for additional radiology, additional procedures, infection, increased length of hospital stay, rehospitalization, and other pertinent complications.</p>
<sec id="section2-1062860612469440">
<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>The proportion of postoperative falls among patients who used a knee immobilizer was compared with the proportion of falls among patients who did not use a knee immobilizer. Because of the limited number of patient falls, a Fisher exact test was used to determine the statistical significance of the data. Minitab version 15 (Minitab Inc, State College, PA) was used for this analysis.</p>

One of these patients required 6 weeks of intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Of patients who experienced a fall, 73% required additional radiology beyond the standard postoperative protocol for TKA patients, and 3 required prolonged hospitalizations beyond the standard 3- to 4-day admission because of associated complications. One patient was readmitted 7 weeks after discharge because of increased pain in the operative knee. Other complications included placement in a skilled nursing facility not otherwise scheduled, additional consults, minor bleeding and swelling events, and loosening of staples.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although the use of FNB to ease postoperative pain after TKA has increased, the increased risk of patient falls during the recovery period continues to be a major complication of this analgesic option. In this study, the authors have identified a simple, inexpensive intervention that has significantly reduced the rate of falls in the TKA patient population.</p>
<p>There are limitations to this study. Because the use of knee immobilizers at this hospital was recently initiated (in 2010), the number of available cases is small. Although the decreased fall rate achieves statistical significance, increasing the total number of cases included in the study would provide a more robust proof of efficacy. Also, the small sample size limited the ability to compare comorbidities of patients who fell before and after the introduction of the knee immobilizer. There is no reason to believe that there are significant differences between the 2 populations in this regard. In addition, the authors recognize that the use of quality assurance reports is not a scientific manner to document falls and that adverse events may have been underreported to the quality assurance system.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, however, it appears that the efficacy of the knee immobilizer in preventing falls actually may be even greater than reported. Of the 8 patients who fell after receiving the device, there is documented evidence that 2 were not wearing the immobilizer at the time of the fall. The authors accept that this is an inherent risk in prescribing these devices, and for this reason, both events were included in the statistical analysis. However, it is worth noting that if patients are adequately educated about the importance of wearing these braces, the beneficial effect may be even greater than reported.</p>
<p>As the number of TKA procedures continues to rise in the United States and as the economic paradigm of medicine shifts to force hospitals and physicians to incur the cost of unintended complications, simple interventions that decrease adverse events have a heightened relevance. Nearly 75% of all patients experiencing falls required, at a minimum, additional radiology, including several patients who needed costly head computed tomography scans or knee magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, in the most severe cases, falls led to complications such as an ankle fracture or wound dehiscence that not only increased costs but also the risk of future morbidity for the patient. One of the 2 patients who experienced wound dehiscence required a 6-week course of IV antibiotics and 3 additional radiographic studies, along with a second operation for washout and reclosure. Excess costs for hospital-acquired falls can be more than $4000 per hospitalization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1062860612469440">18</xref></sup> Given the inexpensive cost of the knee immobilizer device, combined with an absolute risk reduction of 2.1% and a relative risk reduction of 56.7%, the authors propose that the use of knee immobilizers in patients receiving FNB after TKA should become standard practice.</p>
