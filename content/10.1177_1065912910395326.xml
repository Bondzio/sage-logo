<abstract>
<p>This article presents the first systematic analysis of support for democracy in the Islamic Republic of Iran and contributes to the scholarly literature on popular views of democracy in an authoritarian regime. It reaches three main findings. First, religiosity is strongly and negatively related with support for democracy. Second, education and age indirectly affect support for democracy; their effects are mediated through satisfaction with regime performance. Third, greater dissatisfaction with the regime strongly correlates with greater demands for democratization. The data come from a survey conducted in Tehran in 2008 and the 2005 Iranian World Values Survey.</p>

<p>This article investigates support for democracy in Iran. What are the characteristics of individuals who espouse democratic ideas? The article first addresses the difficulties of conceptualizing and measuring support for democracy in authoritarian settings. It then systematically analyzes popular conceptions of and support for democracy in Iran in light of this discussion. The data come from two different types of random sampling surveys conducted in Iran: (1) a nationally representative survey conducted under the auspices of the World Values Surveys (WVS) in 2005 and (2) a survey conducted by the authors in Tehran in 2008. The main statistical analyses are based on the Tehran survey, which allows for a more detailed investigation. The article reaches three main conclusions. First, the effects of religiosity on democratic attitudes are direct and pronounced. Higher levels of religiosity are associated with higher levels of regime support and lower levels of support for democracy. Second, age and education indirectly affect support for democracy through satisfaction with regime performance. Finally, popular discontent with regime performance is strongly and positively correlated with support for democracy.</p>
<sec id="section1-1065912910395326">
<title>Measuring Support for Democracy</title>
<p>A common approach to measuring popular support for democracy in cross-national survey research is to construct an index variable based on several generic questions. WVS includes questions about the democratic performance (i.e., whether democracies are good at maintaining order, etc.) and ideals (i.e., approval of democracy and its superiority to other forms of government). When measured by these indicators, support for democracy in Muslim-majority countries is as widespread as in other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1065912910395326">Tessler 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1065912910395326">Hofmann 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1065912910395326">Norris and Inglehart 2004</xref>, 146). At the same time, a growing body of literature addresses the problems associated with measuring support for democracy in cross-national surveys. Concepts may have different meanings in different countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1065912910395326">Przeworski and Teune 1966</xref>, 552), and the assumption that democracy can be measured by the same items in every culture is not always sustainable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1065912910395326">Heath, Fisher, and Smith 2005</xref>, 320-21; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1065912910395326">Heath, Martin, and Spreckelsen 2009</xref>). Different actors may use the term for different purposes, ranging from expressing an amorphous political ideal to legitimizing their political interests. Confronting this issue is essential to avoid the problem of measurement error, “the discrepancy between respondents’ attributes and their survey response” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1065912910395326">Groves 1987</xref>, S162).</p>
<p>Measuring support for democracy in abstract terms may lead to misleading inferences given democracy’s universal appeal. The respondents are likely to evaluate democracy as a better political system than alternatives regardless of what they understand from the concept. Not surprisingly, the level of popular support for democracy is not a good predictor of a country’s level of democratic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1065912910395326">Inglehart 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1065912910395326">Fails and Pierce 2010</xref>). An alternative strategy may be to ask respondents to evaluate the level of democracy in their own country. A commonly used survey item is “On the whole, are you very satisfied, fairly satisfied, not very satisfied, or not all satisfied with the way democracy works in your country?” Yet it is not clear what this item measures. It may measure support for authorities, support for the prevailing political system, support for democracy as an ideal, a combination of these three, all of them, or none of them. The dimension it measures may vary across individuals and nations and over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912910395326">Canache, Mondak, and Seligson 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1065912910395326">Linde and Ekman 2003</xref>). A promising strategy to overcome the measurement error in cross-national studies is to design questions that inquire how respondents make sense of democracy (King et al. 2003).</p>
<p>Measuring support for democracy is particularly challenging in authoritarian settings where citizens tend to be ambivalent and confused about the meaning of democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1065912910395326">Schedler and Sarsfield 2007</xref>, 638-40). First, survey respondents may give socially desirable answers to avoid any risks in political contexts where people are not permitted to speak their mind freely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1065912910395326">Kuechler 1998</xref>, 193). Next, citizens in countries with no democratic history do not have the opportunity to compare the advantages and disadvantages associated with different regimes. From a rational choice perspective, citizens would support democracy if they think democratic regimes are better in producing economic (i.e., more growth and employment) and political (i.e., more protection for human rights) goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1065912910395326">Evans and Whitefield 1995</xref>). Yet citizens in authoritarian countries lack a performance-based criterion of democracy emanating from their experiences. They would be less likely to have “an instrumental, performance-driven attitude based on an appreciation of what democracy <italic>does</italic> (or fails to do)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1065912910395326">Mattes and Bratton 2007</xref>, 201). Third, popular understanding of and expectations from democracy would be more shallow and incoherent in authoritarian settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1065912910395326">Miller, Hesli, and Reisinger 1997</xref>). For instance, respondents who do not necessarily endorse practices associated with democratic rule such as the sanctity of human rights for unpopular dissidents may appear strong endorsers of democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1065912910395326">Gibson 1998</xref>). Similarly, citizens in authoritarian countries may have unrealistic expectations from democracy such as associating democratic rule with superior economic performance rather than free elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1065912910395326">Jamal and Tessler 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1065912910395326">Figure 1</xref> shows the relationship between popular perceptions of army takeover and the level of democracy in forty-eight countries for which data from the fifth wave of the WVS are available. The respondents were asked whether they considered army takeover when the incumbent government is incompetent as an essential characteristic of democracy. The y-axis of the figure shows the percentage of the respondents in each country who say that army takeover is an essential characteristic of democracy (giving scores from 6 to 10). The x-axis provides the ten-year average democracy score for each country, which are calculated by adding Freedom House political liberties and civil rights scores for the ten years prior to the survey year in that country. The scores that range from 0 to 120 are reversed so that higher values indicate higher levels of democratic rule. The relationship between two variables is strong (correlation = –.55). Respondents in less democratic countries are more likely to associate army takeover with democracy when they perceive government as incompetent than respondents living in democratic countries. This intriguing finding can be interpreted in two different ways. First, people under authoritarian rule may have more superficial understandings of democracy than people living in democratic regimes. They correctly argue that democracy is about people choosing their leaders in free elections and civil rights protecting people against oppression. For instance, 93 percent of respondents in Vietnam, 89 percent in Jordan, 86 percent in Egypt, and 77 percent in Iraq think that civil rights are an essential characteristic of democracy. Yet a majority of respondents in these countries also think army takeover would not necessarily undermine democratic rule. Next, people under authoritarian rule may not have a clear understanding of army rule, which may lack universal meaning. So the measurement error is not just about the concept of democracy but also about the concept of army takeover. In any case, the graph clearly reveals that measuring support for democracy in authoritarian countries needs carefully constructed measurements. In light of this discussion, the following sections offer two strategies to measure support for democracy in Iran.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>A survey was conducted in Iran under the fifth wave of the WVS in 2005. The sample size is 2,667. Detailed information about the survey including the sampling methodology and the questionnaires in Persian and English are provided at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldvaluessurveys.org">www.worldvaluessurveys.org</ext-link>. The authors conducted a survey in Tehran between December 2007 and January 2008. The sample size is 580 and includes residents of Tehran who were fifteen years and older. This urban sample represents the most dynamic, diverse, and educated segment of the Iranian population. Tehran receives immigrants from all over the country. In a sense, it provides a microcosm for studying diversity and plurality of political opinions in Iran. Moreover, a series of demonstrations following the 2009 presidential elections show the centrality of the capital to political struggles in Iran. A group of university students, who were supervised by scholars from the University of Tehran, were trained to conduct face-to-face interviews in respondents’ main residences in Persian. In this regard, this survey is different from several recent surveys that rely on telephone interviews, which create serious reliability problems in a country where face-to-face communication is central to the establishment of rapport and trust in personal relations. The survey is based on multistage area probability sampling. The Tehran municipality, with a population of around 7.5 million, is divided into five zones reflecting different income levels based on the information obtained from the Statistical Center of Iran. The number of interviews in each of the primary sampling units (PSU) was then determined according to the populations of these units. Finally, housing units and respondents were randomly chosen in PSUs.</p>

<title>Measuring Support for Democracy in Iran</title>
<p>While Iran does not qualify as a democracy according to the Freedom House and Polity IV Project, the Iranian political system combines authoritarian forms of government with democratic elements such as highly contested yet unfair elections. Moreover, public debates about the nature and merits of democratic rule have been central to Iranian politics at least since the late 1990s. Major Iranian political actors have loaded the term <italic>democracy</italic> with competing and contradictory meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1065912910395326">Gheissari and Nasr 2006</xref>). For the reformist movement that rose with the victory of Mohammad Khatami in the 1997 presidential elections, democracy signifies quest for societal and individual freedoms, political pluralism, and restrictions on the arbitrary state authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1065912910395326">Vahdat 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1065912910395326">Kamrava 2008</xref>, 151-55). The reformists claim that the current political system has major democratic deficits and demand a major overhaul of the regime’s institutional structure. In particular, they are highly critical of the extensive powers of the institutions (i.e., the office of <italic>faqih</italic>, the Guardians Council, special courts) that lack popular accountability. Yet Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, who became president in 2005 and won a second term after a highly disputed contest in 2009, is dismissive of demands for greater democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912910395326">Azimi 2008</xref>, 380-411). He claims that Iranian regime already has strong democratic credentials. This view is shared by the faqih Ali Khamenei, who argued on September 22, 2007, “[F]or thousands of years, dictators were ruling the country. . . . Nevertheless at present the most unequivocal form of democracy [<italic>mardom salari</italic>] is underway here.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1065912910395326">Khamenei, 2007</xref>) Consequently, the question of how much democracy exists in Iran is highly charged and vigorously debated in intellectual, political, and public spheres. Ultimately, responses given to this question reflect different and contested meanings of democracy among the Iranians.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912910395326">Table 1</xref> compares popular perceptions of democracy in Iran in three samples, the 2005 WVS, the 2005 WVS conducted in Tehran, and the 2008 Tehran Survey. While the question was “How democratic is your country?” in 2005, it was “How much democracy exists in the country?” in 2008. A crucial difference concerns the translation. Although democracy was translated as <italic>mardom salari</italic> (literally meaning the rule of people) in 2005, the word <italic>demokrasi</italic> was used in 2008. This semantic difference may have substantial implications. While the reformist movement uses the term <italic>demokrasi</italic>, the rulers of the Islamic Republic seek popular legitimacy by claiming that <italic>mardom salari</italic> fully exists in Iran. Despite the differences in the question and the translation, the results from the three samples are very similar. The similarity of findings from two different surveys implies replication over time and indicates reliability. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912910395326">Table 1</xref> leads to two observations: (1) a majority of respondents in the 2005 WVS sample do not consider Iran as very democratic and (2) Tehranians consider Iran less democratic than do Iranians living elsewhere.</p>

<p>Note: WVS = World Values Survey. All numbers are in percentages except for the last row. In the 2005 Iranian WVS, people were asked, “how democratic is your country?” On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 stands for <italic>not democratic at all</italic>, 10 for <italic>completely democratic</italic>.

<p>Are Iranians who argue that democracy does not exist in Iran more likely to have more developed and sophisticated understandings of democracy than Iranians who consider Iran to be democratic? <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912910395326">Table 2</xref> shows the relationship between how survey respondents in Iran relate levels of democracy in Iran with substantive (what democracy produces in terms of concrete outcomes) and procedural (how democracy works) understandings of democracy. Interestingly, substantive and procedural understandings of democracy affect people’s perception of neither democracy nor respect for human rights in Iran. According to the 2005 Iranian WVS, respondents who identify “people choose their leaders in free elections” as an essential characteristic of democracy (a procedural understanding) are not more likely to characterize Iran as less democratic than respondents who do not view free elections as an essential characteristic of democracy. Similarly, respondents who argue that “civil rights protecting people’s liberty against oppression” is an essential characteristic of democracy are not more likely to characterize Iran as less democratic than respondents who do not associate civil rights with democracy. Finally, the last rows of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912910395326">Table 2</xref> focus on an index variable combining substantive and procedural understandings of democracy based on factor analysis. Factor analysis using maximum likelihood extraction and direct oblimin rotation was conducted to identify the common dimension underlying substantive and procedural understandings of democracy in Iran. Factor analysis reveals that Iranians associate democracy with free elections, civil rights, economic prosperity, and social welfare state (the last two are examples of substantive understandings of democracy). Index validity is high as the factor analysis extracts a single unrotated factor with an Eigenvalue of 2.03 for four variables. The item loadings are .70 for “people choose their leaders in free elections,” .69 for “civil rights protecting people’s liberty against oppression,” .69 for “people receive state aid for unemployment,” and .77 for “the economy is prospering.” The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy is .78, indicating high levels of validity. A Cronbach’s α score of .80 indicates reliability. An index variable was constructed by combining these four variables. The results remained unchanged. Substantive and procedural understandings of democracy do not affect popular perceptions of democracy in Iran among respondents. Furthermore, the findings did not change when the sample was restricted to respondents from Tehran.</p>

By this logic, respondents indicate their dissatisfaction with regime performance when they characterize Iran as undemocratic and vice versa. In fact, an overwhelming majority of Iranians have positive understandings of democratic rule (e.g., according to the 2005 Iranian WVS, 91 percent of respondents characterize having a democratic system as either very good or fairly good). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1065912910395326">Table 3</xref> empirically substantiates this proposition. Respondents who do not have confidence in the government are much more likely to consider Iran as being not democratic than respondents who have confidence in the government.</p>

<p>These preliminary findings suggest that a valid measure of popular support for democracy in Iran should indicate more than dissatisfaction with the ruling regime. In other words, respondents who combine a minimum understanding of democracy with an awareness that they live under a less than fully democratic regime should be distinguished from respondents who are critical of the regime but lack an understanding of democracy. For this purpose, a measure was created based on two items. The first item is based on a single question, “In your opinion, how much democracy exists in Iran?” It ranges from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 5 (<italic>very much exists</italic>). As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1065912910395326">Table 3</xref> suggests, this question measures popular discontent with the performance of the ruling government in Iran. Hence, it is included in the statistical analysis also as a separate dependent variable. Following the practice elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912910395326">Bratton, Mattes, and Gyimah-Boadi 2005</xref>, 66-70), the second item is an open-ended question that asks respondents to offer their definition of democracy in a sentence. Around 38 percent of respondents could not offer a definition of democracy. This percentage is significantly lower than the percentage in Indonesia but higher than the percentages in most of the African countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912910395326">Bratton, Mattes, and Gyimah-Boadi 2005</xref>, 66). Two students at the University of Tehran who are native Persian speakers separately coded definitions offered by respondents into eight different criteria, which are free speech, popular rule, social justice, political equality, civic freedoms, pluralism, law and order, and the current political system. Free speech was by far the most popular response (36 percent). Intercoder reliability was very high (97.6 percent). The responses that were coded differently were assigned to categories that combined two criteria (e.g., popular rule and social justice, free speech and social justice, etc.). These two items, the level of democracy in Iran and respondent definitions of democracy, were combined to generate a binary dependent variable that measures support for democracy in Iran. Respondents who came up with positive and conventional understandings of democracy and characterized Iran as having a limited degree of, little, or no democracy were assigned a score of 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 316). Positive and conventional understandings of democracy include the first six criteria. Other respondents were assigned a score of 0 (<italic>n</italic> = 202). This binary valuable focuses on respondents who both identify a core meaning of democracy and express criticism of the current regime. It acknowledges that views that are only mildly critical of the Iranian political system can be prodemocratic as long as they exhibit a basic understanding of the term. It establishes a minimum criterion for an objective definition of democracy and does not devalue the plurality and diversity characterizing Iranian views of democracy. Besides, it differentiates respondents who espouse democratic rule from respondents who are only discontented with the government since the former group is the primary focus of this study. The latter includes respondents who do not offer positive and conventional definitions of democracy but see little or no democracy in Iran. They can be hardcore Islamists who think the ruling regime betrays its revolutionary principles. Similarly, respondents who have positive and conventional understandings of democracy but perceive Iran as democratic were also categorized as nondemocrats since they are content with the status quo and do not demand greater democratization in Iran.</p>

<title>Political Attitudes</title>
<p>It is important to make an analytical distinction among support for the ruling ideology, regime performance, and incumbent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1065912910395326">Norris 1999</xref>). An Iranian citizen can be highly critical of how the country is ruled while remaining loyal to the principles of the Islamic Republic that entail the notion of <italic>velayat-e faqih</italic>―the rule of the jurist, the Islamization of legal system, and the state enforcement of religious norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1065912910395326">Tezcür and Azadarmaki 2008</xref>). Similarly, support for the ruling ideology may not indicate that a person is content with the democratic achievements of the current political system. Citizens who are critical of the ruling ideology may come from significantly different demographic groups than citizens who demand greater democracy.</p>
<p>Satisfaction with regime performance in Iran was indirectly measured by the question of how accountable the Iranian political system is to the people in the absence of a better measurement. Support for the ruling ideology was measured by a composite variable based on four items: whether politics should be in union with religion, how important it is for the state to ensure that people’s morals are in line with religion, how important it is for the state to ensure that social order is line with Islamic laws, and whether the influence of religious leaders in politics is useful for the society (Eigenvalue of 1.72 produced by factor analysis using maximum likelihood extraction and direct oblimin rotation). The items loadings are .59, .71, .72, and .60, respectively. Cronbach’s α of .73 indicates a relatively high level of reliability. The KMO is .68, which is an acceptable level of commonness. In light of the previous findings, it is expected that satisfaction with regime performance will be negatively related with support for democracy in Iran.</p>
<list id="list1-1065912910395326" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Respondents who are satisfied with regime performance will be less likely to support democracy and be content with the level of democracy in Iran than respondents who are dissatisfied with the regime.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Negative views of the incumbent, President Ahmedinejad, may translate into more critical views of regime performance and higher support for democracy. Ahmedinejad also enjoyed the support of the most powerful political actors: the faqih, the Guardian Council, and the Pasdaran (the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps). Support for the incumbent was measured by a survey item asking the respondents to name the political actors capable of solving problems. A dummy variable measuring support for the incumbent was created by giving 1 to the responses that mentioned the president and 0 to all others. Admittedly, this is a rather weak measurement of support for the incumbent as the regime includes several autonomous power centers. At the same time, support for the ruling ideology variable is very likely to capture popular perceptions of these centers.</p>

<title>Demographic and Socioeconomic Factors</title>
<p>Scholars studying public opinion in authoritarian settings show that age and education are significantly related to political attitudes and behavior. More specifically, younger people with higher education are most likely to challenge the authoritarian system and oppose its policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1065912910395326">Geddes and Zaller 1989</xref>, 333; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1065912910395326">Chen, Zhong, and Hillard 1997</xref>, 56, 58; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1065912910395326">Zhong and Chen 2002</xref>, 707). Similarly, studies of Iranian politics argue that educated, young, and middle-class Iranians are the primary demographic group demanding greater democratization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1065912910395326">Ansari 2000</xref>, 92-94, 116-18; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1065912910395326">Brumberg 2001</xref>, 234; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912910395326">Amuzegar 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912910395326">Keddie 2003</xref>, 270; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1065912910395326">Khosrokhavar 2004</xref>, 75; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1065912910395326">Gheissari and Nasr 2006</xref>, 129; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1065912910395326">Abrahamian 2008</xref>, 186). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1065912910395326">Kurzman (2008</xref>, 321) argues, “Today’s generation of young, educated women has attitudes and behaviors that are significantly different from other Iranians.” It may be the case that young educated women are particularly supportive of democracy. To directly test these propositions, two binary variables were created: a variable that assigns 1 to respondents who are younger than thirty-five years of age with at least twelve years of education and 0 to others, and another variable assigning 1 to respondents who are female and younger than thirty-five years of age with at least twelve years of education and 0 to others. Finally, it can be argued that access to satellite TV, which increases exposure to oppositional and international broadcasts, is likely to translate into a higher awareness of and support for democracy.</p>
<list id="list3-1065912910395326" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Educated youth in general, and educated young women in particular, will be more supportive of democracy and critical of regime performance than other demographic groups.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: Citizens with access to satellite TV will be more likely to exhibit support for democracy than citizens without satellite TV.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Another hypothesis considers the impact of class identification and financial satisfaction on political attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912910395326">Keddie 2003</xref>, 291; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1065912910395326">Gheissari and Nasr 2006</xref>, 148; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1065912910395326">Abrahamian 2008</xref>, 194; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912910395326">Azimi 2008</xref>, 402). Given the lasting legacy of populism in the Islamic Republic, class differences may not necessarily result in significantly different political attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1065912910395326">Abrahamian 1993</xref>, 17, 133). Nonetheless, dissatisfaction with one’s current income is likely to lead negative evaluations of regime performance and higher support for democracy.</p>

<sec id="section6-1065912910395326">
<title>Religiosity</title>
<p>Recent scholarship argues that religious values and behavior strongly affect political orientation and voting behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1065912910395326">De La O and Rodden 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1065912910395326">Norris and Inglehart 2004</xref>, 205-7; but also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1065912910395326">Liddle and Mujani 2007</xref>). Religiosity also plays an important role in shaping popular support for democracy in the Islamic Republic. Following a long tradition in survey studies of religion, religiosity is conceptualized as having multiple dimensions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1065912910395326">Jelen and Wilcox 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1065912910395326">Olson and Warber 2008</xref>). The first dimension focuses on attitudinal aspects of religiosity, which was measured by a composite variable based on four items: self-described piety, importance of religion in one’s life, frequency of visits to the shrine of the eighth Imam in Mashhad, and importance attached to religion in addressing social problems. The shrine in Mashhad is the most popular travel destination in Iran and attracts around millions of pilgrims a year. The last item was based on the following question: “To what extent is religion capable of addressing social problems?” Factor analysis using maximum likelihood extraction and direct oblimin rotation produced a single unrotated factor for these three items with an Eigenvalue of 1.96. The items loadings are .72, .78, .55, and .73 respectively. Cronbach’s α is .78 and the KMO is .78. A second dimension concerns behavioral aspects of religiosity, which was measured as attendance at Friday prayers.</p>
<p>There are competing expectations regarding the effects of religiosity on political attitudes in Iran. On one hand, a defining characteristic of the Islamic Republic has been the association of political obedience with religious duty. The rulers of the regime demand political loyalty by reason of religious obligation. The education system promotes regime-friendly understandings of religiosity for the past thirty years. Furthermore, citizens who are discontented with the regime may become less religious in reaction to the regime’s imposition of religious norms. On the other hand, individual-level religious belief may not be a good predictor of political attitudes in contemporary Iran (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1065912910395326">Keshavarzian 2007</xref>, 251-53). New forms of religiosity have emerged, especially among the younger generation that does not necessarily have an ideological understanding of religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1065912910395326">Khosrokhavar 2007</xref>). The reform movement and religious intellectuals challenge the regime’s discourse that religious faith should be linked to unquestioning political loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1065912910395326">Jalaeipour 2003</xref>). Nonetheless, it can be reasonably expected that Iranians who are religious continue to be more satisfied with regime performance and exhibit higher support for the ruling ideology than less religious Iranians given the centrality of religious faith to the legitimacy claims of the Islamic Republic. Similarly, respondents who attend Friday prayers are more likely to be satisfied with the regime and supportive of the ruling ideology especially because participation in Friday prayers actually measures support for the regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1065912910395326">Tezcür, Azadarmaki, and Bahar 2006</xref>). Politicization of collective prayers results in exceptionally low mosque attendance rates in Iran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1065912910395326">Kazemipur and Rezaei 2003</xref>).</p>
<list id="list5-1065912910395326" list-type="simple">

<title>Statistical Analyses and Findings</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1065912910395326">Table 4</xref> shows results of the multivariate regression, each with separate dependent variables: satisfaction with regime performance, support for the ruling ideology, and satisfaction with the level of democracy in Iran. It also demonstrates the results of a logistic regression for support of democracy. Multicollinearity is not a serious problem in the analyses. Only the educated youth variable in the democracy in Iran model has a variance inflation factor score slightly more than 3 (3.02 to be precise). Available evidence provides partial support for Hypotheses 3 and 5. Statistical analyses demonstrate that females, educated respondents, educated youth, and respondents dissatisfied with their income are less satisfied with regime performance than other demographic groups. Consistent with the theoretical expectations and previous findings, satisfaction with regime performance is positively associated with support for the ruling ideology and satisfaction with democracy in Iran and negatively with support for democracy. Since female, young, and educated respondents have lower levels of satisfaction with regime performance, they may be more supportive of democracy. Similarly, the effects of financial satisfaction on attitudes toward democracy may be meditated through its influence on satisfaction with regime performance. The effects of satellite TV access on attitudes toward democracy are more straightforward. Respondents who have access to satellite TV are less satisfied with the level of democracy in Iran and are more supportive of democracy than are other respondents.</p>

<p>One of the most consistent findings in the statistical analyses concerns the effects of religiosity on political attitudes. Religious respondents who frequently attend Friday prayers exhibit higher levels of satisfaction with regime performance and the level of democracy in Iran and support for ruling ideology than do respondents who do not participate in prayers. Furthermore, more religious people are less likely to be supportive of democracy. These findings support Hypothesis 6.</p>
<p>Respondents who are dissatisfied with regime performance are also more critical of the ruling ideology, more dissatisfied with the level of democracy in Iran, and more supportive of democracy than other respondents. This finding corroborates <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1065912910395326">Table 3</xref> and is consistent with Hypothesis 1. It can be reasonably suggested that the nature of the causal relationship between dissatisfaction with regime performance and democratic attitudes is bidirectional. Respondents who support democracy are more likely to be critical of the regime than respondents who do not view democratic rule positively. At the same time, greater levels of dissatisfaction with regime performance would make citizens engage with alternative political ideals. The failure of the regime in delivering its promises would lead to the proliferation of democratic values at the societal level. In fact, the trajectory of the reformist movement is a primary example of how disillusioned and politically marginalized former revolutionaries transformed into agents of greater democratization beginning in the early 1990s. Furthermore, respondents who oppose the ruling ideology are also critical of regime performance and the level of democracy in Iran. Finally and expectedly, respondents who have positive evaluations of the incumbent Ahmedinejad are also more likely to be supportive of regime performance and ruling ideology than respondents who are critical of him. Yet support for the incumbent is not directly associated with less support for democracy.</p>
<p>The findings regarding gender, age, education, and financial satisfaction necessitate an analysis that differentiates between direct and indirect effects of these demographic variables on support for democracy. These variables seem to indirectly affect support for democracy through their effects on satisfaction with regime. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1065912910395326">Table 5</xref> presents results from a logit model that estimates direct and indirect effects of different demographic characteristics on support for democracy controlling for other independent variables (for more information on this model, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1065912910395326">Buis 2010</xref>). Consistent with the previous findings, none of the direct effects are significant. Indirect effects of education, educated youth, and financial dissatisfaction are significant. To elaborate, respondents with only a middle school or less education (low education category) would have 1.21 times higher odds of supporting democracy if they had the same level of dissatisfaction with regime performance as respondents with at least twelve years of education (high education category). While the respondents in high education category would have 1.71 times higher odds of supporting democracy than respondents in low education category if they exhibited similar levels of dissatisfaction with regime performance, this effect is not significant. This indicates that education does not have any direct effect on support for democracy and its effect is mediated through satisfaction with regime performance. Similarly, groups other than educated youth would have 1.13 times higher odds of supporting democracy if they had the same level of dissatisfaction with regime performance as educated youth. Finally, respondents who are financially very satisfied would have 0.82 times higher odds of supporting democracy if they had the same level of dissatisfaction with regime performance as financially nonsatisfied respondents.</p>

To address this issue, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1065912910395326">Table 6</xref> shows the results of three multivariate regressions based on the Iranian WVS, each with separate dependent variables: satisfaction with regime performance, satisfaction with the level of democracy and support for democracy. As in the previous analysis, the support for democracy variable combines both positive and conventional understandings of democracy and the level of democracy in Iran. As discussed above, Iranians associate democracy with four characteristics. Two are procedural—free elections, civil rights; two are substantive—economic prosperity and social welfare state. Respondents who identify these factors as essential characteristics of democracy and are mildly or strongly critical of the level of democracy in Iran (scores of 7 or lower on a scale of 1–10) were assigned a score of 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 1,872). All other respondents were assigned a score of 0 (<italic>n</italic> = 747).</p>

<p>Two variables were used to measure attitudinal religiosity. First, a composite variable based on the four items was created: whether mosques give adequate answers to moral, family life, spiritual, and social problems. Factor analysis using maximum likelihood extraction and direct oblimin rotation produces a single unrotated factor for these four items with an Eigenvalue of 1.90. The items loadings are .76, .70, .68, and .60 respectively. Both Cronbach’s α and KMO are .78. Second, the question of confidence in mosques was included in the analysis. An item measuring the frequency of attendance in mosque prayers was used to measure behavioral religiosity. Satisfaction with regime performance was measured by the confidence in the government. The influence of religious leaders in governmental affairs is a proxy variable to measure support for the ruling ideology. Finally, a dummy variable that assigns 1 to interviews conducted in Tehran and 0 to interviews elsewhere was generated.</p>
<p>The WVS survey was administrated from June 1 to August 1, 2005, around two and a half years before the Tehran survey was completed and during and in the immediate aftermath of the presidential elections that resulted in the victory of Ahmedinejad. Despite this difference in the timing of the surveys and significant differences in the questionnaire and measurements, statistical results from both surveys are remarkably similar. Expectedly, higher levels of satisfaction with regime performance strongly correlate with lower levels of support for democracy and higher levels of satisfaction with the level of democracy in Iran. The coefficients of gender, age, education, and class identification are insignificant as direct predictors of support for democracy. As in the Tehran survey, higher levels of education translate into higher levels of discontent with regime performance, which is in turn associated with higher support for democracy. Partially different from the Tehran survey results, lower levels of financial satisfaction directly translate into less satisfaction with democracy in Iran and higher support for democracy. Attitudinal religiosity and mosque attendance are significantly and negatively correlated with support for democracy and significantly and positively with satisfaction with regime performance and democracy in Iran. Finally, support for the ruling ideology and endorsement of religious leaders’ influence are associated with higher satisfaction with regime performance and lower support for democracy. The nationwide analysis also reveals an important distinction between Tehran and the rest of Iran. It seems that dissatisfaction with regime performance spreads out evenly in the country. Yet Iranians residing in larger cities, especially in Tehran, are more likely to espouse prodemocratic attitudes than Iranians elsewhere.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Measuring support for democracy in authoritarian contexts presents unique challenges and necessitates more nuanced approaches to survey data than those usually found in the literature. Particularly important is the mismatch between the conventional understandings and popular perceptions of democracy. Meanings attached to democracy may exhibit significant cross-cultural and within-culture differences. If researchers remain insensitive to these differences, they will likely reach invalid conclusions about popular support for democracy in authoritarian regimes. This article, which presents the first systematic study of democratic attitudes in Iran, directly addresses the complexity of popular support for democracy. The major similarities between factors associated with satisfaction with the level of democracy in Iran and support for democracy increase the reliability of the findings. The statistical analyses of the Tehran survey warrant the conclusion that Iranians who are younger, are more educated, are financially less satisfied, are less religious, and have satellite TV access are more supportive of democracy than are Iranians who are older, are less educated, are financially satisfied, are more religious, and do not have satellite TV. The effects of age, education, and financial satisfaction over support for democracy are indirect and are mediated through satisfaction with regime performance. These findings, which are supported by the analyses of the WVS sample, can be elaborated in several points.</p>
<p>First, religiosity emerges as a primary cleavage in Iranian politics. Greater levels of religiosity are associated with lower support for democracy and more satisfaction with the level of democracy in Iran, regime performance, and the ruling ideology. The direction of causality can be interpreted in two ways. On one hand, Iranian citizens who are critical of the ruling regime may become less religious over time in reaction to the politicization of religion. On the other hand, secular Iranian citizens may be more susceptible to democratic discourses than are religious citizens given their already weak commitments to the ruling regime. Moreover, religiosity may attenuate citizens’ criticisms of the regime’s shortcomings and failings. Most likely both of these factors mutually reinforce each other and make religion a central cleavage in contemporary Iranian politics. Further research can investigate how religiosity affects voting behavior (e.g., in the presidential elections) controlling for demographic factors. In addition, ethnographic studies can offer rich descriptions of how religiosity interacts with political attitudes and identify the causal mechanisms characterizing these interactions.</p>
<p>Second, the statistical results provide support for the conventional wisdom that educated youth are particularly dissatisfied with regime performance. In Tehran, educated young people exhibit greater discontent with regime performance, which is strongly associated with higher levels of support for democracy. In this sense, educated people in general, and educated youth in particular, become advocates of greater democratization not because they naturally hold more democratic views but primarily because they tend to be more critical of the ruling regime. Moreover, geographical location clearly shapes political attitudes of Iranians. The findings from the nationally representative WVS sample suggest that support for democracy is considerably higher in Tehran than in provinces even if geographical location does not affect satisfaction with the level of democracy in Iran. This may reflect the large scope of civic activism and political unrest in Tehran. In addition, the positive impact of satellite TV on support for democracy can be interpreted in two ways. On one hand, it may be a proxy for some unobserved variables in the sense that Iranians already committed to democracy are also more likely to obtain satellite TV. This reasoning is plausible especially since satellite TV access is not significantly associated with regime dissatisfaction. On the other hand, it may directly shape political attitudes as Iranians watching satellite TV programs are exposed to progressive ideas calling for greater democracy in the country.</p>
<p>Finally, popular perceptions of regime performance strongly correlate with democratic attitudes. Satisfaction with the level of Iranian democracy serves as a proxy variable for satisfaction with what the regime delivers. This finding and the negative relationship between financial satisfaction and support for democracy are very similar to the findings in other developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912910395326">Geddes 1999</xref>, 140). As an authoritarian regime experiences economic problems and fails to meet the needs of its citizens, it is likely to confront greater demands for democratization. In Iran, citizens who are critical of regime performance are more likely to espouse prodemocratic views than citizens who are content with what the regime delivers. As briefly mentioned above, the direction of causality is likely to be bidirectional. Citizens with higher levels of awareness and support for democratic rule are naturally more likely to be more critical of the regime than citizens with weak democratic commitments. At the same time, poor regime performance is likely to transform popular preferences and generate greater demands for democratic rule among Iranian citizens in Tehran. There is more support for the second causal dynamic since young and educated Iranians, who are generally perceived as the main agents of progressive political change, exhibit more support for democracy than older and less educated Iranians only if they are dissatisfied with regime performance. Education does not directly cultivate prodemocratic views but contributes to a more critical attitude toward political authority, consistent with one of the core expectations of modernization theory.</p>
