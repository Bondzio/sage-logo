<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Colorectal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) resections may represent a major advancement in minimally invasive surgery. The feasibility of a transrectal NOTES approach to colorectal surgery has been demonstrated in experimental settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612452346">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612452346"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612452346"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612452346"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612452346"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612452346">6</xref></sup> The combination of hybrid transrectal and the transabdominal approach takes advantages of both techniques in performing the critical steps, such as left colon mobilization, specimen extraction, and anastomosis construction. Additionally, in laparoscopic ultra-low rectal resections, the mobilization of the distal rectum, deep in the pelvis, is challenging because of the difficult exposure and might benefit from a combined transanal transabdominal approach, as demonstrated by Marks et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612452346">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sylla et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612452346">8</xref></sup> and more recently, Zorron et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612452346">9</xref></sup> have presented some of the few available clinical experiences in oncologic patients with the transrectal NOTES total mesorectal excision (TME) using “hybrid” procedures involving some degree of laparoscopic assistance.</p>
<p>Sylla et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612452346">8</xref></sup> used a transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) platform to enter the presacral plane, mobilize the mesorectum, and continue the posterior dissection cephalad until the visualization and the division of the peritoneal reflection with penetration in the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneal attachments of the rectosigmoid were divided using flexible bipolar and Thermaseal device.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612452346">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Zorron et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612452346">9</xref></sup> performed a TME through a perirectal pelvic retroperitoneal approach. The access to the perirectal extraperitoneal space was gained through a posterior transrectal viscerotomy using alternatively rigid and flexible instruments. In one case, a transanal single port device (Triport, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was used as surgical platform.</p>
<p>The main advantage of any retroperitoneal surgical approach is the prevention of unnecessary bowel manipulation, the reduction of surgical trauma, and also (especially for colorectal surgery) operation in the precise embryological fusion plane required for oncological resection, complete mesocolic preservation, and retroperitoneal structure identification (ureteric and gonadal vessel, lymph nodes).</p>
<p>Our concept aims to switch this approach to colonic resection and mobilization using an anterior lateral entry point to the perirectal retroperitoneum following embryologic and oncologic planes. This technique was named perirectal oncologic gateway for retroperitoneal endo-scopic single-site surgery (PROGRESSS).</p>
<p>In this concept, the access to the mesenteric vessels and lymph nodes is gained through a perirectal retroperitoneal approach, with rigid instruments (straight or roticulating), standard flexible endoscopes or a customary endoscopic surgical platform (IsisScope, Karl Storz, Tüttlingen, Germany) passed through a robust transanal endoscopic device (Transanal Endoscopic Operation TEO, Karl Storz, Tüttlingen, Germany) allowing for vascular control and lymph node retrieval without entering the abdominal cavity.</p>
<p>The aim of this preliminary study was to assess the feasibility and reproducibility of a transrectal, retroperitoneal approach to the left colon and mesenteric vessels in an acute porcine model. Additionally, we aimed to assess the interest of the combined use of a rigid transanal platform (TEO), which may accommodate a flexible endoscopic surgical platform or a conventional endoscope to improve the visualization of the transanal operative field once the dissection has been pursued beyond the level of the promontory. The acute model was selected for 2 reasons: First, the primary aim was to assess the ability to achieve a complete mobilization of the sigmoid colon by a purely retroperitoneal approach and not to assess the anastomosis in a survival model, and second, because of the terminal vascular anatomy of the distal colon and rectum in the pig, the rectosigmoid junction may suffer from ischemia in case of high vascular ligation.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Eight healthy pigs (6 males, 2 females, weighing from 30 to 70 kg) were used in this feasibility acute study.</p>
<p>All animals used in the experimental laboratory were managed according to French laws for animal use and care and to the directives of the European Community Council (number 86/609/EEC).</p>
<p>Pigs were fasted for 48 hours before surgery. Premedication by intramuscular injection of ketamine (7 mL) and azaperone (3 mL) (Stresnil, Janssen-Cilag, Belgium) was administered 1 hour before surgery. Induction was achieved by intravenous propofol (10 mL/30 kg) combined with pancuronium (2 mL). Anesthesia was maintained with 2% isoflurane. Intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis (Cephalexin 1 g) was administered. Bowel preparation by rectal enema was performed on table.</p>

<title>Step II: Perirectal retroperitoneal approach</title>
<p>The retroperitoneal perirectal space was entered with a single-channel endoscope (Karl Storz, Tüttlingen, Germany) through a single anterior lateral (2 o’clock, lithotomy position; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612452346">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350612452346">3</xref>) transrectal viscerotomy.

<title>Step IV: Rectosigmoid dissection</title>
<p>After vascular ligation, rectal dissection was then accomplished introducing a novel TEO device with a bespoke aperture to introduce the IsisScope or a conventional endoscope, thereby allowing for the dissection to be carried on higher than the limited reach of the TEO endoscope instruments. After circumferentially scoring the rectum below the purse-string, a 360° rectotomy was performed using a 5-mm Ligasure Advance system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612452346">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1553350612452346">8</xref>). The rectum was dissected transanally toward the anterior and lateral presacral space without opening the pouch of Douglas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612452346">Figure 2E</xref>). Once the rectal stump was freed, the distal end was closed into an EndoCatch. To allow visualization at this point up to the promontory, an endoscope was introduced into the TEO device through a specifically modified faceplate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612452346">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1553350612452346">9</xref>). Mobilization was continued until the root of the sigmoid, before the end of the spiral descending colon. The distal end of the rectum was then pushed into the peritoneal cavity to expose the mesosigmoid root. At this point, the peritoneal cavity was accessed by opening the pouch of Douglas dividing the peritoneal attachments.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The procedure was successfully completed and the IMA and IMV were correctly identified and controlled in all cases. The mean operative time was 158.33 minutes (SD = 45.78). In 3 cases, the peritoneum was punctured, but this did not affect the possibility to accomplish the retroperitoneal mobilization and required placement of a transabdominal Veress needle. One or two mesenteric lymph nodes were retrieved per pig. At laparoscopy, no further mobilization of the exteriorized specimen was possible in 7 out of 8 cases. In one case, the sigmoid colon was mobilized extending the dissection into the pelvis until reaching the plane created by the PROGRESSS approach. The saline injection before the creation of the working space was unnecessary to safely access the retroperitoneum.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The transanal NOTES approach to colorectal resections is a very appealing minimal access technique that avoids surgical trauma to the abdominal wall. The combination of transanal and transabdominal approach is helpful in performing difficult mobilization deep in the pelvis and laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME), especially for bulky tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612452346">10</xref></sup> The transanal rectal oncologic dissection in the “Holy” plane is challenging because of specific anatomical features (fusion of the presacral fascia and the fascia propria of the rectum) and several limitations in visualization and instrumentation.</p>
<p>To overcome these shortcomings, we have investigated the use of the TEO technology as a tool to facilitate the minimally invasive approach for left-sided NOTES colectomies in the experimental setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612452346">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>This approach relies on the use of a 4-cm diameter rectoscope of various lengths with a dedicated optical system, which allows for the passage of various rigid, straight, and curved instruments.</p>
<p>These experiences showed that when the dissection is pursued at the level of the promontory or beyond, the TEO dedicated optic cannot achieve a good visualization. This problem is even more obvious after entering the abdominal cavity with a blind angle of view.</p>
<p>Based on this observation, in collaboration with Karl Storz, a modified version of the original TEO faceplate was developed at our institute that now permits the introduction of a latest generation of flexible endoscopic platforms (ie, the IsisScope) in the TEO device. This makes it possible to closely follow the dissection and/or to accomplish resections/sutures higher than the reach of TEO instruments.</p>
<p>In addition, transanal NOTES procedures share some of the challenges of the laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS): (<italic>a</italic>) the in-line view provided by working instruments coming in the operative field from the same entry point of the optical system. (<italic>b</italic>) a progressively reduced surgical triangulation as the target of dissection progresses further, (<italic>c</italic>) the limited ability to retract and expose, and (<italic>d</italic>) the need for the surgeon to cross hands to reduce external conflicts between instruments. The IsisScope has been conceived to overcome these challenges. This multiple channel working device provides surgeons the perception of operating with “both hands” and recreates the basic principles of surgical manipulation and triangulation, in an endoluminal or transluminal environment, while simultaneously reducing external conflicts observed with other systems.</p>
<p>Using a transanal endoscopic platform or a flexible endoscope, Zorron et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612452346">9</xref></sup> performed a transanal posterior retrorectal approach for a NOTES TME procedure recently in 2 patients with rectal cancer.</p>
<p>Similar to this concept, our idea was a 2-staged procedure for an anterior lateral retroperitoneal transrectal oncologic access for lymph node retrieval and control of mesenteric vessels, and a posterior rectal mobilization from cranial to caudal in the “Holy” plane described by Heald et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612452346">11</xref></sup> but without entering the abdominal cavity.</p>
<p>The main difference is that the viscerotomy to access the retroperitoneal perirectal space is anterior lateral in the PROGRESSS technique. We believe that this entry point would give a better angle to find the “Holy” plane that lies above Waldeyer’s fascia formed by the fusion of the fascia propria and the presacral fascia.</p>
<p>Another specificity of the PROGRESSS approach is that, at least in the pig model, it allows for a higher mobilization of the mesocolon and vascular control of caudal mesenteric vessels and lymph node harvesting by a totally retroperitoneal approach, using pneumodissection and endoscopically guided dissection with carbon dioxide insufflation before creating any access to the peritoneal cavity or inserting any transanal device. In addition, the posterior aspect of the mid-rectum can also be mobilized by a twin PROGRESSS approach (The “lobster” variant) by entering the perirectal retroperitoneum through a twin 2 o’clock–10 o’clock viscerotomy.</p>
<p>The interest of the PROGRESSS approach goes beyond surgical resection. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of localized resection in early rectal cancer through transanal endoscopic platforms with similar cure rates and a significantly lower morbidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350612452346">12</xref></sup> The problem with this approach is the impossibility of oncologic staging with lymph node harvesting.</p>
<p>Zerz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350612452346">13</xref></sup> in 2006 assessed the feasibility of a 2-staged procedure involving a dorsal posterior extraperitoneal pelviscopy in 11 consecutive patients with early-stage carcinoma of the lower third of the rectum. The pelvis was entered via the perineum and the operative space in the perirectal retroperitoneum was created with a dilating balloon, and a posterior endoscopic mesorectal resection was performed after transanal endoscopic excision of the tumor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350612452346">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, PROGRESSS access may be part of a TEM to achieve a minimally invasive oncologic staging with nodal status evaluation and, if need be, sentinel node detection in rectal or colon neoplasms as previously demonstrated by our group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612452346">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350612452346">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>One may argue about the challenge of the transrectal viscerotomy closure when PROGRESSS access is used solely for NOTES lymph node retrieval. In such cases, viscerotomy cannot be included in the specimen to be resected and its closure must be addressed.</p>
<p>Different solutions have been proposed to close the rectal viscerotomy such as placement of endo-loops and/or endo-clips,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350612452346">16</xref></sup> manual suture with TEO instruments, and linear stapler.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612452346">17</xref></sup> We have recently proposed a novel stapled technique to close the viscerotomy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612452346">4</xref></sup> by using an EEA hemorrhoid circular stapler (Covidien) in the setting of a transrectal NOTES sigmoidectomy, and we found it beneficial over a manual suture through a TEO device.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350612452346">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another point that could be raised is the risk of peritoneal contamination after creating the transrectal NOTES access during rectosigmoid mobilization. This issue has been assessed by our group in the experimental<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350612452346">18</xref></sup> and in the clinical setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350612452346">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350612452346">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although we have previously shown that intraperitoneal bowel division (for either intraperitoneal anastomosis or natural orifice specimen extraction) results in a 100% rate of peritoneal contamination (compared with an 80% contamination rate for stapled bowel transection), there is no resultant increase in infective complications.</p>
<p>Another issue that needs to be carefully evaluated is the risk of local recurrence by a PROGRESSS approach. Using the transanal transabdominal technique, Marks et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612452346">7</xref></sup> have demonstrated no increase in recurrence rates in more than 100 patients. We hope that the approach itself would not increase the risk of recurrence by strictly complying with the principles of safe oncological surgery.</p>
<p>The last point that calls for attention is the theoretical risk of metastatic seeding while retrieving potentially invaded lymph nodes without adequate protection systems. Since the retroperitoneal space communicates with the peritoneal cavity, it provides one large continuous space in which infectious<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1553350612452346">21</xref></sup> and neoplastic processes may spread.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1553350612452346">22</xref></sup> It would be mandatory to retrieve lymph nodes into specific devices (eg, wound protector or one-way extraction bag) to reduce the risk of diffuse carcinomatosis.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>PROGRESSS for left-sided colonic resection and mobilization using both flexible and rigid surgical endoscopic platforms was feasible and reproducible in an acute porcine model. This technique could well be a step toward pure NOTES rectal TME and/or sigmoidectomy. The possibility to retrieve mesenteric lymph nodes through a minimally invasive extraperitoneal access may provide an interesting staging procedure to complete transanal full-thickness resection of rectal tumors. The next logical step is to evaluate the technique in a human cadaver model.</p>
