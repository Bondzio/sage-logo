<abstract>
<p>Enacting social support and job control can enable effective problem solving and protect well-being. The authors operationalized social support used for problem solving as “discussing problems with others to solve problems” (DIS-SP) and job control used to solve problems as “changing aspects of work activities to solve problems” (CHA-SP). Analyses of experience sampling data (N = 191) revealed that DIS-SP was inversely associated with subsequent negative affect and that there were curvilinear relationships between CHA-SP and subsequent levels of negative affect, fatigue, and cognitive failure, such that only high levels of CHA-SP were associated with lower levels of negative affect, fatigue, and cognitive failure. Fatigue was inversely associated with subsequent levels of DIS-SP and CHA-SP. Contrary to expectations, there was a positive association between cognitive failure and subsequent CHA-SP.</p>

<p>Psychological well-being has well established relationships with job control and social support (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206311430262">de Lange, Taris, Kompier, Houtman, &amp; Bongers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206311430262">Humphrey, Nahrgang, &amp; Morgeson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206311430262">Nahrgang, Morgeson, &amp; Hofmann, 2011</xref>). A premise of the demands-control-support model (DCSM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206311430262">Karasek &amp; Theorell, 1990</xref>) is that job control and workplace social support are beneficial for well-being because workers can actively use job control and social support to solve problems. There are few studies that directly assess this premise and no studies that examine the antecedents of using job control or social support to solve problems. The present study is the first to examine reciprocal relationships between actively using control and support to solve problems and psychological well-being. The present study is concerned with workers’ agency and job design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311430262">Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2008</xref>). Specifically, the present study contributes to debates concerning the emergent processes through which workers’ skills and abilities are involved in job design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311430262">Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2008</xref>), whether there are different consequences for workers’ acting individually or collaboratively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206311430262">Leana, Appelbaum, &amp; Sevchuk, 2009</xref>), and daily antecedents and consequences of dynamic aspects of job design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206311430262">Grant &amp; Parker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311430262">Semmer, Grebner, &amp; Elfering, 2004</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-0149206311430262">
<title>Control, Support, Problem Solving, and WorkerAgency in Job Design</title>
<p>Job demands, job control, and social support are specific features or characteristics of jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206311430262">Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311430262">2008</xref>). In the DCSM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206311430262">Karasek and Theorell (1990)</xref> proposed that job control and social support can offset the adverse consequences of high job demands on well-being because job control and social support can be used to solve problems caused by high job demands. Job control relates to the individual’s authority to make decisions concerning his or her job, such as decisions concerning when and how to execute tasks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206311430262">Breaugh, 1985</xref>). In the DCSM, support is defined as helpful interactions with others at work. The DCSM explains some of the benefits of job control and social support in terms of their instrumental purposes in problem solving. It is possible that there are reciprocal relationships between psychological well-being and using job control and social support to solve problems. This is because decreases in aspects of well-being closely associated with levels of activation and cognitive functioning may reduce personal energetic and cognitive resources. To prevent further depletion of personal resources, workers may become inhibited from using job control and social support for problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206311430262">Hobfoll, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In the DCSM, it is not the just the availability of job control or social support that is related to problem solving. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206311430262">Karasek and Theorell (1990)</xref> describe workers as active in enacting the characteristics of their work for the specific purposes of problem solving. Moreover, executing control, eliciting support, and problem solving involve the application of cognitive skills, social skills, and knowledge, which links how workers use their skills and knowledge closely to the outcomes of job characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311430262">Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2008</xref>). There are other explanations of how job control and social support can influence well-being (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206311430262">Cohen &amp; Wills, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311430262">Ganster &amp; Fusilier, 1989</xref>). In the job design literature, the dominant alternative explanation to that proposed by the DCSM relates to the motivating potential of job control and social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311430262">Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206311430262">Parker &amp; Ohly, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Most research on the DCSM has relied on global assessments of stable levels of job control and social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206311430262">de Lange et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0149206311430262">Häusser, Mojzisch, Niesel, &amp; Schulz-Hardt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206311430262">Humphrey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206311430262">Nahrgang et al., 2011</xref>), without assessing whether workers are active in using job control or social support in any given episode of problem solving. Global assessments of stable levels of job control and social support are problematic for three reasons. First, job characteristics are not stable but also have dynamic components (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311430262">Semmer et al., 2004</xref>). Second, there is evidence that workers are active in enacting and shaping their job characteristics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206311430262">Berg, Wrzesniewski, &amp; Dutton, 2010</xref>). Third, it is not possible to determine from just assessing levels of job control and social support if job control and social support are beneficial for instrumental purposes or for other reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206311430262">Daniels, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>There is empirical evidence that job characteristics vary from day to day, or even within days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206311430262">Daniels, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311430262">Semmer et al., 2004</xref>). There are methodological and theoretical reasons why within- and between-day variation in job characteristics is not trivial variation. The main methodological reason is that assessing short-term changes in job characteristics and related phenomena reduces recall bias and so increases measurement accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206311430262">Tennen, Affleck, Coyne, Larsen, &amp; DeLongis, 2006</xref>). Theoretically, daily variation at work plays an important role in the experience of work. Within the working day, people experience episodes or events that become salient if they have implications for attaining or disrupting goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311430262">Beal, Weiss, Barros, &amp; MacDermid, 2005</xref>), and job design concerns the day-to-day activities of workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311430262">Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2008</xref>). Assessing how people self-regulate the impact of demands during the working day may give a better picture of the specific actions workers can take to protect their well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311430262">Semmer et al., 2004</xref>), what influences changes in job characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206311430262">Fritz &amp; Sonnentag, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206311430262">Kühnel, Sonnentag, &amp; Bledow, in press</xref>), and short-term consequences of changes in job design, that presumably accumulate into longer term outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311430262">Semmer et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>One reason for dynamism in job characteristics is that workers are active in shaping how the characteristics of their work come to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206311430262">Grant &amp; Parker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311430262">Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2008</xref>). One line of research on “job crafting” has examined spontaneous, unsupervised, and worker-initiated changes to stable aspects of job design so that workers can achieve higher order goals (e.g., to make work more interesting; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0149206311430262">Berg, Grant, &amp; Johnson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206311430262">Berg, Wrzesniewski, et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311430262">Wrzesniewski &amp; Dutton, 2001</xref>). However, workers can be active in shaping how they experience work on a day-to-day basis by enacting the characteristics of their work, through for example executing job control or eliciting support over the shorter term for instrumental purposes such as problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311430262">Daniels, Boocock, Glover, Hartley, &amp; Holland, 2009</xref>). Although enacting job characteristics over the short term may or may not reflect aspects of job design embedded in organizational or social processes, workers enacting job characteristics reflects processes that are self-initiated and agentic, that can be unsupervised and spontaneous, and that could potentially lead to longer term changes in work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206311430262">Daniels, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The idea that workers are active in enacting job characteristics for specific purposes is also reflected in the distinction between coping function and coping behavior made in the coping literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206311430262">Skinner, Edge, Altman, &amp; Sherwood, 2003</xref>). Coping function is the target of coping. In relation to problem-solving demands, a function might be problem solving. An alternative function might be expressing affect to regulate affective reactions to problem-solving demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206311430262">Daniels, Beesley, Cheyne, &amp; Wimalasiri, 2008</xref>). Coping behavior refers to those actions that enable coping function to have its desired effect. For example, a worker may execute job control by rescheduling work activities to spend time to reach a solution to a problem or may reschedule work activities to disengage from the problem and regulate affective reactions to that problem. It is therefore important to differentiate coping behavior from coping function because the same behavior can be used to fulfill several functions and because different functions fulfilled by the same behavior may have different effects. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206311430262">Zellars and Perrewé (2001)</xref> found that it was not workplace supportive conversations per se that were associated with well-being but rather the content of the supportive conversations. Moreover, a single function can be fulfilled by multiple behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206311430262">Skinner et al., 2003</xref>), so that the same function may have different effects according to the behavior used to fulfill the function. Furthermore, job characteristics, like social support and job control, may also be intrinsically motivating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311430262">Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206311430262">Parker &amp; Ohly, 2008</xref>). Therefore, it is important to determine the specific purpose for which job control is executed or social support elicited to rule out explanations based on enacting these job characteristics for other purposes or explanations based on the motivating potential of thesejob characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311430262">Daniels et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In spite of research on daily variations in work characteristics and enacting job control and social support for problem solving, several gaps exist. One gap relates to establishing short-term antecedents and consequences of the dynamic aspects of job design. There have been studies on the short-term consequences of daily variation in job characteristics and well-being (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206311430262">Xanthopoulou, Bakker, Demerouti, &amp; Schaufeli, 2009</xref>), and some studies have focused on daily variation in executing control or eliciting support for specific purposes and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206311430262">Daniels et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311430262">Daniels et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206311430262">Daniels &amp; Harris, 2005</xref>). To our knowledge, no studies of daily variation in job characteristics have examined daily antecedents of job characteristics in general, and worker-initiated variations in job characteristics in particular.</p>
<p>Another gap relates to the consequences of different ways of enacting the content of work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206311430262">Leana et al. (2009)</xref> found that initiating changes to the content of work undertaken individually was related to job dissatisfaction, but collectively initiating changes to work was inversely related to job dissatisfaction. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206311430262">Wrzesniewski, Berg, and Dutton (2010)</xref> reason that individually initiated changes to the content of work can lead to conflict with others. Executing job control to solve problems may be considered a more individual way of enacting job characteristics because it involves personal autonomy over decisions concerning work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206311430262">Breaugh, 1985</xref>). Eliciting support to solve problems may be considered a more collective way of enacting job characteristics because it involves interaction with others. In line with Leana et al., two studies have found beneficial effects of eliciting social support to solve problems, and these studies have indicated beneficial effects of executing control to solve problems too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311430262">Daniels et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0149206311430262">Daniels &amp; Harris, 2005</xref>). Another study found a mixed pattern of linear effects of executing control to solve problems on well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206311430262">Daniels et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, it is unclear if, in the short term, individually enacted job characteristics, such as executing control, are more or less beneficial than more collectively enacted job characteristics, such as eliciting support.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0149206311430262">
<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>All the hypotheses relate to the experience of work over short periods (i.e., within the working day), given the importance of examining specific periods within working days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311430262">Beal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311430262">Semmer et al., 2004</xref>). We focused on affect, fatigue, and cognitive functioning (e.g., better attention), as these are components of the superordinate construct of work-related psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206311430262">van Horn, Taris, Schaufeli, &amp; Schreurs, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Eliciting social support for problem solving might prevent problems disrupting progress toward goals because solutions are implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206311430262">Bamberger, 2009</xref>). Disrupted progress toward goals might increase the experience of negative affect and reduce the experience of positive affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0149206311430262">Carver &amp; Scheier, 1990</xref>). Eliciting support for problem solving may also help progress toward a wider set of goals than just preventing disruption to a narrow range of goals connected to a particular problem. For example, eliciting support to solve problems may help an individual form a relationship. Eliciting support to solve problems might also help an individual gain information, expertise, and new skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206311430262">Bamberger, 2009</xref>). Therefore, we might expect eliciting support to solve problems to be associated with lower negative affect and higher positive affect.</p>
<p>Because affective experience contemporaneous with problem solving might reflect a range of initial negative and positive affective reactions to a problem, it may be that the success of problem solving can be gauged only after the problem episode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206311430262">Bindl &amp; Parker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206311430262">Parker, Bindl, &amp; Strauss, 2010</xref>). Moreover, committing resources by eliciting support might be associated with a short-term depletion of resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206311430262">Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, &amp; Tice, 1998</xref>). However, if problem solving is successful, resources may recover at a faster rate because workers do not have to engage in further regulation of the impact of problem-solving demands. Therefore, we expected a lag between eliciting social support to solve problems and enhanced affective experience. We operationalized social support used for solving problems as the extent to which workers “discuss problems with others to solve problems” (DIS-SP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311430262">Daniels et al., 2009</xref>). This operationalization links the purpose of eliciting social support directly to problem solving and reflects the conversational nature of workplace social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206311430262">Zellars &amp; Perrewé, 2001</xref>).</p>
<list id="list1-0149206311430262" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1 (H1)</italic>: DIS-SP will be associated with subsequently (a) lower levels of negative affect and (b) higher levels of positive affect.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Like eliciting support to solve problems, executing job control to solve problems might prevent disruptions to goal progress, and therefore be associated with better affective experiences after the problem-solving episode. Executing control allows workers the latitude to implement solutions, explore a wider range of solutions, and devote sufficient time to problem solving (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311430262">Frese &amp; Zapf, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206311430262">Karasek &amp; Theorell, 1990</xref>). Because executing control is a more individually oriented activity, executing job control to solve problems may be closely linked to individuals’ cognitive processes. When workers are faced with problems but cannot or do not execute job control to solve the problems individually, workers may need to exert more cognitive effort to attempt to solve problems by themselves and find their attention is diverted from individual problem solving to any adverse affective reactions to the problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311430262">Beal et al., 2005</xref>). In turn, the additional cognitive effort and attention to adverse affective reactions may deplete cognitive resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311430262">Beal et al., 2005</xref>). Cognitive resource depletion may have a detrimental effect on the cognitive processes needed to perform work, and cognitive resource depletion may become manifest as fatigue and cognitive failures, such as inability to sustain attention or recall information (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206311430262">Wallace &amp; Chen, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>There are theoretical reasons to suspect that there are nonlinear relationships between executing job control to solve problems and subsequent affective and cognitive outcomes. It is well established that individuals satisfice in decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206311430262">March &amp; Simon, 1958</xref>), and there is evidence that initial but suboptimal solutions to problems can curtail further information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206311430262">Bilalić, McLeod, &amp; Gobet, 2008</xref>), thus leading to lessened understanding of a problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0149206311430262">Osman, 2010</xref>). Therefore, we expected that executing control to solve problems would be related to better affective experience, less fatigue, and fewer cognitive failures only where executing control to solve problems is at a sufficiently high level to enable sufficiently deep understanding of problems to generate and implement the best solutions to problems. In contrast, if executing job control to solve problems is attempted but not at a sufficiently high level, suboptimal solutions will be generated that may not adequately solve the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206311430262">Bouchard, Lussier, Wright, &amp; Richer, 1998</xref>). In turn, generating suboptimal solutions may lead to poorer affective experiences and cognitive resource depletion.</p>
<p>Given that it is common for individuals to satisfice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0149206311430262">March &amp; Simon, 1958</xref>), we expected there to be no relationship between executing job control to solve problems and well-being from the lowest to at least average levels of executing job control to solve problems. We expected any relationship between executing job control to solve problems and well-being to become discernible only at levels of executing job control to solve problems that exceed average levels. We expected the curvilinear effects of executing control to solve problems to occur after the problem-solving episode, when initial affective reactions would have subsided and deployment of cognitive resources recovered if problem solving was successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206311430262">Baumeister et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206311430262">Bindl &amp; Parker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206311430262">Parker et al., 2010</xref>). We operationalized job control used to solve problems as the extent to which workers “change aspects of their work activities to solve problems” (CHA-SP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311430262">Daniels et al., 2009</xref>), so that executing job control is directly linked to the purpose of solving problems.</p>
<list id="list2-0149206311430262" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2 (H2)</italic>: There will be curvilinear relationships between CHA-SP and subsequent levels of (a) negative affect, (b) positive affect, (c) fatigue, and (d) cognitive failure, so that negative relationships between CHA-SP and indicators of better well-being will be manifest only at levels above the mean for CHA-SP.</p></list-item>

<p>There might be reciprocal relationships between problem solving and aspects of well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206311430262">Bindl &amp; Parker, 2010</xref>). Levels of fatigue might be an important antecedent of problem solving because people may conserve sparse energetic resources when fatigued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206311430262">Hobfoll, 2002</xref>). In relation specifically to DIS-SP, the decision to seek help is influenced partly by the energy required to identify and solicit help from an appropriate person, and the social and emotional costs of help-seeking to self-efficacy and mastery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206311430262">Bamberger, 2009</xref>). When people are fatigued, they may not have the energy to engage in seeking help from the right people or the energy to cope with potential social and emotional costs.</p>
<p>A number of studies have also indicated that energetic resources might be important antecedents to broader classes of proactive work behaviors and engagement with work than problem-solving activity. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0149206311430262">Sonnentag (2003)</xref> found detachment from work outside work hours was related to increased work engagement and proactive work behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206311430262">Binnewies, Sonnentag, and Mojze (2010)</xref> found start-of-week recovery from work was related to subsequent levels of personal initiative. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206311430262">Kühnel et al. (in press)</xref> found feelings of recovery from work were associated with higher levels of daily work engagement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0149206311430262">Fritz and Sonnentag (2009</xref>: 98) reasoned that higher levels of energy facilitate “self-regulatory, goal-oriented, and persistent aspects” of proactive behavior. Fritz and Sonnentag’s reasoning might be extended to both DIS-SP and CHA-SP because both forms of problem solving involve self-regulatory processes, are goal-oriented, and can require persistence in finding and implementing solutions. Because the choice to engage in problem solving will be based on levels of energetic resources going into a phase of problem solving, we expected levels of fatigue to have an effect on subsequent levels of DIS-SP and CHA-SP.</p>
<list id="list3-0149206311430262" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3 (H3)</italic>: Fatigue will be inversely associated with subsequent levels of (a) DIS-SP and (b) CHA-SP.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Cognitive resources may also be important for problem-solving activity. If cognitive resources are being depleted, people may wish to protect further depletion by engaging in less problem-solving activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206311430262">Hobfoll, 2002</xref>). However, we expect CHA-SP to be influenced by levels of cognitive resources but not DIS-SP. This is because CHA-SP is more closely linked to cognitive processes than DIS-SP. Executing job control involves decisions on modifying work tasks or altering work schedules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206311430262">Breaugh, 1985</xref>). Executing control specifically to solve problems requires personal filtering and interpretation of information gained from searching for solutions and experimentation (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0149206311430262">Frese &amp; Zapf, 1994</xref>). In contrast, DIS-SP requires less cognitive activity, as help providers can filter and interpret information. Because cognitive failure reflects impairments of memory and attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206311430262">Wallace &amp; Chen, 2005</xref>), cognitive failure may impair CHA-SP as workers may find it difficult to recall how best to execute job control, sustain attention long enough on that problem-solving activity facilitated by executing job control, and/or switch cognitive processing from acquiring information to interpreting the relevance of that information for problem solving. Like fatigue, we expected levels of cognitive failure to have an effect on subsequent levels of CHA-SP because cognitive functioning going into a problem-solving episode will influence initial problem-solving choices.</p>

</list>
<p>In summary, examining H1, H2, H3, and H4 addresses several gaps in the literature. First, H1 and H2 examine different consequences for using job resources for more individual or more collaborative ways of enacting job characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206311430262">Leana et al., 2009</xref>). H2 examines curvilinear relationships, which have yet to be examined. H3 and H4 examine the short-term antecedents of worker-initiated variations in job characteristics and in particular how personal energetic and cognitive resources might influence these changes.</p>

<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>We used an experience sampling methodology (ESM) in which data were collected several times per day. The choice of ESM was partly guided by the dynamic nature of the phenomena under study and also because ESM provides greater accuracy than can be obtained through daily, weekly, or other retrospective reports of dynamic phenomena such as affect and problem solving (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206311430262">Tennen et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>We used a sample of design engineers working on major construction projects for offshore oil and gas extraction or onshore industrial facilities (e.g., pharmaceuticals factories). Design engineers can be characterized as frequently experiencing problem-solving demands. Design engineering involves ongoing decision making and negotiation with other stakeholders such as clients and involves responding to frequent and unforeseen problems in the form of technical difficulties, disruptions, management complications, and changes in requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206311430262">Jagodzinski, Reid, Culverhouse, Parsons, &amp; Phillips, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>We controlled for levels of the dependent variables assessed at the same time as the independent variables, trait levels of cognitive failure, usual levels of job control, social support, linear and curvilinear effects of usual levels of job demands, and linear and curvilinear effects of problem-solving demands. We controlled for two indicators of affective expression in relation to problems (“talking to others to express affect” [TAL-EA] and “changing aspects of work activities to express affect” [CHA-EA]) assessed at the same time as the independent variables, as both may be related to the cognitive and affective processes of problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206311430262">Daniels et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311430262">Daniels et al., 2009</xref>). We also controlled for the Big Five personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206311430262">Goldberg et al., 2006</xref>). Neuroticism and extraversion show high convergence with negative and positive affectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206311430262">Schaubroeck &amp; Ganster, 1991</xref>). Conscientiousness is related to cognitive failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206311430262">Wallace &amp; Chen, 2005</xref>). All Big Five personality traits are related to coping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0149206311430262">Connor-Smith &amp; Flachsbart, 2007</xref>). Finally, we controlled for whether design teams were concerned with offshore or onshore facilities, participants’ level of compliance with requests to provide data, and variables representing the time of the day, the day of the week, and the phase of the study in which ESM data were provided.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-0149206311430262">
<title>Sample and Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were design engineers working on designing offshore oil and gas extraction installations or onshore industrial facilities (<italic>N</italic> = 191, average age = 43.30 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 15.30, 95% male). Participants came from three separate companies (two offshore, one onshore) and were organized in 64 design teams. Participants were recruited by senior managers’ requests for volunteers at specific organizational locations.</p>
<p>Data were collected using personal digital assistants (PDAs). The PDAs administered questionnaires four times daily over the working week (Monday to Friday). The PDAs’ alarm signaled when the questionnaire was to be completed (10:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., 2:00 p.m., and 4:00 p.m.). This allowed us to collect data as close as possible to when problem-solving activity was unfolding. Prior research indicates meaningful variation in problem-solving demands, problem-solving activity, affect, fatigue, and cognitive failure over 2-hour periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206311430262">Daniels et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311430262">Daniels et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, a 2-hour period is a reasonable length in which initial reactions to problems may have subsided and participants have some feedback on the initial success or otherwise of problem-solving activity.</p>
<p>Participants were asked to complete the questionnaires over 2 or 3 separate weeks, depending on the length of the design project the participants’ teams were working on. Participants were asked to complete questionnaires 4 to 7 weeks apart. Some participants were reassigned to other projects after the first or second phases of the study, and so their data were available only for earlier phases. Participants provided data on 5,636 occasions. After taking into account known absences (scheduled leave, etc.), this number of responses gave an overall compliance rate of 63%. The average individual compliance rate was 64% (range = 25–100%). In the week preceding the first round of data collection with PDAs, participants were asked to complete a background questionnaire. The questionnaire assessed demographics and some control variables. All questionnaires were returned before the start of data collection with PDAs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0149206311430262">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Well-being</title>
<p>We assessed four specific variables related to the wider concept of work-related well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206311430262">van Horn et al., 2004</xref>). These were negative affect (NA), positive affect (PA), fatigue, and cognitive failure. NA, PA, and fatigue were assessed by asking participants how they felt at that moment in time, using indicators validated in work contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206311430262">Daniels, 2000</xref>). NA was assessed with the items “anxious” and “worried.” PA was assessed with the items “motivated” and “enthusiastic.” Fatigue was assessed with the items “fatigued” and “tired.” Items were rated on a 5-point scale (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 5 = <italic>very</italic>). Scores were calculated by summing item ratings and dividing by 2 (NA α = .84, PA α = .91, fatigue α = .91).</p>
<p>Three items assessed the major domains of cognitive failure (i.e., memory, attention, and action; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206311430262">Wallace &amp; Chen, 2005</xref>). These items were adapted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206311430262">Daniels et al.

Scores were calculated by summing item ratings and dividing by 3 (α = .71),</p>
<p>Multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) indicated the affect, fatigue, and cognitive failure variables should be analyzed separately. In the hypothesized four-factor model, items loaded on factors representing NA, PA, fatigue, and cognitive failure. The hypothesized model was compared to four alternative models. In the first alternative model, all cognitive failure, affect, and fatigue items loaded on a single factor. In the second alternative model, the affect and fatigue items loaded on one factor and the cognitive failure items loaded on a second factor. In the third alternative model, the PA items loaded on one factor and all other items loaded on a second factor. In the fourth alternative model, the NA and fatigue items loaded on one factor, the PA items on a second factor, and the cognitive failure items on a third factor. For the hypothesized four-factor model, the normed fit index (NFI) was .94, the non-normed fit index (NNFI) was .91, the comparative fit index (CFI) was .94, and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) was .08. The NFI, NNFI, and CFI did not exceed .84 in any of the alternative models. The RMSEA was not less than .13 in any of the alternative models. In the hypothesized four-factor model, freely estimated factor loadings were all in the hypothesized direction for the within-person and between-person parts of the model (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>

<sec id="section8-0149206311430262">
<title>Problem-solving demands</title>
<p>We assessed problem-solving demands with the question, “In the past hour, how many issues without an obvious answer or solution have you had to deal with?” Demands were rated on a 6-point scale (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more). A single-item measure was considered acceptable because of the specific, unemotive nature of the item, the limited time frame over which participants were asked to recall incidences of demands, and the use of specific anchors for each scale point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206311430262">Frese &amp; Zapf, 1988</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311430262">Daniels et al.

<sec id="section9-0149206311430262">
<title>Problem solving and affective expression</title>
<p>Participants rated how they responded in the past hour to the level of problem-solving demands they had experienced. Ratings were made on a 6-point fully anchored scale (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 6 = <italic>to a large extent</italic>), and each scale consisted of two items. If a participant reported no problem-solving demands in a given hour, the problem-solving and affective expression items were not presented and participants automatically given scores of 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) for the problem-solving and affective expression items. Scores were calculated by summing item scores and dividing by 2. The scales were DIS-SP (α = .93), CHA-SP (α = .88), TAL-EA (α = .88), and CHA-EA (α = .88). Example items are, “In the past hour, did you discuss the issues to help you solve them?” for DIS-SP; “In the past hour, did you change your work objectives for the hour to solve the issues?” for CHA-SP; “In the past hour, did you confide in other people about the issues to get your emotions off your chest?” for TAL-EA; and “In the past hour, did you change the order in which you normally do work tasks to get your emotions off your chest?” for CHA-EA. These complex items link the specific behaviors of executing job control (“changing aspects of work activities”) and eliciting support (“discussing problems,” “talking to others”) to specific purposes (problem solving and expressing affect). Daniels et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311430262">2009</xref>: 1007) report a number of checks to indicate participants can interpret these items. In the present study, we received no feedback from the participants that they found the items difficult to understand. Three studies also provide evidence for reliability and validity of these scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206311430262">Daniels et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311430262">Daniels et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206311430262">Daniels, Wimalasiri, Cheyne, &amp; Story, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Multilevel CFA indicated the problem-solving and affective expression items should be treated as four separate scales. The hypothesized four-factor model was compared to six alternative models. The first alternative model was a two-factor model, in which all problem-solving items loaded on one factor and all affective expression items loaded on the other. The second alternative model was a two-factor model, in which all job control items loaded on one factor and all social support items loaded on the other. The third alternative model was a three-factor-model in which all problem-solving items loaded on one factor but the affective expression items were differentiated as hypothesized. The fourth alternative model was a three-factor model in which the problem-solving items loaded on their hypothesized factors but all affective expression items loaded on one factor. The fifth alternative model was a three-factor model in which all job control items loaded on one factor, but there were separate factors for DIS-SP and TAL-EA. The sixth alternative model was a three-factor model in which the CHA-SP and CHA-EA items loaded on their hypothesized factors, but the social support items loaded on one factor.</p>
<p>For the hypothesized four-factor model, the NFI was .99, the NNFI was .98, the CFI was .98, and the RMSEA was .07. In five of the alternative models, one or more of NFI, NNFI, or CFI did not exceed .90. In none of these models was the RMSEA less than .15. The fourth alternative model had NFI, NNFI, and CFI values that exceeded .90 (NFI = .97, NNFI = .95, CFI = .97), and the RMSEA was .10. This model was a three-factor model in which the problem-solving items loaded on their hypothesized factors but all affective expression items loaded on one factor. Although the fit indices for both the hypothesized four-factor model and the fourth alternative model fall within acceptable ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206311430262">Byrne, 2006</xref>: 97-100), we chose the hypothesized four-factor model because both models indicated the problem-solving items should be differentiated into scales assessing DIS-SP and CHA-SP, the fit indices for hypothesized model were better, and the fit of the hypothesized model was significantly better than the fit of the fourth alternative model (Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 774.02, <italic>df</italic> = 2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). In the hypothesized four-factor model, freely estimated factor loadings were all in the hypothesized direction for the within-person and between-person parts of the model (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>

<title>Other Control Variables</title>
<p>The analyses controlled for dependent variables assessed on the same day but at the preceding time point, that is, dependent variables assessed at the same time point as the independent variables. The analyses also controlled for each participant’s compliance rate, whether the sample worked on designs for offshore or onshore facilities, and temporal variables representing the time of day, day of week, and phase of the study in which experience sampling data were provided. Time of day was represented by two dummy codes (12:00 p.m., 2:00 p.m.). A third dummy code was not needed because inclusion of same day lagged dependent variables in the analyses meant variables assessed at 10:00 a.m. could not be used as dependent variables. Day of week was represented by four dummy codes for Monday through Thursday. Phase of the study was represented by two dummy codes (Week 1, Week 2).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0149206311430262">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>To test the hypotheses, we used independent variables assessed on the same day but in the preceding time point to predict the dependent variables. Multilevel regression was used to analyze the data. Three-level models were fitted to the data, representing hourly observations nested within individuals, nested within design teams. We examined the robust standard errors to check any violations of the assumption of normality had not affected the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206311430262">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>). The inclusion of lagged dependent variables meant that data from the first assessment on each day could not be used, nor could data for which the preceding time point was missing. This left 3,446 usable observations.</p>
<p>Most variables were centered at their grand means. Dummy variables were left in their raw metric. Curvilinear terms were calculated by squaring constituent linear terms after grand mean centering. Linear components of curvilinear terms were controlled. Grand mean centering was used because the DCSM provides an explanation of interindividual differences in problem solving and well-being, rather than intraindividual differences. To control for stable between-person variance, participants’ average levels for each variable assessed by ESM were controlled: This is a recognized technique for removing between-person variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206311430262">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>). Participants’ average levels for each ESM variable were grand mean centered. All models included values of the dependent variables assessed at thesame time as the independent variables as well as the other control variables. Because of dependencies between the incidence of problem-solving demands and both DIS-SP and CHA-SP, the level of problem-solving demands assessed at the same time as DIS-SPand CHA-SP was controlled. Regression slopes were fixed to be invariant across individuals and design teams.</p>
<p>In each model, variables were entered in blocks. The first block consisted of control variables assessed prior to the ESM period. The second block consisted of control variables collected by ESM, including participants’ average levels of independent variables and, if appropriate, linear terms of hypothesized curvilinear effects. The second block consisted of ESM variables used to examine linear hypotheses (H1, H3, and H4). For H2, the third block consisted of the curvilinear term for CHA-SP. The deviance test was used to test the contribution of each block of variables to improving model fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206311430262">Snijders &amp; Bosker, 1999</xref>). The deviance test is evaluated against the χ<sup>2</sup> distribution.</p>
<p>Once the main models were assessed, ancillary analyses examined significant relationships in simplified models. These ancillary analyses were conducted to check that multicollinearity or other statistical artifacts had not affected the results. Four different sets of models were assessed in these ancillary analyses. Except where noted, regression slopes in the ancillary analyses were fixed to be invariant across individuals and design teams. In the first set of ancillary analyses, the models included a single independent variable (in the case of H2, this also included the linear term for CHA-SP) and a single control for prior levels of the dependent variable (e.g., for NA, the control would be prior levels of NA only), and levels of problem-solving demands assessed at the same time as DIS-SP and CHA-SP were controlled. There were no controls for between-person variation. In the second set, occasions when participants reported no problem-solving demands were excluded from the analyses. In the second set of ancillary analyses, there were no controls for levels of problem-solving demands or for between-person variation. A single independent variable was assessed, with its linear constituent if appropriate, and a single control for prior levels of the dependent variable. The third set of ancillary models was similar to the main analyses, except the models omitted temporal controls, controls assessed by background questionnaire, controls for affective expression, and the control for the type of facilities designed. In the third set of models, regression slopes were allowed to vary between individuals and design teams. The fourth set of ancillary analyses were the same as the third set, except occasions when participants reported no problem-solving demands were excluded from the analyses and regression slopes were fixed to be invariant across individuals and design teams.</p>

<p>Before examining the hypotheses, we estimated the proportion of variance attributable to within-person differences, between-person differences, and between-team differences in each model estimated. For momentary NA, 47% of the variance was attributable to within-person differences, 43% to between-person differences, and the remainder to between-team differences (&lt; 3%). For momentary PA, 43% was within-person variation, 57% was between-person variation, and less than 3% was between-team variation. For momentary fatigue, 53% of the variation was within-person variation, 45% was between-person variation, and less than 2% was between-team variation. For hourly cognitive failure, the values were 59% for within-person variation and 39% for between-person variation, with the remainder attributable to between-team variation (&lt; 3%). For DIS-SP, the values were 74% for within-person variation and 26% for between-person variation, with less than 1% attributable to between-team variation. For CHA-SP, the values were 68% for within-person variation, 32% for between-person variation, and less than 1% was attributable to between-team variation. In summary, roughly 50% of the variation in NA, PA, fatigue, and cognitive failure was attributable to differences between occasions, and 50% was attributable to stable differences between individuals. Over two thirds of the variation in problem-solving activity can be attributed to occasions and just under one third to variation between individuals. The choice of ESM is supported because of the large proportion of variance in the substantive variables attributable to within-person differences.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0149206311430262">Table 2</xref> shows the results of the multilevel regression analyses. For the independent variables of DIS-SP, CHA-SP, fatigue, and cognitive failure, all of the significant results from the main and ancillary analyses were replicated in analyses using robust standard errors.</p>

The form of these relationships was consistent with H2, in that each was an inverted U-shaped curve, where the highest levels of CHA-SP were associated with the lowest levels of subsequent NA, fatigue, and cognitive failure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0149206311430262">2</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0149206311430262">Figure 1</xref> shows the form of the relationships between CHA-SP on one hand and NA, fatigue, and cognitive failure on the other.

However, the results were similar for all of the models estimated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0149206311430262">Figure 1</xref> shows that CHA-SP was associated with subsequently lower levels of NA, fatigue, and cognitive failure only at the highest levels of CHA-SP. Consistent with H2, analyses of the first derivative indicated that the regression slope became negative at levels slightly above the grand mean level for CHA-SP (0.63 scale points above the mean for the relationship with NA, 0.94 scale points above the mean for the relationship with fatigue, and 0.74 scale points above the mean for the relationship with cognitive failure). Although CHA-SP was a skewed variable, there were some 484 occasions with a score of 4 or more, of which 265 occasions corresponded to a score of 4.5 or more.</p>

<p>In respect of H3 and H4, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0149206311430262">Table 2</xref> shows that the addition of momentary fatigue and hourly levels of cognitive failure to the control variables improved the fit of the models (range of Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 10.94 to 22.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). In relation to H3, there was evidence that momentary fatigue was inversely associated with subsequent levels of both DIS-SP and CHA-SP (<italic>B</italic> = −0.08,<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 in both models). For H3, ancillary analyses of simpler models indicated no significant relationships between fatigue and either subsequent DIS-SP or subsequent CHA-SP. However, controlling for cognitive failure assessed at the same time as fatigue in these simpler models resulted in the association between fatigue and subsequent problem-solving activity becoming significant (range of <italic>B</italic>s = −0.06 to −0.11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 in three models, <italic>B = −</italic>0.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .07 in one model). Given the correlation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0149206311430262">Table 1</xref>) between cognitive failure and fatigue was <italic>r</italic> = .44 at the level of each occasion and <italic>r</italic> = .62 when aggregated at the level of the individual, it was not likely the results were an artifact of multicollinearity. Because the relationship between fatigue and problem-solving activity appeared to be conditional on controlling for cognitive failure, it can be inferred that the relationship between fatigue and subsequent problem solving did not reflect cognitive deficits associated with fatigue but rather a lack of energy or vigor needed to engage in problem-solving activity. This inference is consistent with the reasoning underpinning H3.</p>
<p>In relation to H4, there was evidence that hourly cognitive failure was associated with subsequent levels of CHA-SP. However, the direction was opposite to that predicted, in that higher levels of cognitive failure were associated with subsequently higher levels of CHA-SP (<italic>B</italic> = 0.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The result was replicated in all four models examined in the ancillary analyses (range of <italic>B</italic>s = 0.16 to 0.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0149206311430262">Table 2</xref> shows four other relationships worth noting. First, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0149206311430262">Table 2</xref> shows that participants’ average levels of DIS-SP were related to higher levels of momentary PA (<italic>B</italic> = 0.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and that average levels of momentary PA were related to hourly levels of DIS-SP (<italic>B</italic> = 0.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). In ancillary analyses of simpler models, this relationship between DIS-SP and PA was replicated just once. Second, average levels of DIS-SP were inversely associated with hourly fatigue (<italic>B</italic> = −0.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). However, this relationship was not replicated in any of the ancillary analyses. Third, individuals’ average levels of CHA-SP were inversely associated with PA (<italic>B</italic> = −0.43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). However, this association was not replicated in any of the ancillary analyses. Moreover, in two of the ancillary models, there was a curvilinear relationship between individuals’ average levels of CHA-SP and momentary PA (range of <italic>B</italic>s = 0.09 to 0.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), consistent with higher average levels of CHA-SP being associated with higher levels of PA. These results in respect of PA and fatigue on one hand and DIS-SP and CHA-SP on the other may have reflected either multicollinearity or other substantive processes (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0149206311430262">Becker, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results indicated support for H1 and H2, that DIS-SP and high levels of CHA-SP would be associated with subsequently lower levels of NA, fatigue, and cognitive failure. The results also supported H3, that fatigue would be related to subsequently lower levels of DIS-SP and CHA-SP. Contrary to the expectations of H4, cognitive failure was associated with higher levels of CHA-SP. The present study reinforces arguments that workers play an active role in job design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206311430262">Grant &amp; Parker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311430262">Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2008</xref>). The present study also indicates that the process of workers enacting the work environment for the instrumental purpose of problem solving may be an alternative explanation of the benefits of good job design to processes proposed in motivational models of job design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311430262">Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2008</xref>). The present study adds to the literature by showing that both individual and collaborative forms of enacting job characteristics may contribute to subsequent well-being, and that enacting daily job characteristics may be influenced by within-day variation in personal factors.</p>
<sec id="section18-0149206311430262">
<title>Implications for Theory and Research</title>
<p>Much research on job design is predicated on the motivating potential of job characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311430262">Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206311430262">Parker &amp; Ohly, 2008</xref>). The present study adds to calls to find alternatives to motivational explanations through which job design can influence various outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311430262">Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2008</xref>). At least in relation to two specific features of jobs, eliciting social support and executing job control, the present study indicates that short-term, ongoing, and instrumental enactment of job characteristics can help self-regulation of the impact of problem-solving demands. Worker-initiated enactment of job characteristics requires the application of cognitive skills, social skills, and abilities, and problem solving requires cognitive skills. Therefore, the present study suggests the importance of workers’ skills and abilities in the process of enacting the work environment on a day-to-day basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311430262">Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2008</xref>). However, given levels of fatigue were associated with subsequent DIS-SP and CHA-SP, the results indicate the importance of state variables in influencing workers’ abilities to execute job control and elicit social support to solve problems.</p>
<p>The study established the temporal precedence of DIS-SP and CHA-SP over NA, cognitive failure, and fatigue. This temporal precedence is theoretically important. Some time may need to elapse to allow individuals to assess how problem solving went and whether goal progress was disrupted by the problem or not and for resources initially expended on problem solving to recover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206311430262">Baumeister et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206311430262">Parker et al., 2010</xref>). However, in another study, hourly levels of both CHA-SP and DIS-SP were associated with learning during the same hour, and hourly levels of learning were associated with PA at the end of the hour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311430262">Daniels et al., 2009</xref>). It may be that learning is experienced during problem solving rather than subsequent to problem solving, as people may get immediate feedback in their attempts to obtain knowledge or try out new skills to solve problems. In relation to methodology, although it is desirable to demonstrate temporal precedence empirically, there may be occasions, even with ESM data, when the presumed cause influences the presumed effect so rapidly that establishing temporal precedence is not possible. When it is not possible to establish temporal precedence, the inclusion of carefully chosen mediators between cause and effect can enhance causal inference through well-specified theoretical relationships.</p>
<p>It is worth commenting on zero-order correlations involving usual levels of social support and usual levels of job control. There was low convergence between usual levels of social support and average levels of DIS-SP and low convergence between usual levels of job control and average levels of CHA-SP. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311430262">Semmer et al. (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206311430262">Daniels (2011)</xref> point out, dynamic measures of job characteristics may reflect different phenomena to more static measures. The measures assessed during the ESM phase related to enacting job characteristics for specific purposes within a specific time frame, whereas the measures assessed by the background questionnaire related to reports of how jobs are usually. The measures of usual levels of job control and social support were linked neither to enacting job characteristics for a specific purpose nor to enacting job characteristics within a specific time frame. Moreover, the processes through which a stable job characteristic enables enactment of a specific set of behaviors for a specific purpose within a given time frame may involve many cognitive and contextual variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206311430262">Bamberger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206311430262">Daniels, 2011</xref>), including worker skills and abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311430262">Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>There were also low correlations between usual levels of social support and job control on one hand and within-day indicators of well-being on the other. A large body of literature indicates significant relationships between indicators of usual levels of well-being and usual levels of both social support and job control (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206311430262">de Lange et al., 2003</xref>). One reason for the divergence between this and other studies might be that retrospective reports of well-being not only reflect a simple average of momentary well-being over a defined period but might also reflect judgments based on other criteria such as extremes of momentary well-being over a defined period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206311430262">Parkinson, Briner, Reynolds, &amp; Totterdell, 1995</xref>). That is, studies that assess usual levels of well-being through retrospective reports are not necessarily assessing the same phenomena as studies that assess well-being through aggregating momentary reports.</p>
<p>DIS-SP had linear relations with subsequent NA, but CHA-SP had curvilinear relations with NA, fatigue, and cognitive failure. These results add to the literature by indicating divergence in how well-being may be enhanced by collaborative or individual ways of enacting job characteristics. The beneficial effects of CHA-SP were found only at high levels of CHA-SP. The results indicate that individual forms of enacting job characteristics may not be harmful, at least if conducted at high levels and for the instrumental purposes of problem solving. Previous research has indicated some harmful effects of individual ways of enacting job characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206311430262">Daniels et al., 2008</xref>). However, this previous research has examined linear relations only.</p>
<p>We reasoned curvilinear relations characterize the relationship between CHA-SP and outcomes because CHA-SP needs to be engaged at a sufficiently high level to prevent satisficing in the search for and selection of solutions. This reasoning might imply that a high level of motivation is needed for individuals to continue to search for and analyze solutions after generating initial but potentially suboptimal solutions. In one study, the motivation to go beyond role requirements partially mediated the influence of job control on an index of proactive work behavior that included an assessment of proactive problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206311430262">Parker, Williams, &amp; Turner, 2006</xref>). In another study, work engagement mediated the relationship between an index of active coping, which included an assessment of problem solving, and job control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206311430262">Weigl et al., 2010</xref>). Combined with the findings of the present study, Parkeret al.’s and Weigl et al.’s results suggest that resources such as job control might facilitate problem solving both through a motivational mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206311430262">Parker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206311430262">Weigl et al., 2010</xref>) and through an instrumental process in which job control is used to engage in problem solving (the present study). Therefore, motivational and self-regulation models of job design may be complementary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311430262">Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although it is established that there is day-to-day variation in job characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206311430262">Daniels, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311430262">Semmer et al., 2004</xref>), the present study indicates that there is theoretically meaningful variation that occurs within the working day in the extent to which workers enact job characteristics (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206311430262">Daniels et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311430262">Daniels et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206311430262">Daniels et al., 2011</xref>). Not only does the present study indicate some of the consequences of these within-day variations in enacting job characteristics, but uniquely the present study indicates that fatigue and cognitive error are potential antecedents of within-day, worker-initiated, enacted job characteristics.</p>
<p>Short-term changes in well-being may accumulate into long-term changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0149206311430262">Semmer et al., 2004</xref>). The reciprocal relationships between DIS-SP and CHA-SP, on one hand, and fatigue, on the other, indicate how short-term changes may accumulate into more permanent changes. High levels of CHA-SP were associated with subsequently lower levels of fatigue. In turn fatigue was associated with subsequently lower levels of DIS-SP and CHA-SP. Both DIS-SP and high levels of CHA-SP were associated with subsequently less NA, and another study found that both DIS-SP and CHA-SP were associated with enhanced learning and PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311430262">Daniels et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, support for mutual relationships between fatigue and CHA-SP adds to literature that indicates day-to-day variations in personal resources mediate the relationship between day-to-day variations in job resources and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206311430262">Xanthopoulou et al., 2009</xref>). In the present study, the findings suggest that at particular periods during the course of the working day, personal levels of energetic resources may increase subsequent use of some job resources (i.e., job control) to effectively deal with demands, which in turn can improve energetic resources.</p>
<p>Contrary to expectations, we found that cognitive failure was associated with subsequently higher levels of CHA-SP. It is not likely that this result reflects an increase in problem-solving demands because problem-solving demands were controlled in many of the models tested. Neither is it likely that this result reflects a simple compensatory increase in problem-solving activity following cognitive failures because cognitive failure had no relationship with subsequent levels of DIS-SP. A compensatory process based on restoring self-esteem and self-efficacy may explain the specificity of the relationship between cognitive failure and CHA-SP. Cognitive failures may lead to mistakes that are threats to workers’ self-esteem and self-efficacy. To restore self-esteem and self-efficacy, workers may engage in more problem solving. The social costs of asking for help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206311430262">Bamberger, 2009</xref>) may do little to restore self-esteem and self-efficacy. In contrast, solving problems without help may restore self-esteem and self-efficacy, as solitary problem solving involves the acquisition and application of self-gained knowledge, skills, and solutions. Therefore, cognitive failure is more likely to stimulate individual action through CHA-SP than collaborative action through DIS-SP. An explanation based on restoring self-esteem and self-efficacy provides an alternative interpretation to the finding that individually initiated changes to job design were related to job dissatisfaction in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206311430262">Leana et al.’s (2009)</xref> cross-sectional study. Leana et al. concluded that individually initiated changes to job design influenced job dissatisfaction. However, individual agency in job design may not necessarily be a consequence of job dissatisfaction but a response to job dissatisfaction that is intended to restore feelings of self-esteem and self-efficacy. However, comparisons between Leana et al.’s study and the present study are tentative because each study investigated different aspects of worker agency in job design. Leana et al. investigated the specific concept of job crafting and the present study examined the extent to which workers enacted job control for problem solving.</p>

<title>Managerial Implications</title>
<p>The present study indicates the importance of workers’ agency in enacting their job design for problem solving. The results suggest that eliciting support and executing job control to solve problems may in themselves form interventions that encourage further worker-initiated agency in enacting job characteristics to solve problems. This is because fatigue predicted subsequent levels of DIS-SP and CHA-SP, CHA-SP predicted subsequent fatigue and NA, DIS-SP predicted subsequent NA, and fatigue shared variance with NA. Enacting job characteristics requires skills, abilities, and knowledge too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311430262">Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2008</xref>). Therefore, training workers in cognitive and social skills needed to enact and shape the content of their work might be a particularly useful intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206311430262">Grant &amp; Parker, 2009</xref>). The present study indicates that training may need to include explicit links between self-initiated agency in job design and the instrumental purposes for which job characteristics can be used. In the case of the present study, one instrumental purpose includes problem solving. Therefore, training in how to enact and shape the content of work may usefully include components related to skills and knowledge required for problem solving. In relation to eliciting support to solve problems, training may be better focused on developing skills and abilities in learning from others how to solve problems independently, rather than training in how to persuade others to implement solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206311430262">Bamberger, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>However, encouraging worker agency in job design might be achieved in other ways. Leadership is particularly important for problem solving and related activities such as sense making, obtaining resources, and developing social climates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206311430262">Morgeson, DeRue, &amp; Karam, 2010</xref>). Therefore, team leaders may be influential in establishing climates that encourage executing job control and eliciting social support to solve problems. In relation to executing job control for problem solving, team leaders may need to be aware that workers may seek opportunities to correct their own mistakes of the recent past, as the relationship between cognitive failure and subsequent CHA-SP suggests. Team leaders may also need to establish climates or processes that prevent workers disrupting the work of others when taking individual action to solve problems (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206311430262">Wrzesniewski et al., 2010</xref>)</p>
<p>For social support, it may be especially important for team leaders to structure tasks to encourage social contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311430262">Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2008</xref>), encourage reciprocity in giving and receiving help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206311430262">Bamberger, 2009</xref>), and encourage information exchange to develop trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206311430262">Gong, Cheung, Wang, &amp; Huang, 2012</xref>). Wider human resource management systems can also be useful in developing supportive relationships through orienting human resource management practices toward interdependent work, trust, information sharing, and shared values between workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206311430262">Mossholder, Richardson, &amp; Settoon, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0149206311430262">
<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>One strength of the study is the relatively large sample size for an experience sampling study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206311430262">Ohly, Sonnentag, Niessen, &amp; Zapf, 2010</xref>). Another strength is enhanced causal inference compared to cross-sectional analyses through relating hourly levels of DIS-SP, CHA-SP, fatigue, and cognitive failure to subsequent levels of the dependent variables after controlling for previous levels of the dependent variables. However, because we did not manipulate the independent variables and randomly allocate participants to manipulated conditions, statements of causality are still limited. Evaluating interventions with randomized control groups may provide stronger statements of causality and preserve the ecological validity gained through ESM. Such interventions could be designed to enhance DIS-SP and CHA-SP and reduce fatigue and cognitive failure.</p>
<p>Another limitation concerns the focus on workers with knowledge intensive jobs concerned with engineering design and, it is assumed, a high frequency of problem-solving demands. However, the cognitive elements of work have growing prominence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206311430262">Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2006</xref>). In addition, we used complex items to ensure problem solving was linked explicitly to executing job control or eliciting social support. Prior research has included checks for the interpretability of the items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0149206311430262">Daniels et al., 2009</xref>: 1007), and we found no evidence that the current sample had difficulty understanding the items. However, design engineers are well educated, and the items we used may be less suited to samples with lower educational attainment.</p>
<p>Another limitation concerns the focus on the short-term consequences of problem solving. It is likely that problem solving may have longer term effects for well-being, for example, through promoting learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206311430262">Meurs &amp; Perrewé, 2011</xref>) or proactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0149206311430262">Parker &amp; Ohly, 2008</xref>). Longer term studies using panel methods may be able to detect processes that require more extensive periods to develop. In common with many measures of job demands and other job stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206311430262">Tabanelli et al., 2008</xref>), the measure of problem-solving demands assessed only the frequency with which problems were encountered in any given hour. Individuals’ reactions to demands are also dependent on how individuals appraise the impact of demands and whether similar problems have been encountered before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206311430262">Daniels, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0149206311430262">Meurs &amp; Perrewé, 2011</xref>). However, including additional measures in the ESM component of data collection may have compromised compliance rates. Moreover, our primary interest was not problem-solving demands; rather, we were concerned with the extent to which people executed job control or elicited support to solve those problems. In addition, because the results concerning the hypotheses were replicated in models in which the regression slopes for demands and other variables were allowed to vary between individuals and design teams, we can be confident that our inferences at least take into account stable differences in how people tend to appraise problem-solving demands.</p>
<p>Only self-report methods were used in the present study. Self-report methods were appropriate because the study centered on cognitive and affective variables. However, the use of self-reports might raise concerns about common method variance. The temporal separation of independent and dependent variables, the greater accuracy of measurement afforded by electronic ESM, variation in response formats, and inclusion of a range of control variables mitigated against common method bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206311430262">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The present study indicates that worker agency in job design, in the form of enacting job characteristics, can be short term and instrumental. The present study also indicates that enacting job characteristics for instrumental purposes may have consequences for well-being. Insofar as enacting job characteristics and problem solving requires workers to apply skills and abilities, this present study indicates that job characteristics, skills, and abilities have benefits for well-being beyond their motivating potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0149206311430262">Morgeson &amp; Humphrey, 2008</xref>). The present study adds to the literature by indicating subsequent benefits for more collaborative and individual forms of enacting job characteristics. However, more individual forms of enacting job characteristics need to be conducted at a very high level to accrue benefits for well-being, and these benefits may be bounded by enacting job characteristics for the instrumental purpose of problem solving. The present study also adds to the literature by showing that personal, dynamic factors such as levels of fatigue can influence short-term worker agency in job design. The present study underscores the importance of examining the daily experience of work to enrich our understanding of work and its consequences.</p>

<p> Some 20 participants provided data on less than 25% of available occasions. Following Stone and colleagues’ recommendations, participants with compliance rates of less than 25% were excluded from the analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0149206311430262">Stone, Shiffman, Schwartz, Broderick, &amp; Hufford, 2003</xref>).

<p> Given the high correlation between discussing problems with others to solve problems (DIS-SP) and changing aspects of work activities to solve problems (CHA-SP; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0149206311430262">Table 1</xref>), we also checked whether the curvilinear term for DIS-SP was related to negative affect (NA), fatigue, and cognitive failure using both the main and ancillary modeling procedures. There were no relationships between the curvilinear term for DIS-SP and cognitive failure or fatigue in any models. In three out of five models, the curvilinear term for DIS-SP was associated with NA (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). However, in analyses controlling for the curvilinear terms for DIS-SP and CHA-SP, the curvilinear term for DIS-SP had no significant relationships with NA. Therefore, we can conclude that the weaker effects for the relationship between NA and the curvilinear term for DIS-SP were the result of the correlation between DIS-SP and CHA-SP.</p>
