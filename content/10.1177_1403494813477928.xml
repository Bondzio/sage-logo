<abstract>
<p><italic>Aim</italic>: To assess the quality of medical certificates issued during long-term sick leave or disability. <italic>Methods</italic>: We collected a stratified randomised sample of 250 medical certificates issued for assessment of work capacity: Certificates issued in primary health care (PHC) with a locomotor, psychiatric or other main diagnosis, in psychiatric care, and in other secondary care. Four experts performed a quality assessment per section of the certificate and globally. <italic>Results</italic>: The certificates varied from short notes to extensive documents. Those issued in PHC included more diagnoses per certificate (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.0001) than in secondary care. PHC physicians had a longer professional relationship to their patients (<italic>p</italic> = 0.009). Information on work capacity was entirely adequate and relevant in only 10% of the certificates. Disturbed mental function was indicated in 60% of the certificates without psychiatric main diagnosis. Whether indicated medical state influenced functional state was not assessable in 46 (19 %) of the certificates due to lack of information. Similarly, if reduced function influenced working capacity was not assessable in 66 (27 %) of the certificates. The global quality differed (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.0001) between certificates issued in primary care 5.7 (CI 5.5–5.9) and secondary care 6.9 (CI 6.5–7.3). <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>: There is a need for improvement of the quality of medical certificates issued in cases of long-term sick leave or disability. The quality of medical certificates was low and lacked necessary information requested by the Social Insurance Agency. The quality was lower in certificates issued in primary care, which might be explained by a different case-mix.</bold></p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>High quality is a prerequisite to guarantee equal legal judgement in the handling of allocation of sickness benefits to patients with reduced work capacity. However, insurance-related tasks have not had the highest priority in health care. Furthermore, assessment of work capacity, prediction of return to work and issuing of a medical certificate, have been seen as separate to and of less importance than core physician tasks such as medical examination, investigations, treatment and rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813477928">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Medical certificates issued by physicians are mandatory in many welfare systems when a person is absent due to sickness. In Sweden, a rather simple form is used in short-time absence. In long-term sickness absence, a more advanced form is mandatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813477928">1</xref>] though the clerks at the local Social Insurance Agency (SIA) then need more specific information from physicians, e.g. when a person due to impaired body function applies for disability pension from the SIA. The form should contain the physician’s evaluation of the person’s impairment and remaining work capacity and a prognosis of his or her ability to work in the future.</p>
<p>The information stated by the physician is crucial to the decision on sickness benefits to be taken by the SIA. Supplementing information from other sources such as e.g. the patient’s application form should also be considered. The National Board of Health and Welfare in Sweden has stated regulations regarding medical certificates as well as national guidelines and recommendations regarding sickness-absence certification. A physician who issues a certificate is responsible for both the content of the certificate and the medical investigation and treatment of the patient. The physician is obliged to know the purpose of the certificate, to be objective, to only state what is settled and to describe all relevant conditions in a language that could be understood also by non-medical professionals. Medical certificates must not be issued in a fraudulent manner. Because the issuing of a certificate is a complex task, it is not surprising that complaints of the quality and accuracy of sickness certificates have been repeatedly reported in different countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813477928">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813477928"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813477928">3</xref>].</p>
<p>There are a number of published questionnaire studies regarding physicians’ opinions of their work with sick-listing issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813477928">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813477928"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813477928"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813477928"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813477928">8</xref>]. Some have shown a relation between sick-listing practice and different physician characteristics such as age, sex, years in profession and attitudes. In a Swedish study, Söderberg found differences in the quality of medical certificates issued by physicians of different specialities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813477928">3</xref>]. Only a few studies have investigated actual issued medical certificates, but those who have done so have shown insufficient quality and that essential information is missing in the certificates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813477928">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813477928">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813477928"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813477928">11</xref>]. Still, all these studies have been carried out on the simple forms of the certificates used in short-term sickness absence.</p>
<p>The quality of decisions during long-term sickness is of utmost importance to the individual patient and legal security and health economics at a societal level. Still, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been reported regarding the quality of medical certificates used in the judgement of longer sickness-absence cases.</p>
<p>A national initiative to reduce sickness absence started in Sweden in 2006. It was termed “The sick leave billion” and was an agreement between the Government and the Federation of County Councils aimed to improve the quality and effectiveness of the health care organisations’ management of Social Insurance issues in Sweden.</p>
<p>This initiative enabled to collect and scientifically investigate medical certificates issued in longer sickness-absence cases.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the global quality and the quality in the different sections of certificates issued during long-term sickness. A further aim was to relate the assessed quality to patient and health care unit characteristics.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1403494813477928">
<title>Study material</title>
<p>Medical certificates issued for assessment of long-term sickness absence were investigated in the present study. These medical certificates are used when more detailed information is required at the SIA. Responsible physicians describe the medical state in a standardised form provided by the SIA. A Swedish version of the form is provided as supplementary material. The form is a two-page formulary with 22 sections starting with patient identity, occupation, previous issued certificates and duration of the relation between patient and issuing physician. These sections are followed by medical history, body functions and abilities, results of physical examinations and a prognosis. The final sections are used for administrative purposes and for identification of issuing physician and health care unit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1403494813477928">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Stockholm County Council performed several projects in the frame of the “The sick leave billion”. One was that all health care units in Stockholm County Council were invited to send copies of medical certificates issued for the evaluation of long-term sickness absence to the project group during the year 2007. The issuing physicians were not aware that the certificates should be quality-assessed to avoid selection and performance bias. However, all heads of the health care units had given permission to send de-identified certificates to the project for quality insurance purposes. The investigation conforms to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki 1975, revised in Hong Kong 1989. The Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm, Sweden, approved the study.</p>
<p>However, the issuing of medical certificates is not equally-distributed between health care units. Some units issue only a few or not at all and some issue certificates on a regular basis. No information exists on the numbers and distribution of the issued certificates. It was optional to the managements of the health care units to submit issued certificates. However, a total of 6250 de-identified certificates were sent in. Of the certificates, 65% were issued in primary care, 28% in psychiatric care and 7% in other types of secondary care. These latter 7% were not evenly distributed among specialities. Neurological rehabilitation and hearing impairment clinics were main providers of those certificates. Inclusion criteria were: de-identified copies of certificates with identifiable information on patient gender and age, main diagnosis group and issuing health care unit. We excluded certificates that were incompletely copied, meaning that whole pages were missing, but not if one or several sections of the form were left blank by the issuing physician.</p>
<p>As a first step, all certificates fulfilling inclusion criteria were stratified into predefined groups based on the type of issuing unit and main diagnosis group as stated in the certificate. The predefined groups were: certificates issued in primary health care (PHC) based on a locomotor system main diagnosis; certificates issued in PHC based on a psychiatric main diagnosis; certificates issued in PHC based on another main diagnosis; certificates issued in psychiatric care with a psychiatric main diagnosis; and certificates issued at other types of secondary care units with miscellaneous main diagnoses.</p>
<p>In a second step, a sample of 250 certificates with 50 certificates from each stratum was randomly selected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494813477928">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>A case report form (CRF) was developed based on quality aspects according to the regulations and recommendations of The National Board of Health and Welfare regarding medical sickness-absence certification. The case report form included patient characteristics, number of diagnoses stated etc. Functional impairment was classified depending on which body functions and structures that were affected.</p>
<p>Each certificate was evaluated by a purposive sample of four assessors with different perspectives and experiences: a clerk at the SIA; a specialist physician in psychiatry and family medicine or a specialist in orthopaedics, both with assignment as expert physicians at the SIA; a specialist in family medicine with appointment as an expert physician with special experience in social insurance medicine and quality assessment, and one experienced clinician at high academic level with speciality in cardiology and internal medicine. The four assessors all received a special education in how to perform the assessment. Furthermore we performed a pilot assessment of five certificates. The grading was first performed individually and then discussed between the assessors until a consensus of the rank was achieved. The assessors individually graded the information of different sections stated in the medical certificates and in four global domains. Defined quality aspects and verbal grading criteria used are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813477928">Table I</xref>.</p>

<title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>The aim of the analysis was to describe the global and sectional quality of the information given in the medical certificates, and further, to make two comparisons of the quality of certificates. First between certificates issued in PHC and at specialized health care units, and secondly, to compare the quality between certificates issued at PHC in patients with different main diagnoses and functional impairments. Continuous variables were expressed as mean and 95% confidence intervals, and categorical variables were expressed as frequencies, percentages, or both, unless otherwise indicated. All analyses were carried out with the statistical software Statistica 10 (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK), and a <italic>p</italic>-value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on normalized data.</p>

<title>Basal characteristics of the certificates</title>
<p>Of the 250 certificates, 248 included comprehensible information and were analysed further. Issuing physicians had used two versions of the certificate forms with a slightly different formulation concerning the patients’ opinions of their own function or disability. In some of the certificates additional free text information had been attached on separate sheets of paper. The amount of information given in the certificates varied from short notes on the two-page form to an extensive document with up to five full-written pages.</p>
<p>Certificates issued in PHC included a significantly greater number of diagnoses per certificate, <italic>n</italic> = 2.8 (CI 2.5–3.1), as compared to those issued at psychiatry or other secondary care, <italic>n</italic> = 1.7 (CI 1.3–2.2; <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.0001). Further, issuing physicians in PHC had, irrespective of main diagnosis group, a significantly (<italic>p</italic> = 0.009) more long-lasting professional relationship with their patients: 1356 days (CI 1055–1655) as compared to issuing psychiatric physicians 609 days (CI 379–838), and other specialized physicians 1075 days (CI 702–1448).

<p>The assessment of relevance and completeness of the medical descriptions of function and ability in the certificates was rated 6.1 (CI 5.9–6.3) on a 10-graded scale where 1 means completely insufficient and irrelevant information and 10 means completely sufficient and relevant.

<p>The quality also differed between main diagnosis groups in the subgroup of certificates issued in rimary care (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.0001). The quality of certificates issued in primary care with a locomotor main diagnosis was scored 5.4 (CI 5.0–5.8); with psychiatric main diagnoses 5.6 (CI 5.2–6.0) and with other main diagnoses 6.1 (CI 5.7–6.5).</p>
<p>The assessment of whether all parts of the requested information by the SIA were completed, whether there was implicit information that could be misunderstood and whether the information was easy to comprehend was rated 6.4 (CI 6.2–6.6) on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means that the certificate was hard to read and indistinct and 10 that the certificate was clear and easy to read.</p>
<p>The evaluation of whether indicated diagnosis and medical state was of relevance to the indicated functional impairment could not be performed in 46 (19%) of the certificates due to missing information of medical and/or functional state. The quality of the certificates where this information was given was rated 7.2 (CI 7.0–7.4) on a scale from 1 to 10. Similarly, the evaluation of whether a reduced function could be of relevance to the reduced working capacity could not be assessed in 66 (27%) of the certificates due to a lack of information of function and/or working capacity. The quality of the certificates where this information was given was rated 7.0 (CI 6.8–7.3) on a scale from 1 to 10, where one means marginal influence and 10 means critical impact on indicated work capacity.</p>

<title>Validity and reliability of the quality grading of the certificates</title>
<p>The content validity of the certificates is supposed to be high because the content represents what the National Board of Health and Welfare regulates and recommends as necessary regarding medical sickness-absence certification. The lack of an alternative standard of sickness-certification hinders an assessment of criterion and construct validity.</p>
<p>Validity between assessors was assessed by correlation coefficients. The grading of face validity (comprehension-ability and readability) of the different parts of the certificates correlated significantly to the grading of content given in the corresponding part of the certificate, with correlation coefficients varying between 0.86 and 0.97. However, grading of prognosis had a lower but significant correlation coefficient of 0.31.</p>
<p>Reliability was assessed as internal consistency by a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.87 concerning the scores on different sections of the certificates and 0.89 concerning global scores.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have identified important deficiencies in the quality of the evaluated medical certificates issued in cases of long-term sickness absence. The quality deficits were substantial both regarding the global quality of the certificates and the quality of different sections of the certificates, especially functional impairment, work capacity and prognosis. Medical certificates issued by primary-care physicians were rated to have a lower quality than certificates issued by physicians in secondary care. Issuing physicians in general practice had known their patients for a longer period of time and stated a greater number of additional diagnoses than physicians in secondary care. There were also significant quality differences between main diagnosis groups in the sub group of certificates issued in primary care. Irrespective of the main diagnosis, a large majority of the certificates contained descriptions of mental function impairments. The required description of work capacity was missing, inadequate or insufficient in half of the certificates.</p>
<p>Different certificate forms are used in different countries. The form used in Sweden in cases of long-term sickness absence focuses on the medical findings, the disabilities and the work capacity. Our findings indicate that it seems to be challenging to complete the form correctly when the patient reports medical problems with few objective findings. This might explain some of the deficiencies in the information provided and the low global quality in certificates issued in primary care. Primary care physicians might meet more patients with lack of objective findings as compared to secondary care. In the next step, the medical certificates are to be scrutinised by the SIA. A Swedish study pinpointed the importance that the non-medically trained clerk of the SIA, making decisions of sick leave benefits, should be able to understand the information as stated by the physicians in the certificates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813477928">12</xref>]. Social insurance officers have to handle three problem areas according to Ydreborg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813477928">13</xref>]: heterogeneous clients, inactive waiting for medical certificates impeding the decision process, and finally the different perspectives and attitudes concerning work capacity. An inference of this and of our results is that the certifying physician needs more support on how to assess work capacity in order to fulfil their insurance tasks. Guidelines including information on how to perform the paperwork of sickness-certificates are used in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813477928">2</xref>]. These guidelines provide information on the purpose of the certificate, and hints on how to complete it accurately. The purpose is to improve the efficiency of physicians, and to improve the quality of the certificates.</p>
<p>We found quality differences between certificates issued by different categories of physicians. These differences could be speculated to be due to differences in the case mix of clients. Physicians in general practice issue certificates for patients with a greater number of health problems as shown by the greater number of additional diagnoses. It is well known that patients with multiple morbidities are a greater challenge to handle professionally than patients with no co-morbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813477928">14</xref>]. Therefore, it is plausible that it is a harder task to formulate a medical certificate in complex patient cases with multiple health problems. This is a reasonable explanation of the lower-quality rating of certificates issued in primary care. The issuing of sickness-certificates in patients with composite health complaints was indeed regarded as challenging task in a Norwegian study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813477928">15</xref>]. The patients’ gender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494813477928">16</xref>] and socio-economical status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494813477928">17</xref>] are, besides additional diagnoses, other factors that have been shown to influence the decision-making process and create quality differences between certificates. In this study, there were no gender differences in quality ratings between certificates. Regarding socio-economical status, we lack information due to the de-identification of all certificates prior to analysis. Furthermore, several studies have found that some of the most important factors that influence physicians’ decision-making when issuing certificates are the patient’s ability to present their story, to evoke sympathy, the physician’s prior knowledge of the patient and the patient’s perceived motives for a reduced work capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813477928">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494813477928">18</xref>]. We can assume that the primary care physicians in this study had a greater prior knowledge of the patients due to a significantly more long-lasting professional relationship with their patients. In spite of this, the quality of the certificates was lower.</p>
<p>Only half of the certificates contained information concerning work capacity. The purpose of the form is really to evaluate a client’s work capacity now and in the future and if such fundamental information is missing, the certificate is useless. The legal security of a patient applying for a social security benefit is in such a case endangered. A Polish study stated that lack of certification guidelines, excessive preference on medical criteria – used to define functional disturbances – and insufficient consideration of occupational and economic aspects of an inability to work were main reasons explaining difficulties in the assessment of work capacity in disability pension certificates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494813477928">19</xref>]. In that study, the authors found that the term “inability to work” is not precisely defined, and that the standard of its assessment is inaccurate. These conclusions seem to be applicable to Sweden also.</p>
<p>Despite as main diagnosis, mental impairment seemed to contribute to long-term sickness-absence in a majority of the studied certificates. Another system function commonly affected was the senses and the nervous system, especially symptoms of pain. Descriptions of cognitive function were sparse, making it impossible to value a possible impact of cognitive dysfunction on work capacity, prognosis and certification. The great variability in the descriptions of functional state and the complex mix of several functional impairments increased the difficulties to assess work capacity. These matters need to be studied more thoroughly. Boer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494813477928">20</xref>] have pointed out how disability has been interpreted by social insurance physicians according to a concept that meets legal criteria: the “handicapped role”. They state that the model of disability, as described in the International Classification of Functioning (ICF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494813477928">21</xref>], can be drawn upon to explain the characteristics of the health condition of the “handicapped role”. The ICF is in addition helpful in the evaluation process, especially considering the question of consistency since the categories of the ICF model incorporates just that. The use of ICF in the certificates has a potential to increase the consistency of communication on functional impairment and work incapacity between the stakeholders of the evaluation process. This might be a way to improve the descriptions in the certificates. However, as Boer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494813477928">21</xref>] stated, ICF could not be applicable to the grounds of a fair trial, rehabilitation and compliance. To summarise, a total evaluation of work incapacity contains more factors than the ICF provides.</p>
<p>A limitation of the present study might be a potential selection bias in inclusion of medical certificates. The selection process might have resulted in an overrepresentation of certificates issued at health care units more interested in social insurance medicine. However, this would possibly mean that the quality would be even worse than in the present findings.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There is a need for improvement of the quality in important areas of medical certificates issued in cases of long-term sickness absence. The global quality was low and an unacceptable proportion of the certificates lacked information requested by the SIA. The quality was lower in certificates issued in primary care, which might be explained by different case-mixes of clients in primary and secondary care. The low quality has thereby complex reasons and further studies are needed in order to identify effective interventions to increase the quality and to secure patient safety and legal security.</p>
