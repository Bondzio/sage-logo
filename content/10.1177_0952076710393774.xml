<abstract>
<p>Following the UK's move to quasi-federalism in the 1990s, the Parliament and Assemblies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland gained powers over the promotion of equality of opportunity in the exercise of devolved functions. Constitutional law also placed human rights obligations on the regional administrations. Analysis reveals that the first years of devolution have seen a rapid growth and territorialization of regulatory bodies, such as commissioners, inspectorates, ombudsmen – whose remit includes these cross-cutting issues. Given the rise of distinctive sub-state ‘equalities infrastructures’ in the devolved nations, a key question is whether the dynamics of self-reinforcing feedback processes predicted by historical institutionalism offer the potential for more effective equality and human rights practice at the meso-level. While the discussion reveals a significant increase in the state's capacity to monitor and regulate, examples of innovation and policy transfer – and a cautious, yet generally positive, assessment by policy actors – a number of issues and shortcomings are also identified. These include limited government oversight and a lack of inter-agency coordination. Overall, the emerging evidence suggests that, from a functional institutionalist perspective, devolution has made advances in embedding the regulation of equality and human rights in the regional state; however, historical institutionalism indicates that, while devolution may be viewed as a ‘critical juncture’, notions of ‘path dependency’ towards more effective equalities practice are, as yet, unfounded and significant challenges remain.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0952076710393774" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The international literature suggests that regional governance may foster policy divergence and instances of innovation in equality and human rights practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0952076710393774">Skrentny, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0952076710393774">Grewcock, 2009</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0952076710393774">Shaman (2008</xref>: 3) observes, ‘a conception of equality [may emerge] that transcends the federal model of equal protection’; moreover, ‘while the federal notion of equality has become relatively static, its state counterpart is dynamic and, hence, responsive to the evolving needs of a changing society’. This paper explores developments in the UK. Here, recent analysis of the regulation of equality of human rights has centred on the creation of a single equalities body (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0952076710393774">Dimond, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0952076710393774">Niven, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0952076710393774">Micklem, 2009</xref>). However, the work of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is complemented by a broad range of new, devolved bodies because, following the move to quasi-federalism in the 1990s, the Parliament and Assemblies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland gained powers over the promotion of equality of opportunity in the exercise of devolved functions. Policy divergence on such matters became likely owing to the asymmetrical nature of the devolution settlement – with each administration having contrasting powers and responsibilities. This was further compounded by the equalities clauses in the respective devolution statutes; these set out different definitions of ‘protected characteristics’ (e.g. ‘race’, gender, social origin, disability, etc.).</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, the following discussion aims to chart the rise of new, ‘devolved’ public sector inspectorates, ombudsmen and commissioners concerned with the monitoring of equality and human rights so as to provide greater understanding of the impact of constitutional reform on the regulation of these cross-cutting issues. Thus the analysis adopts a neo-institutionalist approach; such a locus of enquiry is appropriate to understanding the changing nature of the contemporary state for public bodies have a key role in issues of equality. At worst they may further the hegemony of ruling elites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0952076710393774">Gramsci, 2007</xref>); sustain outmoded practices in public administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0952076710393774">O’Toole, 1984</xref>); or have a negative impact in shaping gender relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0952076710393774">Connell, 2007</xref>). However, when properly regulated they may effectively challenge prevailing inequalities and patterns of discrimination. Two branches of neo-institutionalism are employed here – functionalist and historical. In the former case, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0952076710393774">Thelen (1999)</xref> observes, ‘the question of why institutions emerge and are sustained has been answered in terms of the functions that they perform’ (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0952076710393774">Hall and Taylor, 1996</xref>). In the latter case, temporal analysis examines the socio-political implications of institutional change at ‘critical junctures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0952076710393774">Peters, 1999</xref>), such as at times of constitutional reform. Together, these branches of institutional theory facilitate the current investigation of a range of issues including the extent to which the territorialization of equalities bodies in the UK is fostering divergent practices and/or policy innovation; and whether there is emerging evidence that the growth of regional equalities infrastructure is resulting in self-reinforcing, positive feedback processes that offer the potential for more effective equality and human rights practice.</p>
<p>The remainder of this paper is structured thus: following a summary of the research methods, and an overview of the constitutional position of equalities and human rights in the polities of the UK, an outline of (neo-)institutionalist theory is presented. Attention is then focused on the nascent equalities and human rights ‘infrastructure’ in the devolved nations. Subsequently, the discussion explores the critical views of policy actors, and surveys the official reports of the devolved regulatory bodies in order to evaluate the issues, challenges and progress associated with the promotion and monitoring of equality and human rights at the meso-level.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0952076710393774" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>Mixed research methods were employed in gathering the data reported in the following discussion. Official documents were examined by using policy discourse analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0952076710393774">DeLeon, 1998</xref>). This is part of a post-empiricist, interpretative approach that places an emphasis on the language of policy documents in order that ‘ideas thus move to the centre of policy evaluation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0952076710393774">Fischer, 2003</xref>: 223). Using content and thematic analysis in this way allowed an appreciation of how policymakers formulate and construct problems; enabled focus on their claims and rhetoric; acknowledged that policy documents are complex exercises in agenda-setting power; and that policy issues may be framed in particular forms of language reflecting the political viewpoints of those in power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0952076710393774">Fischer and Forester, 1993</xref>: 5–7). Thus, an exhaustive survey was undertaken of post-devolution policy and law relating to the creation of the new, regional bodies concerned with the administration of equality and human rights.</p>
<p>This entailed analysis of approximately 150 policy documents and 50 devolved enactments. All were accessed electronically via the websites of the devolved governments and legislatures. This was complemented by document analysis of (circa 100) all key publications of the new, devolved institutions with an equalities and human rights remit – such as commissioners’ offices and audit bodies (e.g. annual reports, consultation exercises and evaluation studies). Throughout the document analysis appropriate software<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0952076710393774">1</xref></sup> facilitated keyword searches and thematic scrutiny illuminating the aims, issues and developments associated with the development of sub-state equalities infrastructures in each territory. Analysis was also made of the published transcripts of the plenary and committee proceedings of each devolved legislature. Boolean searches of their online archives allowed identification and analysis of all instances where the regulation of equality and human rights was discussed in proceedings.</p>
<p>In addition, a total of 31 semi-structured interviews was undertaken (2007–10) with a purposive sample of civil and civic society policy actors designed to span the equality ‘strands’ (e.g. ‘race’, gender, disability, etc.) in each country. Software coding<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0952076710393774">2</xref></sup> of the transcripts allowed exploration of key themes (e.g. issues around inter-agency coordination, capacity, knowledge transfer, etc.). The combination of policy discourse/document analysis and interview suits the present research aim for it allows the views of independent, non-state actors to be juxtaposed with official policy discourse and reports of the new sub-state regulatory bodies.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0952076710393774"><title>Context: the constitutional position of equalities and human rights in the polities of the UK</title>
<p>The constitutional design of the UK's devolved Parliament and Assemblies was influenced by a prevailing political concern to promote equality, inclusion and human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0952076710393774">Cabinet Office, 1999</xref>). Accordingly, the Scotland Act (1998) makes qualified provision for the Parliament to legislate and develop policy in relation to equalities. While not a duty on government, the Act states that the Scottish Parliament may advance ‘the encouragement (other than by prohibition or regulation) of equal opportunities, and in particular of the observance of the equal opportunities requirements’. Here, ‘equality of opportunity’ denotes ‘the preservation, elimination or regulation of discrimination between persons on grounds of sex, marital status, on racial grounds, or on grounds of disability, age, sexual orientation, language or social origin, or other personal attributes, including beliefs or political opinions’.</p>
<p>The general equality duty in the Government of Wales Act is unique because of its non-specific phrasing and all-embracing scope; it applies to all people and all functions of government. It modifies all Westminster Acts of Parliament where the National Assembly/Welsh government has powers in its exercise and implementation. Moreover, the devolution Act requires that Welsh ministers ‘must make a code of practice setting out their policy on … the carrying out of regulatory impact assessments (RIA) in connection with relevant Welsh legislation’ – including ‘due regard to the general equality duty’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0952076710393774">Welsh Assembly Government (WAG), 2008</xref>: 6). Thus, regardless of the subject matter, all devolved enactments must be compatible with the need for due regard that there be equality of opportunity for all people.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act (1998) places on government (and designated public bodies) an active duty to promote equalities. Under its provisions they are required to have due regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity ‘between persons of different religious belief, political opinion, racial group, age, marital status or sexual orientation; between men and women generally; between persons with a disability and persons without; and, between persons with dependants and persons without’. Each body must thus have an equality scheme in place, a plan for performance of the duty, and must assess (and publish a report on) the equality impact of their policies. If a public authority's assessment shows a possible ‘adverse impact’ on any protected group, it must consider how this might be reduced, and how an alternative policy might lessen any adverse impact that the policy may have (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0952076710393774">Equality Commission for Northern Ireland (ECNI), 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although not the focus of the present discussion, it is necessary to outline briefly the situation pertaining to England (and in respect of non-devolved matters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). Here, prior to the Equality Act (2010), a series of statutes obliged the UK government and listed public bodies to promote equality on grounds of ‘race’, age, disability, faith (and non-belief), gender, and for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0952076710393774">3</xref></sup> The 2010 statute has had the effect of consolidating the law and extending the range of ‘protected’ characteristics. Notwithstanding this development, a striking aspect of the new governance arrangements is the asymmetrical nature of equalities law in the unitary state. Notably, throughout the first decade of devolution, a broader range of protected characteristics applied in the devolved polities than the six principal grounds in England.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0952076710393774">4</xref></sup> This is even more significant because each of the devolved legislatures has passed a burgeoning number of laws that place territorially-specific equalities duties on subordinate public sector bodies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0952076710393774">5</xref></sup> In turn, devolved inspectorates are charged with monitoring how such bodies comply with these ‘local’ enactments – as well as GB equality law.</p>
<p>Constitutional law also places human rights obligations on the respective administrations through the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into the devolution statutes. Thus, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish Ministers have no power to make, confirm or approve any legislation, or to do any other act, so far as it is incompatible with the Convention. Moreover, statute requires the respective devolved administrations to act in accordance with European Community law and the UK's international obligations, such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0952076710393774"><title>Institutional theory, equality and human rights</title>
<p>Institutional theory provides an appropriate framework for the present analysis for, at the simplest level, it emphasizes the need to locate public policymaking and service delivery in an organizational context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0952076710393774">Selznick, 1996</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0952076710393774">Clemens and Cook (1999</xref>: 460) observe: ‘the analysis of institutional change rests on an appreciation of the heterogeneity of institutional arrangements and the resulting patterns of conflict or prospects for agency and innovation’. Allied to this, functionalist institutional theory allows governance structures to be interrogated according to the role that institutions perform in relation to the wider operation of the state, and, crucially, to gain insight into the way that different social groups and interests benefit from particular institutional arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0952076710393774">Thelen, 2004</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0952076710393774">March and Olsen (1984</xref>: 738) explain:<disp-quote><p>Political democracy depends … on the design of political institutions … [they] are arenas for contending social forces, but they are also collections of standard operating procedures and structures that define and defend interests. They are political actors in their own right.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In such a way public institutions may be seen as ‘places of constant struggle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0952076710393774">Thelen, 2004</xref>: 143); for, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0952076710393774">Squires (2005</xref>: 380) notes, their practices and procedures have a core role in ‘enabling excluded groups to unsettle [hitherto] institutionally accepted conceptions of equality [something that … ] makes democratic inclusion central to both the meaning and realization of equality’. In short, functionalist institutionalist thought ‘requires examination of the organization and interests of the state, specification of the organization and interests of socio-economic groups and, into the complementary as well as conflicting relationships of state and societal actors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0952076710393774">Skocpol, 1979</xref>: 136). Such a view captures the regulatory function of public bodies in relation to social priorities such as the promotion of equality and human rights (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0952076710393774">Nanton, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0952076710393774">Tamara, 1998</xref>). Thus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0952076710393774">Steinmo et al. (1992</xref>: 9) observe: ‘institutions are not just another variable … By shaping not just actors’ strategies but their goals as well, and by mediating their relations of cooperation and conflict, institutions structure political situations and leave their own imprint on political outcomes’. Accordingly, a series of authors have engaged with state equalities practices using neo-institutionalist theory, including: gender inequality (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0952076710393774">Chappell, 2002</xref>); disablism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0952076710393774">Mur et al., 2005</xref>); racism (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0952076710393774">Floya, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0952076710393774">Symon, 1999</xref>); and equality for lesbian, gay and bisexual people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0952076710393774">Monro, 2007</xref>). It should also be noted that institutional aims and values are shaped by exogenous social processes such as activism by new social movements. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0952076710393774">Koelble (1995</xref>: 235) observes,<disp-quote><p>cultural fields, which define concepts such as justice, equality, and democracy, influence organizational choices. These cultural fields offer a variety of symbolic and cultural systems from which organizations choose. Their choices are then reflected in the structures, functions, and goals of the organization.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As noted, historical institutionalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0952076710393774">Peters, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0952076710393774">Bell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0952076710393774">Staffen, 2005</xref>) is a further school of thought employed in the following discussion; for this temporal perspective examines the socio-political implications of institutional change at ‘critical junctures’, such as times of constitutional reform. Such a conceptual framework is suited to present purposes because, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0952076710393774">Ikegami (1995</xref>: 33) observes, ‘new institutional frameworks resulting from state-making transform a society's wider cultural environment in critical and unforeseen ways’. Central to this view is the notion of ‘path dependence’ (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0952076710393774">Collier and Collier, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0952076710393774">Ertman, 1997</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0952076710393774">Pierson and Skocpol (2002</xref>: 6) explain, this refers to:<disp-quote><p>the dynamics of self-reinforcing or positive feedback processes in a political system … a clear logic is involved in strictly defined path dependent processes: Outcomes at a ‘critical juncture’ trigger feedback mechanisms that reinforce the recurrence of a particular pattern into the future … events or processes occurring during and immediately following critical junctures emerge as crucial.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In the case of post-devolution developments in the UK, not only did state restructuring in the 1990s transform the governance arrangements of a hitherto centralized state, it was significantly accompanied by a political discourse of ‘inclusiveness’, ‘equality’ and ‘social justice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0952076710393774">Levitas, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0952076710393774">Chaney and Fevre, 2001</xref>). In turn, such policy priorities shaped both the institutional ‘blueprints’ of the devolved legislatures (as witnessed, for example, by the inclusion of equality and human rights clauses in the devolution statutes), and, as will be demonstrated, the comparatively rapid growth of a regional state ‘infrastructure’ designed to monitor and uphold equality and human rights. Accordingly, the present discussion is concerned to explore the latter's form, functioning – and future prospects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0952076710393774">6</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0952076710393774"><title>The equalities and human rights infrastructure in the devolved territories</title>
<p>European Commission (EC) Directives<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0952076710393774">7</xref></sup> and domestic developments such as the Macpherson Report<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0952076710393774">8</xref></sup> underline the salience of multi-level governance to advancing the regulation of equality and human rights. Thus, over recent decades, the need for robust equalities inspection regimes has featured in the policy prescriptions of different tiers of government. In response, the present can be seen as a period characterized not only by the territorialization of such administrative bodies but also by growing functional specialization.</p>
<p>In the case of post-devolution Scotland, the regulatory infrastructure is extensive and diverse. In terms of language equality, created in 2006, the Gaelic Language Board has a monitoring and quasi-enforcement role such that it can require a public body to draft and implement a Gaelic language plan and issue Mandatory Orders on compliance. On other matters, the role of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments is to ensure that: ‘the appointments process will promote and demonstrate equality of opportunity and treatment to all applicants’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0952076710393774">OCPAS, 2006</xref>: 34). On fiscal affairs, the Auditor General for Scotland and the Accounts Commissions’ remits include a focus on public bodies’ adherence to equalities principles. Evidence of the developing nature of the equalities infrastructure is provided by the creation (from 2011) of Social Care and Social Work Improvement Scotland (SCSWIS) and Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS); their statutory obligations include the inspection of ‘inclusion, equality and fairness in service delivery’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0952076710393774">SWIA, 2007</xref>: 6). In terms of criminal justice, HM Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland (HMICS) carries out scheduled and thematic inspections, including those on equalities issues (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0952076710393774">HMICS, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0952076710393774">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>HM Inspectorate of Education's current set of quality indicators for secondary schools inspection includes: ‘approaches to inclusion; promoting equality and fairness; and ensuring equality and fairness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0952076710393774">HMIE, 2007</xref>: 28). Further key institutional developments include Additional Support Needs Tribunals for Scotland (ASNT) (created in 2005) and Scotland's Commissioner for Children and Young People (founded in 2004). Last, the Scottish Human Rights Commission's remit includes the promotion of best practice on human rights; reviewing and recommending changes to the law and policy; and conducting inquiries into the policies or practice of public bodies.</p>
<p>In Wales, constitutional reform has also seen the creation of a series of new public agencies with varying forms of equalities remit including: the Care and Social Services Inspectorate, which enforces the statutory requirement that ‘children and young people, and their families, are provided with foster care services which value diversity and promote equality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0952076710393774">SSIW, 2004</xref>: 24). In terms of language equality, under the provisions of the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure (2010), a new regulator, the Welsh Language Commissioner, will replace the existing Welsh Language Board and gain broader powers.</p>
<p>Established in 2001, the Children's Commissioner for Wales (CCfW) was the first independent statutory commissioner of its type in the UK with powers to review the effect of policies on, and the delivery of services to, children and young people. A further policy innovation is Older People's Commissioner for Wales (OPCfW), whose official remit includes advocacy and support, and the elimination of discrimination. Other examples of devolved inspectorates include the Wales Audit Office and the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales. The former's remit includes the promotion of diversity, equal opportunities and human rights; while the latter's Principles of Good Administration include ‘treating people without unlawful discrimination or prejudice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0952076710393774">PSOW, 2009</xref>: iv). In addition, the Special Educational Needs Tribunal for Wales (SENTW) was created in 2003, replacing the previous ‘England and Wales’ body. It provides a further illustration of the way that devolution is introducing contrasting rights and protections in the devolved territories. In response to the findings of a critical UK-wide UN report on human rights that stated, children ‘have no right to appeal the decisions of a special educational needs tribunal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0952076710393774">United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women UNCEDW, 2008</xref>: 15), primary legislation passed by the Assembly in 2009 made children in Wales the first in the UK to gain the direct right to appeal.</p>
<p>As noted, the Equality and Human Rights Commission is the Great Britain-wide compliance authority.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0952076710393774">10</xref></sup> Reflecting devolution, it has statutory Scotland and Wales Committees with reserved functions. Recent analysis concludes that the EHRC<disp-quote><p>enjoys an historic opportunity’ because the fourth generation duties that it is required to enforce ‘go beyond the negative notion of anti-discrimination towards a more positive, value-driven conception of equal participation [and this] offers the best chance of fruitful coalition with a human rights approach.

<p>Foremost in Northern Ireland's equalities infrastructure is the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland (ECNI) with a responsibility to oversee compliance with the ‘Section 75’ equality duty. Its work is complemented by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) with a remit that includes promoting awareness of human rights, reviewing existing law and practice and advising government. On the contentious issue of public appointments, the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments for Northern Ireland (OCPANI) provides guidance for devolved government; its policy framework refers to ‘recognis[ing] the need for diversity to be rigorously addressed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0952076710393774">OCPANI, 2008</xref>: 24).</p>
<p>Other devolved monitoring bodies include the Northern Ireland Social Care Council (NISCC) and, in respect of healthcare, the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority. The former's core principles include ‘equity and fairness: supporting equality of opportunity and valuing diversity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0952076710393774">NISCC, 2008</xref>: 6); while the latter's require ‘equality of opportunity and ensuring that positive outcomes for service users and staff are promoted’ (Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety Northern Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0952076710393774">DHSSPSNI, 2006</xref>: 56)). A development that illustrates policy transfer between the devolved territories came in the wake of the establishment of the Older People's Commissioner for Wales; namely, the creation in 2008, of the Older People's Advocate (as an interim measure pending the establishment and appointment of a Northern Ireland Commissioner for Older People).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0952076710393774"><title>Critical views of policy actors</title>
<p>Against the background of the comparatively rapid rise of the devolved state equalities and human rights infrastructures the views of policy actors (drawn from civil and civic organizations) are of value in making a preliminary assessment of progress and future prospects for the development of effective equality and human rights practice at the meso-level. This is particularly the case because each of the devolved administrations has espoused a ‘mainstreaming’ approach to promoting equality and human rights (crucially, this is predicated on the engagement and participation of a diverse range of actors and interest collectivities in policy work and public service delivery – see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0952076710393774">Chaney, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, reflecting on the work of the EHRC Wales, the views of a manager of a disabled people's non- government organization (NGO) indicate that the new sub-state bodies/structures are responsive to the policy demands of NGOs. She said,<disp-quote><p>I think it's generally positive, the Commission took a while to find its feet … yet, things like the Formal Inquiry [into disability-related harassment announced in 2009] show that it's starting to address things that are important to our members; that's something we’d pushed hard for.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0952076710393774">11</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>An executive officer with an age equality organization also felt that gains had been made through the transfer of personnel (and therefore values and expertise) between NGOs and the new regulatory bodies: ‘we’ve worked with them [named inspectorate], it's good to note that they are listening, I suppose that comes from having members drawn from organizations like ours – you know, campaigners’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0952076710393774">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, others were less sanguine about recent developments. Reflecting work that highlights the role of trust in fostering effective equality and human rights governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0952076710393774">Fennema and Tillie, 2000</xref>), one ‘race’ equality manager with an NGO said:<disp-quote><p>we’ve always struggled to get our views heard, but in some ways I think in the past couple of years we’ve gone backwards … we had good relations with [named official] in the CRE [Commission for Racial Equality] he knew ‘where we were coming from’, there was a trust thing, I think that's gone.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0952076710393774">13</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A manager with a language rights NGO made a point raised by several interviewees; she was highly critical of a perceived lack of coordination and co-working between the constituent organizations in the sub-state equalities infrastructures. In this case she was dissatisfied with what she saw as the failure of the EHRC and Welsh Language Board to work together:<disp-quote><p>it's in Article 14 [i.e. freedom from discrimination on the basis of language in the ECHR incorporated – into the Human Rights Act, 1998] with the Commission [EHRC] I – and I’m not alone in this – we’d thought, here's an opportunity to co-work, co-ordinate – that is – using the ‘93 [Welsh Language] Act and the Human Rights Act – it hasn’t happened; [it’s] a failure in my view.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0952076710393774">14</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A local authority equalities officer made a similar point, observing ‘what worries us at the authority level is that services are monitored equalities-wise by different bodies – there's a load of different standards and regs’. Another language campaigner pointed to the comparatively rapid pace of change at the sub-state level. Referring to the Welsh Language Measure (2010) she said:<disp-quote><p>I think this is a fateful time, but we’ve still got to fight … if it does deliver equal status [i.e. for the Welsh and English languages in law] and the Commissioner [the proposed statutory office of Welsh Language Commissioner] we’ve made a massive step forward’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0952076710393774">15</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Others, such as an executive with a disabled people's organization in Scotland, also saw the post-devolution developments in a positive light because of the territorialization of equality and human rights and the degree of autonomy this afforded. He said:<disp-quote><p>all the pre – [UK 2010 general] election stuff about revoking the Human Rights Act … our members were clear, thank God it's in the Act [i.e. devolution statute, Scotland Act, 1998], I don’t think they’d thought it through, it wasn’t for them to say, not as far as Scotland goes anyway.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0952076710393774">16</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Others felt that, notwithstanding the new devolved equalities bodies, some regulators were not giving sufficient weight to inspecting equality in service delivery. The manager of a Scottish NGO said: ‘you take residential care, it's just “tick-box” – it needs to look at the equalities side a whole lot more … it boils down to two things – funds and management’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0952076710393774">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some sceptical voices were also evident among equality and human rights bodies in Northern Ireland. A lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) campaigner said: ‘at the end of the day what difference has it made? Yeah, they “talk the talk”, but when it comes to it, attitudes are the same’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0952076710393774">18</xref></sup> Yet others were more equivocal. For example a manager with a women's NGO observed:<disp-quote><p>there's been some change, for one there's this general idea that groups like ours should be involved in policy, [public] services and the rest, but what have they done on [equal] pay? Look at the managers – [it’s] still all [men in] “suits”, that's where the Commission [ECNI] could have moved us on.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0952076710393774">19</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A member of a disabled people's NGO said:<disp-quote><p>I was all for Good Friday [i.e. the agreement that re-established devolved government]; I had hopes … some stuff has changed for the better – we as an organisation have been asked what we think on policy – there's some good people in DENI [Department for Education Northern Ireland] but I’d say the Commission's not really pushed on policy outcomes, you know, impact.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0952076710393774">20</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A campaigner with a women's NGO made a similar point and observed that equalities practices related to the S.75 equality duty had ‘become “techy” … [equality] impact assessments, [equality] schemes, monitoring, compliance – and that's ok. I’m just worried we lose sight of the difference it all makes’?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0952076710393774">21</xref></sup> In terms of belief, the manager with a community faith-based organization said:<disp-quote><p>it's better now, it is, but it's got a long way to go … for me it's the ‘good relations’ side [i.e. the public duty under Northern Ireland Act S.75, s.2]<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0952076710393774">22</xref></sup> that's key, the Commission [ECNI] didn’t really follow that one through … it's the way to make change.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0952076710393774">23</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0952076710393774"><title>Emerging evidence: monitoring and evaluating equality and human rights</title>
<p>Analysis of the official reports of the new devolved regulators and monitoring bodies – as well as the published transcripts of parliamentary proceedings – provide further insight into the extent to which equality and human rights are being upheld in the delivery of devolved public policy and services. For example oral evidence presented to the Scottish Parliament by Scotland's Commissioner for Children and Young People identified a number of issues and policy priorities including: the need for ‘better awareness and understanding of the UNCRC [UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]’; ‘we must do a lot better with our children who are in care’; address ‘discrimination … [against] disabled children and … looked-after children’; and end child poverty. The Commissioner's overall assessment of the impact of devolution was that: ‘significant inroads have been made … although that reduction has not been nearly big enough and has not been accompanied by a reduction in inequality’ (Scottish Parliament, 2009).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0952076710393774">24</xref></sup> On other matters, analysis by the Office of Commissioner for Public Appointments revealed poor progress; of those appointed in 2008–9, just 1.3 per cent were from an ethnic minority background, 7.8 per cent declared a disability and 36 per cent were women. Reflecting the views of other policy actors (see above), in the Commissioner's assessment there were issues around political leadership and coordination in the monitoring of devolved equalities practice:<disp-quote><p>the Scottish Government has work to do to provide the people of Scotland with an appointments process that attracts a wide range of applicants … The ability and enthusiasm to increase diversity exist and the challenge will be one of harnessing these to deliver the required improvements. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0952076710393774">OCPAS, 2009</xref>: 6)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>With regard to criminal justice, HM Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland reported considerable ongoing challenges, for while the proportion of female police officers continues to rise (constituting ‘a little over one in four of all police officers in 2008–09’), it noted:<disp-quote><p>we are unable to provide a Scotland-wide figure for declared disabled police officers and staff, but proportions recorded by individual forces range from 0% to 1.9% … although the actual number of black or minority ethnic police recruits has not changed from 2007–08, the numbers as a proportion of all police officers have fallen to just over one per cent. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0952076710393774">HMICS, 2009</xref>: 14)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, the education inspectorate highlights some progress: ‘many establishments have strengthened their policies in relation to diversity, equality and fairness as a result of our inspections’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0952076710393774">HMIE, 2010</xref>: 18); while according to the Gaelic Language Board (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0952076710393774">GLB, 2009</xref>: 20): ‘Gaelic Medium Education continued to record annual increases in the number of pupils accessing early years, primary and secondary education through the medium of Gaelic’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0952076710393774">25</xref></sup> In terms of additional support needs, the ASN Tribunals for Scotland also reported advances, the number of references to the tribunals has decreased from a peak of 76 in 2007–8 to 54 in 2009–10; the majority was in relation to issues around the provision of coordinated support plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0952076710393774">ASNTS, 2010</xref>: 34).</p>
<p>Against this background the Scottish Human Rights Commission has called for changes in the law to address deficiencies in co-working between the devolved equality and human rights bodies:<disp-quote><p>the importance of linking human rights and equality is fundamental to ensuring the delivery of both. Human rights law and standards fill the gaps emerging from an approach relating solely to equality … a single integrated approach makes sense for public authorities: it is coherent, it increases the effectiveness of public service delivery.

<p>In terms of overall equalities practice, an evaluation commissioned by the EHRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0952076710393774">EHRC Scotland, 2009</xref>: v–vi) identified mixed progress. Inter alia, it concluded that since devolution ‘there has been greater awareness and understanding of equality issues and capacity building through, for example, equality training and secondments across the public sector’; and a ‘move to a more equality sensitive culture within public authorities’. Yet it also identified a range of problems, including: ‘a lack of follow-through in respect of reporting and monitoring on equality matters’; ‘a need for positive leadership from the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government … [this is] important to making a difference to how public authorities consider and act on equality matters’; and the need for greater ‘strategic interventions that codify standards and competencies for the delivery of equality training in the public sector’.</p>
<p>In Wales, the Children's Commissioner has raised a number of issues, including: the need to<disp-quote><p>prohibit as a matter of priority all corporal punishment in the family, including the repeal of all legal defences … The current situation simply does not comply with the principles and provisions of the UNCRC and this issue must not be laid to rest and I urge both Welsh and UK politicians to keep this high on their agenda. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0952076710393774">CCfW, 2009</xref>: 62)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Recent publications also reveal the policy influence of the new regulators, for example, the latest report of the Commissioner for Older People concluded: ‘the Commissioner encouraged the [Welsh] government to include the UN Principles on Older People in their Single Equality Scheme … [following its adoption by government] we can examine how the policies and actions of the government reflect this commitment in future’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0952076710393774">OPCfW, 2009</xref>: 14). On education policy, the schools inspectorate identified areas of progress and good practice; yet it also highlighted a series of ongoing concerns including: ‘too often, staff in schools … do not assess the language needs of ethnic minority children as soon as they arrive in school’; ‘schools, mainly where numbers of ethnic minority pupils are low, did not see the development of race equality policy and practice as a priority. This is a cause for concern’; and ‘only a few schools tracked the progress of their pupils by minority ethnic group well’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0952076710393774">Estyn, 2009</xref>: 11). In contrast, there is evidence of progress in relation to additional learning needs; over recent years there has been a fall in the number of cases brought to the Special Educational Needs Tribunal for Wales (2005–6: 150; 2008–9: 92). However, 77 per cent of all appeals that went to a full hearing were upheld (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0952076710393774">WAG, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A general evaluation of equalities and human rights practice commissioned by the EHRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0952076710393774">EHRC Wales, 2009</xref>: vii–xiv) identified mixed progress. Among its main findings was that: ‘in the wake of devolution there has been a significant raft of policies on equalities across the breadth of devolved functions’; ‘there has been a broadening of the focus on equalities beyond the initial focus on “race”, disability and gender’; and that ‘the issue of a policy “implementation gap” continues to be a major concern in some areas of devolved policy making’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0952076710393774">EHRC Wales, 2009</xref>: vii–xiii). The latter point is borne out in the reports of a number of inspectorates and regulators. For example one questioned: ‘how to measure/assess progress towards being a “truly bilingual nation”? What consideration has been given to this at a senior level within the Welsh Assembly Government/senior civil service in Wales?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0952076710393774">Arad Consulting and Evans, 2007</xref>: 46).</p>
<p>In Northern Ireland, a number of studies allow an assessment of equality and human rights regulation and practice. For example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0952076710393774">McLaughlin and Faris (2004</xref>: 55) found that the equality duty in the devolution Act ‘is proving effective in moving authorities towards compliance and mainstreaming of equality within the public sector’. However, another official review found that its impact was largely process-driven rather than focusing on outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0952076710393774">Chaney and Rees, 2004</xref>). A subsequent evaluation by the Equality Commission was more sanguine, concluding that the duty ‘has transformed the policymaking process, making it more inclusive, more evidence-based and, as a result, more informed’. However, it added ‘despite this … public authorities are generally poor at demonstrating policy outcomes arising from the mainstreaming processes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0952076710393774">ECNI, 2007</xref>: 37). The latter point was supported by an independent audit of public bodies’ legal compliance; it found that they were generally failing to demonstrate compliance with the equality duty in their policy work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0952076710393774">Reeves Associates, 2007</xref>). Notwithstanding this, the review concluded in positive terms, stating that:<disp-quote><p>in a relatively short period of time, it has, indeed, been effective in achieving something of a transformation in the development and delivery of public policy. Section 75 has effected substantial cultural change in the institutions of government and, in particular, in how public policy is made. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0952076710393774">ECNI, 2007</xref>: 80)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In response to the identified shortcomings, the ECNI has determined to ‘amend its approach to progress reporting to require public authorities to measure the impact of mainstreaming equality on policy outcomes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0952076710393774">ECNI, 2007</xref>: 46). In addition, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission continues to raise a number of issues in relation to contemporary equality and human rights practice, such as: ‘concerns about women and girls in prison including appropriate health provision, alternatives to custody and the longstanding need for a separate women's prison facility’; ‘concerns about appropriate measures to respond to violence against women including the need for domestic violence courts’; and that ‘more needs to be done to ensure that the key principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child are fully integrated into law, policy and practice in Northern Ireland’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0952076710393774">NIHRC, 2009</xref>: 35–7).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0952076710393774" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The past decade has seen the comparatively rapid growth of devolved public bodies, such as commissions, inspectorates and ombudsmen that have the monitoring and/or enforcement of equalities and human rights within their remits. Thus, as a result of constitutional reform, there has been territorial divergence in the regulatory framework on these cross-cutting issues. For example the National Health Service Reform (Scotland) Act (2004) places a duty on Health Boards to prevent discrimination based on the Scotland Act definition of equality; in Wales the Children's Commissioner (and, under draft legislation, Welsh government ministers)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0952076710393774">26</xref></sup> are legally bound to exercise their functions in accordance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. In Northern Ireland, a separate Equality Commission operates to uphold public sector compliance with the comprehensive and territorially-specific ‘section 75’ equality duty. The past decade has also seen examples of policy innovation and policy transfer in the monitoring and regulation of equalities and human rights. Prominent examples include the devolved commissioners’ offices for children, and for older people – and the Welsh/Gaelic languages.</p>
<p>As the foregoing discussion suggests, from a theoretical perspective, functional institutionalism has utility in understanding the implications of devolution for the administration of equality and human rights. This is because it allows state structures to be critiqued according to the extent to which they allow for a redistribution of power and the advancement of the interests of groups traditionally targeted by equality of opportunity initiatives. Such an approach requires holistic examination of institutional developments in order to appreciate ‘the heterogeneity of institutional arrangements and the resulting … prospects for agency and innovation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0952076710393774">Clemens and Cook, 1999</xref>: 460). It also allows governance structures to be interrogated according to the role that devolved institutions perform in relation to the wider operation of the unitary state, and, crucially, to gain insight into the way that different social groups and interests benefit from particular institutional arrangements at the meso-level (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0952076710393774">Thelen, 2004</xref>). In this respect the present analysis reveals that constitutional reform has resulted in the increasing embeddedness of equalities and human rights regulation, accompanied by functional specialization, and a significant increase in state capacity to monitor these issues at the ‘regional’ level.</p>
<p>However, the comparatively rapid rise of regional state equality and human rights infrastructures also underpins the need for a temporal perspective. In this regard, historical institutionalist theory suggests that devolution is a ‘critical juncture’ in this area of public administration, and that post-1998–9 developments will in turn shape future practice and prospects. It is here that the two strands of institutional theory interconnect, for functional analysis of the work of the new regional regulators reveals mixed progress and identifies a number of significant issues and shortcomings. These include ongoing patterns of inequality and discrimination in public service delivery; limited government oversight; (in some cases) inadequate institutional powers; and, crucially, a lack of inter-agency coordination. The importance of these issues relates to historical institutionalist thinking and the concepts of ‘self-reinforcing feedback processes’ and ‘path dependency’. In other words, continuing benign effects – or a ‘virtuous circle’, are seen to operate when there is effective co-working between institutions. While, from a functionalist perspective, the impact of devolution has been positive (e.g. greater capacity to monitor and regulate equality and human rights in ways that meet ‘local’ needs), it is argued that deficiencies in oversight, coordination and knowledge transfer between regulatory bodies signals the general absence of self-reinforcing feedback processes predicted by historical institutionalist theory – such that the notion of ‘path dependency’ towards more effective equality and human rights practice at the meso-level is currently unsupported by the emerging evidence.</p>
<p>In terms of future development (short-to-medium term) of the administration of equality and human rights at the regional level, as noted, there is an ongoing process of developing capacity with an increasing number of specialized bodies. Moreover, the national Scotland and Wales Committees of the EHRC, together with the delegated responsibilities to Welsh and Scottish ministers set out in the Equality Act (2010) – including, from 2011, setting the terms of future public sector equality duties in the two countries – also suggest greater policy divergence and future differences in the way GB statutes apply to devolved functions in Wales and Scotland. Equally significant is the territorial dimension to future change. Thus the UK government's forthcoming Scotland Bill (in response to the Calman review of Scottish devolution) and the 2011 referendum on revised primary law-making practices for the National Assembly for Wales – both evidence the ongoing accumulation of greater powers and competencies by the devolved administrations and legislatures. In turn, this will also increase divergence in administrative practices – first, as the devolved governments are required to apply equality impact assessments to all Welsh, Scottish and Northern Ireland legislation (based on the differing definitions of equality in the devolution statutes) – and, second, because of the devolved governments’ growing powers to set standards and service delivery requirements across an increasing array of devolved public bodies. In addition, in each territory, electoral politics will continue to drive policy divergence in the promotion of equality and human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0952076710393774">Chaney, 2007</xref>) – as distinctive ‘local’ issues and agendas shape manifesto commitments and subsequent government policy programmes. Accordingly, the experience of the past decade suggests that cumulative and incremental process of territorial divergence in the administration of equality and human rights will not only continue, it will accelerate, in turn offering differential rights, practices and protections in the constituent polities of the UK.</p></sec>
