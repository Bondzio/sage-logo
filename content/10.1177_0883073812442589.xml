<p>High-functioning adolescents and young adults with mitochondrial disease are now attempting transitions to postsecondary environments. This pilot and case study explores factors that interfere with their successful transition through behavior-rating scales addressing academic skills and behavior. In the <italic>Behavior Assessment System for Children</italic>, Second Edition, Spearman correlation matrices showed that students’ attitude to school was associated with depression and anxiety. Mothers’ reports linked internalizing disorders with somatic symptoms. Two case studies, with Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function profiles, show the role executive functions play in academic success. Attention to both cognitive and psychiatric concerns may increase success in academics and enhance the sense of well-being in older students with mitochondrial disease.</p>

<body>
<p>Mitochondrial diseases, a large heterogeneous collection of disorders that involve disruption of energy production, are now considered to be the most common metabolic disease. The population prevalence is estimated at 1 in 5000 births.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812442589">1</xref>

Familiarity with the range and course of cognitive and behavioral patterns associated with these illnesses is critical to facilitate effective transitions through high school and to college. Targeted strategies and accommodations may then support a successful college experience. The late adolescent and young adult population, in particular, may “fall through the cracks,” between pediatric and adult primary care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812442589">5</xref></sup> Unique difficulties they may face as they attempt to perform developmentally expected activities such as going to college may not be anticipated by physicians, mental health providers, academic support staff, or their families.</p>
<p>This article will describe a pilot study of adolescents and young adults with mitochondrial disease, and suggestions to help facilitate effective transition to higher educational environments will be offered. Two case studies will be presented, illustrating the need for an integrated approach to support postsecondary study, as well as support for transitions, in general, for these students.</p>

<title>What Is Mitochondrial Disease and How Does It Affect Students?</title>
<p>Through advances in molecular biology, biochemical methodologies, and genetics, inborn errors of metabolism have been recognized with greater frequency over the past decades. Many can produce serious or life-threatening illness early in life. Known mitochondrial syndromes have clusters of symptoms that are readily identifiable to the physician, although they may not be easily recognizable unless they present in their most severe form. More mild variants can be found in individuals who may struggle with a multiplicity of medical issues, but who continue to have the resources and determination to seek postsecondary education and employment.</p>
<p>Neuropsychological evaluation can be valuable in delineating where accommodation is needed. Although some metabolic disorders, such as phenylketonuria (PKU) and galactosemia, have specific patterns of cognitive dysfunction associated with them,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812442589">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812442589"/>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812442589"/>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812442589"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812442589">10</xref></sup> mitochondrial diseases are a very heterogeneous group, with variation not only among types of disease but also among individuals with the same genetic mutation. Under these conditions, the role of the neuropsychologist is that of a team member, delineating cognitive strengths and weaknesses at a particular point in time, and then providing recommendations not only to school but also to family and work settings. These recommendations are part of a team “package,” where attention to other factors such as intermittent fatigue, autonomic dysfunction, and a wide variety of central nervous system and medical problems are the norm. An understanding of the basic nature of mitochondrial disorders and types of deficits that can be associated with them is crucial to the individuals working in a postsecondary environment. Educators, neuropsychologists, and learning specialists may then participate as team members, pairing with their health service colleagues on campus, as well as with metabolic and genetic specialists and neurologists, in the support of these young adults.</p>
<p>Mitochondria in the cell serve to convert chemical energy provided by food to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. Electrons that result are passed through the electron transport chain complexes that are intimately involved in ATP synthesis. The energy from mitochondria powers muscular action and other energy-demanding organs such as the brain. Most individuals with primary mitochondrial disease have deficits in the 5 multiprotein complexes (complex I-V) found on the inner membrane of mitochondria. Most of the 87 genes known to be involved are of the nuclear genome; the potential role of additional regulatory genes is currently unknown. Thirteen are derived from mitochondrial DNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812442589">11</xref></sup> Mitochondrial DNA is circular and double stranded, inherited solely through the maternal line. Thus, although most mitochondrial diseases are inherited through Mendelian genetics, and the majority are inherited through autosomal recessive mechanisms, the mechanism of inheritance can be diverse: Some are also autosomal dominant, X-linked, or inherited through maternal mitochondrial DNA alone. Mitochondrial dysfunction can not only be found when there are problems that genetically impact on the electron transport chain but also when other pathways in the mitochondria, such as fatty acid oxidation or amino acid metabolism, are affected. Medications and toxins can affect mitochondrial activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812442589">12</xref></sup> In addition, spontaneous or sporadic mutations in adulthood can lead to such disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812442589">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812442589">14</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Individuals, even those in the same family with the same mutation, can show great variety in the clinical manifestation of disease. When the disease is transmitted through Mendelian genetics, the severity of the disease may be relatively consistent among family members. However, if inherited through mitochondrial DNA, the concept of heteroplasmy may apply. In heteroplasmy, a single cell may contain a mix of mutant and normal DNA. The proportion of mutated mitochondria passed on to a child may be different in each pregnancy, depending on which mitochondria go into egg cells. Then, when a threshold for the disease is reached, that is, when the load of mutated DNA reaches a critical level, symptoms appear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812442589">15</xref></sup> In addition, mutated mitochondria may segregate differently in each offspring, resulting in an extraordinarily broad array of symptoms differing in each affected.</p>
<p>Characteristic neuropsychological and psychiatric patterns can be associated with certain syndromes but are not confined to them. The syndromes below are a far from exhaustive list, but supply examples of the most common, illustrating the range of presentation in these disorders.</p>
<p>Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) has onset that is often in late childhood or young adulthood but can be present earlier. Transient ischemic episodes, and cognitive dysfunction related to infarcts can be found associated with the middle cerebral artery or related to multiple small infarcts. Both cortical and subcortical white matter can be affected, especially in the parietal and occipital lobes, thalamus, corpus striatum, globus pallidus, brainstem, and cerebellum. Although progressive cognitive dysfunction is often reported, discrete deficits or a schizophrenia-like syndrome may more rarely be observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073812442589">16</xref></sup> Stroke-like episodes or events, sometimes known as “metabolic strokes,” appear related to regional defect in cellular energy production. Because the injury is not due to reduced blood supply, the lesions do not always follow a vascular distribution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073812442589">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073812442589">18</xref></sup> Seizures and early-onset hearing loss are common phenomena. Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes may present as migraines with visual auras. Visual hallucinations and bipolar disorder have been described in patients with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes and other mitochondrial patients with cognitive decline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073812442589">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073812442589">19</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF), characterized by myoclonus, myoclonic epilepsy, progressive ataxia and myopathy, is seen in childhood and young adulthood. Cerebellar ataxia and dementia can lead to retardation, but infarcts are uncommon. Clinical symptoms may include deafness, optic atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, and others. Eighty percent of patients have a point mutation in mitochondrial DNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073812442589">17</xref></sup> Kearns-Sayre syndrome is also associated with mitochondrial DNA point mutations. With beginnings in childhood, this syndrome involves progressive degeneration of optic muscles, retina, cardiac conduction, cerebellar deficits, and myopathy.</p>
<p>Leigh syndrome is characterized by bilateral symmetric lesions of the basal ganglia. Most common in children, symptoms include dyskinesia, dystonia, somnolence, nystagmus, respiratory abnormalities, and ataxia. The patient may appear as if he or she has cerebral palsy. Although the syndrome is usually progressive, symptoms may wax and wane depending on the degree of metabolic or catabolic stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073812442589">18</xref></sup> Neuroimaging findings include periventricular leukomalacia and hyperintensities in the basal ganglia and thalamus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073812442589">17</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Mitochondrial cytopathies appear less consistently syndromal in nature and may show waxing and waning cognitive symptoms and fatigue, thus proving more difficult to document neuropsychologically despite a progressive course. Dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system (controlling heart rate, respiration, temperature, and digestion), debilitating fatigue, and multiple organ systems affected can result in severe functional disabilities. In addition, psychiatric symptoms can be found, sometimes as first symptoms of these complex disorders that occur prior to the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073812442589">19</xref></sup> Bipolar disorder, major depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and autism have been related to impaired mitochondrial dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073812442589">19</xref>

Case studies have been informative but limited in their ability to provide generalizations about cognitive and psychiatric profile or prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073812442589">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883073812442589">24</xref>

<title>Subjects and Procedure</title>
<p>A national sample of high-functioning adolescents and young adults, ages 13 to 21 years was sought through a flier posted on the website of MitoAction.org, an advocacy organization that has wide participation by children and their families with mitochondrial disease. A Google connection was offered by MitoAction.org for 3 months in which individuals who Googled mitochondrial disease saw a link to this flier. The same flier was placed in offices of several physicians who manage patients with energy disorders. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was obtained for the flier, forms, and all contact, mailing, and database procedures. Information from new subjects was immediately deidentified on receipt and added to the database in Excel. As information about general intellectual functioning was often not available, adolescents and young adults who were able to complete forms independently were included in the study. Parents were permitted to physically help with completion but not with provision of answers to questionnaires.</p>
<p>Sent to the participating adolescent/young adult and their mother were a self-report and parent report Behavior Assessment for Children, second edition (BASC-2), for ages 12 to 21 years, a Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) self-report and parent report for older children/adolescents aged 13 to 18 years or an adult report and informant report for those aged 18 to 21 years. In addition, each parent was asked to complete a questionnaire about the nature of their child’s disorder, how it had been diagnosed, and accommodations and other supports needed. These were mailed to the families who wished to participate with stamped addressed return envelopes. In each case, first contact was initiated by the parent inquiring about the study by email or telephone.</p>
<p>The Behavior Assessment for Children, second edition, and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function are rating scales widely used to collect psychiatric and behavioral data on adolescents and young adults. The Behavior Assessment for Children, second edition, is intended to be “sensitive to both obvious and subtle behavioral and emotional disorders as expressed in school and clinical settings, and to academic and familial demands on child and adolescent development.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883073812442589">27</xref></sup> As such, it appeared singularly appropriate to explore the effects not only of a disorder that may have the stresses one might expect in individuals struggling with medical and academic problems but in a disorder where psychiatric issues may be intrinsic in some individuals. In addition, a single normative base can be used for subjects and their parents from ages 12 to 21 years. The Behavior Assessment for Children, second edition, is available in versions for parent, teacher, and self-report. As many children with mitochondrial disease are home-schooled for at least periods of time, only the parent and self-report versions were used. Spearman correlation matrices and linear regression graphs were completed with SAS to isolate important factors affecting the subjects’ function from the perspective of the subject and parent.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function addresses subdomains of executive functioning in a fashion that appears related to skills affecting daily living and academics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0883073812442589">28</xref></sup> The scales are informative about how the child is perceived in their everyday real-world setting, with increased ecological validity, whereas tests tell us something about how the student can perform over a short time frame on a specific task.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883073812442589">29</xref></sup> Although the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function is clinically useful in describing a wide array of such daily activity, there is not a clear one-to-one relationship between Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function results and the results of neuropsychological tests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0883073812442589">30</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0883073812442589"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0883073812442589">32</xref></sup> The term <italic>executive function</italic>, referring to a broad range of self-regulatory and cognitive processes, is defined and operationalized in a wide variety of ways, and associated with more than 1 brain-behavior pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0883073812442589">33</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0883073812442589"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0883073812442589">35</xref></sup> In the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, executive function is broken down into domains divided into 2 groups, self-regulation (inhibition, shift, emotional control, self-monitor) and metacognition (initiate, working memory, plan/organize, task monitor, organization of materials).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All but 2 families who contacted the author found the study flier on the MitoAction.org website. Two additional families found study information through their metabolic physician. Of those families inquiring about the study, 2 were identified as not filling study criteria. These 2 parents indicated that their children would not be able to complete the questionnaires independently because of their cognitive limits and were clearly not appropriate for a study related to transition to higher educational settings; therefore, they were not sent the packet. Of initial contact of 20 subjects who filled research criteria, all requested research packets, and 15 returned completed questionnaires; 1 individual was later removed from the sample as it was found he had a different sort of metabolic disorder. Thus, 70% of the distributed packets were returned and utilizable for this study. On their return, the responses were deidentified and entered into an Excel file. Two case studies had been identified prior to the beginning of the study and releases were obtained. Although these individuals also participated in the study, they also cannot be identified through the database. The demographics of each individual were changed significantly to preserve their anonymous status.</p>
<p>Parents indicated the ways in which the mitochondrial disorder had been diagnosed on the Parent Questionnaire (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0883073812442589">appendix</xref>); all had mutations identified or strongly suspected through muscle biopsy and/or blood test, in addition to clinical symptoms. Identification of specific mutations responsible for mitochondrial diseases is an evolving science, and new tests and strategies are emerging. Thus the type of mitochondrial disease each subject’s parent reported only carries a level of specificity available to the parent at the time of this study. Although 5 subjects had unspecified cytopathies, represented in the group was 1 unspecified point mutation, 1 individual with carnitine palmitoyl transferase deficiency, 1 individual with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes, and mutations in complex I, III, IV, and possibly II. Two individuals had more than 1 complex identified. The sample included 7 male adolescents/young adults and 7 female. Five of the subjects were between the ages of 19 and 21 years, and thus utilized the adult form of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function. Consequently, it was difficult to derive statistics from the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function at this stage. Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function results will be viewed in the case studies. The same version of the Behavior Assessment for Children, second edition, was completed by all subjects, however.</p>
<p>Parents were asked to qualitatively “Describe how your child (adolescents and young adults) struggles with mitochondrial disease.” All of the parents lamented the extreme fatigue their children experienced and the unpredictability of their symptoms, “leading to academic and social issues,” according to 1 parent. All but 1 parent described multiple medical problems leading to modified school experiences and home schooling in several cases. Cognitive or academic problems were identified as central experiences of their children by 11 of the parents. Quite touching assessments of the situation were offered: “Her mind is capable but her body is unable to do what she strives to achieve in life.” Dysautonomia with fluctuations in cognition, energy, fatigue, and serious threats to ongoing well-being were described. Individuals experienced specific difficulty with muscle strength, gastrointestinal motility, migraines, seizures, hearing loss, sleep disorders, and poor attention and concentration, depression, and learning disabilities and Asperger syndrome.</p>
<p>Spearman correlation matrices were computed for the Behavior Assessment for Children, second edition, self-report (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073812442589">Table 1</xref>) and parent report forms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073812442589">Table 2</xref>) using SAS. Mixed gender clinical norms were used such that the entire sample could be analyzed from the same normative database. There was a significant correlation between Somatization and Internalizing Disorders (but not individually with either depression or anxiety) on the parent form at <italic>P</italic> ≤.01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812442589">Figure 1</xref>). Strong adaptive skills were associated with strong functional communication, leadership, activities of daily living, social skills, and negatively correlated with attention problems.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this pilot study was to gather information about what challenges adolescents and young adults with mitochondrial disease face, as they transition to higher grades and college. Given the cognitive heterogeneity of this group, this study used behavior rating scales rather than neuropsychological testing. In this way, the functional limits that affect success in challenging environments could be identified.</p>
<p>The size of the sample limits the statistical information one may derive from it. However, there was a highly significant correlation between students’ attitude to school and depression and anxiety in the Behavior Assessment for Children, second edition. The developmental task of these students is success in school, separation and seeking the future, despite uncertainty. Challenges in these domains certainly cause distress. It follows that improvement of the school experience and optimization of success could provide a mitigating variable in the development of depression and anxiety as well as a positive feeling of efficacy. Those students with strong social, communication, and leadership skills may more easily adapt to frequent changes in their medical status. Yet their vulnerability to internalizing disorders is understandable.</p>
<p>The etiology of depression and anxiety in young students with mitochondrial disease is likely to be complex. Not only are the developmental tasks of adolescence and young adulthood challenged but the biological and genetic substrate of these diseases may also be involved. Mitochondrial deletions have been found in some individuals with psychiatric symptoms, including schizophrenia and mood disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0883073812442589">36</xref></sup> A higher incidence of depressed behavior (including fatigue) has been found in children with disorders of oxidative phosphorylation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0883073812442589">37</xref></sup> and a high incidence of psychiatric comorbidity in adults is associated with mitochondrial disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073812442589">22</xref></sup> In addition, the role of intermittent fatigue experienced by these students and its direct relationship to metabolic change in the brain has not been mapped out well yet. The presence of depression, anxiety, and stress in mothers of children with mitochondrial disorders has also been addressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0883073812442589">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0883073812442589">39</xref></sup> Yet Boles et al note that although mothers of chronically ill children may be prone to depression and anxiety, depression is more frequently observed in matrilineal relatives who likely share the same mitochondrial DNA as the affected children themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0883073812442589">38</xref></sup> Certainly, a high index of suspicion for mood and anxiety disorders in these students and their families can lead to more specific supportive intervention.</p>
<p>Although with a larger sample it might have been possible to correlate variables from the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function to the Behavior Assessment for Children, second edition, as there are correlation coefficients available, the age range of the sample resulted in even smaller groups than the Behavior Assessment for Children, second edition, thus limiting its utility in this way. The self-report Behavior Assessment for Children, second edition, is based on a different normative sample, but a validation study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883073812442589">27</xref></sup> showed significant correlations to the self-report version of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (N = 104). In addition, utilization of a comparison group of adolescents and young adults with other medical illnesses might provide further information about how specifically these disorders have impact, and how that impact may be compared to the effect of chronic illness, in general. This sample was self-selected in the sense that those families who responded to information about the study already were sensitive to cognitive and emotional issues related to the transitions experienced by high-functioning adolescents and young adults with mitochondrial disease. Thus, these findings are difficult to generalize to more severely affected individuals or, conversely, to individuals for whom transitions have not been problematic. Case studies remain a strong tool for better understanding what may be needed to support success in transition to postsecondary education.</p>

<title>Case Studies</title>
<sec id="section7-0883073812442589">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>Case 1 was diagnosed with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) in early childhood by muscle biopsy and clinical evaluation, as was his twin sister. When younger, he had several types of seizures: he fell down and lost consciousness, on occasion. He also had “catatonic seizures,” where he was unable to speak and his muscles became stiff and tight, both now controlled with medication (Lamictal). He has struggled with exhaustion and a sleep disorder, difficulty sustaining attention and focus, and spastic diplegia and acid reflux. He has 70% hearing loss and chose a college with robust resources to support hearing-impaired individuals. He had accommodations throughout secondary school, including extended time for testing, a low-distraction environment, shorter days, extra time for getting to classes and obtaining class notes, and medical absences were allowed. He had hearing aids, braces, and surgeries. In college, he was able to register for classes early so that he could plan his schedule. He received a note taker and speech-to-print technology, where he could read lectures on a computer screen. He relied on accommodations available for the deaf, rather than those that might have been delineated by neuropsychological testing. A full battery was never administered; rather, only limited testing in childhood had been completed.</p>
<p>College offered new and sometimes unexpected challenges. He noted that his support structure of family and friends was no longer in place, and he realized he had to rely on himself; he had to be “independent and an adult all at the same time—it’s a reality check.” He had roommates at the beginning of the school year and got little sleep. Although he enjoyed meeting new people, he found he was not entirely tolerant of “immature behavior.” He got sick and missed a month of school and his grades reflected that. He transferred to a single room and switched his major to psychology, an area that interested him far more than his original choice.</p>
<p>He noted that he can be very organized and uses a schedule. However, he is capable of putting off certain kinds of assignments such as papers until close to the deadline. He believes he takes longer to learn things and learns through “busy work” over and over until he finally takes it in. He may become anxious before tests, anticipating difficulty.</p>
<p>Review of the Behavior Assessment for Children, second edition, showed an elevation on the anxiety and internalizing problems scales by self-report, as well as elevation of the Somatic scale. His mother indicated mild elevations in depression and withdrawal but not anxiety; somatization was also high (T = 72). In the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, both he and his mother indicated difficulties in behavioral regulation. Inhibition, shifting, and emotional control scales were a standard deviation or more above the mean (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0883073812442589">Table 3</xref>). His mother also noted that working memory, in particular, was problematic leading to a mild elevation in the Metacognition Index. Such difficulty is likely to be related to his experience of needing to review material repeatedly before learning it.</p>

<p>In follow-up contact a year later, he reported that his health varied and colder weather negatively affected him. He continued to need to watch his sleep and schedule carefully: when he had an early morning class, it was difficult for him to get enough sleep to function well. He was taking a reduced course load, had extended time on tests and quizzes, and used an interpreter and note taker. He has learned to write his teachers in advance of beginning a new class so as to warn them of his condition, noting that this “makes them more likely to work with me in case anything does happen.”</p>
<p>When asked what was the most important thing for a college student with mitochondrial disease to consider, he replied, “I would recommend that they start with a lighter course load at the beginning and try to figure out how much they can handle—if they could handle an extra class later, then they could add one in the future. I strongly suggest starting out this way because I did very badly my freshman year trying to keep up with people who simply had 2 times or more the amount of energy I did.” In addition, he reported that living with a roommate was not feasible as it interfered with his sleep.</p>
<p>Thus, although he had sophistication in the potential accommodations available to him and knowledge about how to put them in place, he was less able to anticipate the effects of a new social environment in combination with the loss of his usual family and friend network. Although he had some skill at managing accommodations, his usual strategy of waiting until the last moment to do some sorts of work was problematic. His learning strategy, requiring repetition and review of material, required more expense of energy than he observed was required by his peers. It took time and a trial-and-error approach to find a reasonable strategy for his college experience. He does believe he will graduate with his current plan and hopes to work with minority populations in a rehabilitation context.</p>

<title>Case 2</title>
<p>Case 2 had a late onset of mitochondrial disease, a probable deficit in complex I, as do her mother and sister. Her condition was diagnosed during an evaluation for intense migraines, staring spells, and worsening memory in school activity. When in high school she completed 60% of her curriculum at home with tutorial support under a 504 plan. She remained a strong student but she easily became fatigued and had variable visual acuity apparently related to eye muscle fatigue. Epilepsy was diagnosed at age 19 years and she was begun on Lamictal. Two administrations of neuropsychological testing over time indicated deficits in working memory and in her ability to organize complex auditory-verbal and visuospatial material to facilitate reliable and consistent learning of new information and retrieval.</p>
<p>She complained of difficulty keeping track of tasks for which she was responsible, remembering facts and recalling pieces of conversation, even after beginning medication. Her tutor described “debilitating fatigue” in addition to her migraines, noting that it took her 3 times as long to complete writing projects as her peers. Although she had initially hoped to become a physician, she was attending community college part time while living at home. She had changed her major to secondary education in biology and history. She reported sleeping a great deal, and struggling with having sufficient energy to complete academic tasks. Accommodations included extended time on tests, a note taker (which she often did not use), no penalty for absences, and assistive technology such as books on CD-Rom and an electronic reader. She was proud that she had passed her Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) certification for which she had been studying for a long while.</p>
<p>Although her mother did not record any concerns in the Adult Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, she indicated particular concern with planning/organizing (T = 65), and mild concern with initiating behavior (T = 60; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0883073812442589">Table 4</xref>). In the Behavior Assessment for Children, second edition, both she and her mother indicate somatic concerns a standard deviation above the mean, but did not endorse other indicators. It was of interest that her mother indicated that she had particularly strong social and adaptive skills on the same scale (T = 76 and 66, respectively).</p>

<p>A year after initial contact, she had a setback when her sister and mother both became ill; her grades plummeted. She noted, “I hit a wall emotionally.” She was taking 3 courses and attempting to get her grades back up, but remained concerned about her family members. Although strong interpersonal skills appeared to be an asset in helping this young woman manage her medical issues and school, when the health of family members also became a concern, her resources were taxed. It was hard for her to consider that she might need emotional as well as academic support.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In both the above cases, only a planned strategy, along with a system of accommodations and support that address medical, psychosocial, and academic concerns together, adequately address the challenges these young people face on a daily basis. The importance of college as a vehicle for a simple belief in a future is clear. This pilot study suggests it is certainly a primary developmental focus. Yet these students not only face the developmental challenges all teens and young adults face, they also live with a degree of uncertainty that is difficult to imagine for most. The need for all disciplines to work together to provide a cogent and flexible plan to optimize their success and health is a challenge in itself. Protocols for health crises involving local and home-based physicians specific to the individual needs of the student are only the beginning. Integration of health and academic components of a college plan mean that academic support services and health services communicate regularly and more effectively support the student. Standard academic accommodations such as extended time, note takers, audiotaping, scribes, use of laptop, and books on CD or mp3 may be worthy of consideration in some individuals. Alternative technologies include the Kurzweil reader (text to voice) and Dragon Naturally Speaking for dictation to text. The sophisticated technologies available to the dyslexic, blind, or deaf student bring a new dimension to such aids. In addition, medical demands may point in the direction of alternative test taking methods for some individuals.</p>
<p>It is more the rule rather than the exception that navigation changes and course corrections will be a part of the college experience for students with mitochondrial disease. In addition, feelings of fatigue and intermittent illness should be expected. Although flexible programming can be helpful in this regard, there can be a tension between the need for reasonable accommodation and maintaining consistent educational standards that may affect how some universities and colleges choose to develop accommodation plans. As is the case in high school, variable energy level can be mistaken for deliberately withheld effort; a familiarity with mitochondrial disease is helpful. Education of faculty and staff about mitochondrial disease will promote support at the salient moment. For some students, meeting with an academic support service can promote organizational skill development, improved study and test preparation skills, and more facility in developing long projects such as papers.</p>
<p>Students with mitochondrial disease understandably feel the same lure of meeting new people, and being drawn to social activities, as do all students. Yet with more interest than energy, realistic appraisal of the situation is important. Counseling support can help students begin to gauge for themselves, for the first time, what is doable and what is not, how to achieve the aspirations they have, and prioritize their short- and long-term goals. The interaction between the particular cognitive challenges each student may have and the ever-changing demands of a complex environment such as a college will be different for each student. Comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation, along with functionally based rating scales, may serve to anticipate areas of difficulty and identify areas of strength, thus reducing frustrating moments such as those discussed in case 1. For those students who successfully complete their college education, careful thought about what types of environments for work play to their strengths and minimize the impact of their illness and cognitive concerns would enhance the likelihood of success. Research further exploring the needs of this late adolescent young adult population with mitochondrial disease is sparse and much needed.</p>

<title>Pilot Study on Executive Function and Adaptive Skills in Adolescents and Young Adults with Mitochondrial Disease</title>
<p>Clinical experience has shown that teens and adolescents with mitochondrial disease often face learning challenges as they transition to high school and college. Many may have limited organizational skills and may experience new difficulties when their work becomes more complex and time-consuming. Such challenges have not been well researched to date.</p>
<p>Teenagers and young adults with mitochondrial disease, ages 13 to 21 years, need to better understand what their learning needs are especially when they make big academic transitions. Each participant will be asked to fill out 2 standardized questionnaires. Their parents will be asked to complete 2 parallel questionnaires, and a short form about the nature of their child’s mitochondrial disease.</p>
<p>With the results from these questionnaires, a database will be constructed in which participating individuals cannot be identified. We hope to learn about the overall pattern of strengths and weaknesses in our participants. With this information we may develop more sophisticated accommodations for students with mitochondrial disorders, for the transition from grade to grade, and to college.</p>
<p>Please contact Dr Schreiber by phone or email if your family is interested in participating in this study.</p>
