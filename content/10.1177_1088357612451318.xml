<abstract>
<p>Historically, learners with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have not had access to the general education curriculum. Current legislation mandates that <italic>all</italic> children, including children with ASD, have access to and make progress in the general education curriculum. This article contains a review of the literature on writing instruction for children with ASD. Investigation yielded 15 studies with 29 participants with ASD ages 4 to 21 years. Based on the studies reviewed, we concluded that students with ASD benefit from explicit writing instruction, but more research is needed to establish an evidence-based set of practices to guide educators in the development of effective writing programs for this population of students. Strategies that are particularly promising and suggestions for future research are given.</p>

<p>Researchers have suggested that the development of composition skills may be challenging for students with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1088357612451318">Myles et al., 2003</xref>). Several reasons may account for this phenomenon. First, writing as a communicative act is a social event between the writer and the audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1088357612451318">McCutchen, 2003</xref>). This requires an awareness of other people’s perspective but individuals with ASD often have difficulty understanding that others have perspectives different from their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1088357612451318">Leslie, 1987</xref>). This difficulty in attributing thoughts to others may make writing for a specific audience problematic. Second, writing requires that students manage several cognitive, linguistic, and motor processes simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1088357612451318">Singer &amp; Bashir, 2004</xref>) while engaging in planning, generating text, organizing, and revising. Researchers have found that individuals with ASD often experience deficits across many of these critical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088357612451318">Anzalone &amp; Williamson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088357612451318">Jansiewicz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1088357612451318">Minshew, Goldstein, &amp; Siegel, 1997</xref>). Finally, researchers have demonstrated that a strong relationship exists between written and oral language development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1088357612451318">Shanahan, 2006</xref>). The communication deficits, considered a cardinal feature of ASD, also likely serve as a barrier to the acquisition of a functional writing repertoire.</p>
<p>The negative effect of social, language, and executive functioning deficits on the written products of individuals with ASD is supported by studies comparing writing samples of individuals with ASD to those of individuals without disabilities. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1088357612451318">Myles et al. (2003)</xref> reported that individuals with ASD demonstrated decreased legibility, complexity, and number of words used during handwriting tasks in comparison with students without disabilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1088357612451318">Church, Alisanski, and Amanullah (2000)</xref> also found that children with Asperger syndrome (AS) consistently struggled with various aspects of writing tasks (i.e., handwriting, organization, addressing abstract concepts). These challenges may be exacerbated as the demanding nature of these tasks for students with ASD may lead to noncompliance and result in decreased instructional opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1088357612451318">Church et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Although children with autism may experience difficulty in the development of writing skills, the acquisition of these skills is critical in that they can be used in a variety of contexts to express ideas and subsequently access reinforcement. Individuals use written responses to make direct requests, engage in social dialogue, or create compositions intended to evoke emotional responses in others. Some use writing to affect their own behavior through the use of organizational strategies (e.g., list making, self-monitoring, labeling). For students, writing skills are required for success in most educational contexts, as written expression serves as the primary means through which they demonstrate knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1088357612451318">Mercer &amp; Mercer, 2010</xref>). Students who fail to develop adequate writing skills are likely to experience challenges in both school and the workplace. Thus, there is a great need for effective methods for teaching writing.</p>
<p>The research literature provides guidance on how best to teach writing to students without disabilities or students with mild disabilities. The results of two comprehensive meta-analysis of writing instruction provide important recommendations for effective writing instruction. Based on a review of experimental and quasi-experimental studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088357612451318">Graham and Perrin (2007)</xref> made the following suggestions: (a) teach students strategies for planning, revising, and editing; (b) teach procedures for summarizing reading material; (c) use instructional arrangements in which students collaborate in planning, drafting, revising, and editing compositions; (d) set clear goals for what students will accomplish with their writing; (e) provide opportunities to use word processing; (f) teach students how to combine sentences to make more complex sentences; (g) use writing activities to strengthen inquiry skills; (h) provide activities to assist students in gathering and organizing information before writing; (i) provide models of good writing; and (j) provide professional development on implementing the writing process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088357612451318">Rogers and Graham (2008)</xref> made similar recommendations based on a review of single-case design research and also suggested that the following practices are effective: (a) reinforcing writing productivity, (b) teaching strategies for editing, and (c) teaching strategies for constructing paragraphs. Notably, absent from these recommendations are a focus on spelling instruction and handwriting instruction. Thus, in addition to providing students with models of quality writing and access to word processing, the basic components of effective writing instruction include strategy instruction, peer-mediated instruction, sentence combining, and reinforcement for writing productivity.</p>
<p>To date, there has been limited research on the instruction of writing skills for students with ASD. This dearth of research is problematic in light of legislation calling for an increased focus on providing access to the general curriculum for students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088357612451318">No Child Left Behind, 2002</xref>). The purpose of the current review is to summarize the empirical research on interventions to teach writing to students with ASD. The following research questions are addressed:</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: What writing skills have researchers targeted for investigation?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: What interventions have been investigated, and are they consistent with practices for teaching writing to populations of students without ASD?</p></list-item>

<sec id="section1-1088357612451318" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The researchers conducted an electronic search of the Educational Research Information Center (ERIC), PsycINFO, and the Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection databases. The researchers used the following combinations of keywords: <italic>autism or Asperger syndrome</italic> and <italic>writing, written expression, handwriting, scripting, sentence, story writing, letter writing, letter formation</italic>, and <italic>composition</italic>. The search engines identified 421 articles. In addition, the researchers conducted hand searches of the professional journals available to members of the Division on Autism and Developmental Disabilities within the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC), from the years 1994 to 2011. These journals included <italic>Education and Training in Autism and Developmental Disabilities, Focus on Autism and Developmental Disabilities, Teaching Exceptional Children</italic>, and <italic>Exceptional Children.</italic></p>
<p>The articles in the current review met specific inclusion criteria. First, they were published in a peer-reviewed journal between the years 1994 and 2011. The year 1994 provides a 3-year window, capturing research conducted in close temporal proximity to the 1997 amendment to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). This legislation reflected a major shift toward providing access for students with disabilities to the general education curriculum. Second, the investigators who conducted the studies used experimental, quasi-experimental, or single-case research. That is, the researchers introduced an independent variable and analyzed its effects on a dependent measure. Third, the participants in the articles were identified as having an ASD (i.e., autism, AS, pervasive developmental disorder–not otherwise specified [PDD-NOS]). Finally, the researchers addressed the instruction of writing skills. Writing skills were limited to those skills involving the composition of text. We excluded studies involving the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) and Facilitated Communication (FC) despite their obvious relation to writing; each was believed to be evaluated sufficiently in the research literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1088357612451318">Mostert, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1088357612451318">Tien, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The first author examined the 421 articles and identified 15 that met inclusion criteria. Both the authors independently reviewed the 15 articles against the established inclusion criteria and agreed that all of the articles should be included in the current review (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088357612451318">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Participants and Settings</title>
<p>Two females and 27 males participated in the reviewed studies (<italic>N</italic> = 29). Each of the studies involved four or fewer participants with ASD. The participants ranged in age from 4 to 21 years, and the majority of the participants (<italic>n</italic> =27) were younger than 15 years. Overall, 22 participants were diagnosed with autism, 6 with AS, and 1 with PDD-NOS.</p>
<p>The research teams in the articles conducted seven studies in school-based special education settings (i.e., self-contained school, special class, resource room). One study was conducted in an alternative school. Three sets of researchers used university settings to conduct their evaluations, and two conducted their investigations in home settings. Finally, two research teams evaluated interventions in nonspecified areas.</p>

<sec id="section4-1088357612451318">
<title>Targeted Skills</title>
<p>The authors of the articles described the evaluation of procedures to teach a variety of writing skills. Four research teams targeted the acquisition of spelling responses. The authors of two studies addressed sentence construction in response to a picture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088357612451318">Basil &amp; Reyes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1088357612451318">Yamamoto &amp; Miya, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088357612451318">Rousseau, Krantz, Poulson, Kitson, and McClannahan (1994)</xref> targeted increases in participants’ use of adjectives per thought unit during writing.</p>
<p>Seven of the studies involved narrative writing skills. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088357612451318">Pennington, Ault, and Schuster (2011)</xref> taught students to construct stories. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088357612451318">Bedrosian, Lasker, Speidel, and Politsch (2003)</xref> targeted the number of words used, revisions made, and types of contributions made during joint story-writing activities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1088357612451318">Delano (2007a)</xref> targeted number of words and functional essay elements used by participants during persuasive writing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088357612451318">Delano (2007b)</xref> measured gains in story-writing responses through total number of words, action words, describing words used, and revisions made.

<sec id="section5-1088357612451318">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>Eight of the fourteen research teams investigated the use of electronic technology to teach writing skills. Two research teams used researcher-developed software programs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1088357612451318">Stromer, Mackay, Howell, and McVay (1996)</xref> taught a student to touch letters to spell a word on a computer desktop using a delayed-word construction procedure. During these procedures, a sample word appeared on the computer desktop. Once the student touched the sample, it immediately disappeared and was replaced by a set of letters. Subsequently, the student spelled the word by touching the letters. Correct student responses were followed by a flashing computer display and the delivery of a token that could be exchanged for a preferred item. Incorrect responses resulted in the immediate presentation of the intertrial interval (no response). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088357612451318">Sugasawara and Yamamoto (2007)</xref> used computer-based match-to-sample (MTS) tasks to teach the construction of Japanese Hiragana characters. Although similar to spelling in English, the ordering of Japanese characters is based on content rather than phonetics. During instruction, the computer presented a picture stimulus and two characters. The student used a mouse to select the characters in a prescribed order. The computer provided a digital reading of the text, computerized auditory fanfare, and a circle around the characters immediately following correct responses. The computer provided no response following errors.</p>
<p>Two research teams used voice output communication aids (VOCA) and a copy-cover method to teach spelling responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088357612451318">Schlosser &amp; Blischak, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1088357612451318">Schlosser, Blischak, Belfiore, Bartley, &amp; Barnett, 1998</xref>). During the cover-copy method, the researchers first presented a word on an index card, pronounced the word, finger spelled the word, and subsequently asked the student to copy the word. The researchers then removed the card and asked the student to write the word. Finally, the researchers presented the index card and asked the student to compare his response. During instruction, the students typed their responses into a VOCA, which provided auditory (i.e., digitized text reading) and visual feedback (i.e., words shown on a light-emitting diode [LED] screen).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088357612451318">Kinney, Vedora, and Stromer (2003)</xref> used video models, displayed in a Microsoft PowerPoint® presentation, which depicted the spelling of target words by an adult. After observing the video model, correct student responses were followed by the presentation of reinforcing video clips. These clips depicted a researcher engaged in play routines with objects (e.g., toy frog jumping over a rock, adult licking a popsicle). Following error responses, the researcher withheld reinforcement and proceeded to the next trial.</p>
<p>Research teams also used computer software to teach sentence construction to their participants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088357612451318">Basil and Reyes (2003)</xref> used a multimedia software package (i.e., Delta Messages) to teach sentence construction. The students received three training sessions on using the computer program prior to intervention. During training, the students constructed sentences by using a mouse to select words from an array. Finally, the computer presented feedback in the form a digitized reading of the text, and a short animation depicting the sentence content. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1088357612451318">Yamamoto and Miya (1999)</xref> used computer software that required students to select words using a mouse click to construct sentences following the presentation of a pictured stimulus. Prior to training, the researchers conducted sessions to teach the students to operate the computer program. During training, the computer presented an auditory fanfare following correct responses and a beep tone following errors. In addition, the computer modeled the correct response following all errors. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088357612451318">Pennington et al. (2011)</xref> used simultaneous prompting to teach students to select words from a computer-based array to construct simple stories.</p>
<p>Three research teams conducted five studies using self-regulated strategy development (SRSD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088357612451318">Graham, Harris, MacArthur, &amp; Schwartz, 1991</xref>) procedures during intervention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088357612451318">Asaro and Saddler (2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088357612451318">2010</xref>) delivered SRSD instruction across multiple lessons. The lessons involved (a) background knowledge development and the introduction of a graphic organizer, (b) identifying story parts present in students’ writing samples, (c) teaching students to use self-statements, (d) collaborative writing, (e) independent writing with planning supports and graphing of story elements, (f) independent writing with no supports, and (g) independent writing with the use of a scribe. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088357612451318">Mason et al. (2010)</xref> instructed students across five lessons including (a) developing background knowledge, (b) modeling and prompted practice, (c), collaborative practice, (d) guided practice in writing a persuasive response, and (e) guided practice in writing a 10-min persuasive response. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088357612451318">Delano (2007b)</xref> used SRSD procedures to improve a student’s story-writing skills. The researcher taught the student three strategies to improve his use of vocabulary. First, in the <italic>action words</italic> strategy, the student was asked to brainstorm a list of action words (e.g., running, climbing, jumping). Then the researcher and the student used the list to generate a story. Through subsequent sessions, the researcher gradually faded prompts until the student responded independently. Second, the researcher used the same procedures to teach the student to use <italic>describing words</italic>. Finally, the researcher taught the student to use a revision strategy. Following story writing using the other two strategies, the researcher prompted the student to read his draft and determine where better words could be used. In addition, the student and researcher brainstormed a list of ways that the story could be improved and selected three changes to make. The researcher gradually faded instructional prompts until the student revised his composition independently. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1088357612451318">Delano (2007a)</xref> used video self-modeling to teach SRSD procedures to students with AS. The researcher recorded students as they read a script and performed each of the strategies. Subsequently, the researcher edited the video clips to remove all verbal prompts. Finally, the students watched the videos prior to performing persuasive writing tasks.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088357612451318">Bedrosian et al. (2003)</xref> used an instructional package comprised of multiple strategies to improve student performance during joint story-writing activities. The researchers taught two students, one with and one without a disability, to select from an array on a communication device to ask questions or make comments during joint writing activities. The researchers also taught the students to use a story grammar map and storyboards to facilitate writing activities. The students were then taught to use story-writing software (i.e., <italic>My Words</italic>; Hartley-Jostens Learning) to write the stories. All of the strategies were explained and then modeled by a pair of researchers. The researchers provided prompts to ensure the students’ use of strategies.</p>
<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088357612451318">Rousseau et al. (1994)</xref> used a sentence-combining method to teach students to increase the use of adjectives in written responses. The researchers taught students to combine two sentences to make one sentence that included an adjective. For example the student combined the sentences, “<italic>The boy went home</italic>” and “<italic>The boy was little</italic>” to construct “<italic>The little boy went home.</italic>” Initially, the researcher presented worksheets with the target adjective underlined and a carat placed in the first sentence to indicate where the adjective should be inserted. Subsequently, the researchers faded the visual prompts. The researchers delivered pennies to the students following correct responses.</p>

<title>Efficacy</title>
<p>Generally, data were interpreted to conclude that students with ASD benefited from writing intervention. All of the research teams reported that students acquired or increased the frequency of target responses. Two teams of researchers conducted studies designed to compare the effects of using the copy cover method and different types of electronic feedback during spelling instruction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1088357612451318">Schlosser et al. (1998)</xref> found that auditory feedback was more efficient than visual feedback, in terms of numbers of sessions to criterion. In a replication of the previous study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088357612451318">Schlosser and Blischak (2004)</xref> found differential results across participants.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In general, the current research data can be interpreted to suggest that writing deficits for children with ASD can be ameliorated through intervention. All of the participants described in the current review improved their performance on a variety of targeted writing tasks. In addition, 10 research teams demonstrated that intervention resulted in the generalization of writing skills across untrained response topographies (i.e., handwritten, spoken) or the acquisition of nontargeted literacy skills (i.e., sight word reading, phonological awareness).</p>
<p>Researchers have constructed criteria for establishing evidence-based practices using different research methods. In the current review, the majority of the researchers used single-case or quasi-experimental group research designs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1088357612451318">Horner et al. (2005)</xref> suggested the use of five criteria in determining whether an intervention should be deemed as evidence based using single-case research. These criteria require that an intervention (a) is clearly operationalized, (b) has been demonstrated to be effective in a minimum of five studies, (c) conducted by at least three different research teams across three different geographical locations, and (d) included a minimum of 20 participants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1088357612451318">Gersten et al. (2005)</xref> established criteria for defining evidence-based practice using group experimental or quasi-experimental research. They suggested that a practice should be supported by at least four studies of acceptable quality or two high-quality studies, and that calculated weighted-effect sizes should be significantly above zero. Consequently, in the current review, we did not identify any evidence-based interventions as no single intervention (e.g., SRSD, video modeling) was evaluated across a sufficient number of participants, and none of the investigations met the minimum criteria for being deemed a quality study according to Horner et al. or Gersten et al.</p>
<p>Despite limited research support for any single writing intervention for students with ASD, several of the studies we reviewed incorporated practices deemed effective for other populations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1088357612451318">Table 2</xref>). In addition, clear practice trends emerged across the available research. First, in five studies, the authors demonstrated that SRSD procedures were effective with students with ASD. These findings are commensurate with those of investigations focused on other populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1088357612451318">Baker, Chard, Ketterlin-Geller, Apichatabutra, &amp; Doabler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1088357612451318">Joseph &amp; Konrad, 2009</xref>) and may suggest that SRSD offers much potential for students with ASD.</p>

<p>Second, researchers in the majority (<italic>n</italic> = 10) of the studies incorporated the use of CAI. This has been broadly defined as the use of a computer technology to present learning materials and/or check a learner’s knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1088357612451318">Anohina, 2005</xref>). Researchers have suggested that CAI may be an effective tool during the instruction of students with ASD and have cited several advantages of using CAI, including the reduction of challenging social contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1088357612451318">Higgins &amp; Boone, 1996</xref>), the use of monotone digitized speech that reduces the need to interpret inflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1088357612451318">Schlosser &amp; Blischak, 2001</xref>), and the use of motivating multimedia stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1088357612451318">Moore &amp; Calvert, 2000</xref>). The current findings are interpreted to suggest that CAI, in a variety of forms, may serve as an effective component of writing intervention for students with ASD.</p>
<p>Third, based on this review, it was concluded that individuals with ASD can benefit from interventions that involve various forms of modeling. Researchers evaluated the use of cards with printed words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088357612451318">Schlosser &amp; Blischak, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1088357612451318">Schlosser et al., 1998</xref>), video (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088357612451318">Delano, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088357612451318">Kinney et al., 2003</xref>), and role-play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088357612451318">Bedrosian et al., 2003</xref>) as models for student responses. Their findings were consistent with those of other investigators who have incorporated modeling during the instruction of students with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088357612451318">Akmanoglu &amp; Batu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1088357612451318">Akmanoglu-Uludag &amp; Batu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088357612451318">Bellini &amp; Akullian, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Fourth, the authors of seven of the articles described interventions that required students to make selections from a visual array of possible responses. This intervention component may have reduced cognitive load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088357612451318">Mayer &amp; Moreno, 2003</xref>) for students with ASD by decreasing the demands on working memory. In addition, this intervention may have circumvented difficulties related to handwriting that may impede the development of composition skills.</p>
<p>Finally, researchers used various forms of reinforcement to engage participants in writing instruction. The authors of 11 articles described the delivery of tokens, computerized fanfare, reinforcing video clips, and the use of preference assessment. These data are critical in that they emphasize the role of immediate reinforcement in the acquisition of writing skills for learners with ASD. In many educational contexts, students may be expected to write for enjoyment or delayed conditioned reinforcers (e.g., grades, praise, teacher feedback). Teachers must consider student preferences and individualized schedules of reinforcement to maximize instructional efficacy for these learners.</p>
<sec id="section13-1088357612451318">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>In general, any conclusions derived from the current review should be observed with caution. Six research teams used designs capable of demonstrating a functional relation between the intervention and outcomes. In contrast, five teams used pre-/posttest designs, two teams conducted comparative studies, one team used an AB design, and one team described a case study. These designs are highly vulnerable to threats of internal validity (e.g., history, maturation, instrumentation) when used with small samples. In addition, only eight teams reported the use of measures to ensure the fidelity of interventions. This poses two major problems in interpreting the current findings. First, there is little confidence that the majority of interventions in the current review were implemented as planned. It may be possible that treatment effects were a result of teacher behavior not accounted for in the design of the intervention, thus presenting challenges to replication by researchers and practitioners. Second, treatment fidelity data are important as they also may indicate how difficult an intervention is to deliver with accuracy. This information is critical toward the endeavor of translating research into daily practice.</p>
<p>The review also revealed other concerns related to the application of the described interventions in applied settings. Researchers conducted only five studies in school settings, and the majority of those were in special education classrooms. Studies conducted in clinical settings may have reduced validity for practitioners as school-based contexts present unique challenges to the delivery of interventions. In addition, a large number of students on the autism spectrum are increasingly served in general education contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1088357612451318">U.S. Department of Education, 2001</xref>). To date, no research team has evaluated writing interventions directly administered by general education teachers to students with ASD. In addition, in only six articles did authors describe measures to increase the social validity of interventions, and only three research teams evaluated teacher and/or student perceptions of intervention or outcomes following treatment. As a result, the current body of literature provides minimal data as to the acceptability of writing interventions by those intended to use and benefit from them.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The body of research on writing interventions for students with ASD is limited. Generally, the available data are interpreted to suggest that interventions can be used to improve a variety of writing skills and may result in the increase of nontargeted responses. Although no single intervention could be vetted as an evidence-based practice, several components were used repeatedly in the evaluations. These components (i.e., modeling, CAI, selecting from an array, positive reinforcement) have been evaluated frequently during the instruction of other skills to students with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088357612451318">Bellini &amp; Akullian, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088357612451318">Matson &amp; Boisjoli, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1088357612451318">Moore, McGrath, &amp; Thorpe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1088357612451318">Tien, 2008</xref>). The identification of these components may serve as a starting point for future research into writing intervention.</p>
<p>In the future, researchers should replicate the current investigations in the context of more robust research designs. Researchers need to establish a set of evidenced-based practices to guide practitioners in their selection of intervention strategies. Researchers also should expand their inquiries to a broader set of skills ranging from writing mechanics (e.g., handwriting, grammar), to composition (i.e., creative writing, email communication, note taking). A first step might be to evaluate programs and strategies for use with children with ASD that have been demonstrated to be effective in teaching writing to students without disabilities. Finally, researchers will need to conduct future investigations of writing intervention in applied instructional contexts. Studies should be increasingly conducted by classroom teachers and in the context of less restrictive environments (i.e., general education contexts). This final direction may place research within contexts more digestible by consumers in the field of education.</p>
