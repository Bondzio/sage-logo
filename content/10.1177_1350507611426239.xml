<abstract>
<p>In the organizational learning literature a variety of concepts exists denoting some third order of organizational learning, notably that of ‘triple-loop’ learning. Despite this there has been no systematic, critical consideration of this concept or its origins, impeding both theoretical development and empirical research. Whilst ‘triple-loop learning’ has been inspired by Argyris and Schön, we establish that the term does not arise in their published work. Indeed, we argue that conceptualizations of triple-loop learning are diverse, often have little theoretical rooting, are sometimes driven by normative considerations, and lack support from empirical research. We map the major influences on these conceptualizations, including Bateson’s framework of levels of learning, and offer an original theoretical contribution that distinguishes between three conceptualizations of ‘triple-loop learning’. We also highlight implications for practice, and caution against the uncritical preference for ‘higher levels’ of learning that is sometimes discernible in the literature and in practice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the last decade, interest in organizational learning has burgeoned, with both increasing journal and book output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350507611426239">Bapuji and Crossan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1350507611426239">Dehler and Vendelø, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1350507611426239">Elliott et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1350507611426239">Scarbrough et al., 2007</xref>) and an increasing number of reviews of the field (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507611426239">Argote, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1350507611426239">Easterby-Smith and Lyles, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1350507611426239">Easterby-Smith et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1350507611426239">Örtenblad, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1350507611426239">Shipton, 2006</xref>). Yet, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1350507611426239">Friedman et al. (2005)</xref>, it is a field characterized by conceptual confusion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1350507611426239">Huysman (2000)</xref> argues for the deconstruction of writings on organizational learning and identifies a series of biases in the literature, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1350507611426239">Örtenblad (2010)</xref> cites organizational learning as an example of ‘packaged’ knowledge combining two labels in a potentially paradoxical way that qualifies, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1350507611426239">Weick and Westley (1996)</xref>, as an oxymoron.</p>
<p>Many scholars have considered the concept of organizational learning as a dichotomy. In its basic, primary form they have described it as action oriented, routine and incremental, occurring within existing (mental) frameworks, norms, policies and rules. In the face of profound change in organizational environments, these scholars argue that a qualitatively distinct, secondary form of learning is necessary. This aims to change the (mental) frameworks, norms, policies and routines underlying day-to-day actions and routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1350507611426239">Cope, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>This dichotomy has been expressed in a variety of terms: single-loop and double-loop (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350507611426239">Argyris and Schön, 1974</xref>); lower-level and higher-level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1350507611426239">Fiol and Lyles, 1985</xref>); first-order and second-order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350507611426239">Arthur and Aiman-Smith, 2001</xref>); exploitation and exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1350507611426239">Levinthal and March, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1350507611426239">March, 1991</xref>); incremental and radical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1350507611426239">Miner and Mezias, 1996</xref>); and adaptive and generative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1350507611426239">Senge, 1990</xref>). Although these dichotomous terms stem from different perspectives on organizational learning, a reasonable consensus seems to have been established that they refer to comparable learning processes and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350507611426239">Argyris, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350507611426239">Arthur and Aiman-Smith, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1350507611426239">Miner and Mezias, 1996</xref>). Thus, as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507611426239">Argyris (1999</xref>: 68), single-loop learning occurs ‘whenever an error is detected and corrected without questioning or altering the underlying values of the system’, and double-loop learning occurs ‘when mismatches are corrected by first examining and altering the governing variables and then the actions’.</p>
<p>A number of authors have conceived of a further type of organizational learning, for which the most prominent term is ‘triple-loop’ learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350507611426239">Flood and Romm, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611426239">Isaacs, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1350507611426239">Romme and Van Witteloostuijn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1350507611426239">Snell and Chak, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1350507611426239">Swieringa and Wierdsma, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1350507611426239">Yuthas et al., 2004</xref>). Typically, this is described as additional to, and metaphorically at a ‘higher’ or ‘deeper’ level than, primary and secondary forms of learning, the metaphor implying that this level has greater significance and profundity. Yet, in spite of its perceived importance, conceptualizations of this form of learning do not always make clear how it differs from, or relates to, primary or secondary forms. Scholars of organizational learning might look first to Argyris and Schön; significantly, though, we have established that whilst triple-loop learning has been inspired by Argyris and Schön, the term does not appear explicitly in their published work.</p>
<p>As we shall demonstrate, there is limited consensus amongst the scholars about the definition of triple-loop learning, other than that its proponents all place it relative to single- and double-loop learning. Furthermore, not one of the sources already cited that offers any conceptualization of triple-loop learning explores similarities or tensions between competing definitions. This lack of either consensus or critical discussion impedes theoretical development and makes testing and measurement through empirical research difficult. It also leads to confusion for practitioners about the role that learning can play in responding to wider pressures and challenges in the organizational environment.</p>
<p>The aim of this article is therefore to undertake a critical review of the ways in which triple-loop learning has been conceptualized by organization and management scholars. By conceptualization we mean the identification of conceptual components and the formation of conceptual definitions. As such, conceptualization precedes operationalization, the former being at the level of theory and the latter at the level of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1350507611426239">Frankfort-Nachmias and Nachmias, 1992</xref>). Within this we explore the original work of Argyris and Schön, and of the anthropologist and cybernetician Gregory Bateson, the major influences cited by authors who propose these conceptualizations. This enables us to make a theoretical contribution through identifying three distinct conceptualizations of triple-loop learning. These are:</p>

</list>
<p>We discuss why these conceptualizations should be regarded as distinct from each other, and highlight some implications for practice.</p>

<title>Conceptualizations of ‘triple-loop learning’</title>
<p>As noted, scholars of organizational learning might look first to Argyris and Schön for a definition of triple-loop learning. Indeed, several authors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1350507611426239">Gilmore and Warren, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1350507611426239">Jakimow, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1350507611426239">Mark, 2006</xref>) attribute triple-loop learning to, or associate it with, their work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1350507611426239">Dishman and Pearson (2003</xref>: 616) say: ‘<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611426239">Argyris (1991</xref>) proposed that there is also triple-loop learning, which provides feedback and a change mechanism for the individual’. Yet an examination of their work shows that Argyris and Schön neither formulate nor mention any notion of triple-loop learning. More precisely, no instance of the term appears in the text or index of any of Argyris and Schön’s joint or separate publications, including seminal texts such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350507611426239">Argyris and Schön (1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350507611426239">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350507611426239">1996</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611426239">Argyris (1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507611426239">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350507611426239">2004</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1350507611426239">Schön (1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1350507611426239">1987</xref>); nor, based on our examination of this literature, do we consider that Argyris and Schön developed any conceptualization that was intended by them as, or that equates to, a third ‘loop’ of learning that would logically extend their notions of single- and double-loop learning (we comment below on the place in their conceptual schema of their notion of ‘deutero-learning’).</p>
<p>If it is therefore incorrect to identify the concept of triple-loop learning as the progeny of Argyris and Schön’s long-established stream of work on organizational learning, where does this notion come from, how has it evolved, and how is it defined? Our literature search shows that the term first appeared in the 1990s, contemporaneous with the emergence of the ‘learning organization’ theme. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1350507611426239">Table 1</xref> shows key articles identified by this search, selected on the basis that they introduce conceptualizations of triple-loop learning or contain substantive discussions of that notion, together with the sources cited by these authors.</p>

<title>Conceptualization A: Beyond and superior to double-loop learning</title>
<p>The earliest reference in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1350507611426239">Table 1</xref> is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1350507611426239">Hawkins (1991)</xref>, who identifies shortcomings in thinking about learning organizations and argues that ‘treble-loop learning’ is necessary to move beyond the ‘effectiveness thinking’ that can be achieved through double-loop learning. Hawkins therefore addresses what he regards as limitations in Argyris’ thinking by transcending or going beyond a ‘double-loop’ outlook, providing ‘the awareness and deeper purpose which contains and informs the strategic thinking and operational realities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1350507611426239">Hawkins 1991</xref>: 183).</p>
<p>The earliest published use of the term triple-loop learning occurs the following year in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1350507611426239">Swieringa and Wierdsma’s (1992)</xref> book, <italic>Becoming a Learning Organization</italic>, which is cited widely in subsequent literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350507611426239">Bovaird and Rubienska, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1350507611426239">Easterby-Smith, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1350507611426239">Hales, 2000</xref>). Acknowledging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350507611426239">Argyris and Schön (1978</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1350507611426239">Swieringa and Wierdsma (1992</xref>: 41, 42) speak of triple-loop learning as occurring ‘when the essential principles on which the organization is founded come into discussion’ and involving ‘the development of new principles, with which an organization can proceed to a subsequent phase’. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611426239">Isaacs (1993</xref>: 30), discussing dialogue as a reflective process, acknowledges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350507611426239">Argyris and Schön (1978</xref>, among others) and also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1350507611426239">Hawkins (1991)</xref>. He suggests that triple-loop learning ‘opens inquiry into underlying “why’s”…that permits insight into the nature of paradigm itself’. In a similar vein, though in an apparently separate strand of development, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350507611426239">Nielsen (1993</xref>: 118), writing about Woolman’s action-learning method applied to issues of ethics, proposes that triple-loop action learning involves ‘change in the embedded tradition system within which the governing values of a behaviour can be nested’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350507611426239">Nielsen (1993</xref>: 118) suggests that this may represent ‘a theoretical advance beyond’ Argyris and Schön.</p>
<p>This first conceptualization of triple-loop learning is therefore generated by authors who view it as a level that is beyond and superior to Argyris and Schön’s single-loop and double-loop learning, and that is concerned with the underlying purposes, principles or paradigms. Following Argyris and Schön’s schema logically, since double-loop learning involves correction of governing variables, it would appear that triple-loop learning should be concerned with change in whatever governs those governing variables. This could be the ‘paradigm’ to which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611426239">Isaacs (1993</xref>: 30) refers, or the ‘embedded tradition system’ discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350507611426239">Nielsen (1993</xref>: 118). However, these terms remain ill defined and imprecise.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1350507611426239">Roper and Pettit (2002)</xref> observe that the discussion of triple-loop learning is often normative, simply encouraging organizations to aspire beyond single- and double-loop learning. This indicates a sense in which this first conceptualization could exemplify the dominant managerial perspective on organizational learning that is noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1350507611426239">Huysman (2000)</xref>. It is noteworthy that several of the sources cited above emphasize applied learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1350507611426239">Hawkins’ (1991)</xref> article appears in the journal that was the precursor to <italic>Management Learning</italic>, which at that time targeted both academic and practitioner audiences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1350507611426239">Swieringa and Wierdsma’s (1992)</xref> book appears in the practitioner-focused Addison-Wesley series on Organization Development. Isaacs writes in the journal <italic>Organizational Dynamics</italic> whose objective is ‘to link leading-edge thought and research with management practice’. Rhetoric concerned with a higher (or deeper) subject matter that (for example) ‘informs the strategic thinking’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1350507611426239">Hawkins, 1991</xref>: 183), or which concerns the ‘essential principles on which the organization is founded’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1350507611426239">Swieringa and Wierdsma, 1992</xref>: 41, 42) appears to constitute the kind of normative appeal to the value of, or even the necessity for, higher-order learning, that is observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1350507611426239">Roper and Pettit (2002)</xref>.</p>
<p>This conceptualization has also been portrayed in a more instrumental and reductive fashion, such as a solution offered by consultants, or as a strategic choice available to managers. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1350507611426239">Lassey (1998</xref>: 11) describes triple-loop learning as where ‘the role or the mission of the organization is questioned’, and suggests an example of managers deciding intentionally to change the nature of their business from a fast food outlet to a café. This is problematic because changing the nature of a business does not necessarily constitute even double-loop learning; it therefore mistakes a change in external circumstances for change in values or principles.</p>

<sec id="section4-1350507611426239">
<title>Conceptualization B: Deutero-learning</title>
<p>An alternative conceptualization was subsequently offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350507611426239">Flood and Romm (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1350507611426239">Romme and Van Witteloostuijn (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1350507611426239">Snell and Chak (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1350507611426239">Yuthas et al. (2004)</xref>. This differs from the first in that it emphasizes reflexivity towards, and change in, processes of learning, in contrast to the earlier focus of Hawkins and others on the purposes, principles or paradigms that lie behind operations and strategy. This reflexivity echoes Argyris and Schön’s concept of ‘deutero-learning’ (from the Greek ‘deuteros’, meaning second or secondary), which they define (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350507611426239">1978</xref>: 27) as ‘to learn how to carry out single- and double-loop learning’. To learn to single-loop learn implies learning to improve performance at an increasing rate. To learn to double-loop learn implies learning to carry out the reflection on and inquiry into the governing variables, values and norms underlying organizational action. However, in their later work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350507611426239">Argyris and Schön (1996</xref>: 29) appear less clear cut on this matter, when they define organizational deutero-learning as a ‘critically important kind of organizational double-loop learning’.</p>
<p>Flood and Romm, writing about diversity management, acknowledge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1350507611426239">Swieringa and Wierdsma’s (1992)</xref> use of triple-loop learning, but they make no reference to Argyris and Schön (despite discussing single- and double-loop learning). They suggest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350507611426239">Flood and Romm, 1996</xref>: 163) that their own conceptualization (defined as ‘increasing the fullness and deepness of learning about the diversity of issues and dilemmas faced, by linking together all local units of learning in one overall learning infrastructure as well as developing the competences and skills to use this infrastructure’) is distinctive; nevertheless, this also emphasizes learning about the process of learning.</p>
<p>Whilst citing both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350507611426239">Argyris and Schön (1974)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1350507611426239">Hawkins (1991)</xref> in order to construct an analytical framework for a discussion of the learning organization, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1350507611426239">Snell and Chak (1998</xref>: 340) define triple-loop learning for organizations as: ‘Co-inventing—collective mindfulness. Members discover how they and their predecessors have facilitated or inhibited learning, and produce new structures and strategies for learning’. Significantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1350507611426239">Snell and Chak (1998</xref>: 340) explicitly equate triple-loop learning with Argyris and Schön’s deutero-learning.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1350507611426239">Romme and Van Witteloostuijn (1999)</xref>, who adopt Snell and Chak’s notion of collective mindfulness, also equate triple-loop learning with deutero-learning. They offer the following description: ‘Are we doing things right (single-loop learning)? Are we doing the right things (double-loop learning)? Can we participate in making well-informed choices regarding strategy, objectives, etc. (e.g. triple loop learning)?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1350507611426239">Romme and Van Witteloostuijn, 1999</xref>: 452).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1350507611426239">Yuthas et al. (2004)</xref>, who advocate triple-loop learning in relation to ethics in public accounting, acknowledge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350507611426239">Argyris (1982)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350507611426239">Argyris and Schön (1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350507611426239">1978</xref>), but not Snell and Chak. They define triple-loop learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1350507611426239">2004</xref>: 239) as ‘continual reflection on the learning process, the contexts within which learning occurs, and the assumptions and values motivating the learning and influencing its outcomes’.</p>
<p>Is deutero-learning therefore simply Argyris and Schön’s terminology for their own conceptualization of a third order of learning? This appears not to be the case. Although the relationship between double-loop learning and deutero-learning is not always clear in the work of Argyris and Schön, it seems that these concepts often refer to the same second-order learning phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1350507611426239">Visser, 2007</xref>). More recent comments by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350507611426239">Argyris (2003</xref>: 1179) appear definitive on this point:
<disp-quote>
<p>We understood deutero-learning to mean second-order learning, reflecting on the first-order actions. Deutero-learning can occur by going meta on single- or double-loop learning. The distinction is important because the knowledge and skills required to produce double-loop learning are significantly greater and more complicated than those required for deutero-learning on single-loop issues.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, Argyris casts deutero-learning not as a further level in a hierarchy going beyond single- and double-, but as ‘meta’ to either single- or double-loop learning. Saliently, Argyris’ comment about the knowledge and skills required for double-loop learning being significantly greater and more complicated than those required for deutero-learning on single-loop issues, supports our view that Argyris does not regard deutero-learning as a higher order of learning than double-loop learning.</p>
<p>Understandably, the noted confusion about the nature of deutero-learning appears in other authors’ work. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1350507611426239">Thomsen and Hoest (2001</xref>: 474) regard deutero-learning as an extension beyond double-loop learning that resembles the first conceptualization of triple-loop learning, in that ‘members question and challenge the assumptions about the existence of the organization’.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our conceptualization B refers to those authors who have equated Argyris and Schön’s notion of deutero-learning with triple-loop learning. We emphasise that Argyris and Schön themselves did not regard deutero-learning as a third ‘loop’ beyond double-loop learning.</p>

<title>Conceptualization C: Bateson’s Learning III</title>
<p>It is evident from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1350507611426239">Table 1</xref> that, in addition to Argyris and Schön, Bateson is a prominent influence on several authors. We turn now to his framework of ‘levels of learning’ in order to explain the context in which a third distinct conceptualization of ‘third order’ learning (i.e. Learning III) appears. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1350507611426239">Isaacs (1993</xref>: 30) suggests that Learning III could also be called triple-loop learning. Nevertheless, in this section we argue that Bateson’s notion of ‘Learning III’ differs radically from the first two conceptualizations of triple-loop learning in several respects that are significant for our understanding of organizational learning.</p>
<p>Bateson worked across diverse fields including anthropology, cybernetics and family therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1350507611426239">Hawkins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1350507611426239">Visser, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1350507611426239">2007</xref>). While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1350507611426239">Thomas et al. (2007</xref>: 872) report that the majority of Bateson’s citations in the <italic>SSCI</italic> (<italic>Social Science Citation Index</italic>) are in the field of business and organization management, Bateson’s central preoccupation was with epistemology, the ‘processes of knowing, thinking and deciding’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350507611426239">Bateson, 1979</xref>: 242). Working in the field of anthropology in the 1940s, Bateson had observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611426239">1973</xref>: 139, 140) that in psychological experiments:
<disp-quote>
<p>there is a common phenomenon of a somewhat higher degree of abstraction or generality than those which the experiments are planning to elucidate. It is a commonplace that the experimental subject—whether animal or man, becomes a better subject after repeated experiment. He not only learns to salivate at the appropriate moments, or to recite the appropriate nonsense syllables; he also, in some way, <italic>learns to learn</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Based on this observation, Bateson proposed a distinction between proto-learning and deutero-learning. It is relevant to note that like Argyris and Schön, Bateson was influenced by cybernetician Ross Ashby. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350507611426239">Argyris and Schön (1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350507611426239">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350507611426239">1996</xref>) use Ashby’s distinction between variable and parameter change for their definition of single-loop learning and double-loop learning; it also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350507611426239">Bateson, 1958</xref>) underlies the distinction that Bateson made initially in 1942 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611426239">Bateson, 1973</xref>: 141), between proto-learning and deutero-learning. Argyris and Schön also acknowledge Bateson’s influence on their conceptualizations of single-loop and double-loop learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350507611426239">Argyris and Schön, 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350507611426239">1978</xref>) and deutero-learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350507611426239">Argyris, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350507611426239">Argyris and Schön 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350507611426239">1996</xref>). Although they hold Ashby’s distinction in common, Bateson’s and Argyris and Schön’s ideas have diverged.</p>
<p>Subsequently, in 1964, in a paper titled ‘The logical categories of learning and communication’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611426239">Bateson, 1973</xref>: 250–279), Bateson expanded his initial distinction into a five-level model ranging from Learning 0 (learning zero) to Learning IV, shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1350507611426239">Table 2</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1350507611426239">2</xref></sup> While Bateson did not apply this framework to issues of organizational learning himself, it is referenced widely in articles on organizational learning and related topics (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507611426239">Bartunek and Moch, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350507611426239">French and Bazalgette, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1350507611426239">Huysman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350507611426239">Nielsen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1350507611426239">Roach and Bednar, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1350507611426239">Schein, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1350507611426239">Tosey and Mathison, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1350507611426239">Visser, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1350507611426239">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1350507611426239">Wijnhoven, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1350507611426239">Yuthas et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>Bateson described his framework as an attempt to illuminate ‘the barriers of misunderstanding which divide the various species of behavioural scientists … by an application of Russell’s Theory of Logical Types to the concept of “learning”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611426239">1973</xref>: 250). In Bateson’s framework, therefore, each higher level of learning represents the <italic>class</italic> of instances of learning of the lower type. Thus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350507611426239">Bredo (1989</xref>: 36) notes that ‘instrumental conditioning tasks, for example, teach not only how to discriminate between particular stimuli, but also about instrumentality itself’.</p>
<p>This indicates the essence of the difference that we argue exists between conceptualization B and conceptualization C. Conceptualization B entails reflexivity; in other words, it concerns learning as applied to the process of learning itself. Conceptualization C, on the other hand, is a new logical category, one to which all instances of learning at the previous level belong.</p>
<p>It is pertinent to comment on the way Bateson conceived Learning 0, I and II in order to clarify his conceptualization of Learning III. Learning 0 entails responding to stimuli but making no changes based on experience or information. While at first glance one might dismiss the value of Learning 0, it recognizes both the importance and the utility of not changing; for example it may be said to include skilled, unconscious performance, and habituation.</p>
<p>The emphasis of Learning I is change <italic>within</italic> a set of alternatives. Learning I is therefore broadly comparable to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350507611426239">Argyris and Schön’s (1996</xref>: 68) single-loop learning, which occurs ‘whenever an error is detected and corrected without questioning or altering the underlying values of the system …’ In an organization this could occur through seeking more efficient ways to manufacture an existing product or deliver an existing service.</p>
<p>In Learning II, one not only learns but simultaneously learns how to learn. Learning II introduces the notion of <italic>context</italic>, which concerns the meaning given to behaviour; there is change in the way events are punctuated, and ‘<italic>a way of punctuating</italic> is not true or false’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611426239">Bateson 1973</xref>: 271). Context is significant because it emphasizes the need to understand learning as both recursive and relational; Bateson’s ideas entail a shift from a linear to circular notion of causality (as is foundational in cybernetics), and from an individual to a social perspective on learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1350507611426239">Snyder’s (1971)</xref> notion of the hidden curriculum, cited as an example of Learning II by both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350507611426239">Bredo (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350507611426239">Engeström (2001</xref>), refers to the tacit expectations and rules for success of formal educational contexts, of which the teachers may be unaware but which they also reinforce.</p>
<p>What of Learning III? While first introduced by Bateson in 1964, as noted, it was not until 1971 that he added a substantial textual commentary on the idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611426239">1973</xref>: 250, footnote), where he defined Learning III as ‘a corrective change in the system of <italic>sets</italic> of alternatives from which choice is made’. This is a challenging notion; if Learning II is about punctuating experience differently, by implication Learning III might be thought of as an entirely different system of grammar. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611426239">Bateson (1973</xref>: 272) said: ‘something of the sort does, from time to time, occur in psychotherapy, religious conversion, and in other sequences in which there is profound reorganization of character’, and referred to being ‘driven to level III by “contraries” generated at level II’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611426239">1973</xref>: 276).</p>
<p>One possible illustration of Learning III, taken from the world of film, is <italic>The Truman Show</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1350507611426239">Weir, 1998</xref>), in which the entire life of the hero, Truman Burbank, has, from the time of his birth, been a broadcast TV show. All the characters, with the exception of Truman himself, are actors, and his world is a gigantic film set—all of which is known to everyone except, of course, Truman himself. His eventual discovery of this fact presents him with massive and inescapable contradictions in his experience; the realizations, emotions and implications that this entails representing an entirely new set of alternatives, and is probably what Bateson meant by Learning III.</p>

<sec id="section6-1350507611426239">
<title>The significance of Learning III</title>
<p>We now highlight four features of Learning III that are distinct from conceptualizations A and B, and which have implications for the theory and practice of organizational learning: (1) Bateson’s scepticism about the instrumental pursuit of Learning III; (2) his emphasis on Learning III as being beyond language; (3) the recursive organization of the levels of learning; (4) the prevalence of risk in Learning III.</p>
<p>Regarding the first issue, Bateson questioned the idea that Learning III can be achieved through conscious, instrumental means. Bateson was known to hold a deeply passive attitude towards human interference in nature, being sceptical about the capacity for deliberate social planning and intervention to leave ‘the complexity and spirit of the biological world’ unimpaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1350507611426239">Lipset, 1980</xref>: 287). This is echoed in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1350507611426239">Yorks and Marsick (2000)</xref>, who note that generative learning is unpredictable and by definition not controlled, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1350507611426239">Huysman (2000</xref>: 87), who acknowledges that managers are not able to ‘fully engineer the future’. This contrasts markedly, for example, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1350507611426239">Swieringa and Wierdsma’s (1992)</xref> description of triple-loop learning as a means for organizations to make progress.</p>
<p>Regarding the second issue, Bateson saw Learning III as extending beyond the reach of language. This contrasts, for example, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1350507611426239">Swieringa and Wierdsma’s (1992)</xref> description of triple-loop learning as amenable to discussion. Instead, Bateson emphasized the role of the unconscious and aesthetic, saying that learning entails a ‘double involvement of primary process and conscious thought’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350507611426239">Brockman, 1977</xref>: 61) and insisting that ‘no amount of rigorous discourse of a given logical type can “explain” phenomena of a higher type’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611426239">Bateson, 1973</xref>: 265). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611426239">Bateson (1973)</xref> did accept that one can talk about Learning II but that merely talking about Learning II does not constitute Learning III.</p>
<p>With Learning III, a discourse of spirituality and the sacred therefore also becomes prominent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350507611426239">Bateson and Bateson, 1988</xref>). This theme is taken up in Hawkins’ conceptualization of treble-loop learning and, for example, in Bartunek and Moch’s notion of third order change, which they say is ‘initiated by openness to transconceptual experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350507611426239">1994</xref>: 26). Rather than higher orders of learning being achievable by superior cognitive or intellectual skills possessed by those operating at a more rarefied, strategic level of the organization, Bateson’s conceptualization indicates the need for a different type of intelligence. Building on this point, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1350507611426239">Tosey and Mathison (2008)</xref> propose a development of Bateson’s original framework drawing on references to multiple modes of learning (i.e. embodied, analytic and aesthetic) identified in Bateson’s writing.</p>
<p>Regarding the third issue, Bateson’s levels of learning are arranged hierarchically, but he was aware that this was an over-simplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611426239">Bateson, 1973</xref>). Within Bateson’s five levels, higher orders of learning are not inherently superior to or more desirable than lower levels; this challenges conceptualizations of triple-loop learning that conceive of lower levels of learning as being of lesser value than higher levels (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1350507611426239">Snell and Chak, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350507611426239">Bredo (1989</xref>: 32) affirms that this ‘multilevel approach to change is not a stage theory moving sequentially from lower to higher levels of learning’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1350507611426239">Roach and Bednar (1997</xref>: 674) emphasize that Bateson ‘refers to the levels as orders of recursion’, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1350507611426239">Flood and Romm (1996)</xref> allude, if briefly, to a recursive relationship between levels of learning. Rather, the levels go in parallel and represent different orders of abstraction. To illustrate this distinction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350507611426239">Figure 1</xref> is a schematic depiction of a recursive hierarchy. In a linear hierarchy, each successive level appears above the other (as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1350507611426239">Table 2</xref>), and a higher level is assumed to be superior to a lower level, as in a hierarchy of job roles shown on a typical organization chart. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350507611426239">Figure 1</xref>, we have arranged the levels of learning as concentric circles to represent the idea that each successive level extends beyond the boundary of, and includes, the previous level. Learning at ‘higher’ levels means that new premises with a successively wider scope are involved. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350507611426239">Figure 1</xref> also introduces feedback loops from each level to all of the prior levels, and vice versa. These loops represent the central principle of recursion, which is that causality flows from cause to effect and back again, such that ‘a given phenomenon, viewed in context, is both the cause and effect of related phenomena and, ultimately, its own cause’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1350507611426239">Roach and Bednar, 1997</xref>: 674). The diagram looks complex, which is precisely our point; recursion involves greater complexity than, and is more dynamic than, a linear hierarchy.</p>

<p>Regarding the final issue, Bateson’s framework also challenges the assumption that higher orders of learning are necessarily more desirable than lower orders—an assumption that is common in the Western world, where more is usually held to be better. Specifically, a central feature of Bateson’s conceptualization is that higher order learning entails risk, and calls into question the wisdom of the apparent hunger for transformational learning in organizations. Thus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350507611426239">Bateson (1973</xref>: 277) considered that ‘even the attempt at LIII can be dangerous’, with psychotic breakdown as a possible consequence for an individual since the very concept of self may be abandoned. Perhaps not surprisingly, Bateson refers to the notion of fools rushing in where angels fear to tread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350507611426239">Bateson and Bateson, 1988</xref>). Attempts by managers to control and directly effect Learning III may, in an analogous way, result in unintended consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1350507611426239">Roach and Bednar, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1350507611426239">Tosey, 2005</xref>) and profound ‘organizational unlearning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1350507611426239">Tsang and Zahra, 2008</xref>). Significantly, calls for transformation led by an enthusiasm for the value of higher levels of learning may underestimate the impact on an organization’s ecology.</p>
<p>An implication of this feature is that the pursuit of higher orders of learning has ideological and not merely technological dimensions. Authors such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350507611426239">Contu et al. (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1350507611426239">Huysman (2000)</xref> are among the few to identify a value-laden rhetoric in the field of management, such that ‘learning’ and ‘the learning organization’ are seen as unequivocally good things, even (as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1350507611426239">French and Bazalgette, 1996</xref>) as some kind of holy grail. This would appear to be a projection of the type of instrumental, goal-orientated mind-set that Bateson criticized as epistemologically flawed, and in his view likely to lead to disaster.</p>
<p>Bateson therefore offers a darker view that emphasizes risk in the pursuit of transformation. Fundamentally, Bateson’s conceptualization is about wisdom rather than rational knowledge. It involves a change of epistemology—that is, a change in the form of knowing and learning—not merely a change in subject matter (as from operations to strategy in conceptualization A) or a reflexivity about the process of learning, as in conceptualization B. We suggest that the four features discussed here provide the basis for a critique of conceptualizations of triple-loop learning.</p>
<p>The need for further work to apply Bateson’s framework to organizational learning is emphasized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1350507611426239">Engeström (2001</xref>: 139), who suggests that his conceptualization of Learning III was ‘a provocative proposal, not an elaborated theory’, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350507611426239">Bredo (1989</xref>: 36), for whom the levels of learning are ‘properly viewed as a framework and not an elaborated theory’. That it appears to be misconstrued at times is not helped by Bateson’s writing being primarily theoretical and lacking detailed empirical evidence. Bateson’s research style was unconventional to the extent that theory took precedence over empirical observations. Instead of inductive generalization, Bateson favoured abduction, where he used empirical data to illustrate the operationalization of his concepts, not to provide empirical proof. He often collected small amounts of data that were discarded when the thinking they were intended to support was done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1350507611426239">Lipset, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1350507611426239">Visser, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Synthesis and discussion</title>
<p>In order to summarize our ideas, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1350507611426239">Table 3</xref> maps the three conceptualizations we have discussed onto Bateson’s and Argyris and Schön’s schemas. Bateson’s framework of levels of learning appears in the left-hand column. A break is shown between this column and Argyris and Schön’s single- and double-loop learning in the adjacent column in order to indicate that these conceptualizations are related but not isomorphic. In the second column, the broken line between double-loop learning and conceptualization A, ‘Beyond and superior to double-loop learning’, indicates that triple loop learning is not from Argyris and Schön’s work. Argyris and Schön’s deutero-learning appears in the adjacent column to the right. This is shown in lateral relationship to single- and double-loop learning, based on Argyris’ statement quoted above, that: ‘Deutero-learning can occur by going meta on single- or double-loop learning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350507611426239">Argyris, 2003</xref>: 1179). We emphasize that, while Learning II is historically Bateson’s renaming of his initial concept of deutero-learning, Learning II does not equate to Argyris and Schön’s deutero-learning.</p>

<p>The three areas of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1350507611426239">Table 3</xref> marked A, B and C denote the three principal conceptualizations that we have identified. We emphasize that the literature cited can combine or blur these conceptualizations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1350507611426239">Hawkins (1991)</xref>, for example, offers a blend of conceptualizations A and C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1350507611426239">Schippers et al. (2007)</xref> appear to blend conceptualizations A and B when proposing three levels of reflection in teams (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1350507611426239">Swift and West, 1998</xref>). They liken ‘deep reflection’ to triple-loop learning (attributed to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1350507611426239">Nielsen, 1993</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1350507611426239">Snell and Chak, 1998</xref>) in which ‘the norms and values of the team or organisation are questioned and their effect on team and organisational functioning is discussed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1350507611426239">Schippers et al., 2007</xref>: 191). We have not mapped individual authors discussed in this article onto <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1350507611426239">Table 3</xref>, which would give the impression of an over-simplified arena. However, the principal influences on those authors are apparent from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1350507611426239">Table 1</xref> and our foregoing discussion.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that not one of the sources cited above that proposes any conceptualization of triple-loop learning explores similarities or tensions between competing definitions; this article is the first to attempt such a review. The need for such examination is shown, among other things, by the authors cited referring variously to the focus of learning (‘the essential principles on which the organization is founded’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1350507611426239">Swieringa and Wierdsma, 1992</xref>: 41, 42); the process of learning (‘new processes for generating mental maps’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1350507611426239">Snell and Chak, 1998</xref>: 339); the relational scope of learning (‘collective mindfulness’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1350507611426239">Snell and Chak, 1998</xref>: 340); and the product or output that results from learning (‘new structures and strategies for learning’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1350507611426239">Snell and Chak, 1998</xref>: 340; ‘new principles’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1350507611426239">Swieringa and Wierdsma, 1992</xref>: 41, 42).</p>
<p>Furthermore, only two of these sources incorporate empirical work with data relating specifically to triple-loop learning, and even then it is minimal. Discussing the case of Endenburg Elektrotechniek, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1350507611426239">Romme and Van Witteloostuijn (1999</xref>: 440) claim that enabling people to ‘participate in making well-informed choices regarding strategy, objectives, etc.’, constitutes triple-loop learning. However, this is not debated in depth, nor is any evidence presented of the effects of this practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1350507611426239">Snell and Chak (1998)</xref> present data from two case organizations and discuss the types of learning shown to have taken place. However, their account concentrates on single- and double-loop learning, and identifies only one possible instance of triple-loop learning that is not significant to the paper’s findings. Given this, together with our observations about Bateson’s research style, there is an obvious need for empirical work to test and develop each of these conceptualizations.</p>
<p>We have noted that the first conceptualization (A) of triple-loop learning appears to be an attempt to expand Argyris and Schön’s schema. If so, logically it should be concerned with a level of learning beyond the changes in the governing variables that are addressed by double-loop learning. Although some authors refer to notions such as ‘paradigm’, these remain poorly defined and imprecise. The second conceptualization (B) raises the question of whether renaming deutero-learning as triple-loop learning is justified. We consider it is not because Argyris and Schön never conceived of deutero-learning as being at a higher level than double-loop learning, and because it adds confusion to the relationship between deutero-learning and double-loop learning in particular that is already ambiguous in the work of Argyris and Schön.</p>
<p>We have argued that Bateson’s Learning III differs from other conceptualizations of triple-loop learning in that it reveals a dark side to transformation, is non-instrumental, exists beyond language and is recursive. While many of the authors who have introduced a concept of triple-loop learning cite Bateson and appear to be in sympathy with Learning III (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1350507611426239">Hawkins’ (1991)</xref> acknowledgement of a spiritual dimension to organizational learning), we are not convinced that any of these constitute a comprehensive working-through of Bateson’s theory.</p>
<p>What does this analysis imply for the practice of organizational learning, and for those who might seek to pursue transformational change? Bateson’s conceptualization contrasts with constructions of triple-loop learning as a consultancy offering or a form of deeper strategic thinking, showing this order of learning to be potentially destructive. It therefore cautions organizations against seeking utopian solutions through ever higher orders of learning.</p>
<p>Indeed, Bateson’s emphasis on the risks of Learning III lead us to speculate that in many situations, organizations may be in need of Learning 0 or Learning I more than transformation. In other words, significant improvements in performance can often be gained through enabling existing competences to be used to greater effect—perhaps by resisting a felt need to transform. This option, we speculate, may be neglected at times through an acceptance of the imperative to change further and faster, and a belief that Learning 0 is somehow inadequate compared to Learning I, II and III. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350507611426239">Brunsson (1998)</xref>, for example, comments further on the the value of ‘non-learning’ in organizations.</p>
<p>Conversely, the challenges of pursuing transformational change through higher orders of learning should not be underestimated. More typically, we suggest, the rhetoric of transformation may not be matched in action. As an illustrative example, the Copenhagen summit on climate change in December 2009 (COP 15, the 15th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) was concerned with no less transformative a task than that of saving the world from the hypothesized effects of climate change. In order to achieve this, it was believed that the summit would need to produce a paradigmatic shift in strategies for dealing with climate change. If we were to take at face value <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1350507611426239">Swieringa and Wierdsma’s (1992)</xref> suggestion, noted above, that triple-loop learning can take the form of discussion through which progress is achieved, the design would appear sufficient, since it was a collective event through which all interested nations could, in theory, participate in decisions. Yet a familiar format—conferencing among representative delegates—was adopted that was probably better known for producing compromises than breakthroughs. Despite espousal of the need for a transformative outcome, we suggest that the Copenhagen summit was primarily an example of single-loop learning, in Argyris’ terms, and Learning I, in Bateson’s terms.</p>

<title>Concluding comment</title>
<p>In the organizational learning literature, triple-loop learning is the most prominent of the concepts that exist to denote some third order of organizational learning. In this article we have established that whilst triple-loop learning has clearly been inspired by Argyris and Schön, it does not arise explicitly in their published work.</p>
<p>This article has also questioned the preference for higher levels of learning that characterizes much of the organizational learning arena, and has suggested a more nuanced and balanced understanding. This has been accomplished by critically examining the use and definition of the triple-loop concept. Conceptualizations are often loaded with positive value; competing and conflicting definitions have not previously been debated, and have been subjected to virtually no empirical testing. This dearth of empirical research needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>The article has re-recognized Bateson and the importance and relevance of his work to the understanding of organizational learning. We have shown how Bateson’s Learning III raises important questions about the possibility and wisdom of actively pursuing higher orders of learning in organizations in search of transformation. In particular this emphasizes that higher levels of learning cannot be actively planned and may not necessarily have beneficial outcomes. It provides a clear warning against the one-sided preference for higher levels of learning that is sometimes discernible in parts of the organizational learning literature and in consultancy practice.</p>
