<title>Objective:</title>
<p>To evaluate the efficacy of 3 progestin treatment regimens in the management of simple endometrial hyperplasia without cytological atypia in premenopausal women.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Prospective randomized comparative study. The study included 90 premenopausal women with histological diagnosis of simple endometrial hyperplasia (EH) without atypia, during the period from January 2010 to March 2012, at TAIBA Hospital in Kuwait. Patients were randomly allocated to 3 groups of 30 patients each receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, 10 mg/d; group I), norethisterone (NET, 15 mg/d; group II) for 10 days per cycle, or insertion of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS; group III). Patients were reevaluated after 3 months of treatment. Patients with regression and persistence were offered the same medication they were using for another 3 months. The primary outcome of the study was the proportion of patients requiring further treatment for another 3 months.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Patients in the LNG-IUS group showed the highest resolution rate (66.67%). Patients in MPA group had a resolution rate of 36.66% where the resolution rate was 40% in patients of NET group. The patients having LNG-IUS showed a regression rate of 33.3%, whereas patients receiving MPA and NET showed a regression rate of 60% and 56.67%, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the 3 groups regarding the proportion of patients requiring further treatment for another 3 months (χ<sup>2</sup> = 6.501; <italic>P</italic> = .0387).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Endometrial hyperplasia (EH) is defined as an increased ratio of endometrial glands to stroma greater than one to one. In simple EH, the ratio is only slightly increased and the glands may be cystically dilated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112459243">1</xref></sup> The EH is a precursor of the most common female genital malignancy, that is endometrioid endometrial carcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112459243">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Progestational agents are an effective treatment option for EH. Successful treatment of EH with progestins is commonly accompanied by an inactive or suppressed endometrium after therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112459243">3</xref></sup> Progestins appear to decrease glandular cellularity by triggering apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112459243">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are many regimens of progestin therapy for EH. Previously, progestins were used in high doses and for long durations, but current practice tends to use the regimens with a lower dose and for a shorter duration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112459243">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is an intrauterine system with a T-shaped plastic frame of 32 mm long, with a reservoir on the vertical stem of the IUS containing 52 mg of levonorgestrel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112459243">6</xref></sup> It releases 20 μg/d of levonorgestrel (20 μg/d) directly into uterine cavity, producing very high endometrial concentration with very low plasma concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112459243">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of 3 progestin treatment regimens in the management of simple EH without atypia in premenopausal women.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1933719112459243" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>This is a prospective randomized comparative study conducted at TAIBA Hospital in Kuwait during the period from January 2010 to March 2012.</p>
<p>Ninety premenopausal women with histological diagnosis of simple endometrial hyperplasia (EH) without cytological atypia were invited to enroll in the study (although its malignant potential is low, yet considerable numbers of patients were seen frequently in the outpatient clinic). Premenopausal status was defined by measuring the serum follicle-stimulating hormone level (&lt;20 IU/L) and the ongoing menstrual cycle for at least 6 months before inclusion. After the approval of the hospital’s ethics committee, a written informed consent was obtained from each patient to participate in the study.</p>
<p>The initial histologic diagnosis of simple EH without cytological atypia was based on endometrial curettage specimens, obtained by dilatation and curettage (D&amp;C) performed under general anesthesia, and assessed by a gynecologic pathologist using the 1994 World Health Organization classification of EH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112459243">8</xref></sup> CONSORT 2010 Statement was followed in reporting this study.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria included age between 35 and 50 years with abnormal uterine bleeding. Exclusion criteria included hormonal treatment in the previous 6 months before inclusion, associated pathologies of the endometrial cavity or adnexa, atypical EH or complex EH, hot flushes, sleeping disorders, or changes in mood within the 3 months preceding the study, breastfeeding, congenital uterine abnormality, hypothyroidism, hypertension, history of vascular or coagulation disorders, concomitant use of medication or presence of an underlying disease/condition known to affect the metabolism or pharmacokinetics of the study medications, allergy to progestins, family history of breast cancer, and a body mass index greater than 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Initially, each patient was evaluated by transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) to determine endometrial thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719112459243">Figure 1</xref>) and any uterine or adnexal pathology. Eligible patients were randomly allocated to 3 groups of 30 patients each; group I receiving oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 10 mg/d orally (Provera; Pfizer, New York), group II receiving norethisterone (NET) 15 mg/d (orally Primolut-Nor; Schering, Germany), or group III insertion of LNG-IUS (Mirena; Schering, Germany). The oral treatment was for 10 days a month (from the 16th to 25th day of the menstrual cycle) for 3 months.</p>

</fig>
<p>Randomization was performed through a computer-generated, random number list. The random number list was generated by means of the QuickCalcs (GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, California). The group assignment numbers were sealed in an envelope and kept by the study supervisor. After the written informed consent was signed, the opaque envelope was unsealed to determine which treatment modality would be performed.</p>
<p>After 3 months of treatment, each patient was reevaluated by TVS (to measure the endometrial thickness) and outpatient pipelle endometrial biopsy which were obtained between the 20th and 24th day of menstrual cycle. The outcome was determined by comparing the diagnosis of the follow-up pipelle endometrial biopsy with the initial histologic diagnosis. The patients in groups I and II were advised to use condoms as a contraceptive method during the treatment period. The gynecologic pathologist was blinded to the modality of treatment. Response to treatment, based on the histopathology of the posttreatment pipelle endometrial specimens, was defined as follows: (1) posttreatment diagnosis of secretory-, inactive- or atrophic-pattern endometrium was classified as resolution; (2) posttreatment diagnosis of proliferative pattern endometrium was classified as regression; (3) posttreatment diagnosis of EH was classified as persistence if the specimen showed simple EH; and (4) posttreatment diagnosis of EH was classified as progression if the specimen showed complex EH and/or atypia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112459243">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The primary outcome of the study was the proportion of patients requiring further treatment for another 3 months according to the pipelle endometrial biopsy performed after 3 months of the start of treatment.</p>
<p>Patients with resolution in the follow-up pipelle endometrial biopsy discontinued therapy and were asked to come for follow-up with TVS 3 months later. Patients with regression and persistence were offered the same medication they were using for another 3 months and were then reevaluated by a third pipelle endometrial biopsy. Treatment was stopped and hysterectomy was suggested for those patients with no histological evidence of complete regression or if there was histological evidence of persistence of EH or progression of EH to atypia (in the third endometrial sample) or persistence of uterine bleeding following a total of 6 months of treatment, without any further biopsies.</p>
<p>The primary focus of this study was the proportion of patients requiring further treatment for another 3 months. Based on a similar investigation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112459243">10</xref></sup> a sample size of 28 patients per group was calculated for 90% power, α = .05, β = .1, and anticipated effect size = 0.40 using sample size software (G*Power Ver. 3.00.10, Germany). Therefore, we decided to include 30 patients per group to compensate for any losses during the follow-up.</p>
<p>Demographic characteristics, endometrial thickness (before treatment and 3 months after treatment), treatment outcomes, proportion of patients requiring further treatment for another 3 months, and side effects were recorded for each group and were compared using chi-square test and analysis of variance, where appropriate.</p>
<p><italic>P</italic> values &gt;.05 were considered statistically nonsignificant, <italic>P</italic> values &lt;.05 were considered statistically significant, and <italic>P</italic> values &lt;.01 were considered statistically highly significant for all comparisons.

<p>After 3 months of treatment, no patients in any group developed progression of EH in the follow-up endometrial sample.

<p>No persistence of EH occurred in any of the patients in LNG-IUS group, while EH persisted in only 2 patients (1 in MPA group and 1 in NET group; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1933719112459243">Table 2</xref>). Both of them accepted to continue on the same allocated medication for another 3 months. The endometrial biopsy performed for the patient in the MPA group, at the end of the sixth month, showed secretory endometrium. While the endometrial biopsy performed for the patient in the NET group showed persistence of EH without atypia.</p>
<p>Of the 90 patients, 47 patients (52.22%) continued to receive the allocated treatment MPA (21.11%), NET (20%), and LNG-IUS (11.11%) for another 3 months. No progression of EH occurred in any of these patients. Persistence of EH occurred only in 1 patient in the NET group. This patient was 45 years old, and she did not want to keep the uterus, so she underwent hysterectomy. Resolution and regression rates for all groups, after 6 months of treatment, were similar to those after 3 months of treatment.</p>
<p>The side effects were comparable between the 3 groups. Bloating developed in 2 patients in the MPA group and in 2 patients in the NET group, nausea developed in 2 patients in MPA group and in 2 patients in the NET group, while none developed in LNG-IUS group, but amenorrhea occurred in 3 patients in the LNG-IUS group and none in the other 2 groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Endometrial hyperplasia is a common disease. Uterus is considered a symbol of womanhood and femininity especially in the Arab countries. Removing one’s uterus will have a major psychological impact upon her. So, all the efforts are to be done to preserve the uterus as much as it could be.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge; the present study is, to date, the first to compare MPA, NET, and LNG-IUS for treatment of EH without atypia in premenopausal women.</p>
<p>The major finding of the study is using LNG-IUD for the treatment of EH without atypia in premenopausal women for 3 months; it was associated with statistically significant reduction in the endometrial thickness and the proportion of patients requiring further treatment for another 3 months, and a highest rate of resolution of EH as compared to using MPA and NET for the same duration, without obvious side effects. Also, none of the patients treated with LNG-IUS showed persistent EH. So, the patients in LNG-IUS group were treated successfully compared to the other 2 groups. The difference was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>These results are in accordance with those obtained by Vereide et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112459243">11</xref></sup> who compared LNG-IUS with MPA (10 mg daily for 10 days a month repeated for 3 months) by performing nuclear axis measurements to evaluate the treatment effect in the 2 groups. They concluded that, after 3 months, all patients treated with LNG-IUS showed regression of hyperplasia, whereas 14 of 31 patients in the MPA group still had persisting disease. But in this study they included patients with all types of EH.</p>
<p>The results of Ørbo et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112459243">10</xref></sup> are in accordance with our results. They showed that the LNG-IUD treatment was significantly superior to oral MPA treatment. They obtained 100% effectiveness with the LNG-IUS as long as it remained in situ. But they included patients with all types of EH and the follow-up was after 6 months.</p>
<p>In our study, the resolution and regression rates of EH in those treated with MPA and NET were in accordance with those obtained by Ozdegirmenci et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112459243">12</xref></sup> who compared MPA (10 mg/d), lynestrenol (15 mg/d), and NET (15 mg/d) for 10 days/cycle for 3 months, for treatment of EH without atypia.</p>
<p>Bese et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112459243">13</xref></sup> evaluated the effect of 3 months of cyclic progesterone treatment (NET, 15 mg/d) on proliferation and apoptosis in simple EH without atypia. They found that 3 months of cyclic progesterone treatment reduces both proliferative and apoptotic activities in endometrial tissue with simple hyperplasia.</p>
<p>Ferenczy and Gelfand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112459243">14</xref></sup> used MPA 10 mg/d for 14 days/month for 6 months in patients without cellular atypia and a dose of 20 mg/d for 6 months in patients with cellular atypia. They reported a persistence rate of 14% in the patients without cytological atypia. In our study, the persistence rate was 6.6% after 3 months of treatment, indicating that most of the patients responded well to progestins. The LNG-IUS costs about 60 KD ($213.42) in Kuwaiti market, but it appears to be more convenient for many women as compared to daily intake of tablets for 10 days each month, in addition to its contraceptive effect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1933719112459243">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The use of LNG-IUS for treating EH without atypia in premenopausal women for 3 months was associated with highest resolution rate and lowest proportion of patients requiring further treatment for another 3 months as compared to the use of MPA and NET for the same period of time. Thus, LNG-IUS appears to represent an effective convenient treatment option for such condition. However, we recommend periodic outpatient pipelle endometrial sampling for at least the first 2 years of follow-up.</p>
