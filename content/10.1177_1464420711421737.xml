<abstract>
<p>Friction stir welding (FSW) is a recently developed welding technique, where the metals that are welded are not melted. FSW takes place at temperatures below the solidus points of the metals that are joined. FSW is thus a solid-state process. This can yield weldments of a significantly higher strength than those achieved by traditional fusion welding processes. This is due to the enhanced grain structure of the FSW materials. Submerged FSW is performed underwater for structural purposes such as oil platforms and pipelines, or in industrial settings and laboratories in order to further enhance the strength of the weldments, sometimes exceeding the strength of the parent materials. Submerged FSW, due to the significantly lower temperatures of the process compared to FSW in air, yields even more enhanced grain structures and greater strengths. In the experiments performed here, it is shown that the hydrogen generated during submerged FSW is produced at rates and quantities sufficient to be easily detected by means of a fuel cell. The generated hydrogen, which is a function of the FSW parameters, can be used as a means of sensing and control of submerged FSW which can be applied to robotic and automatic submerged FSW.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1464420711421737"><title>1.1 Friction stir welding</title>
<p>Friction stir welding (FSW) is a recently developed welding technique (1991) in which materials are joined by a rotating tool applied along the weld line that causes the material to be stirred together and form a joint while in the solid state. A basic schematicdiagram demonstrating this process is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1464420711421737">Fig. 1</xref>.
<fig id="fig1-1464420711421737" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The essential schematic diagram of FSW [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464420711421737">1</xref></bold>]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711421737-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1464420711421737">Fig. 1</xref>, the tool rotates and applies an axial force to the material while traversing the weld line. Frictional heat is generated by the shoulder of the tool and the plasticized material is stirred together by the pin which extends out from the shoulder. One of the major advantages of FSW is that because welding occurs at the solid state, welds do not contain melt-related defects and exhibit high joint strength, even in materials such as certain aluminium alloys which are considered ‘non-weldable by conventional techniques’ [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464420711421737">2</xref></bold>]. For this reason, processes that require aluminium to be joined are increasingly using FSW for this purpose.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1464420711421737"><title>1.2 Submerged friction stir welding</title>
<p>A sub-field of FSW is submerged FSW (SFSW), in which FSW is performed underwater. There are a number of reasons to research SFSW. One would be to discover FSW’s potential as an underwater welding technology for use on aquatic construction and repair. SFSW could also be used to improve the quality of non-aquatic welds [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464420711421737">3</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464420711421737">5</xref></bold>]. The report ‘An analysis of microstructure and corrosion resistance of underwater friction stir processed 304 L stainless steel’ discusses an example motivation for using SFSW, inthat, the tool temperature is kept lower, whichcould yield less sigma phase [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464420711421737">6</xref></bold>]. This is a supposition. Another motivation, discussed in the paper ‘Submerged friction stir processing (SFSP): An improved method for creating ultra-fine-grained bulk materials’, is that SFSP (FSP is a process where the approach used in FSW is employed for creating fine-grained microstructures rather than joining) leads to a reduction in grain size compared to FSP run in air [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464420711421737">7</xref></bold>]. Because of these advantages, it is possible that submerged FSW will find applications in a number of industries.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1464420711421737"><title>1.3 Aluminium and hydrogen generation</title>
<p>In the paper ‘Hydrogen gas generation in the wet cutting of aluminium and its alloys’, hydrogen is shown to be released when aluminium is cut underwater [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464420711421737">8</xref></bold>].The paper attributes this to the reaction of the freshly revealed aluminium with water. The chemical formula for the reaction is stated to be most likely
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1464420711421737"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711421737-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>The explanation for the release of hydrogen is the oxidation of freshly exposed aluminium. The surface of aluminium has an oxide layer, which prevents theinner material from oxidizing. When this inner material is exposed by cutting or machining, it oxidizes. When this is done underwater, the oxygen is taken from water molecules and hydrogen gas is released.</p>
<p>In the paper, bubbles are shown to develop along the freshly cut surface of aluminium. A flame test and hydrogen detector were used to demonstrate that these bubbles were indeed hydrogen.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1464420711421737"><title>2 EXPERIMENT</title>
<p>An experiment was performed to demonstrate the release of hydrogen gas during SFSW. The experimental set-up included a tank system for clamping aluminium samples underwater, as well as components tocollect released hydrogen. This set-up is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1464420711421737">Fig. 2</xref>.
<fig id="fig2-1464420711421737" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Submerged FSW set-up</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711421737-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In the experiments, the aluminium to be welded is clamped underwater. The sample is a 25 × 7.5 cm<sup>2</sup> section of 6.35-mm thick 6061-T6 aluminium. The FSW tool is made of steel and uses a square probe.A shoulder diameter of 1.6 cm (5/8 in) and square probe diagonal dimension of 0.64 cm (1/4 in) were used. Welds presented in this study were made at 1000 r/min, 5i/min, and with a 2° angle of attack (or pitch angle). Triangular funnels were used to collect hydrogen gas generated during the weld. The funnels travel with the tool and remain at a constant distance from the tool throughout the experiment. The funnels were connected by tubing to a hydrogen fuel cell. The voltage of the fuel cell was monitored and used to indicate the presence of hydrogen. A block diagram of the experimental set-up is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1464420711421737">Fig. 3</xref>.
<fig id="fig3-1464420711421737" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Block diagram of experimental set-up</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711421737-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The fuel cell combines hydrogen and oxygen (taken from the air) and produces water according to the following reactions, which take place at the anode and cathode connections of the fuel cell, respectively
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-1464420711421737"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711421737-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-1464420711421737"><label>(3)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711421737-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>In a typical fuel cell operation, the hydrogen ions pass through a membrane, while the electrons are directed through a load circuit [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464420711421737">9</xref></bold>]. The voltage and current produced by a fuel cell can therefore be used as indicators of hydrogen. In the first experiment, the aluminium was processed three times. Essentially, the FSW tool traversed through the same weld line three times. During this time, the voltage measured across the fuel cell was periodically recorded. After all three passes were made, a short circuit was created across the fuel cell and the resulting voltages were recorded; this was repeated a second time. The tubes connecting the fuel cell to the hydrogen-collecting funnels were then disconnected and the fuel cell was short-circuited a third time. The recorded voltages for this experiment are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1464420711421737">Fig. 4</xref>.
<fig id="fig4-1464420711421737" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Fuel cell voltage in experiment 1. Dashed lines indicate start and stop of welds</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711421737-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It is evident that hydrogen is being released during SFSW of aluminium. As a means of further investigation, a second experiment was performed, where a resistor of 985 Ohms was added to the circuit. The resistor connected the terminals of the fuel cell to provide a load path for the accumulated charges. A second experiment was run; however, this time, only one pass was made and the process monitored until the voltage across the resistor returned to zero. The voltage across this resistor is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1464420711421737">Fig. 5</xref>.
<fig id="fig5-1464420711421737" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Resistor voltage in experiment 2</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1464420711421737-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>This experiment gives an indication of the total number of charges generated by the process and therefore an indication of the total amount of hydrogen released. However, it is not likely that all released hydrogen gas was collected by our system; so, this represents an incomplete count. This problem will be further discussed in the future work section.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1464420711421737" sec-type="discussion"><title>3 DISCUSSION</title>
<p>This research documents the presence of released hydrogen gas during SFSW. This release could be useful as a feedback signal during welding. According to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1464420711421737">equation (1)</xref>, the amount of hydrogen released is in direct relation to fresh (non-oxidized) aluminium exposed by the process. By integrating the charges produced, a total amount of exposed aluminium can be determined and in turn potentially related to features of the weld. It is believed that the relationship between charges produced and aluminium exposed by the FSW process is linear and therefore the total exposed aluminium can be determined empirically by experimental correlation with the integral of produced charge. One example use is the detection of flash. Excess flash produced along theweld will result in larger hydrogen release due to the increased amount of fresh aluminium exposed. Future research should focus on determining which welding or environmental conditions can be related to hydrogen production effectively. Further testing would be required to assess the usefulness of the sensed hydrogen as a measure of quality.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1464420711421737" sec-type="conclusion"><title>4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK</title>
<p>The release of hydrogen gas in submerged FSW was demonstrated. An apparatus for collecting and measuring the hydrogen was exhibited. Future work should focus on capturing a larger percentage of the released hydrogen and quantifying that amount. This could then be related to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1464420711421737">equation (1)</xref> to fully understand and verify the chemical process underlying the generation. Additionally, it is proposed by the authors that a useful relationship exists between hydrogen generation and weld quality. Excess hydrogen generation would indicate a large amount of flash, while low hydrogen generation would indicate incomplete tool contact with the material surface. In both cases, poor weld quality would be indicated.</p>
<p>For sensing and control, a purpose-built hydrogen sensor should be used with near-real-time hydrogen measurement capability. By correlating detected hydrogen data with various metrics of weld quality, a defect detection algorithm may be found.</p></sec>
