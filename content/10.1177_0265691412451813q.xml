<sec id="sec1-0265691412451813q"><title>Peter Paret, <italic>The Cognitive Challenge of War: Prussia 1806</italic>, Princeton University Press: Princeton NJ, 2009; 164 pp., 8 illus.; 9780691135816, £15.95 (hbk)</title>
<p>Peter Paret needs no introduction. His contribution to our understanding of Clausewitz and his expertise in the era of the Prussian reforms in particular put him in a perfect position to write about Prussia’s catastrophic defeat in 1806 and its long-term and short-term practical, social and intellectual ramifications in Prussia and Germany.</p>
<p>The breadth of the author’s knowledge goes far beyond the spheres of military theory and history. Hegel and Habermas are quoted with the same ease as little-known writings by the young Clausewitz. Paret’s mastery of French and German is easily discernible, in prose and even in verse. The book is a pleasure to read, written in elegant prose and well matched by the good binding and tasteful production.</p>
<p>The theme of the book is innovation in war. Rather than write a general treatise on this subject, the author decided to use the Prussian defeat of 1806 and its aftermath as a case study.</p>
<p>The first chapter discusses military innovations and their interdependence with the spheres of society and politics. The author then provides a short and succinct overview of the events leading up to the war of 1806 and the war itself. This narrative provides the factual basis for the analysis of the Prussian response to the defeat. The second chapter examines Prussian and wider German reactions to the event in the shape of popular engravings and arts. The third chapter turns its sights on the institutional responses of the Prussian state and army in the shape of the Prussian reforms, but also discusses the effect on the elite of Prussian and German artists and writers. The fourth and final chapter discusses the work of military theorists in the years before and after the Jena Campaign, with particular emphasis on Clausewitz and Jomini, who had fought on opposing sides during this campaign. The author concludes with an encouragement to study wars and campaigns not just from a narrow military history perspective, but to study war and nations’, states’ and societies’ perceptions of and responses to war in a holistic fashion. Indeed, this book itself is a model of this comprehensive approach.</p>
<p>The book is full of insights on the nature of military innovation, the way in which Clausewitz’s thought was shaped by contemporary drama, aesthetic theory, philosophy, works of other theorists, and his personal experience, and many other revelations. For the reader, it is also fascinating to see to what degree the Clausewitz-expert Paret seems to have internalized Clausewitzian methodology.</p>
<p>One can not fail, however, to notice some imperfections in this book. Considering the attention that the author devotes to interpreting paintings, it would have been appropriate to provide colour rather than black and white illustrations, particularly in the case of the Caspar David Friedrich painting. The maps, which accompany the campaign narrative in the first chapter, just about serve their purpose but seem somewhat primitive. These, however, are minor niggles and may not be of much concern to most readers. Whilst Paret is an established authority in Prussian history in this period, he could have consulted and referenced more recent literature on the campaign. Finally, at times the book’s origins in a series of lectures shine through. Paret has set himself an ambitious task – to write a holistic and comprehensive analysis of the Jena Campaign’s aftermath, and to do so in a coherent manner. Whilst the author has achieved this to an admirable degree, the book reflects two structural tensions throughout. The first tension is between a traditional case study in military innovation on the one hand, and a broader, cultural and cognitive approach to the study of war on the other hand. Whilst Paret’s observations on art are erudite and truly fascinating, on occasion they appear almost self-indulgent and only superficially woven into the overall purpose of the book. The author clearly loves his subject, but this can lead to a far more detailed discussion of a particular work of art than is warranted, even though the author repeatedly tries to establish the wider connections. The second tension is between the study of the Prussian state’s, army’s, and society’s reaction on the one hand, and a study of an individual’s – Clausewitz’s – thought and its evolution on the other hand. Whilst the author discusses the wider Prussian response beyond the person of Clausewitz, his profound interest in Clausewitz and Jomini’s alternative approach to military theory at times threatens to imbalance the book as a whole. These structural problems could have been avoided by publishing this work as a collection of related essays rather than a unitary piece.</p>
<p>The above criticism notwithstanding, this book is a major achievement that few historians could even have tried to undertake, and the reader will be richly rewarded by the unusually comprehensive perspective and the many compelling insights. Anybody interested in Prussian history of the nineteenth century, Napoleonic military history, military and strategic theory, or the history of military innovation will find the price well worth paying.</p>
