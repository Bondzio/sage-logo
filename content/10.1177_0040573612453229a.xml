<p><italic>Theories of Ethics: An Introduction to Moral Philosophy with a Selection of Classic Readings</italic></p>
<p>Gordon Graham</p>
<p>New York and London: Routledge, 2011. 400 pp. $44.95</p>
<p>This book represents a substantial revision of a previous book (<italic>Eight Theories of Ethics</italic>, Routledge, 2004) written by Gordon Graham, who is Professor of Philosophy and the Arts at Princeton Seminary. This new book includes ten chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the book by focusing on “Ethics, Truth, and Reason.” Chapters 2–8 present the eight theories that formed the foundation of the original book: Contractualism, Egoism, Hedonism, Naturalism and Virtue, Existentialism, Kantianism, and Utilitarianism. The last two chapters, which are new additions, look at specific areas of moral thinking: “Ethics and the Environment” (chapter 9) and “Ethics, Religions, and the Meaning of Life” (chapter 10). Another significant addition to the original book is the inclusion of excerpts from primary sources that correspond to each of the ten chapters and include selections by David Hume, Thomas Reid, John Locke, John Rawls, Plato, Friedrich Nietzsche, Aristotle, Epicurus, Jean-Paul Sartre, Immanuel Kant, John Stuart Mill, James Lovelock, and Albert Camus.</p>
<p>The use of typologies, of course, can fall into the errors of simplicity and caricature. This book avoids these errors and provides a clear, introductory “road map” to the discipline of ethics. The book is, as the subtitle indicates, an introduction to philosophical rather than theological theories of ethics and as such would make an excellent introductory text in a course on moral philosophy. It could, however, also be used as a primary or secondary source in a course in theological ethics if one is willing to make the connection between theology and philosophy via lectures or other sources. Really good introductory texts in the field of ethics are hard to find; this one is first rate.</p>
