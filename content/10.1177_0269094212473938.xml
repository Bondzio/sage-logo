<abstract>
<p>This article focuses on the importance of the community context for voluntarism within shifting discourses of localism in England and Scotland. Mobilising communities through the encouragement and support of voluntarism is an important policy and practice driver in both jurisdictions, but is non-reserved. In this context, we outline the ways localism discourses have been mobilised, drawing on case study research in deprived urban areas of Scotland and England to explore the implications of these for sustaining voluntarism. We argue it is important to recognise that the social, spatial and economic context in which voluntarism takes place is multi-layered: some acts are undertaken through an organisation, others may be part of one-to-one acts of helping, or through semi-formal or informal neighbourhood/community groups. If expectations of further voluntarism are to be realistic and sustainable, discourses of localism must support this at the local level and recognise the diverse range of both visible and less visible acts which take place over time. Otherwise unrealistic, unsustainable and ultimately unachievable models and amounts of voluntary participation may be asked of communities, posing serious challenges for ‘localism’ discourse.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0269094212473938" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>A decade ago in this journal Irene Hardill and Sue Baines highlighted the growing policy interest in voluntarism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094212473938">Hardill and Baines, 2003</xref>). As part of this special issue on localism we wish to focus on the implications for voluntarism of localism rhetoric, by drawing on research undertaken in deprived urban communities. In particular, we wish to critically reflect on how far a divergence in public policy towards voluntarism and communities is emerging between Scotland and England, given that such policies are non-reserved. Across the UK, including England and Scotland, changing economic, social and political contexts have seen an emphasis on the ‘local’ as a space of individual and community participation (Amin, 2007). This raises questions regarding the capacities of individuals and communities to participate equally in such agendas and how the resilience of these actors may influence, and be influenced by, this trend.</p>
<p>Increasing academic attention has been given to the ongoing process of devolution within the UK with regards to emerging economic geographies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094212473938">Danson and Lloyd, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094212473938">Danson et al., 2012</xref>), social policy directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269094212473938">Birrell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269094212473938">Mooney and Scott, 2012</xref>), governmental and governance rhetoric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269094212473938">Leith, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269094212473938">Scott and Wright, 2012</xref>) and devolved third sector policy and governance frameworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094212473938">Alcock, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094212473938">2012</xref>). Less attention, however, has been given to how far the position of voluntarism itself may also be diverging. Given that ‘Big Society’ discourse (and accompanying governance) has not been adopted in Scotland and voluntarism is a non-reserved policy area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094212473938">Alcock, 2012</xref>), this is surprising. The increasing (often implicit) roles of acts of individual and collective voluntarism in these governance discourses are intrinsically place based and often local. It therefore follows that the nature, extent and capacity for involvement is likely to vary geographically and socio-economically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269094212473938">McCulloch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269094212473938">Mohan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0269094212473938">Williams, 2003b</xref>). Attention must be given to both individual and institutional capacities at the local level to engage with voluntary activity if increased expectations of participation are to be realistic and sustainable.</p>
<p>In this article we focus on the importance of the community context for voluntarism within shifting discourses of localism in England and Scotland. We do so specifically with reference to more deprived urban areas. We seek to move beyond conventional quantitative assessments of rates of formal volunteering (lower amongst more deprived populations) and ask ‘what else matters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269094212473938">Horton and Kraftl, 2009</xref>) outwith the most formal activity, to engage more fully with the lived perceptions and experiences in the local and individual level ‘doing’ of volunteering. This, we argue, renders visible activities, motivations and roles for both individuals and organisations that would otherwise be unrecognised and ‘below the radar’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094212473938">McCabe, 2011</xref>). This therefore raises important questions for how voluntarism is nurtured, supported and valued within the context of a localism agenda which relies heavily on voluntarism. It first outlines how localism discourses relating to voluntarism have been mobilised within Scotland and England, before drawing on in-depth micro-sociological research undertaken within the two jurisdictions to identify possible implications of these discourses for sustaining voluntarism.</p>

<p>Scotland gained its Parliament in 1999 and has been governed by the Scottish National Party first in 2007, and most recently with a majority in 2011.</p>
<p>Post-1999, the Active Communities Initiative (ACI) launched in 2000 had four aims: (1) to bring about more positive attitudes at all levels to volunteering and community action; (2) to locate volunteering and community action at the heart of policy and practice; (3) to broaden the range of people involved and (4) to increase the number of people involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269094212473938">Scottish Executive, 2000</xref>). Funding for the ACI was difficult to isolate from other funding streams, however, with an unclear monitoring framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269094212473938">Stephenson, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The strongest focus on ‘volunteering’ nationally was the Volunteering Strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269094212473938">Scottish Executive, 2004</xref>). Here, the personal and wider societal benefits of volunteering were emphasised:<disp-quote>
<p>almost every aspect of everyday life – the communities in which we live, the physical environment, our recreation and leisure activities, our places of work and worship, our schools and our hospitals – benefit from the input of volunteers. But volunteers themselves also benefit as a result of their actions. Volunteering can provide a real sense of personal fulfilment and achievement, the opportunity to make friends and to establish new contacts, and the reward of developing new skills and mastering new challenges. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269094212473938">Scottish Executive, 2004</xref>: 1).</p></disp-quote>In so doing, its objectives were:
<list id="list1-0269094212473938" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>focusing on Project Scotland and young people;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>dismantling the barriers to volunteering and closing the opportunity gap;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>improving the volunteering experience and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>monitoring, evaluation and ongoing policy development.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>There appeared an emphasis on the <italic>experience</italic> of voluntarism, the (local) barriers to participation, and the ways in which benefits may accrue at multiple scales from the individual, to community, to national levels.</p>
<p>A step-change has then been identified, from ‘interventional’ national volunteering policy framed mainly around a social justice discourse of removing barriers, towards a more localised ‘infrastructural’ approached with less emphasis on volunteering at the national level, but continued investment in local organisations and the emergence of Third Sector Interfaces (TSIs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269094212473938">Lee, 2012</xref>). Since 2007, Local Authorities (LAs) have had a greater degree of freedom in the allocation of their budgets as part of the Concordat with the Scottish Government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269094212473938">Scottish Government, 2007</xref>). As part of the Single Outcome Agreements that this entailed, the place of Community Planning Partnerships in the design and delivery of services in LAs has become more important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269094212473938">Park and Kerley, 2011</xref>). TSIs bring Volunteer Centres, third sector agencies (through Councils for Voluntary Service (CVSs)) and Community Planning Partnerships together in each of the 32 LAs potentially offering spatially sensitive voluntary action support.</p>
<p>The 2009 Community Empowerment Action Plan was couched far more strongly in the language of ‘empowerment’ with the place of the ‘local’ (at the community level) strongly emphasised: ‘ … [community empowerment] … stimulates and harnesses the energy of <italic>local</italic> people to come up with creative and successful solutions to <italic>local</italic> problems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269094212473938">Scottish Government, 2009</xref>: 6, emphases author’s own). It also placed a far stronger emphasis on economic issues and the empowerment of communities to deliver their own services: <italic>‘</italic>The confidence and resilience that grows when people work together in their communities is never more important than in challenging economic times and when facing major social problems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269094212473938">Scottish Government, 2009</xref>: 5). This working together is characterised by an emphasis on ‘community action’ (rather than voluntarism per se) which ‘is about all of us recognising that communities doing things for themselves can sometimes be the best way of delivering change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269094212473938">Scottish Government, 2009</xref>: 6) through ‘locally owned, community led organisations’ acting as ‘anchors’. Given the absence of a renewed Volunteering Strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094212473938">Hardill and Lee, 2011</xref>) it is possible this is the model along which volunteering is being encouraged to develop. The forthcoming Community Empowerment and Renewal Bill should also therefore be noted. It states achieving public service reform ‘will not be possible without working with our partners in the public, private and third sectors – and with communities themselves – to unlock the knowledge, potential and abilities of all Scotland’s communities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269094212473938">Scottish Government, 2012</xref>: 4). Therefore the Bill aims to ‘strengthen opportunities for <italic>communities</italic> to take independent action to achieve their own goals and aspirations and ensure <italic>communities</italic> are able to have a greater role in determining how their public services are delivered’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269094212473938">Scottish Government, 2012</xref>: 5, emphases author’s own).</p>
<p>Voluntarism also plays a role in Scottish public service reform. In light of decreased public sector budgets, the 2011 Scottish Spending Review highlighted the role of the third sector in service delivery (particularly preventative services) and accessing more hard to reach groups; and signified ongoing support for a socially enterprising model of third sector activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269094212473938">Scottish Government, 2011a</xref>). This is echoed in the Report of the Christie Commission on the Future Delivery of Public Services, where services are to maximise ‘scarce resources by utilising all available resources from the public, private and third sectors, individuals, groups and communities’ to provide services that are ‘delivered in partnership, involving local communities, their democratic representatives, and the third sector’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0269094212473938">Scottish Government, 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, there has been an increased emphasis on the ‘local’ (community) as a context for, and beneficiary of, voluntarism, whilst at the same time (community) ‘empowerment’ has become a central component of voluntarism rhetoric (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094212473938">Alcock, 2009</xref>: 10). This suggests a shift away from a focus on the ways the act of voluntarism itself might be supported and sustained and the benefits this might bring to the individual. The emphasis may now be moving toward the ways in which members of ‘local’ communities can be engaged to address ‘local’ (place-based) challenges including the delivery of public services, the ownership of assets and engagement in decision-making processes. However, narratives of both community empowerment and public service reform in Scotland have been positioned as distinct from the ‘Big Society’ programme. First Minister Alex Salmond has stated: ‘ … much has been said about the Big Society. I am more concerned by the Fair Society. And I am concerned that in the rush to adapt, good things will be lost’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094212473938">BBC News, 2010</xref>), envisaging ‘[A] tale of two countries, of two very different visions of society and of the future … there is a harshness to the UK government’s approach that goes against the grain of Scottish society’ (Salmond, 2011 cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094212473938">Barnes, 2011</xref>). What is clear is that for the visions which have been set out above to be achieved, capacities for voluntarism at the local level are very much required.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0269094212473938"><title>Localism and voluntarism in England</title>
<p>Over the past 15 years voluntarism in England has moved from the ‘shadows into the policy spotlight’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269094212473938">Kendall, 2010</xref>: 1), focusing – as in Scotland – on one dimension of voluntarism, formal acts of voluntarism (through an organisation) as opposed to more informal voluntary activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0269094212473938">Williams, 2003a</xref>). Under New Labour (1997–2010), voluntarism was seen as able to solve social problems associated with worklessness via such schemes as The New Deal projects for the young, older adults or single mothers, or Sure Start projects that offered training for formal volunteering and encouraged parents to use this as a route into employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269094212473938">National Evaluation of Sure Start (NESS), 2004</xref>). They supported participants to develop skills, contacts and credentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212473938">Doyle and Smith, 1999</xref>). Voluntarism therefore became aligned with welfare-to-work policies, which some suggest have tended to devalue non-marketised activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094212473938">Lister, 2002</xref>), and some of these policies were spatially targeted at disadvantaged communities (Amin, 2007). The ‘V’ initiative (2006–2011) also promoted the skills, experience and confidence which can be gained by young people through voluntarism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094212473938">Hill et al., 2009</xref>) and became strongly linked with education. The benefits of voluntarism were also expounded to young people through the National Curriculum, with volunteering seen as part of being a good citizen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094212473938">Hardill and Baines, 2011</xref>). New Labour also identified National Indicator 6 ‘participation in regular volunteering’ in Local Area Agreements (LAAs)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269094212473938">1</xref></sup> in an attempt to raise the profile of volunteering at local level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094212473938">Hardill and Baines, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As a consequence, in addition to the traditional altruistic impulses to volunteer (philanthropy and mutual aid; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094212473938">Davis Smith, 1995</xref>) it has been suggested that two ‘new’ types of volunteer have appeared in empirical studies of volunteer sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094212473938">Hardill and Baines, 2011</xref>). They participate because they either (1) have been excluded from paid work and need support to prepare for it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269094212473938">Parsons and Broadbridge, 2004</xref>); or (2) see volunteering as a route into a desired career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094212473938">McDonald and Warburton, 2003</xref>). Both reinforce the role of volunteering in training and retraining for the workplace; the first in terms of rehabilitation and increasing job-readiness and the second with regard to career development.</p>
<p>What <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269094212473938">Kendall (2010</xref>: 1) has called a ‘relatively upbeat context for the British domestic pro-volunteering policy community’ has continued under the Conservative-led Coalition. In the 2010 Conservative election manifesto David Cameron argued, ‘a country is at its best when the bonds between people are strong’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269094212473938">Conservative Party, 2010</xref>: viii). One of the first acts of the Coalition Government was the launch of the ‘Big Society’ in May 2010. The short wide-ranging strategy document <italic>Building the Big Society</italic> encompassed volunteering, local democracy, revising planning laws, publication of government data, the abolition of regional spatial policy and giving public sector workers a right to bid to take over the services they deliver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269094212473938">Conservative Party, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The Big Society can be regarded as the aim of the Coalition: to create a society where people and communities have more power and responsibility, and use this power to create better services and outcomes. Localism can be regarded as its ethos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269094212473938">Shaw, 2012</xref>), as reflected in the <italic>Localism Act</italic> of 2012 marking the local as the preferred spatial scale for delivery and action, whether it be the supply of public services, or empowering communities to do things.</p>
<p>The Big Society is about, ‘fostering and supporting a new culture of voluntarism, philanthropy and social action’, a more socially active Britain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094212473938">Cameron, 2010</xref>). It is presented as the opposite to big government, a politics of devolution where central government cedes power, and responsibility, to citizens in neighbourhoods and communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094212473938">Cameron, 2010</xref>). This vision is founded in a belief that local communities have the embodied knowledge and expertise to plan and deliver local services better (for a fuller account see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269094212473938">Stott, 2011</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269094212473938">Mycock and Tonge (2011</xref>: 57) David Cameron espouses an associational view of civil society, and this empowerment narrative can be traced back to John Major’s ‘citizen’s charters’, and some of New Labour’s citizenship agenda (community cohesion, participation and engagement, volunteering and building social capital) is evident in the Big Society narrative. Like the Third Way, Big Society also affirms, ‘no rights without responsibilities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269094212473938">Mycock and Tonge, 2011</xref>: 57).</p>
<p>‘Vanguard communities’ were announced in 2010 in Cumbria, Windsor and Maidenhead, Liverpool and Sutton. They are not neighbourhoods or communities (of place/identity) but cover wider geographical areas. Cumbria, for example, covers 50 parishes, while the remaining three are local authority districts. Termed ‘the great training grounds of change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094212473938">Cameron, 2010</xref>), change is positioned as being led by local communities and people, not central government, and so it could be argued embraces a more diverse view of voluntarism than under New Labour. The four flagship communities were recipients of extra powers and support from central government to implement a range of initiatives. For example, Liverpool planned to build a volunteer programme to keep local museums open for longer, but after six months this vanguard community – with the highest levels of deprivation – withdrew because the Government’s cuts had seriously undermined the ability of community organisations to improve the quality of life of residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094212473938">Keaveny, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the Community Organisers Programme is one of the flagships of the Big Society. It is in fact a training programme, providing funds for 500 ‘Senior Community Organisers’ to receive payment, while training, in the form of a learning bursary. The 4500 ‘Mid-level Community Organisers’ will be unpaid volunteers. While the vision is of community organisers throughout the whole of England, the first community organisers are being trained in 11 ‘kickstarter’ communities to ‘help bring communities together and support neighbourhood groups to address common problems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269094212473938">Conservative Party, 2010</xref>: 6)</p>
<p>Overall, the Big Society’s focus appears deeply spatial, based on place-based localities and neighbourhoods (rather than communities of identity/interest), with an expectation that all communities (rich and poor) must pull together. But it has long been recognised there are spatial variations in the strength of civil society, including propensity to give and volunteer. In 1978, for example, the Wolfenden Report argued ‘some social and geographical contexts seem to provide a much more fertile soil for voluntary action than others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094212473938">Committee on Voluntary Organisations, 1978</xref>: 58, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269094212473938">Mohan et al., 2006</xref>: 269).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0269094212473938"><title>Localism and voluntary participation: Divergent visions?</title>
<p>In both jurisdictions there is a far stronger emphasis on the role of voluntary participation at the local level. Indeed, whilst there are some distinctions in rhetoric and governance evident, there also remains significant common ground, such as the continued reliance on the highly contested and value-laden narrative of ‘community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094212473938">Hancock et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, there appears a somewhat limited acknowledgement of the ways in which the nature of voluntarism, and capacities for this, may vary geographically and socially.</p>
<p>These findings chime to some extent with work which has sought to examine how far the voluntary sector itself has diverged across the UK jurisdictions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269094212473938">Birrell (2009</xref>: 75) for example finds that the voluntary sector is part of a<disp-quote>
<p>substantial policy area where the basic principles of policies have largely remained the same throughout the UK. With devolution, however, some lower-level differences have emerged during the implementation of these policies.

<sec id="sec6-0269094212473938"><title>Examining the ‘local’ as context for voluntarism in Scotland and England</title>
<p>We now draw on two studies to examine the ‘local’ as context for voluntarism, on the basis of data collected as part of two larger studies in Scotland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269094212473938">Smith et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0269094212473938">Woolvin, 2011</xref>) and England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094212473938">Hardill and Baines, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In Scotland, as in England, the emphasis has been on ‘formal’ volunteering. However, this has been problematised, with some calling for an appreciation of ‘informal volunteering’. This has been defined as ‘helping a friend or a neighbour in a self-managed way, e.g. helping them with some gardening or watching their home … ’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269094212473938">Volunteer Development Scotland (VDS), 2004</xref>: 1). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0269094212473938">Williams (2003b</xref>: 288–289) argues that by focusing on formal volunteering, government programmes are ‘derogatory’ of informal volunteering which, he suggests, is more characteristic of the voluntary activity taking place in more deprived areas. This is echoed in policy, with the Commission on the Future of Volunteering stating: ‘ … the culture of volunteering in this country tends to downgrade certain types of voluntary work, such as informal volunteering, and to exclude or undervalue what certain groups can contribute’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269094212473938">Neuberger, 2008</xref>: 25).</p>
<p>Therefore there have been moves to clarify our understanding of what might be understood as ‘volunteering’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094212473938">Ellis Paine et al., 2010</xref>: 8–16) and an increasing degree of attention given to ‘below the radar’ organisations, defined as ‘small voluntary organisations, community groups and more informal or semi-formal activities in the third sector’ which might not necessarily be recognised by policy makers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094212473938">McCabe, 2011</xref>: 1). However, little remains known about the nature and extent of informal volunteering, (what could be seen as a form of voluntarism which is ‘below the radar’) and its potential relationships with more formal voluntary activity, particularly in more deprived communities. It is these themes around which the research undertaken in three deprived urban Scottish communities focuses.</p>
<p>Whilst the Scottish case study foregrounds less formal participation in deprived communities (but captures other forms of voluntarism), our second study complements and moves beyond this by focusing on more formal voluntarism and the local institutions through which it takes place. In doing so we recognise that engaging in voluntarism may be a function of individual motivations, perceptions and capacities, but may also be strongly influenced by the nature of the voluntary and community sector in local communities of place. Of course, this may be particularly the case for more formal acts of voluntarism.</p>
<p>Our English case study is Brightville,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0269094212473938">2</xref></sup> in the East Midlands of England. It developed in the 19th century and had a diverse industrial base spanning coal mining and textiles. All four communities record high levels of deprivation. Brightville includes the most deprived ward in the county, and under New Labour received support via Neighbourhood Renewal and Sure Start (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094212473938">Hardill and Baines, 2011</xref>). Yet, from a series of visits prior to the start of the study, vibrant, active volunteer initiatives were evident, leading us to think of it as a place rich in the elusive quality of ‘community spirit’. Each of the three Scottish communities was selected with reference to the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269094212473938">Scottish Government, 2010</xref>). In order to engage with a range of contextual and compositional factors which may influence the nature of participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269094212473938">Mohan et al., 2006</xref>) additional factors were taken into account including the degree of ethnic diversity in each community, the social history of the area, the characteristics of the built environment, and the nature of the voluntary and community sector institutional landscape. The three communities selected were Ashburgh, Hinton and Linmount.</p>
<p>Beyond studies focusing on a particular context or lifecourse stage of engagement (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269094212473938">Teather, 1999</xref>) little is known of the shifting drivers for, barriers to and meanings of community involvement in lifecourse perspective, allowing these studies to make a unique contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094212473938">Hopkins and Pain, 2007</xref>: 290; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269094212473938">Wilson, 2000</xref>: 215). Therefore both studies employed lifecourse interviews to gather information on the diverse acts of voluntarism and paid work undertaken. In Scotland 38 residents of Ashburgh, Hinton and Linmount shared their life histories of community involvement, with the particular focus being on less formal acts of voluntarism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269094212473938">Smith et al., 2010</xref>). In England a total of 19 life history interviews were undertaken with volunteers drawn to give time to help Brightville residents, identified through stakeholders involved in four voluntary organisations active in Brightville. In both studies focus groups and key informant interviews were also undertaken.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0269094212473938"><title>‘Local’ participation: Helping, formal volunteering and the lifecourse</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0269094212473938">Williams (2003b</xref>: 289–290) has argued that, although levels of formal and informal voluntary activity are reported as higher amongst more affluent populations, informal volunteering may have a greater significance among residents in deprived communities where, of the total, proportionately more is informal compared to that in more affluent communities. Williams also calls for a move away from hierarchical understandings of any relationship between formal and informal acts of voluntarism. Synthesising these points and given the focus – as identified above – on examining diverse forms of participation throughout the lifecourse, and the potential journeys ‘between’ these forms of activity, a ‘spectrum’ heuristic was developed for use during interviews, focus groups and key informant interviews. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269094212473938">Figure 1</xref> illustrates how this allowed participants to discuss both ‘more’ and ‘less’ formal participation and how far they may (or may not) move between different spheres over time in a non-hierarchical way. The larger left hand sphere refers to informal volunteering, a greater rate of which is reported relative to formal volunteering. The most formal of activity – that which is regular and mediated – can be found in the sphere to the right which is smaller, reflecting the lower proportion of overall activity which is formal in nature. Finally the community action/social participation sphere depicts that activity which exhibits both formal and informal characteristics. To illustrate any potential journeys a number of arrows are included to (simply) illustrate the potential journeys between activities individuals may make over time.
<fig id="fig1-0269094212473938" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>A ‘spectrum’ of participation over time (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269094212473938">Smith et al., 2010</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0269094212473938-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Attentiveness to the lived experience of participation can aid understanding of how spectrums of activity might be ‘below the radar’. Whilst much work has focused on the value of helping (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0269094212473938">Woolvin, 2011</xref> for an explanation of this term’s use over mutual aid or self-provision) in ‘getting things done’, helping has broader implications than purely allowing tasks to be completed. Helen cites her sense of community as characterised by wider neighbour networks which came into being in times of need:<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve always found it quite a … good community place I mean any time that there’s any … er … if a family has … troubles, accidents anything like that, people in Ashburgh are very good at getting together and looking after their own if you like … er … thinking about a family that had a fire down the road you know and folk very quickly came together to … er … support them and help with replacing goods for them and things like that – raising money. (Helen, Ashburgh)</p></disp-quote>Here, ‘raising money’ occurred outwith an organisation, suggesting the diversity of involvement which may take place within one apparently ‘formal’ activity. Rachel demonstrates how she began to fundraise in support of a young girl suffering from cancer without an organisation or group of individuals being required:<disp-quote>
<p>I started fund raising for a wee girl that had cancer and I brought in monies for her, and she died, and I don’t know if … I felt sad when I lost my parents and I lost my friends, but just to see this wee one actually die after fundraising for her, I just thought you know this is what I’ve got to do, this is what I’ve got to do is help others. (Rachel, Ashburgh)</p></disp-quote>Therefore the motivations for such helping can have close links to lifecourse events and be a profoundly ‘emotional experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094212473938">Roberts and Divine, 2004)</xref>, as well as have marked consequences for the subsequent nature of involvement over time. Margaret shows how the catalyst for similar involvement can be the below the radar space of a community centre:<disp-quote>
<p>… I run a wee bingo in here on a Tuesday and Sunday night, and somebody had mentioned that so-and-so who was well known in the community – I can’t remember the girl’s name because it was quite a while back – and er she needed a chair and er it was just suggested amongst one or two of them here that let’s do some fundraising for it. (Margaret, Hinton)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The diversity of ‘on’ and ‘below’ the radar activity taking place beneath the apparently formal categorisation of ‘fundraising’ is graphically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269094212473938">Figure 2</xref>.
<fig id="fig2-0269094212473938" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Diversities of ‘on-’ and ‘below-’ the radar participation – the example of fundraising.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0269094212473938-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Appreciating the ‘different kinds of doings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094212473938">Jupp, 2008</xref>) within one realm of activity situates participation within communities, broader motivations and lifecourse contexts of those involved. This challenges findings that rates of ‘formal volunteering’ appear lower amongst more deprived populations to explore rather how the <italic>formality</italic> of voluntarism may be distinct. Similar activities may be undertaken to more affluent populations; however, the degree to which this activity is mediated may differ. These ‘invisible feelings and practices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094212473938">Jupp, 2008</xref>) may go unrecognised not just by policy makers but by individuals themselves. David (Linmount) reflects that community activity:<disp-quote>
<p>is unseen, and … and … I don’t think they can … there’s no … I mean, there’s no real specific media that … that … that shares information in the community.</p></disp-quote>An understanding of informal voluntarism appears particularly fundamental given it appears prioritised over more formal participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269094212473938">Musick and Wilson, 2008</xref>: 159–160)</p>
<p>A ‘fourth sector’ approach which ‘harnesses’ cultures of less formal participation has been proposed, through Time Banking and Local Exchange and Trading Schemes (LETS) for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0269094212473938">Williams, 2003b</xref>). An alternative approach to rendering the helping which occurs below the radar visible is a ‘portrait of gifts’ process whereby members of communities are encouraged to bring to light their assets and capabilities and focus ‘attention on the range of unpaid and non-market economic practices, like gifting and voluntary work’ which might be undertaken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269094212473938">Gibson-Graham, 2006</xref>: 145–148). Care must be taken, however, not to formalise pre-existing cultures of participation.</p>
<p>Therefore discourses of localism must take the ‘below the radar’ participation at the community level into account. Care must be taken to be attentive to ‘what else matters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269094212473938">Horton and Kraftl, 2009</xref>) beyond and within the most formal of participation to ensure that expectations of further involvement are realistic (in terms of the amount of additional participation expected), and appropriate (in terms of the formality of that experience), to avoid erecting barriers to particular populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269094212473938">Institute for Volunteering Research (IVR), 2004</xref>). Indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269094212473938">Milbourne (2009)</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094212473938">Alcock (2012</xref>: 230) argues, there may be tensions between the professionalisation of third sector organisations to bid for and deliver contracts, and informal community-based approaches to volunteer involvement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0269094212473938"><title>The changing local spaces of voluntarism</title>
<p>We now move on to examine the importance of local level context for more formal voluntarism, and the role of volunteer involving organisations within this, drawing on research undertaken in England. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269094212473938">Table 1</xref> summarises the key characteristics of each of the four volunteer involving organisations in question. All attract volunteers from within the boundaries of Brightville, as well as from neighbouring communities, such as Irontown, although the government project has a remit to work within defined geographical boundaries and directs enquiries from beyond them to other organisations. Two of the organisations (Community Project and Community Centre) were established by Brightville residents as a response to a local need, which at the time was ‘unmet’. One, the Community Project was first set up as an informal community group by a group of Brightville women serving lunches to elderly residents. It eventually became a formal voluntary organisation.

<p>The length of volunteering experience varied from one who was just completing the training course to others who had been volunteering for over a decade. Individuals’ average weekly time commitment to volunteering ranged from two hours to around 15. Some individuals volunteered for other organisations. Just seven of the 19 volunteers were in waged work. Of the other 12, only two expected to engage in the labour market in the future (one of whom was in training and the other on Job Seekers Allowance). Others were retired (4), in receipt of incapacity benefit (3), one was a full-time carer for a severely disabled son and two were partnered mothers who expressed no interest in paid work.</p>
<p>While Brightville residents are drawn to volunteer in Brightville, they tend to see the community as, ‘insular … closed (Sally, volunteer), yet volunteers are attracted from further afield. Non-Brightville residents tend to stress their own relative good fortune and typically entered volunteering in response to an appeal or advertisement. Brightville is where ‘a lot of people have got problems’ (Jane, paid worker at Community Project), but it is a community where, ‘I knew all my neighbours … very neighbourly place to live (former resident, chief executive of economic development partnership).</p>
<p>For some their formal volunteering formed part of a complex mix of unpaid roles they performed. Martin who cannot take up paid work because of mental health problems has a history of voluntary work, helping elderly Brightville residents who are housebound, with whom he has great empathy. Every week, he shops for them and helps them informally too outside the formal befriending voluntarism he undertakes. Just as the boundary between formal and informal voluntarism can be blurred so can the boundary between paid work and volunteering. Three Community Project employees – Emily, Chas and Jean, all of whom live in Brightville – volunteer, formally and informally, to help those they have met through work. Chas and Jean ‘befriend’ and Chas and Emily exercise the dog of a client who is ill. He also undertakes informal befriending, which he sees as being a good neighbour, ‘I used to go and visit elderly people … not officially. I just go and see if they are all right and if they need anything’.</p>
<p>There was movement between – and a blurring of – paid and unpaid work by one of the volunteers (Sandra) and the paid worker Jean. Jean is a Team Support Worker at the Community Project and one of her main duties is running the luncheon club twice a week, which she loves doing. Some evenings she prepares food, especially desserts, at home. At some points in the year, such as Christmas, organising and executing the meal becomes a volunteer task. She explained that this Christmas voluntary task began at 8 a.m. on Christmas Day. Her paid job and voluntarism, therefore, blur. Jean’s unpaid volunteer efforts are ‘rewarded’ – like the other volunteers – by a volunteer certificate at the annual Community Project awards ceremony. When Jean is on holiday or off sick, Sandra takes over her roles of cooking and organising for which she receives remuneration.</p>
<p>Since 2010, the capacity of these local organisations to mobilise the community has been constrained as funding from public service contracts reduced (Family Charity, Government Project, Community Project). There have also encountered competition from the private sector for some contracts. The Community Project, for example, lost the handy van scheme to a (national) private sector competitor. The major funder of the Family Charity offered a one year rather than a three year contract, and this was for a reduced amount (−10%).The contract to support the Government Project has been cut so much that staff are now working a three-day week, and there have been some redundancies. The reduced budgets have affected the amount of training (and childcare) they can offer their volunteers. The scale of change and uncertainty at the Government Project has left staff feeling discouraged and depressed. In May 2011, the Community Centre was forced to close when the funding application to maintain it was unsuccessful. Despite funding issues, the chief executives of both the Family Charity and the Community Project remain positive, in part because of the continued enthusiasm of their volunteers. They have also seen enquiries about volunteering opportunities increase.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0269094212473938" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In both Scotland and England there is an increasing emphasis on engaging with local level voluntarism in pursuit of diverse goals including public service reform, civic renewal and community empowerment. Their governance articulations are somewhat distinct, but the onus upon the ‘community’ is shared. What appears lost here is the individual motivation for, and benefits of undertaking acts of voluntarism. This would appear dangerous if subsequent expectations for higher levels of participation are to be met.</p>
<p>Equally, it is important to recognise that the socio-spatial context in which voluntarism is undertaken is multi-layered. Some acts are undertaken through an organisation, others may be part of one-to-one acts of helping, or through semi-formal or informal neighbourhood/community groups on which less policy (and research) attention is focused. The language used to describe these acts may not be readily analogous to ‘volunteering’ but be seen as ‘helping’, and the acts themselves may not be visible through conventional means of measurement: that is not to suggest that they should be formalised, but that they should be acknowledged in assessments of the participation landscape within a community. Indeed, the participatory landscape may be much more vibrant when such an assessment is undertaken. The nature of voluntary participation, as well as capacities for further participation, varies between communities.</p>
<p>Findings in England suggest that the VCS is an important vehicle through which the statutory sector might engage with communities amongst whom there is a limited tradition of engagement: it is an important part of local democracy, confidence and trust in organisations. However, we have also seen that the tensions (and overlaps) between localism and budgetary constraints may be influencing the nature and extent of volunteering in both positive and more challenging ways, and that there are disjunctures between the boundaries of administratively based and lived communities.</p>
<p>In this special issue, themes of localism and the resilience of place-based communities have been examined. We suggest that whilst localism agendas may draw on – and potentially seek to enhance – the resilience of communities to challenging times, they may also pose risks for their continued resilience which must also be considered.</p>
