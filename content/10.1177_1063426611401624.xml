<abstract>
<p>Prevalence of children with emotional or behavioral disorders (EBD) is a critical component in the discussion of underidentification of children served in special education. This discussion has previously focused almost exclusively on point prevalence or the number of children with EBD presumably needing services at any single point in time. Cumulative prevalence, on the other hand, is the number of children who have had EBD at some point in their lives before high school graduation. In the authors’ review of both types of prevalence, they found that estimates of the latter far exceed those of the former, significantly highlighting the service gap that exists between prevalence estimates and special education identification. Even when point prevalence is limited just to children with moderate or severe disorder, special education identification in the emotional disturbance category appears restricted to less than the bottom tenth of all children in need. Implications for special education are discussed, including issues around underidentification, misidentification, underservice, and related issues concerning children with EBD.</p>

<body>
<p>The question of prevalence or how many school-age children have an emotional or behavioral disorder (EBD) is a critical problem in the provision of services to this population of children, particularly in special education. This problem centers on the question of how many children should be served. Kauffman and his colleagues consider that question one of the primary problems in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1063426611401624">Kauffman &amp; Landrum, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1063426611401624">Kauffman, Mock, &amp; Simpson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1063426611401624">Kauffman, Simpson, &amp; Mock, 2009</xref>). They note that special education serves less than 1% of the school population in the category of emotional disturbance (ED), the primary category designated for children with EBD, and contend that this is only a very small fraction of those who need services. This disparity between prevalence and actual service has significant implications for a number of special education issues that we discuss in the final section of this article.</p>
<p>We are using the term <italic>emotional or behavioral disorders</italic> as all emotional, behavioral, or psychiatric disorders listed in the psychiatric diagnostic manual that can affect children or adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063426611401624">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). We exclude, however, all developmental disorders, such as language or learning disorders and mental retardation, that are listed in the manual since these are not strictly considered mental health disorders. The disorders that therefore would be included are primarily oppositional defiant or conduct disorders; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); depression, mood, or anxiety disorders; and schizophrenic and psychotic disorders.</p>
<p>These EBDs, of course, do not automatically qualify children for the ED category of special education. The ED category, as defined in federal education regulations, stipulates that, for children to qualify for special education services, their EBDs must adversely affect educational performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1063426611401624">Forness &amp; Knitzer, 1992</xref>). Since the term <italic>educational performance</italic> is not further defined in regulations, a narrow interpretation could be construed to limit eligibility only to those children whose disorders result in poor academic achievement, but there is some consensus that eligibility should also include children whose disorders significantly affect other important areas of school functioning such as poor relationships with teachers or classmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1063426611401624">Kavale, Forness, &amp; Mostert, 2005</xref>). In either case, the educational performance criterion clearly seems intended to limit eligibility for the ED category only to those children with EBD who require special education services because their disorder adversely affects their functioning in school settings, however defined. The difficulty is that most EBDs, particularly at the moderate or severe level, have at least the potential to significantly affect academic or social functioning in school settings.</p>
<p>Comparing the percentage of the population served in special education to the prevalence of EBD in the general population is therefore critical to such issues as the nature of the service gap between potential need and actual service and the lack of primary and secondary prevention prior to special education identification. Such comparison, moreover, depends on reliable prevalence data. Regarding the gap between service or treatment and prevalence of disorder, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1063426611401624">Costello, Egger, and Angold (2005)</xref> concluded,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Substantively, we can say with certainty that only a small proportion of children with clear evidence of functionally impairing psychiatric disorder receive treatment. Once upon a time, when effective treatments for child and adolescent psychiatric disorders were rare, this was regrettable but not a major public health issue. Now it is. The tragedy is compounded by powerful evidence that most psychiatric disorders have their origins early in life: risk even for adult-onset disorders is often increased by childhood adversities, and disorders manifesting themselves in the early years often recur in adulthood. So the public health directive to intervene early is clear . . . but the reality is different. (p. 982)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Our purpose here is to provide a brief summary of recent representative prevalence data for children and adolescents with EBD including both point and cumulative prevalence and also to draw implications of these data for identification of children with EBD in special education. Our objectives therefore are to (a) update briefly the point prevalence data on children and adolescents with EBD with particular reference to those who have at least moderate levels of impairment, (b) present a summary of the more limited data on cumulative or lifetime prevalence of children or adolescents in the school years, (c) comment briefly on some of the complexities underlying these prevalence findings, and (d) discuss some implications of both types of prevalence data for issues in special education identification and service. Although there are a number of reviews on epidemiology of child and adolescent EBD, there are none that combine a review of <italic>both</italic> point and cumulative prevalences to focus specifically on the implications of these data for special education. We begin with a description of our literature search methods.</p>
<sec id="section1-1063426611401624">
<title>Literature Search Methods</title>
<p>A definitive meta-analysis of 52 child and adolescent prevalence studies of EBD from the 1950s to the mid-1990s was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1063426611401624">Roberts, Attkisson, and Rosenblatt (1998)</xref>. We augmented this study with a search of studies for the period of 1995 to 2010. We used the following search terms: <italic>behavior, emotional</italic>, and <italic>psychiatric</italic> and limited these searches to <italic>prevalence</italic> or <italic>epidemiology</italic> and to <italic>child</italic> or <italic>adolescence</italic>. We also limited searches to English-language publications during the 1995–2010 period. PsychLit produced 288 entries, ERIC 48, and PubMed 480 (given the search engine PubMed was more broadly defined to include all journal articles except letters, editorials, and practice guidelines).</p>
<p>We selected studies from each search that met the following additional criteria: (a) original research studies on prevalence or epidemiology, eliminating all commentaries or reviews, and (b) studies that dealt only with emotional, behavioral, psychiatric, or related mental health disorders. Studies were eliminated if they dealt with high-risk health behaviors (e.g., binge drinking), special samples (e.g., asthma, substance abuse), or specialty settings (e.g., children in hospitals). A few studies (<italic>n</italic> = 8) were also eliminated if they were (a) longitudinal extensions of point prevalence studies included in the Roberts et al. original meta-analyses, (b) longitudinal extensions of other point prevalence studies published since 1995, or (c) originally conducted as cumulative prevalence studies. These 8 studies, although eliminated from review for point prevalence estimates, served as the database for the cumulative prevalence analysis.</p>
<p>This strategy resulted in a total of 51 studies, close to the number found by Roberts and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1063426611401624">1998</xref>) prior to 1995. An additional 4 articles were added after a visual search of the literature. Thus, a total of 55 original point prevalence studies published since 1995, plus the summary data from the 52 studies included in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1063426611401624">Roberts et al. (1998)</xref> meta-analysis, served as the database for point prevalence. Since the focus of this article is more on <italic>implications</italic> of prevalence data, we have chosen for brevity to limit discussion of more recent data primarily to more well-designed studies of point prevalence that we delimit further below. As noted above, 8 studies composed the database for discussion of cumulative prevalence presented later in this article.</p>

<sec id="section2-1063426611401624">
<title>Point Prevalence</title>
<p>Point prevalence refers to the number or percentage of children meeting criteria for a disorder at a particular point in time, whereas cumulative prevalence refers to children who meet criteria for a disorder at any time in their lives during their school years. The latter has also been referred to as “period” or “lifetime” prevalence and has not heretofore been greatly emphasized in discussions of prevalence, particularly in regard to special education services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1063426611401624">Kauffman &amp; Landrum, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1063426611401624">Walker, Ramsey, &amp; Gresham, 2004</xref>). Since there have been decades of studies on point prevalence of children with EBDs, we first present information from a summary review of studies conducted before 1995 and then summarize more recent studies (1995–2010).</p>
<sec id="section3-1063426611401624">
<title>Studies Prior to 1995</title>
<p>Some of the most reliable and informative data on point prevalence prior to 1995 come from the meta-analytic study of children and adolescents with EBD by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1063426611401624">Roberts et al. (1998)</xref>. They analyzed 52 studies conducted over nearly 40 years, ending in the mid-1990s. Their data were particularly useful because prevalence rates could be compared over each decade to determine whether prevalence is increasing over the years, whether rates are higher with increasing ages of children, and how methodological issues affect prevalence rates. Overall, point prevalence across the 52 studies averaged 15.8%, but with increases across the age span. Preschoolers had a mean of 10.2%, whereas children (ages 6–12) had a mean of 13.2% and adolescents a mean of 16.5%. When 14 studies that were composed of children from across the age span were analyzed separately, the mean prevalence was 21.9%. It should be noted that the mean prevalence is highest in those studies that sample across all age spans since totals include those who currently have a disorder in adolescence (16.5%) and also a portion of children who once had a disorder but no longer met diagnostic criteria by adolescence.</p>
<p>Point prevalence rates were relatively consistent across the decades (approximately 14% to 16%), with the exception of studies carried out after 1990, in which the mean was 26%. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1063426611401624">Roberts et al. (1998)</xref> note, however, that three studies in the 1990s had methodological issues, such as lack of significant impairment criteria, less well-defined symptoms, or multiple informants, therefore grossly inflating prevalence estimates and when these were accounted for, point prevalence tended to be relatively consistent with rates found in earlier decades. A large recent longitudinal study from Finland also did not show an increase over the past two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1063426611401624">Sourander, Niemela, Santalahti, Helenius, &amp; Piha, 2008</xref>). This consistency across several decades is remarkable, especially considering periodic revisions of mental health diagnostic criteria and introduction of new diagnostic interview or rating scales over this period.</p>
<p>There were also methodological issues involving whether some measure of functional impairment was required along with emotional or behavioral symptoms to define “caseness” (i.e., the decision to include the child as meeting criteria for an EBD). In some cases, requiring a measure of impairment dropped the point prevalence rate substantially, but there was very little agreement on the best measure of impairment; and Roberts et al. (1995) estimate that using a measure of impairment led to reductions of about a third to nearly a half in overall point prevalence. For a more detailed analysis of how the actual definition of caseness can affect point prevalence, particularly in relation to young children and special education eligibility, the reader is referred to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1063426611401624">Cluett et al. (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063426611401624">Feil et al. (2005)</xref>.</p>
<p>Although across-age point prevalence in the Roberts et al. study averaged more than 20%, it is unreasonable to expect that all children with EBD in these studies would be potential candidates for special education in the ED category, as defined above. It seems more reasonable and germane to our discussion here to limit point prevalence to those children whose level of functional impairment would make them at least plausible candidates for the ED category. Although it is somewhat arbitrary and different scholars might disagree, we therefore chose to limit our “working” estimate of point prevalence to those children who have at least a <italic>moderate</italic> level of functional impairment. Moderate impairment is generally characterized by a level of functioning in which the child in question has few if any friends, experiences ongoing conflict with peers or adults, is performing below expectations academically, and the like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063426611401624">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1063426611401624">Winters, Collett, &amp; Myers, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1063426611401624">Roberts et al. (1998)</xref> suggest, this level of impairment as applied to the total across-age point prevalence would result in around 12% of children or adolescents with moderate or severe impairment. This also accords with a similar figure by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1063426611401624">Costello et al. (2005)</xref>, who also report a median prevalence of 12% for child and adolescent studies on EBD that used a federal social security definition requiring both a mental disorder and significant impairment in one or more life domains. More recent studies generally confirm this point prevalence estimate, as we note below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1063426611401624">
<title>Studies 1995–2010</title>
<p>To provide a brief illustration of the most representative point prevalence studies published since the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1063426611401624">Roberts et al. (1998)</xref> meta-analysis, we have selected nine such studies published from 1995 to 2010. These include studies that address important limitations of previous epidemiologic research concerning sample representativeness, impairment issues, and the like as suggested by Roberts and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1063426611401624">1998</xref>) and by authors of more recent reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1063426611401624">Costello et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1063426611401624">Costello, Foley, &amp; Angold, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>These 9 studies therefore represent all those studies from our point prevalence search described above (55 studies) that met the following additional criteria: (a) to ensure sufficient representation, the study sample had to include a minimum of 1,000 children and youth from which to screen for EBDs; (b) the sample had to include both boys and girls since some prevalence differences have been found between the genders; (c) the sample had to include both children and adolescents since younger children have been found to have fewer such disorders; (d) the sample had to include a child or adolescent age range of more than 4 years so as to represent a relatively broad spectrum of ages; (e) the sample had to include both externalizing and internalizing disorders so that it was at least somewhat representative of the spectrum of EBDs; and (f) the sample had to include participants who were English speaking and/or from the United States and its territories to generalize sufficiently for our purposes in this article. These limiting criteria excluded such well-known and/or well-regarded studies as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1063426611401624">Bird et al. (2006)</xref>, who sampled 2,491 children and adolescents in Puerto Rico but focused only on disruptive behavior disorders, and the recent well-designed nationally representative study of 1,329 children and adolescents by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1063426611401624">Carter et al. (2010)</xref> that to date has reported on only a subsample enriched for psychopathology.</p>
<p>The sample sizes for the nine studies meeting the six additional criteria range from 1,285 to 373,055, with the majority of studies conducted in the United States. The majority of the samples were European Americans (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1063426611401624">Table 1</xref>). The point prevalence estimates range from 3.7% to 21.1% across studies when using a conservative estimate of point prevalence using a criterion of at least moderate impairment. Four studies reported a higher prevalence rate when this criterion was not used, and this is noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1063426611401624">Table 1</xref> along with any salient findings regarding race or ethnicity and socioeconomic status.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best example of these recent prevalence studies is the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1063426611401624">Merikangas, He, Brody, et al., 2010</xref>). It is, surprisingly, the first nationally representative probability sample ever completed in the United States and included 3,042 children, ages 8 to 15 years. It involved a structured diagnostic interview of not only symptoms for major psychiatric disorders but also impairment for six domains of functioning including interactions with peers and teachers as well as academic performance. Point prevalence, as measured by meeting symptoms for <italic>any</italic> major psychiatric disorder, was 13.1% but dropped to 11.3% when a moderate or severe level of functional impairment was required on at least <italic>two</italic> or more domains. The most problematic study was the U.S. survey that reported a point prevalence of 3.7% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1063426611401624">Bethell, Reed, &amp; Blumberg, 2005</xref>). This study was a brief phone interview involving ascertainment for only children with chronic EBD whose parents reported them as needing or already receiving treatment such as special therapies or prescription medication for an emotional, behavioral, or developmental problem, a rather strict delimitation. The remaining studies all involved more detailed in-person structured diagnostic interviews, using primarily parents as informants.</p>
<p>The mean point prevalence rate from the nine studies, adjusted for moderate to severe impairment, was 12.7%, consistent with our conservative adjusted estimate of 12% derived above from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1063426611401624">Roberts et al. (1998)</xref> meta-analysis. Although it is clear that there is a wide range of point prevalence estimates based on age, impairment, and other variables discussed above, it is important to note that selection of a particular point prevalence figure also depends on policy issues. Our 12% estimate is, as we have shown, relatively conservative because it is based primarily on moderate to severe levels of impairment or those children most likely to qualify for special education. Policy makers wishing to bring mental health care to public attention and/or to attract funding for mental health services, on the other hand, have generally favored a 20% point prevalence figure that might be said to contain at least a certain proportion of mild cases not requiring immediate special education or other mental health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1063426611401624">Hunter et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1063426611401624">U.S. Public Health Service, 2000</xref>). It should be pointed out, however, that the concept of developmental psychopathology would nonetheless suggest that even mild symptoms place a child at high risk for subsequently developing a severe disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1063426611401624">Forness, Kavale, MacMillan, Asarnow, &amp; Duncan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1063426611401624">Pennington, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1063426611401624">Wang, Bergland, et al., 2005</xref>). This brings us to the importance of cumulative prevalence.</p>

<title>Cumulative Prevalence</title>
<p>Up to this point we have been discussing primarily point prevalence of children and youth with EBDs, which we earlier defined as the number or percentage of affected individuals at a circumscribed point in time. Another type of prevalence of interest to our discussion is cumulative prevalence or, as we noted before, the number or percentage of individuals who met criteria for an EBD at <italic>any</italic> time over the course of their lives or, in this case, prior to high school graduation. For example, it is not uncommon in epidemiologic studies for a child who met criteria for an EBD at Time 1 in a longitudinal study to no longer meet criteria a few years later or at Time 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1063426611401624">Costello et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1063426611401624">Costello et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1063426611401624">Costello, Mustillo, Erkanli, Keeler, &amp; Angold, 2003</xref>). Conversely, a child who did not meet diagnostic criteria at Time 1 may do so at Time 2.</p>
<p>Depression is a good example. The onset of depression begins to occur much more frequently in adolescence; and, as children, such individuals may have had few if any symptoms and thus would not have been counted as a “case” in a point prevalence study conducted during this time period. On the other hand, an individual can meet criteria for a major depressive disorder through presence of a single episode of severe depression if it occurs during the period covered when the prevalence study is being conducted. Such an episode places the individual at heightened risk for subsequent episodes and perhaps chronic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063426611401624">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). Factors in the environment or genetic predisposition of some individuals, however, may result in no subsequent depressive episodes, and such an individual may no longer suffer from significant depressive symptoms or functional impairment in the following years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1063426611401624">Pennington, 2002</xref>). He or she at that point would also no longer be counted as a case, at least in a point prevalence study.</p>
<p>Likewise, in a review of recent carefully controlled studies of intensive psychiatric treatment for ADHD, depression, or anxiety disorders, anywhere from half to nearly three quarters of affected children or adolescents responded to such treatment and thus no longer currently met diagnostic criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1063426611401624">Forness, Freeman, &amp; Paparella, 2006</xref>). A treatment follow-up of children with ADHD, for example, recently demonstrated marked improvement for behavioral symptoms over baseline symptoms as a result of initial treatment; but, 8 years later, these children still had significantly more functional impairment than their nondisabled high school classmates who had never had ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1063426611401624">Molina et al., 2009</xref>). Although they remained at risk, most would no longer have met criteria for ADHD and would not have counted as a case at that point. Unexpected changes in an individual family environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1063426611401624">Szatmari, 2009</xref>) or even documented increases in a local economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1063426611401624">Costello, Erikanli, Copeland, &amp; Angold, 2010</xref>) can also lower risk for EBD. It is thus likely that in any of the above instances (late onset, spontaneous recovery, response to treatment, or environmental circumstance), many of these children or adolescents might have had subclinical or mild symptoms and would probably not have qualified for caseness in a point prevalence study conducted during that time, but they probably would have qualified in a cumulative prevalence study.</p>
<p>Of what interest is cumulative prevalence to the issue of school identification of children with EBDs? As we demonstrate below, about 80% of cumulative lifetime prevalence occurs before high school graduation. To support this point, we present in some detail findings of the most recent national study of mental health disorders in adults and findings from representative studies on cumulative prevalence in children and adolescents.</p>
<sec id="section6-1063426611401624">
<title>Adult Cumulative Prevalence</title>
<p>The National Comorbidity Survey Replication has been described as the largest, most sound, and most comprehensive study of both point prevalence and cumulative prevalence of mental health disorders in adults in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1063426611401624">Kuehn, 2005</xref>). Four articles detailing the findings were published in June 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1063426611401624">Kessler, Bergland, Demler, Jin, &amp; Walters, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1063426611401624">Kessler, Chiu, Demler, &amp; Walters, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1063426611401624">Wang, Berglund, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1063426611401624">Wang, Lane, et al., 2005</xref>). In this study, 9,282 adults, aged 18 and older, were interviewed face to face with a structured diagnostic interview that generated specific diagnoses from the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1063426611401624">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>) and their age of first onset. Diagnoses included ADHD or related disruptive behavior disorders, depression or related mood disorders, and anxiety disorders. Overall, 5,692 adults were available for a second interview on risk factors, consequences of the disorder, and treatment issues.</p>
<p>Among the salient findings were that point prevalence was 26.2% and cumulative lifetime prevalence was 46.4% for all disorders (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1063426611401624">Table 2</xref>). Among specific disorders, cumulative prevalence was also nearly twice that of point prevalence. The sum of individual disorders was greater than the average sum for all disorders because a number of disorders overlapped or were comorbid with one another in the same individual. Comorbidity occurred in slightly fewer than half of all individuals. Moreover, 22.3% of all cases were classified as serious, 37.3% as moderate, and 40.4% as mild, based on levels of functional impairment. For example, individuals with a serious disorder reported missing a mean of 88.3 days of work, school, or other commensurate activities in the past 12 months as a direct result of their disorder. Moderate levels resulted in 4.7 days lost, and mild levels resulted in 1.9 days lost.</p>

<p>An important consideration for our discussion is the age of onset of these disorders. Respondents who received a diagnosis were asked the exact age they first had the disorder. If they could not remember exactly, they were probed for a boundary of uncertainty. For example, they were asked if onset was “before you first started school” or “before you became a teenager.” These answers would then be coded as age 6 or 12, respectively, thus providing a relatively conservative estimate of age of onset. Median age of onset across all disorders was approximately 14 years of age. Although onset for depression or mood disorders was 30 years, almost a quarter of participants with depression or mood disorders had an age of onset before 18 years. Another significant finding involved the length of time that elapsed before contact with a treatment provider. Median treatment delay across all disorders was approximately 10 years from onset of the disorder to treatment contact with variations for specific disorders. Of those reporting current disorders, only about 41% had received treatment services in the prior 12-month period. Fewer than 33% of the cases being treated were receiving interventions that met at least minimally adequate clinical practice standards, based on accepted mental health practice parameters that included psychopharmacologic treatment and/or visits to a licensed mental health professional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1063426611401624">Wang, Bergland, et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1063426611401624">Wang, Lane, et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, only about 13% or 14% of those with a current disorder were getting adequate help.</p>
<p>To summarize findings from this study, about one quarter of adult individuals from a demographically representative sample had a current EBD; but nearly half had experienced such a disorder at some point in their lives. Most study participants (3 of 5) with a current disorder had severe or moderate levels of impairment, resulting in approximately a week to 3 months of missed work, school, or the like. Most had an onset before high school, and only about 1 in 7 with a current disorder had received even minimally adequate treatment as defined above. Note that although this was a cross-sectional study, a recent 24-year longitudinal study from the Netherlands suggests that childhood onset EBD often persists well into middle adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1063426611401624">Reef, van Meurs, Verhulst, &amp; van der Ende, 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section7-1063426611401624">
<title>Child Cumulative Prevalence</title>
<p>Contrasting cumulative prevalence in this study with what we know about cumulative prevalence of school-age children is instructive in regard to the overall burden of EBDs during the school years. Compared to the literature on point prevalence, there have been very few cumulative prevalence studies of EBDs in the child and adolescent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1063426611401624">Costello et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1063426611401624">Costello et al., 2006</xref>), but four of the eight studies we identified from our search on cumulative prevalence are particularly representative (and informative). Three of these are among the most frequently cited in our mental health literature, particularly since all took place in the United States or other English-speaking countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1063426611401624">Jaffee, Harrington, Cohen, &amp; Moffitt, 2005</xref>). The fourth has only recently been published but contains the largest sample to date.</p>
<p>In the first of these four studies, Cohen and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1063426611401624">1993</xref>) sampled 447 children from upstate New York who were assessed for an EBD in late elementary school and again in their middle to high school years. Approximately 39% of the students had been diagnosed by age 16. Some 10 years later, Costello and colleagues (2003) reported on a sample of 1,420 children in North Carolina also first assessed in late elementary school and annually thereafter. Approximately 37% had been diagnosed by age 16, and this research has now continued into the adult years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1063426611401624">Crawford et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, both the Cohen and Costello studies used similar structured diagnostic interviews, augmented by parent and/or teacher reports. A third study in New Zealand using similar methodology on a sample of 1,037 children found a cumulative prevalence of 38% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1063426611401624">Kim-Cohen et al., 2003</xref>). The fourth study of a nationally representative U.S. sample of 10,123 adolescents began in adolescence and segmented adolescents into 13- to 14-, 15- to 16-, and 17- to 18-year-old cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1063426611401624">Merikangas, He, Burstein, et al., 2010</xref>). They found a cumulative prevalence of EBD across the teenage years of 38%. To be consistent across studies, we excluded primary diagnoses of substance abuse disorders from this last study’s prevalence estimate, which were not included in the other three studies. That all these studies nonetheless found such consistent rates of cumulative prevalence of EBDs in four very different samples at somewhat different historical points is striking and supports the “contention that retrospective and single-wave, cross-sectional studies underestimate the burden of these disorders over time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1063426611401624">Jaffee et al., 2005</xref>, p. 407).</p>
<p>Likewise, for our purposes, the range of cumulative prevalence of EBDs of 37% to 39% in these four representative studies is approximately 80% of the total lifetime prevalence of about 46% reported in adults in the national comorbidity study discussed above. That 4 of 5 adults who do have an EBD at some point in their lives presumably may have an onset of their disorder prior to high school graduation not only augments the impact of EBDs during the school years, above and beyond that already ascribed to childhood point prevalence, but also especially accentuates the dismally low identification rate of the 1% of youth with EBD who actually manage to receive special education in the ED category. It also highlights the lost opportunity for both primary and secondary prevention.</p>

<sec id="section8-1063426611401624">
<title>Commentary on Prevalence</title>
<p>We recognize that not all problem behavior meets the criteria for EBD and that the criteria for identification of a child’s actually having EBD are judgmental. That is, EBD always entails a behavior problem, but not every behavior problem indicates that a student should be identified as having EBD. Furthermore, there is no test or other criterion for EBD that is not open to challenge, simply because both measurement and clinical judgment are required. Data derived from observations, questionnaires, interviews, or other measurement devices must be interpreted, and judgment of the meaning of the data is therefore necessary. Consequently, we examined the literature on point prevalence in particular with attention to the criteria used for identification. We also recognize that problem behavior is sensitive to context and is episodic, varying with place and time. Thus, an individual may exhibit a problem or disorder in one place but not in another or at one time but not at another. We therefore made note of the contexts and chronology of the criteria used in various studies. Our best estimate of point prevalence, therefore, was 12% of school-age children or youth have an EBD with at least moderate impairment. Our discussion of cumulative prevalence suggests that at least a third of all school children or youth will probably have had an EBD at some point prior to graduation.</p>
<p>Development of both reliable and valid measures to assess EBDs in children and adolescents has improved rather dramatically in the past few years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1063426611401624">Collett, Ohan, &amp; Myers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1063426611401624">Myers &amp; Winters, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1063426611401624">Nemeroff et al., 2008</xref>), as has development of scales to assess the functional impairment resulting from these disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1063426611401624">Merikangas, Avenevoli, Costello, Koretz, &amp; Kessler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1063426611401624">Winters et al., 2005</xref>). Epidemiologic studies on prevalence of EBD in childhood have benefited as a result. It should also be noted that both individual rating scales and impairment measures commonly used in school-based studies have been subject to rigorous scrutiny in ongoing studies and have been shown to be relatively free of racial or ethnic bias, at least in the early grades when evaluation for special education eligibility occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1063426611401624">Cluett et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1063426611401624">Feil et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1063426611401624">Serna, Nielsen, Mattern, Schau, &amp; Forness, 2002</xref>). What little bias does occur tends to diminish when teacher ratings are supplemented with parent ratings and/or measures of functional impairment.</p>
<p>It is important here to note that almost all of the above studies noted gender differences, but these were generally limited to specific diagnoses. For example, the NHANES study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1063426611401624">Merikangas, He, Brody, et al., 2010</xref>), noted significantly more boys with ADHD but significantly more girls with depression or other mood disorders. Surprisingly few studies noted any racial or ethnic differences, including even the one recent study specifically focused on this issue. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1063426611401624">Roberts, Roberts, and Xing (2006)</xref> sampled 4,175 adolescents in health maintenance organizations and found few, if any, differences among African Americans, Mexican Americans, and European Americans after controlling for covariates such as gender, age, parent education, and family income. They concluded that there appear to be “few systematic differences between majority and minority adolescents at risk for psychiatric disorders” (p. 1329). On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1063426611401624">Xue, Leventhal, Brooks-Gunn, and Earls (2005)</xref> examined a much younger sample from the same racial or ethnic groups and found that children’s neighborhoods account for significant differences among groups. The percentages for point prevalence of children above the clinical diagnostic thresholds were 11%, 18%, and 21% in high, medium, and low socioeconomic neighborhoods, respectively. They suggest that certain structural characteristics of low-income neighborhoods, such as concentrated disadvantage, may be responsible for higher risk, perhaps more so than socioeconomic status, a conclusion also reached by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1063426611401624">Jensen (2007)</xref>. There is also a possibility that it might be more accurate to think in terms of children in high-income neighborhoods having an <italic>advantage</italic>, reflected in lower point prevalence, rather than in terms of children from low- to middle-income neighborhoods having a disadvantage, as suggested by a recent study of family resources in this regard by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1063426611401624">Amone-P’Olak and colleagues (2010)</xref>.</p>

<sec id="section9-1063426611401624">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>There are a number of implications about special education for children with EBD that could be drawn from this brief overview of point and cumulative prevalence. We discuss these in relation to underidentification, misidentification, underservice, gender or ethnic differences, and service gap disparities within special education. When we refer to special education, this includes all services provided under an individualized education program, including instructional and behavioral interventions or supports in a general education classroom or such services provided in special classes or other specialized settings. It should be noted that identification rates for ED are not evenly distributed in that the special education identification rates for ED vary across states from around 0.2% to just more than 2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1063426611401624">U.S. Department of Education, 2007</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section10-1063426611401624">
<title>Underidentification</title>
<p>The findings of this review on point prevalence, in particular, are related to the probability of errors in special education identification. Since our point prevalence estimates far exceed the percentage of children receiving special education, false negatives (i.e., a false finding of no EBD) are statistically much more likely than are the false positives (i.e., a false finding of EBD) that have been much discussed in the special education literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1063426611401624">Hart, Cramer, Harry, Klingner, &amp; Sturges, 2010</xref>). Children in the ED category itself are less than 1% of the school population; and thus using even our very conservative estimate of 12% point prevalence, they are probably likely to be among the lowest 10% or the most severely impaired of all children with EBD. This enormous service gap is significantly magnified when we add to this our findings on cumulative prevalence. Such children are like disabled aircraft circling over the emergency runway until suddenly forced down by circumstance. In the case of either point prevalence or cumulative prevalence, it could reasonably be inferred that those children with EBD who find their way into special education in the ED category are by far the most impaired and very much in need of whatever special education or related services we can afford them. This is corroborated by recent longitudinal evidence that, even after receiving evidence-based interventions in a three-tiered model of school intervention, children at moderate or severe risk for EBD continue to show serious impairment as they reach the third tier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1063426611401624">Nelson et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Most worrisome, of course, are the false negatives, that is, those children with EBD who are not identified or served in special education at all. General education teachers at all grade levels are very likely to face formidable numbers of children assigned to their classrooms with undetected moderate or severe emotional or behavioral challenges, particularly in schools located in lower income neighborhoods. Special educators and other professionals have made significant progress in working with children in <italic>general education</italic> to either prevent EBDs with programs of positive behavioral support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1063426611401624">Bradshaw, Mitchell, &amp; Leaf, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1063426611401624">Horner et al., 2009</xref>) or to forestall the functional impairments of children already at risk for EBD with selected interventions designed for general education classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1063426611401624">Buckley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1063426611401624">Walker &amp; Forness, in press</xref>). Some evidence exists that despite recent emphasis on academic interventions for children with EBD including tutoring or other special instructional approaches, children at significant risk for EBD in general education classrooms are either not receiving or not responding to such instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1063426611401624">Siperstein, Wiley, &amp; Forness, in press</xref>). The problem is that <italic>adoption</italic> of these instructional or behavioral practices in school settings lags far behind the development of such evidence-based interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1063426611401624">Burns &amp; Ysseldyke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1063426611401624">Cooper, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1063426611401624">Dunlap et al., 2006</xref>). Just as problematic is the fact that few if any systematic studies have been conducted on the types and extent of <italic>mental health</italic> services actually provided to children with EBD in general education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1063426611401624">Atkins, Hoagwood, Kutash, &amp; Seidman, 2010</xref>). There is increasing evidence that such mental health interventions, including psychopharmacology, may increase school performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1063426611401624">Forness et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1063426611401624">Jacobs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1063426611401624">Molina et al., 2009</xref>), but unfortunately the quality of these interventions in community settings leaves much to be desired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1063426611401624">Zima et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, lack of such effective support for general education teachers leaves them woefully underprepared for the presence of children with undetected EBD in their classrooms.</p>

<sec id="section11-1063426611401624">
<title>Misidentification</title>
<p>One implication of cumulative prevalence in particular is the possibility that some children whose EBD waxes and wanes (i.e., those within the range of cumulative prevalence) but who are not <italic>currently</italic> affected (i.e., point prevalence) may nonetheless still be identified and served in special education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1063426611401624">Forness (2005)</xref> has noted the possibility that a significant portion of children with EBDs may be served in special education but in categories other than ED. Although the ED category, in particular, is considered the primary special education category for children with EBDs, there is evidence that significant numbers of children with EBD may also be found in the learning disability (LD) and speech and language impairment (SLI) categories as well. Misidentification or diagnostic substitution, as opposed to underidentification, of children with EBDs has not been a primary focus of concern in special education; but Redden and her colleagues spent a number of years following preschoolers into middle elementary school to study children at risk for special education placement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1063426611401624">Redden et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1063426611401624">Redden et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1063426611401624">Redden et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1063426611401624">Redden, Forness, Ramey, Ramey, &amp; Brezausek, 2002</xref>). In this project, annual data were collected on a sample of more than 4,000 Head Start children, across 30 different sites across the nation. They were followed until the end of third grade in terms of their risk for EBDs as well as their subsequent eligibility for special education. Risk was established using a diagnostic analogue of clinical cutoff points, both for symptoms of EBDs and for concurrent impairment in either social skills and/or academic performance obtained independently by research staff.</p>
<p>Although nearly 15% of children met diagnostic prevalence criteria for concurrent EBD symptoms and impairment by end of third grade, only about one fourth of the children diagnosed in this way were found eligible for special education by their schools. Children who met criteria for EBDs were, moreover, 5 times more likely to be identified in the LD and SLI categories (if they were found eligible) than they were in the ED category. This was despite the fact that possible comorbid learning or language disorders were first <italic>ruled out</italic> through testing or teacher ratings <italic>prior</italic> to these children being diagnosed at risk for EBDs. More intensive research on smaller, middle-class samples using more extensive diagnostic testing also confirms such misidentification findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1063426611401624">Bussing, Zima, Belin, &amp; Forness, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1063426611401624">Duncan, Forness, &amp; Hartsough, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1063426611401624">Lopez, Forness, MacMillan, Bocian, &amp; Gresham, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1063426611401624">MacMillan, Gresham, &amp; Bocian, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>It should be noted that the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1063426611401624">U.S. Department of Education (2002)</xref> has also devoted a special section of one of its relatively recent annual reports on the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to this issue of behavior problems in children classified by the schools as LD or SLI. In this report, they detail selected findings from their Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Study based on social skills and problem behavior ratings obtained from a total of 4,541 teachers and 4,466 parents of children (ages 6–12) in 12 categories of special education. Across <italic>all</italic> special education categories, nearly 40% of children were rated by teachers as “easily distracted” on a frequent basis, 25% as “acting impulsively,” and 7% to 10% as “depressed or lonely.” As expected, social skill impairments and problem behaviors were greatest in the ED category. Children in the LD and SLI categories, however, also had substantial levels of problem behaviors. Children in the LD and SLI categories also tended to be suspended or expelled for disciplinary reasons in substantial numbers, though somewhat less so than children in the ED category.</p>
<p>Similar misidentification may also exist in other special education categories. The category of other health impairments (OHI) allows for special education of at least some children with ADHD who do not qualify for the ED category; but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1063426611401624">Forness and Kavale (2002)</xref> note that the OHI category serves less than 0.9% of school-age children, of whom probably much fewer than half meet eligibility as ADHD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1063426611401624">Coo et al. (2008)</xref> examined trends in the school identification of autism in the United Kingdom and found that more than half of the tremendous increase from 1996 to 2004 within the autism school category was attributable to children switching into that category from other special education categories, including the U.K. category that corresponds to our ED category. Others have suggested a similar phenomenon in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1063426611401624">Freeman, Paparella, &amp; Stickles, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1063426611401624">Shattuck, 2005</xref>). Since misidentification could result from the waxing and waning of certain EBDs in school children as discussed in the cumulative prevalence section, it is not unreasonable to suspect that many children with EBD are served in these other categories.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1063426611401624">
<title>Underservice</title>
<p>From the studies on diagnostic substitution or misidentification just discussed, it seems a distinct possibility that at least as many children with EBDs may currently be served in other special education categories as they are in the ED category itself. It may be that these children are knowingly placed in special education categories other than ED either to accommodate a comorbid EBD or to avoid the stigma associated with ED placement. The impact of possible stigma associated with such mental health disorders cannot be discounted, particularly in regard to school eligibility decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1063426611401624">Hinshaw, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1063426611401624">Pescosolido et al., 2008</xref>). It is equally plausible, however, that such children’s EBDs are <italic>misidentified</italic> as learning or communication problems. In regard to our discussion of cumulative prevalence, a significant number of these children may have been those with subthreshold symptoms who either previously had or were subsequently to develop EBD.</p>
<p>Whether such children are actually well served while in these other categories is another matter entirely. Most teachers in these categories are not traditionally prepared to deal with the emotional or behavioral, as opposed to the learning or communication, problems of children in their care. Even in states with so-called noncategorical special education, children must first be identified in a particular category; and, if this is not ED, the primary focus on their EBD may well be dissipated. Children identified in these other categories may well remain in special education for years but continue to be significantly underserved, at least in regard to their emotional or behavioral problems, regardless of whether these are primary disorders or are comorbid with their learning or communication disabilities. As noted above in our discussion of underidentification, children with EBD may in fact be as underserved as to their emotional or behavioral needs in these other categories of special education as they were when initially identified in general education. Whether somehow these children might be correctly identified at a later time and/or given appropriate education or related services for their emerging emotional or behavioral problems is not clear.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1063426611401624">
<title>Gender and Ethnic Issues</title>
<p>As noted above, there has been marked improvement in diagnostic and impairment measures. We also noted the relative lack of ethnic or racial bias found in the above prevalence studies when income or severity are controlled. Disproportionate <italic>identification</italic> of children of color in the ED category of special education continues, however, but with certain disclaimers. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1063426611401624">Coutinho, Oswald, Best, and Forness (2002)</xref> examined Office of Civil Rights data on thousands of students identified in the ED category. Although Black males seem consistently overidentified in the ED category compared to Whites, this is not the case in low-income neighborhoods. Only when neighborhood income increases does overidentification of Black males increase. Living in a largely White, affluent community significantly increases the odds of ED identification for Black students but only slightly, if at all, for other students. Thus, although living in a high-income neighborhood should decrease the odds of having EBD, as we have noted above in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1063426611401624">Xue et al. (2005)</xref> study, it may actually increase the odds of being identified in special education for Black males. Living in a largely non-White, low-income community, however, increases the odds of ED identification for Native American students. Females are consistently underidentified compared to males, and Hispanic and Asian American students of both genders tend to be underidentified in the ED category compared to their White counterparts.</p>
<p>Yeh and her colleagues have examined a sample of 1,019 children identified in the ED category and found that controlling for <italic>severity</italic> of a child’s EBD tended to eliminate significant differences in overidentification of African American children in this category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1063426611401624">Yeh, Forness, Ho, McCabe, &amp; Hough, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1063426611401624">Yeh, Hough, McCabe, Lau, &amp; Barland, 2004</xref>). The problem is, however, that local school professionals do not necessarily control for family income, gender, ethnicity, or relative severity of disorder but respond to the individual constellation of behaviors that the student presents as well as to pressures from parents and teachers for assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1063426611401624">Waitoller, Artiles, &amp; Cheney, 2010</xref>). Thus, potential racial or ethnic biases in special education identification for the ED category must be viewed in the context of a myriad of complex factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1063426611401624">
<title>Service Gap Disparities</title>
<p>In regard to the enormous gap between prevalence and needed services, children with EBD may be unique even <italic>within</italic> special education. In learning disabilities, for example, there is some consensus that children at even mild risk for learning disabilities number around 20% of school-age children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1063426611401624">Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1063426611401624">Shaywitz, 2003</xref>), similar to the most generous point prevalence estimates of EBD noted above; yet special education serves more than 5% of school children in the LD category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1063426611401624">U.S. Department of Education, 2007</xref>). Likewise, the category of mental retardation or intellectual disabilities serves just slightly more than 1% of school enrollment, similar to the number served in the ED category; yet no one would even attempt to claim that the prevalence of school-age children with mental retardation or intellectual disabilities would number any higher than 2 or 3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1063426611401624">Forness &amp; MacMillan, 1989</xref>). Comparisons among these service gaps go largely unremarked in the special education literature. We should not be surprised, therefore, that students in the ED category have been shown to have by far the worst outcomes of any of the major categories in special education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1063426611401624">Siperstein et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1063426611401624">Wagner, Kutash, Duchnowski, Epstein, &amp; Sumi, 2005</xref>). Let students who eventually make it into the LD category, for example, be limited to <italic>their</italic> worst 1% of school enrollment and the odds are that their outcomes probably would be no better.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There is increasing recognition that having a child with EBDs represents a harsh reality to families across the United States and that the burden associated with this impairment is heightened during the school years because of lack of referral and/or limited access to appropriate services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1063426611401624">Bussing, Mason, Bell, Porter, &amp; Garvan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1063426611401624">Bussing, Zima, Gary, &amp; Garvan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1063426611401624">Bussing, Zima, Gary, Mason, et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1063426611401624">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1063426611401624">Costello et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1063426611401624">Hinshaw, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1063426611401624">Kuehn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1063426611401624">Zima et al., 2010</xref>). Part of the difficulty in school identification and intervention for children with EBDs is the lack of training of school professionals in the broader context of mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1063426611401624">Forness, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1063426611401624">Forness &amp; Beard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1063426611401624">Forness, Walker, &amp; Kavale, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1063426611401624">Obiakor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1063426611401624">Owens &amp; Hamel-Lambert, 2007</xref>). Many, if not most, general education teachers and administrators seem to instinctively view classroom externalizing behavior as totally willful and cause for disciplinary referrals rather than as a possible symptom of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1063426611401624">Walter, Gouze, &amp; Lim, 2006</xref>). On the other hand, they frequently tend to view lack of involvement in certain instructional activities as a learning problem rather than as a potential symptom of depression or anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>Implications of data presented herein on widespread prevalence of these disorders, their age of onset during school years, and the tremendous time lags to appropriate intervention seem to be as lost on school professionals as they are on the general public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1063426611401624">Warner, 2010</xref>). There is likewise a serious lack of mandated preventive interventions for school children at risk for EBD that could be used prior to special education identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1063426611401624">Zirkel &amp; Thomas, 2010</xref>). That these gaps in service delivery are surely the result of limited fiscal resources, training of personnel, and a myriad of other factors is not in question, but the extent of this disparity between need and services seems unique even within special education. Not being at least sensitized to the high prevalence of EBDs and their symptoms, school professionals may often fail to either detect children needing help for EBDs or else misidentify their problems as learning or school discipline issues.</p>
