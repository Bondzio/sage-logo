<sec id="section1-1944451611431697">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is present with increasing frequency in patients coming for surgery and carries significant implications that extend well beyond the intraoperative arena.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451611431697">1</xref></sup> Epidemiologic studies have found a prevalence of 5% to 24% in Western countries, with rates rising as high as 70% in certain surgical patient populations, such as bariatric surgery patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451611431697">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451611431697">4</xref></sup> Ideally, these patients would be diagnosed with a preoperative formal sleep study, be compliant with outpatient continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices, and be on stable CPAP settings. Knowing patients’ OSA severity beforehand may help identify those at higher risk of postoperative complications. This patient population may benefit from a higher level of monitoring after surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1944451611431697">5</xref></sup> Unfortunately, physicians are often confronted with the patient who has not been formally diagnosed with OSA but who carries several clinical risk factors. This article outlines a framework to help physicians identify and manage the patient at risk for OSA throughout the perioperative period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1944451611431697">
<title>Preoperative Detection</title>
<p>The need to identify patients at high risk for OSA without a formal polysomnography has resulted in the development of several different screening tools. Currently, the STOP and the Berlin questionnaires and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) checklist are the only ones validated for preoperative patients. The STOP questionnaire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1944451611431697">Figure 1</xref>) was specifically created as a screening test for surgical patients. Patients are given a score based on the presence or absence of Snoring, daytime Tiredness, Observed apnea, and high blood Pressure. The STOP questionnaire has sensitivities of 66% to 80%, with a higher sensitivity for detecting moderate and severe OSA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451611431697">6</xref></sup> When further refined with the addition of other patient measures, such as Body mass index (BMI), Age, Neck circumference, and Gender, the sensitivity of the STOP BANG tool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1944451611431697">Figure 2</xref>) for predicting moderate and severe apnea or hypopnea rises and ranges from 84% to 100%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1944451611431697">7</xref></sup> The STOP BANG questionnaire’s high sensitivity for detecting moderate to severe OSA could be particularly useful because OSA severity seems to correlate with the probability of postoperative and cardiovascular complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451611431697">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1944451611431697">8</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>In contrast, the Berlin questionnaire is a series of 11 more detailed questions in several categories: snoring, fatigue/tiredness, blood pressure, and BMI. Finally, the ASA checklist focuses a little more on the physical characteristics of the airway, such as craniofacial abnormalities, tonsils, and neck circumference. It also incorporates the basic signs and symptoms of OSA, such as snoring, apneas, and somnolence. However, the ASA checklist does not take into account a history of hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451611431697">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>These 3 preoperative tools were compared head-to-head by Chung et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451611431697">6</xref></sup> in a retrospective study. The investigators analyzed the ability of the 3 screening methods to identify patients with significant apnea or hypopnea and to predict the development of postoperative complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451611431697">6</xref></sup> All 3 assessments were able to predict the presence of severe OSA, defined as an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) &gt;30 by formal sleep study, with a sensitivity in the 80% to 90% range. The ASA checklist and the STOP questionnaire were also able to identify patients with a high risk of developing postoperative respiratory, cardiac, or neurologic complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1944451611431697">7</xref></sup> Given the prevalence of OSA, patients who present with multiple known risk factors, including hypertension, witnessed apnea, obesity, old age, male gender, craniofacial abnormalities, large neck circumferences, excessive alcohol intake, and menopause, should be screened preoperatively with 1 of the 3 validated assessments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451611431697">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once a patient has been identified as high risk for OSA, the decision to delay surgery to obtain a formal polysomnography and commence treatment with CPAP should be made based on the urgency of the surgery and the severity of the patient’s symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451611431697">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451611431697">9</xref></sup> Current literature does not clearly show a benefit of preoperative CPAP on perioperative outcomes. However, current ASA guidelines recommend attempting positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, such as CPAP or bilevel PAP, preoperatively in patients with severe OSA. This recommendation is supported by the observation of Gupta et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451611431697">10</xref></sup> that patients treated with preoperative CPAP had fewer complications than their untreated counterparts, independent of postoperative CPAP use. OSA patients on PAP therapy should bring their outpatient devices to the hospital.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1944451611431697">11</xref></sup> Continuing inpatient PAP management is facilitated by their familiarity with the mask and the preset, individually titrated machine settings.</p>

<sec id="section3-1944451611431697">
<title>Intraoperative Management</title>
<p>To date, there are no comprehensive studies comparing various anesthetic modalities and the impact of anesthetic choice on perioperative outcomes in OSA patients. As a result, the optimal intraoperative management of identified high-risk patients is mostly based on expert opinion. Associated comorbidities and anatomy, such as obesity, large neck circumference, or craniofacial abnormalities, can make airway management more difficult. Being prepared to manage a difficult airway is essential, and patients should not be extubated until they are fully awake and all paralytics and anesthetics have worn off.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451611431697">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Using regional and neuraxial anesthetics for peripheral and superficial surgeries, minimizing perioperative opiate and benzodiazepine use, and avoiding deep sedation without a definitive airway have been recommended.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451611431697">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451611431697">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1944451611431697">12</xref></sup> However, the optimal anesthetic should always be tailored to the individual patient and the type of surgery. The choice of anesthetic must ultimately be based on the anesthesiologist’s risk–benefit assessment (eg, general anesthesia with a secured airway versus regional anesthesia plus sedation with an unsecured airway). Several case reports of delayed respiratory arrests have been reported in OSA patients receiving epidural opiates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451611431697">13</xref></sup> The role of neuraxial opiates compared with other anesthetic and analgesic regimens needs further exploration. The few published case reports suggest the possibility of adverse respiratory effects in OSA patients, but there is insufficient data to make concrete opiate dose or route (epidural versus intrathecal) guidelines. The use of pure local anesthetics for neuraxial techniques may be preferable in OSA patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451611431697">13</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section4-1944451611431697">
<title>Postoperative Recovery</title>
<p>The postoperative period for the OSA patient can be a particularly dangerous time, especially during the first 24 hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451611431697">9</xref></sup> In a case–control study of 202 patients undergoing orthopedic procedures, Gupta et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451611431697">10</xref></sup> showed that a higher percentage of OSA patients had significant postoperative complications, such as need for reintubation and cardiac events, compared to control patients (24% vs 9%, <italic>P</italic> = .001). Their findings were supported by the subsequent retrospective cohort study by Liao et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1944451611431697">14</xref></sup> which examined 240 paired subjects undergoing elective surgery. The OSA study group had a postoperative complication incidence of 44%, compared with 28% in the control group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1944451611431697">14</xref></sup> Common postoperative complications in the OSA patient population include arrhythmias, cardiac events, desaturations, hypercapnea, and unanticipated ICU admissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451611431697">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451611431697">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1944451611431697">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The complications associated with OSA, general anesthesia, and postoperative pain management are on full display in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Following general anesthesia, patients with OSA may show an increased incidence of upper airway obstruction, apnea, and desaturation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451611431697">9</xref></sup> Residual anesthetic effects may not only compromise upper airway tone but also blunt the patient’s arousal response to hypoxemia and hypercarbia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451611431697">2</xref></sup> This tendency may be exacerbated in the PACU, where patients often require acute pain management with opioids, which are known respiratory depressants. Many experts recommend that opiates be used only if appropriate nonopiate medications and regional anesthetic techniques are inadequate for pain control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1944451611431697">15</xref></sup> If possible, OSA patients should also be placed in non-supine positions while they recover from anesthesia to improve airway patency and functional residual capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451611431697">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451611431697">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1944451611431697">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Good communication with the PACU nurses is critical. Their role in monitoring vital signs, observing emergence from general anesthesia, and administering pain medications can help identify patients experiencing worrisome episodes early in the recovery period. This information can help determine the appropriate level of monitoring after discharge from the PACU. In an effort to determine which subset of OSA patients is at highest risk for adverse events after leaving the PACU, Gali et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1944451611431697">16</xref></sup> studied 693 surgical patients. These patients were identified preoperatively as being at high or low risk for obstructive sleep apnea based on a sleep apnea clinical score (Flemons criteria). This questionnaire included an assessment of neck circumference, a history of hypertension, and clinical symptoms. Patients were observed for apneas, slow respiratory rates, desaturations, and pain–analgesia mismatch in the PACU. After discharge from the PACU, patients were monitored by continuous pulse oximetry for 48 hours. The authors defined an oxygen desaturation index (ODI) as the number of desaturations (&gt;4% decrease lasting for &gt;10 seconds) per hour. Patients categorized as high risk for OSA preoperatively or patients who had recurrent PACU events were more likely to have a postoperative ODI &gt; 10 and respiratory complications. The combination of the preoperative assessment tool and the PACU observations helped to identify those patients at greatest risk for postoperative desaturations and other respiratory complications after PACU discharge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1944451611431697">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1944451611431697">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Objective predictors of complications would be very helpful in guiding appropriate postoperative management. There appears to be a greater likelihood of significant clinical morbidity with moderate to severe OSA, compared with mild OSA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451611431697">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1944451611431697">8</xref></sup> However, OSA severity is classically determined by the apnea–hypopnea index, which requires a formal sleep study. Risk stratification based on OSA severity is therefore not possible in most perioperative settings. Easily obtainable and quantifiable clinical data, such as the severity of hypoxemia or the absolute nadir of the observed pulse oximetry desaturations, have not yet been shown to predict morbidity, mortality, or perioperative complications.</p>
<p>Given these limitations, there are few evidence-based guidelines to help the physician determine the optimal duration and intensity of postsurgical monitoring in the newly diagnosed OSA patient. The ASA created a perioperative complication risk assessment for OSA patients based on expert opinion. This risk assessment takes into account the severity of sleep apnea, invasiveness of the surgery, type of intraoperative anesthesia, and postoperative opioid requirement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451611431697">3</xref></sup> Patients who scored ≥5 were deemed to be at significant perioperative risk. Individuals with high perioperative risk and multiple observed desaturation episodes in the PACU may benefit from the institution of PAP therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451611431697">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451611431697">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1944451611431697">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The current ASA guidelines also recommend continuous pulse oximetry after PACU discharge until the patient no longer meets criteria for high perioperative risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451611431697">3</xref></sup> In many hospitals, continuous pulse oximetry can be provided in the ICU, the step-down telemetry unit or the regular hospital floor with bedside telemetry and a trained individual in the room. The hospital’s staffing resources and bed availability, and the physician’s judgment regarding the risk of post-operative complications should guide the patient’s admission to the appropriate unit floor. At our hospital, all patients started on new inpatient PAP therapy must be admitted to the ICU for initial management and monitoring. ICU admission has also been suggested for patients with severe OSA, a history of a difficult airway, other cardiac or pulmonary comorbid conditions, nasal/sinus surgery with postoperative nasal packing, and significant postoperative opiate requirements for pain management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451611431697">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451611431697">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1944451611431697">15</xref></sup> Ambulatory surgery patients do represent a particularly challenging population. Although there are no definitive guidelines, patients with frequent or severe apneas in the PACU and/or multiple high-risk factors by the ASA criteria should be monitored in the PACU for a longer period of time and admission for overnight observation should be strongly considered.</p>
<p>Although the patient’s anesthetic and immediate postsurgical analgesic requirements may contribute to early complications, disordered sleep may act as a late risk factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451611431697">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1944451611431697">19</xref></sup> Sleep deprivation and the initial lack of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep postoperatively can result in a phenomenon known as REM rebound. REM rebound may manifest several days after the initial surgery. For OSA patients, this can be a particularly hazardous time for several reasons. First, airway tone is lowest during REM sleep and studies have shown increased inspiratory resistance and pharyngeal narrowing in normal subjects during sleep.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451611431697">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1944451611431697">15</xref></sup> This correlates with observations that apneas and hypopneas occur with greater frequency and severity during REM sleep in OSA patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451611431697">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451611431697">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451611431697">13</xref></sup> Second, the sympathetic stimulation associated with hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and intermittent arousals can cause detrimental hemodynamic swings and may contribute to the cardiac events and arrhythmias observed in this patient group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451611431697">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1944451611431697">12</xref></sup> Given the presence of both early and late risk factors for postoperative complications, definitive, evidence-based guidelines on the appropriate degree and duration of inpatient monitoring for the OSA patient need to be developed.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The perioperative management of the OSA patient represents a burgeoning challenge for surgeons, anesthesiologists, hospitalists, and intensive care physicians. Patients with risk factors for OSA should be evaluated preoperatively with the currently available screening questionnaires, such as the STOP BANG and the Berlin questionnaires or the ASA checklist. Patients who are at moderate to high risk for significant OSA based on these screening evaluations should be managed intraoperatively as though they carry a diagnosis of OSA. Avoiding or minimizing the use of general anesthesia, opiates and benzodiazepines, and using regional anesthesia and nonopiate analgesia may help minimize postoperative complications. The preoperative screening assessment, PACU course, and ASA perioperative risk score might help physicians identify those patients at highest risk for postoperative adverse events. This information can facilitate triage to the appropriate acuity level and help guide the decision to institute CPAP therapy after surgery. Although residual anesthetics and opiates might pose as early risk factors for complications, delayed adverse events have also been observed and may be related to sleep disturbances and REM rebound. The duration of postsurgical monitoring is unclear and until evidence-based guidelines are available, clinical judgment must be applied on a case-by-case basis.</p>
