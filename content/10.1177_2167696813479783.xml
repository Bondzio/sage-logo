<abstract>
<p>In the past, the tasks of establishing psychological and practical independence were linked in time. Nowadays, these transitions are no longer successively manageable sequences; rather, they are characterized by fluctuations, discontinuities, and reversals. In this review, research findings on factors contributing to the diversity in emerging adults’ leaving home patterns (including early leaving, late leaving, or continued residence in the parents’ home) are summarized. These findings show that although culture, gender, social class, and education shape leaving home patterns, individual factors (e.g., emerging adults’ attachment representations or their progress in the domains of love and work), and parenting strategies that essentially keep the child emotionally and physically in close proximity are also influential. The review reveals that leaving home is an important developmental task for both emerging adult children and their parents and illustrates how linked their lives are.</p>

<p>Around the world, young people are delaying moving out of their parents’ homes, which is commonly regarded as the first step toward establishing an independent adult life. In recent years, unanticipated changes in family composition and living arrangements in families with adult children have occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2167696813479783">Bynner, 2012</xref>). The reversal of the empty nest phenomenon has received considerable attention in the printed media, as reflected by article headings such as “Some kids aren’t back—they never left,” “When a nest won’t stay empty,” or “The return of the boomerang adults” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2167696813479783">Boyd &amp; Pryor, 1989</xref>). Recent assessments have shown that 51 million emerging adults in the European Union live with their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2167696813479783">Choroszewicz &amp; Wolff, 2010</xref>), and the numbers for emerging adults in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2167696813479783">Settersten, 1998</xref>) and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2167696813479783">Cobb-Clark, 2008</xref>) are also considerably large. Continued coresidence with parents during emerging adulthood may slow down the process by which an individual moves toward becoming a self-sufficient and independent adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2167696813479783">Arnett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2167696813479783">Roisman, Masten, Coatsworth, &amp; Tellegen, 2004</xref>). Because successful achievement of adult status also is linked to the emerging adult’s well-being and the quality of parent–adult child relationships, the issue of delayed home leaving requires special attention. Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize research findings on the factors that might contribute to the diversity in emerging adults’ leaving home patterns. Sociological and psychological factors that have a bearing on the home-leaving process will be examined. In addition, cultural norms and behaviors that underpin this important developmental task for emerging adult children and their parents will be considered.</p>

<title>Leaving Home: Cohort Differences and the Relative Impacts of Culture and Values</title>
<p>Previous sociological and demographic research has drawn much attention to structural components such as gender, family structure, and economic conditions and analyzed historical influences. This research substantiated that the leaving home patterns of young adults in the Northern and Central European and North American countries were similar and that they strongly differed from leaving home patterns of young adults from Mediterranean countries.</p>
<sec id="section2-2167696813479783">
<title>Cohort Differences: Indications of a Delayed Departure</title>
<p>Changes and reversals in the time patterns for leaving home have been observed in recent decades. For example, between 1960 and the late 1980s, young people in the United States, Canada, and many European countries tended to leave the parental home increasingly earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2167696813479783">Cordon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2167696813479783">DaVanzo &amp; Goldscheider, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2167696813479783">Galland, 1997</xref>; Schnaiberg &amp; Goldenberg, 1989). However, the trend toward leaving home earlier began to move in the opposite direction. Since the early 1990s, the mean age for leaving home has increased. This postponement of leaving home, which essentially means that a greater percentage of adult children continue to reside with their parents, has generated much research in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2167696813479783">Arnett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2167696813479783">Barber, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2167696813479783">Goldscheider, 1997</xref>) and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2167696813479783">Cobb-Clark, 2008</xref>). The number of central European young adults who continue to live in the parental home has also risen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2167696813479783">Cherlin, Scabini, &amp; Rossi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2167696813479783">Rossi, 1997</xref>); currently 46% of emerging adults (ages 18–34) in the European Union live with their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2167696813479783">Choroszewicz &amp; Wolff, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2167696813479783">Dribe and Stanfors (2002)</xref> analyzed the determinants of leaving the parental home in three birth year cohorts (1954, 1959, and 1965) in Sweden and found that the lengthening of the educational period and the change in traditional models of entry in the labor resulted in delayed home leaving. For Germany, in the 1950s and 1960s, youth left home at a very young age (e.g., between 17 and 19 years; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2167696813479783">Lauterbach &amp; Lüscher, 1999</xref>). However, in the 1970s, young people began to leave home later, and this trend has persisted over the last two decades. The observed increase in age of leaving home has also been consistently reported for Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2167696813479783">Cherlin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2167696813479783">Cordon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2167696813479783">Dribe &amp; Stanfors, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2167696813479783">Galland, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2167696813479783">Kins, Beyers, Soenens, &amp; Vanstenkiste, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2167696813479783">Rossi, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2167696813479783">Galland (1997)</xref> found that the percentage of young people in France living in the parental home increased from 1968 to 1995, regardless of their occupational status. Similar to the other researchers, he identified a greater professional instability among young people before they settled into an independent living situation, and that unemployed or less educated young men left home latest of all.</p>

<title>Heterogeneity in Leaving Home Patterns Across Countries: Differences Between the North and South, and the Impact of Culture</title>
<p>A prolongation and diversification of the transition to adulthood is known to have taken place in all advanced industrialized countries, although differences between countries are notable. In measuring the magnitude of cross-national differences in the timing of leaving home, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2167696813479783">Fussell, Gautheir, and Evans (2007)</xref> applied entropy analyses based on census data from Australia, Canada, and the United States. They found that youth in the United States experienced a shorter, more uniform transition than their peers in Australia and Canada did, even though this transition was increasingly prolonged in all three countries. Although the earlier transition to residential independence in the United States is mostly due to an earlier entry into the job market, U.S. young adults also marry earlier than their Australian and Canadian age-mates do.</p>
<p>There is also great variation in the timing of home leaving in Europe. While youth in Central and Northern European countries show similar leaving home patterns (e.g., delayed home leaving, and a small proportion of young adults in their late 20s who still reside with their parents), the picture in Southern European countries (e.g., Greece, Italy, and Spain) is quite different. EUROSTAT data from 1983, 1994, and 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2167696813479783">Choroszewicz &amp; Wolff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2167696813479783">Cordon, 1997</xref>) revealed that the percentage of young adults (ages 24–29) in Southern Europe who were still living with their parents was up to 3 times greater than the percentages in Northern European countries (e.g., Denmark, Estonia, Finland, and Sweden) and Central European countries (e.g., Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2167696813479783">Choroszewicz &amp; Wolff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2167696813479783">Cordon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2167696813479783">Lauterbach &amp; Lüscher, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2167696813479783">Rossi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-2167696813479783">Van Hekken, de Mey, &amp; Schulze, 1997</xref>). Among young adults (ages 25–29) in Southern European countries, 65% of the men and 44% of the women still lived with their parents, compared to 25% of the men and 11% of the women in Northern and Central European countries. Similar to the pattern found for Northern and Central Europe, in Australia, Canada, and the United States, about 15–20% of emerging adults between the ages of 25–29 still live with their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2167696813479783">Fussell, Gautheir, &amp; Evans, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2167696813479783">Goldscheider, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-2167696813479783">White, 1994</xref>). There have been frequent reports that the increase in coresidence with parents is more striking for young males than females (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-2167696813479783">Schnaiberg &amp; Goldenberg, 1989</xref>) and that young women move out earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2167696813479783">Nave-Herz, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2167696813479783">Newman &amp; Aptekar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-2167696813479783">Schnaiberg &amp; Goldenberg, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, compared to the leaving home pattern shown by young adults in the northern parts of Europe, continued residence in the parental home is quite widespread in Mediterranean countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2167696813479783">Iacovou, 2001</xref>). For emerging adults in this region, different social and cultural norms about when young adults should physically, economically, socially, and emotionally separate from their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-2167696813479783">Schnaiberg &amp; Goldenberg, 1989</xref>) and the greater connectedness and family orientation in Southern European countries appear to have a bearing on leaving home patterns. Traditionally, most young people left home when they married. This traditional pattern still exists, and for the countries following the Mediterranean model, marriage is the only reason for leaving home. However, there are other social and economic reasons specific to this region that must be taken into consideration, such as weak social welfare systems, high unemployment rates, and the low solvency of young people, who often earn quite little or have unstable jobs. All of these are more characteristic for young people following the Mediterranean pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2167696813479783">Cordon, 1997</xref>) than for those living in more northern European countries. Furthermore, compared to countries following the Nordic pattern, housing shortages are common, and cohabitation with a romantic partner as a living arrangement is rare. Work status does not appear to be a particularly important factor for the timing of leaving home in males, as both employed and unemployed young men continue to reside with their parents up to the age of 30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2167696813479783">Cordon, 1997</xref>). There are some exceptions in the patterns described so far. For example, early home leaving is quite common in Great Britain, where a substantial number of young people leave home at age 17 or 18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2167696813479783">Cordon, 1997</xref>). This is most likely related to their earlier school-leaving transition.</p>
<p>Thus altogether, from a sociological perspective, the greater enrollment of young people in higher educational institutions, difficulties in finding a permanent job before the age of 30, and, to a lesser extent and not in all countries, the unlinking of marriage and residential status have contributed to a delay in young adults’ leaving home pattern.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2167696813479783">
<title>Characteristics of the Family Home That Play a Role</title>
<p>One of the most important determinants of leaving home is the family situation (e.g., parents’ marital status, number of siblings, and location of the family home; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2167696813479783">DaVanzo &amp; Goldscheider, 1990</xref>). In most U.S. studies, family structure has been found to have the strongest effect on the timing of leaving home. Male youth living with a single parent are over 5 times more likely and female youth twice as likely to leave home early than those living at home with both parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2167696813479783">Goldscheider &amp; Goldscheider, 1994</xref>). Also, earlier home leaving has been reported for young adults coming from families with stepparents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2167696813479783">Cooney &amp; Mortimer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-2167696813479783">Tang, 1997</xref>). Similarly, studies of young people in the Netherlands and Sweden revealed that experiencing a parental divorce increased the likelihood of leaving home both for males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2167696813479783">Bucx, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2167696813479783">Dribe &amp; Stanfors, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-2167696813479783">Stattin &amp; Magnusson, 1996</xref>). The timing of the divorce did not matter a great deal. Another potentially relevant aspect of the family situation influencing the decision to leave home is the family household’s composition. There is evidence that children with more siblings leave the home earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2167696813479783">Dribe &amp; Stanfors, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2167696813479783">Nave-Herz, 1997</xref>), which is largely explained by the lack of space in the parental home. In addition, poor location relative to the labor market or educational opportunities is related to early home leaving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2167696813479783">Cobb-Clark, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The family’s financial resources have also been found to be an important determinant of leaving home. In this respect, it is important to distinguish how resources may shape different pathways out of the parental home. For example, parents may use financial resources to help their child establish a new household and or get married (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2167696813479783">Cobb-Clark, 2008</xref>). Alternatively, higher parental income has been associated with a higher likelihood for the child to leave home to go to college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2167696813479783">Nave-Herz, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-2167696813479783">Raymore, Barber, &amp; Eccles, 2001</xref>). In a comparison of 11 European countries, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2167696813479783">Le Blanc and Wolff (2006)</xref> also found that a high parental income was associated with early home leaving, mostly because the children were studying at locations away from the parental home. The relationships between mothers’ and fathers’ professional/employment statuses and home leaving have also been investigated, but the findings are mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2167696813479783">Dribe &amp; Stanfors, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Different Pathways Out of the Parental Home: Emerging Adults’ Perspectives</title>
<p>Historically, the tasks of establishing physical and psychosocial independence were linked in time and drove one another. The prolongation of the transition to an adult status has led to an uncoupling of such developmental tasks, and the markers of adulthood, such as marriage or achieving economic independence, are occurring at later ages. Society paces the transition to a lesser extent nowadays, and this poses new challenges in terms of self-regulation. Recently, more specific subtypes of leaving home patterns have been linked to the developmental processes in emerging adults, including those related to self-perceived maturity and preparedness. Influential in this context has been self-determination theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2167696813479783">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000</xref>), which posits that when behaviors are more regulated by autonomous motives, individuals are more likely to experience subjective well-being.</p>
<sec id="section6-2167696813479783">
<title>Diversity in Emerging Adults’ Leaving Home Pathways and Motives</title>
<p>Research summarized so far has substantiated a delay in home leaving and different cultural patterns. However, there is more diversity than just continuing to live in or move out of the parental home. Most studies on college populations, such as those conducted in Belgium by Kins and coworkers, distinguish three different types of residential statuses of emerging adults. In one of their studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2167696813479783">Kins et al., 2009</xref>), they found that 43% of emerging adults were living with their parents, 26% were living semi-independently (e.g., in student housing during the week and at home on weekends), and 31% were living fully independently. Longitudinal studies in a German sample revealed additional groups, for example, the late leavers (emerging adults leaving after the normative age in a particular country) and the returners, amounting altogether to 28% of all leaving home patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2167696813479783">Seiffge-Krenke, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2167696813479783">2010</xref>). Young people in both groups were similar with respect to level of schooling, socioeconomic status (SES), and family structure. Low developmental status (i.e., having a low mean value for the accomplishment of developmental tasks such as establishing a firm partnership or starting a professional career) predicted late leaving. Others returned home because they needed parents’ help to deal with severe and stressful events (e.g., unemployment, unplanned pregnancy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2167696813479783">Seiffge-Krenke, 2010</xref>). U.S. studies have shown that returners are usually single males looking for a job after graduation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2167696813479783">Settersten, 1998</xref>). Alternatively, some returners come back to live in the parental home after realizing that they made unwise or poorly planned decisions about living arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2167696813479783">DaVanzo &amp; Goldscheider, 1990</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-2167696813479783">Schnaiberg and Goldenberg (1989)</xref>, up to 40% of emerging adults in the United States move back into the parental home once and then out again.</p>
<p>The motivational dynamics underlying emerging adult’s living situations are quite complex. Independent living seems to provide emerging adults with better opportunities for autonomous functioning and thus indirectly contributes to promoting well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2167696813479783">Kins et al., 2009</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2167696813479783">Ryan and Deci (2000)</xref> found that when an emerging adult made a conscious decision to leave home later or stay in the parents’ home, this was not problematic for his or her well-being.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-2167696813479783">
<title>Self-Perceived Maturity and Developmental Progression</title>
<p>Despite the importance of leaving home as a salient developmental task for emerging adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-2167696813479783">Raymore et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-2167696813479783">Seiffge-Krenke &amp; Gelhaar, 2008</xref>), only about every second emerging adult in North America and Central and Northern Europe leaves on time, which nowadays is a considerably later age than decades ago. The question is whether many of those leaving late, returning, or never leaving at all consider themselves to be mature (i.e., with respect to the attainment of major developmental tasks) or whether they still feel they need the family’s help in navigating through this period of experimentation and exploration.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2167696813479783">Arnett (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2167696813479783">Galambos, Turner, and Tilton-Weaver (2005)</xref> have shown that emerging adults have different conceptions of being mature. Many feel that they are not mature enough, “caught in between” adolescence and adulthood. In a German longitudinal study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2167696813479783">Seiffge-Krenke, 2010</xref>), the attainment of the tasks for emerging adulthood and the achieved developmental status during adolescence were found to have an impact on the timing of leaving home. On-time leavers (based on the normative ages for home leaving in Germany: 21 years for females, 22 years for males) had a high overall developmental status during adolescence (e.g., had developed a mature body concept and established close relationships with peers) and showed a continuous progression in the attainment of developmental tasks specific for young adulthood (e.g., establishing firm partnerships, developing a career). Emerging adults who continued to reside with their parents showed medium levels of developmental status during adolescence and very little progress during emerging adulthood. Late leavers and returners showed slightly lower levels of development in adolescence than those who continued to reside with their parents and a medium level of progression in emerging adulthood. Similarly, another longitudinal study illustrated that emerging adults in Belgium who lived independently had the highest levels in diverse developmental tasks (e.g., with respect to financial status or partnership status) and, consequently, did not make many gains in the following year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2167696813479783">Kins &amp; Beyers, 2010</xref>). Those residing with their parents made progress over time but still scored lower than age-mates living independently outside of the parental home. Those who moved back home preserved their previously attained developmental statuses.</p>

<title>The Impact of Romantic Involvement and Employment Status</title>
<p>Leaving home for marriage has continued to represent an important pattern for emerging adults in Southern Europe. For example, the majority of Italian and Spanish young people leave home late in order to marry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2167696813479783">Lanz &amp; Tagliabue, 2007</xref>). In contrast, for many emerging adults in Central and Northern Europe, a decoupling of marriage and leaving home is noticeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2167696813479783">de Jong Gierveld, Leifbroer, &amp; Beekink, 1991</xref>). Their interest in the institution of marriage is waning, and other lifestyles (e.g., cohabitation) are becoming increasingly popular.</p>
<p>Findings from studies on emerging adults living in the parental home seem to suggest that they pursue relationships with romantic partners less actively than do emerging adults who have left home. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2167696813479783">Lauterbach and Lüscher (1999)</xref> found that 60% of emerging adults in Germany living with their parents at age 30 did not have a partner. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2167696813479783">Seiffge-Krenke (2009)</xref> found that emerging adults still living at home reported lower rates of romantic activity from ages 16 to 25, whereas on-time leavers showed a strong increase in romantic activity during adolescence and emerging adulthood. Twenty-one percent of the variance in leaving home patterns was explained by earlier romantic activity. This lends support to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2167696813479783">Gray and Steinberg’s (1999)</xref> thesis that the development of romantic interest is inherently linked to the tasks of separation and individuation from the family.</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean region, particularly in Italy, Portugal, and Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2167696813479783">Cordon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2167696813479783">Rossi, 1997</xref>), it is common for two adult generations to live under the same roof. Only about 4% of women and 5% of men (ages 25–29) live alone in Italy, and housing facilities are only provided for couples that are going to marry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2167696813479783">Lanz &amp; Tagliabue, 2007</xref>). A serious romantic relationship is important for young Italians, and it sparks anticipation about leaving home and planning for the future. Thus, in the Mediterranean model, the presence of a romantic partner is a stimulus to begin the separation process. Italy has the highest rate of unmarried young people under the age of 34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2167696813479783">Rossi, 1997</xref>), and the late ages for marriage and the low fertility rates are of concern for Italian politicians and researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-2167696813479783">Scabini &amp; Cigoli, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-2167696813479783">Scabini, Marta, &amp; Lanz, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>As previously stated, the tendency to remain home longer is partly due to the difficulties involved in entering the currently competitive job market or unemployment. Several studies have highlighted the importance of full-time employment for home leaving. In comparing 11 European countries, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2167696813479783">Le Blanc and Wolff (2006)</xref> found that an emerging adult’s income was found to be about 9 times more important for leaving home than the parents’ financial resources. Having a job and earning a regular income were prerequisites for leaving home and a crucial step toward establishing a separate household outside the parental home. Whereas unemployed young people delay home leaving in Southern European countries, this is not necessarily the case for unemployed young people in Denmark, Germany, and Great Britain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2167696813479783">Aassve, Billari, Mazzuco, &amp; Ongaro, 2002</xref>), a finding that is thought to be related to better social welfare systems. Having a job may not necessarily enable residential independence, especially if earnings are insufficient to afford buying or renting a residence or if the job is unstable, thus potentially threatening solvency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2167696813479783">Cordon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2167696813479783">Lanz &amp; Tagliabue, 2007</xref>). Even if young people have a job, especially males following the Mediterranean model, they may continue to reside with their parents for a couple of years.</p>

<title>Linked Lives: What Have Parents Got to Do With It?</title>
<p>The task of achieving an adaptive balance between closeness and autonomy largely depends on the parents’ abilities to demonstrate respect for their child’s autonomy and provide warmth and support. In making the transition to young adulthood, the stability of the balance may be tested again, especially with respect to the developmental task of leaving home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-2167696813479783">Thornton, Orbuch, &amp; Axinn, 1995</xref>).</p>

<title>Theoretical Background for Linked Lives</title>
<p>Parents’ reactions to their child’s developmental needs play a decisive role in the course of the separation–individuation process during and after adolescence. Several theoretical frameworks deal with the changing relationships between parents and children and how they can influence a child’s path to becoming independent. The object relations theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2167696813479783">Mahler, Pine, &amp; Bergmann, 1975</xref>) highlights the importance of a separation between self and others, for example, the importance of interpersonal differentiation, distancing, and boundary formation for both mother and child. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2167696813479783">Blos (1967)</xref> posits that a second separation–individuation process occurs during adolescence, when the child again negotiates closeness and distance with his or her parents. Attachment theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2167696813479783">Bowlby, 1973</xref>) further highlights that the child needs a secure base in order to make progress toward becoming independent. Both attachment and object relations theories support the idea of the child’s progressively greater need for autonomy with age. A more recent conceptualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2167696813479783">Colarusso, 2000</xref>) focuses on separation–individuation processes in adulthood. In sum, many different theoretical positions have addressed how separation–individuation refers to a redefinition of the self and the relationship with parents.</p>

<title>The Impact of Attachment</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2167696813479783">Kenny (1987)</xref> conceptualized leaving home as being analogous to Ainsworth’s Strange Situation procedure, which activates the attachment system. The short- and long-term implications of individual differences in attachment representation when leaving for college, military service, or work have been examined in several studies with very consistent findings. Emerging adults with secure attachment representations report lower distress upon separation and describe their parents as being quite available to them, encouraging their independence. They also report an interest in interacting with their parents at reunions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2167696813479783">Kenny, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-2167696813479783">Scharf, Mayseless, &amp; Kivenson-Baron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-2167696813479783">Seiffge-Krenke, 2006</xref>). In contrast, preoccupied emerging adults who have left home report higher distress, more homesickness, and a more negative relationship with each parent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2167696813479783">Bernier, Larose, &amp; Whipple, 2005</xref>) than their peers with secure attachment presentations do. Yet, they also report having more contact with their parents after leaving home. This suggests that preoccupied emerging adults are so enmeshed in the relationship that they have difficulty assuming a healthy distance from their parents. This enmeshment with the parental relationship may partially explain why preoccupied individuals show nonnormative leaving home patterns (e.g., leave later or remain in the parental home; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-2167696813479783">Seiffge-Krenke, 2006</xref>), even when the relationship with the parents is antagonistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-2167696813479783">White &amp; Rogers, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-2167696813479783">Scharf, Mayseless, and Kivenson-Baron (2011)</xref> found that preoccupied individuals’ greater needs for assistance yet lower satisfaction with the support they received from others resulted in more severe adjustment problems, even several months after the transition.</p>
<p>Research has found no convincing differences between the dismissing and the secure groups, as emerging adults in both groups reported similarly positive relationships with their parents, especially their fathers, after leaving home. Although dismissing individuals seem to adapt well to the new environment, they have been found to portray themselves as individuated and self-sufficient, even if they are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2167696813479783">Bernier et al., 2005</xref>). In another study, dismissing males (not females) were found to function worse than those with secure attachment representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-2167696813479783">Scharf et al., 2004</xref>). Although the findings for individuals with dismissing attachment representations are more diverse, the consistent finding of poor adaptation of emerging adults with preoccupied attachment representation is of great concern.</p>

<title>Separation Anxiety and Inadequate Boundaries</title>
<p>Research on children and adolescents has confirmed that maternal separation anxiety decreases with the child’s growing competence and that mothers with a high level of separation anxiety do not support the child’s autonomy development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2167696813479783">Hock, Eberly, Bartle-Haring, Ellwanger, &amp; Widaman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2167696813479783">Hock &amp; Lutz, 1998</xref>). In the process of leave-taking from the parental home, the separation–individuation issue is again at stake.</p>
<p>Parents’ responses to separation-related issues, including their child’s residential independence, can be very diverse. Some parents may feel frustrated or even angry about their inability to maintain close proximity with their child; some may feel despondent about the imminent or current loss. Accordingly, mothers with separation anxiety have been found to show more depression and to engage in various activities aimed to maintain contact with their child. Some parents react by exercising psychological control, using manipulative strategies (e.g., guilt induction or love withdrawal) to keep their adult children in close proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2167696813479783">Barber, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-2167696813479783">Soenens &amp;Vansteenkiste, 2010</xref>). However, psychological control interferes with the child’s need for autonomy and predicts poor adjustment.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2167696813479783">Kins, Soenens, and Beyers (2011)</xref> found that parental exercise of psychological control on their emerging adult children functioned as an intervening mechanism between maternal separation anxiety and emerging adults’ pathological individuation–separation. Parents who are highly anxious about their children’s distancing use more dependency-oriented controlling strategies and engage in manipulative tactics to keep their emerging adult child emotionally and physically close. This suggests that separation anxiety is not restricted to parents of younger children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2167696813479783">Hock &amp; Lutz, 1998</xref>) and may also be present in parents with an emerging adult child. In addition, whereas separation anxiety and psychological control are often considered typical maternal characteristics, when fathers feel anxious about their child’s distancing, they pressure the child to stay in close proximity and thus contribute to emerging adult separation–individuation pathology. However, residential status is not related to pathology of the separation–individuation process. Hence, although these findings do not speak for a literal interpretation of separation as physical disengagement from parents, they do support Blos’s (1967) view of separation as an intrapsychic process.</p>
<p>Analyses of distinct types of inadequate boundary setting in families with youth further underline that there are two types of boundary violations which are particularly detrimental for the individuation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2167696813479783">Mayseless &amp; Scharf, 2009</xref>). Whereas guilt induction and psychological control were found to generate the lowest level of individuation and a striving for overindependence, a blurring of boundaries (e.g., when the parent views the child as an extension of the self) frequently resulted in overdependence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-2167696813479783">
<title>Too Much Support—Too Much Conflict?</title>
<p>Emerging adults’ pathways to residential independence are also mediated in different ways by support and conflict experienced in the family. In Western societies, an adolescent’s growing independence is marked by increased negotiating with his or her parents. Conflicts between parents and adolescents typically revolve around mundane issues, even when the parents are supportive of their child’s autonomy. Parents often struggle to find the right balance of warmth and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2167696813479783">Laursen &amp; Collins, 2009</xref>), and in some families, conflict levels can become quite high and represent a reason for home leaving. Women who recalled having experienced more strained family interactions were more likely to have left home before the age of 18 than women who reported having more harmonious family relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-2167696813479783">Stattin &amp; Magnusson, 1996</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-2167696813479783">Steen and Peterson (2003)</xref> found that young adults with aggressive parents distanced themselves from their parents by leaving home early.</p>
<p>Support is one of the most studied characteristics of parent–child relationships during the leaving home phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2167696813479783">Aquilino, 2006</xref>). When emerging adults remain at home, they continue to rely on their parents as a source of support and comfort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-2167696813479783">White &amp; Rogers, 1997</xref>). In fact, feeling supported is one of the principal reasons why some emerging adults stay home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2167696813479783">Lanz &amp; Tagliabue, 2007</xref>). In one study, a continuously high level of maternal and paternal support provided throughout a child’s adolescence and emerging adulthood was among the factors which predicted an emerging adult’s continued coresidence with parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-2167696813479783">Seiffge-Krenke, 2006</xref>). In these families, parents provided support for too long because they felt their child needed more support.</p>
<p>Given that adolescents’ and parents’ developmental changes and emerging adults’ and their parents’ developmental changes are closely intertwined, adjustments in parental support may be necessary when children traverse from adolescence to emerging adulthood. A reduction in parental support parallels the increasing investment the emerging adult child makes in romantic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2167696813479783">Lanz &amp; Tagliabue, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2167696813479783">Seiffge-Krenke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2167696813479783">Sneed et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that support and attachment functions of parents are transferred to peers and romantic partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2167696813479783">Mayseless, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>From Empty Nest to Crowded Nest: Parent–Adult Child Relationships and Living Arrangements</title>
<p>In Western countries sharing individualistic values, a major development in the life course is for parents to allow their children to establish themselves independently, and the success for both parties may be measured by a child’s ability to stand on his or her own. If children experience difficulties that prompt them to remain or return to the parental household, this may generate more family tension. In contrast, young adults living in a very comfortable home environment may not feel an urge to leave and function autonomously. Thus, it is of concern whether the restructuring of relationships in families with an emerging adult hinders his or her individual development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-2167696813479783">Scabini &amp; Cigoli, 1997</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section15-2167696813479783">
<title>Living With Nestlings</title>
<p>It has been argued that changes during the last couple of decades toward a more liberal family climate has made it possible for young people to obtain higher degrees of freedom and independence without leaving the parental home, for example, in France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2167696813479783">Galland, 1997</xref>), Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2167696813479783">Lanz &amp; Tagliabue, 2007</xref>), and Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2167696813479783">Dribe &amp; Stanfors, 2002</xref>). Further, coresidence has many financial advantages. For example, resources can be pooled, which is important in times of economic hardship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2167696813479783">DaVanzo &amp; Goldscheider, 1990</xref>). Most parents with a coresident emerging adult child report being satisfied with the living arrangements and describe mostly positive relationships with their child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813479783">Aquilino &amp; Supple, 1991</xref>). Coresident children also report good relationships with their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-2167696813479783">White &amp; Rogers, 1997</xref>) and experience a greater sense of well-being in the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2167696813479783">Lanz &amp; Tagliabue, 2007</xref>) than do those who have moved out.</p>
<p>Although emerging adults remaining at home tend to have a great deal of autonomy, some findings indicate that they feel restricted and treated like a child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-2167696813479783">White, 2002</xref>), have more conflict with parents and thus avoid them, and that their well-being may be compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2167696813479783">Flanagan, Schulenberg, &amp; Fuligni, 1993</xref>). Too much parental support may have negative consequences for the parents themselves. For example, German and North American parents feel emotionally and financially strained when their adult children are still “in the nest” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2167696813479783">Boyd &amp; Pryor, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2167696813479783">Seiffge-Krenke, 2010</xref>). Particularly mothers regard their emerging adult child’s living in the home as representing a financial burden and an increase in their own workload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2167696813479783">Dennerstein, Dudley, &amp; Guthrie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2167696813479783">Nave-Herz, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2167696813479783">Clemens and Axelson (1985)</xref> found that the older the child was, the less likely parents were happy with this arrangement.

<title>The Parent–Child Relationship After the Child Leaves Home</title>
<p>A number of studies have analyzed parent–child relationships after the child leaves home for college. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2167696813479783">Flanagan, Schulenberg, and Fuligni (1993)</xref> found that a child’s moving out of the parents’ home to study at college was associated with more child independence, parental support, and mutual respect between parents and children. Similarly, in a different cultural context, leaving home following graduation from high school in Israeli youth was linked with more positive and less conflictual parent–adult child relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-2167696813479783">Scharf, Mayseless, &amp; Kivenson-Baron, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Most findings suggest that leaving home is related to positive changes in relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2167696813479783">Aquilino, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813479783">Aquilino &amp; Supple, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2167696813479783">Lefkowitz, 2005</xref>). For example, compared to emerging adults who still live in the parental home, independently living emerging adults have better well-being and better relationships with parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2167696813479783">Buhl &amp; Lanz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2167696813479783">O’Connor, Allen, Bell, &amp; Hauser, 1996</xref>). Intensification of family relations is found more on the mother’s side than on the father’s. Sibling relationships also improve, which highlights the interrelatedness of family subsystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2167696813479783">Aquilino, 2006</xref>). Thus, leaving home normally inaugurates less interaction between parents and children, less dependence on parents for assistance, but more respect between parents and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-2167696813479783">White &amp; Rogers, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>An important dimension in understanding the nature of emerging adult–parent relationships that has received little attention concerns geographical distance. The findings are mixed. Some studies have shown that geographic proximity is associated with more frequent contact between parents and their children and more help provided to parents by their children and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2167696813479783">Aquilino, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2167696813479783">Dubas &amp; Petersen, 1996</xref>).

<title>Implications for Research, Policy, and Practice</title>
<p>The research summarized here has generated some important findings. First, social timetables that existed one or two decades ago have become less relevant, and the process of residential independence has become more gradual and varied. Second, families are often overburdened in extending support to emerging adult children.

<title>Residential Independence Cannot Be Equated With Autonomy</title>
<p>Emerging adulthood is a highly unstable life stage. This is even more so the case nowadays, as has been reflected in the development of diverse types of residential status for emerging adults over the past couple of decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2167696813479783">Arnett, 2000</xref>). In this review, a number of factors that play a role in the emerging adult’s leaving home process were discussed, such as features of the parental home, involvement in work and partnerships, and cultural values. Residential independence cannot be equated with autonomy, and residing with parents is not necessarily a sign of pathological separation individuation, as it is apparently more an inner process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2167696813479783">Blos, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2167696813479783">Colarusso, 2000</xref>). Although moving out of the parental home may be an outward manifestation of the inner process of separation, it is not the core element in this process. It is more important to analyze the reasons behind an emerging adult’s residential status. Young people who continue to live with their parents because they lack the financial resources to move out or because they feel parental pressure to stay home might create more problems. Overall, however, this review shows that most emerging adults are pleased with the level of autonomy they experience within the family. Most have egalitarian relationships with their parents that are characterized by reciprocal emotional independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2167696813479783">Cook &amp; Furstenberg, 2002</xref>). Under these circumstances, leaving the parental home is not regarded as an important marker of adulthood in the same the way as steady employment is. It is clearly possible to be a responsible adult while living together with the parents under one roof.</p>

<title>Future Challenges in Research</title>
<p>The research reviewed here has had some limitations that pose challenges for future work. A special shortcoming of the cohort analyses is that they were all based on quite old data. For example, the cohort comparison between German and Italian pathways to leaving home used data obtained from 1992 to 1995. Hence, many of these adults are likely to be parents of today’s emerging adults. Another shortcoming is that measures were frequently based on retrospective self-reports and did not include both parties’ perspectives. Parents and adult children can have strongly differing opinions about what is the right time for leaving home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2167696813479783">Seiffge-Krenke, 2010</xref>). Research work has also insufficiently explored interdependencies. It is possible, for example, that late leavers or young adults living in the parental home are not only “late starters” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-2167696813479783">Schulenberg &amp; Schon, 2012</xref>), but also come from families with precarious stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2167696813479783">Bynner, 2012</xref>) that often have limited resources. Because leaving home is no longer a clear-cut or linear process, we need more longitudinal research analyzing sociological and psychological factors that contribute to the reversal patterns of home leaving and the adaptive ways parents and emerging adults deal with them. Further, although gender differences have been found consistently in several studies, it is still unclear why daughters leave home earlier than sons do. It is, for example, possible, that females’ advanced intimacy development and their earlier romantic involvement are linked to earlier home leaving, as work status did not have an impact on females’ different leaving home patterns. More research is needed to explain the consistent gender differences. The possible moderating role of intrapsychic variables (e.g., self-concept, personality, or coping competence) and interpersonal variables (e.g., intimacy) also need to be explored.</p>
<p>Until recently, most research on leaving home patterns has been conducted in Western, industrialized regions of the world (e.g., Australia, Europe, and North America). However, much more remains to be learned about leaving the parental home in non-Western cultures. The favoring of individualistic criteria (e.g., self-focus, identity exploration, and independent decision making) as markers for the transition may only prevail in cultures where marriage can been postponed and individualism is valued. In more collectivistic-oriented cultures (e.g., in some Asian and Middle Eastern countries), in which interdependence with the family is very important and the opportunity to explore romantic relationships often limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2167696813479783">Nelson &amp; Chen, 2007</xref>), marriage, securing employment, and becoming financially independent may be more important criteria for departure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2167696813479783">Arnett, 2000</xref>). Yet, parents and emerging adults in these cultures may disagree more strongly about the criteria for leaving home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2167696813479783">Mayseless &amp; Scharf, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2167696813479783">Nelson et al., 2007</xref>). It is important to understand the criteria for autonomy and departure as they relate to the specific cultural context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2167696813479783">Kagitcibasi, 2005</xref>), especially because so many Western societies have become multicultural, often with many subpopulations of families that focus on more traditional or other criteria for leaving home. Given this increasing cultural diversity in Europe and North America, cross-cultural studies may further an understanding of how different value orientations influence this significant life course transition, also in mixed-culture societies.</p>

<title>Linked Lives: Some Suggestions for Prevention and Intervention</title>
<p>In this review, I have demonstrated that the unlinking of traditional markers (e.g., marriage and, to a lesser extent, job status) for residential independence poses new challenges for many emerging adults in Western societies with respect to self-regulation. A consistent finding has been that emerging adults with low developmental status (e.g., showing incomplete completion of developmental tasks such as securing full-time employment or establishing firm partnerships) and preoccupied attachment representations have more difficulties in making the transition to residential independence. This suggests that prevention and intervention strategies should aim to strengthen young people’s skills in dealing with age-dependent tasks while providing a secure base for exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2167696813479783">Settersten &amp; Ray, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A child’s leaving home for the first time can activate his or her need for closeness and support, but also engender parents’ separation anxieties. The question of how parents struggle with giving the right amount of support has been particularly raised in research investigating emerging adults in Mediterranean regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2167696813479783">Cherlin et al., 1997</xref>). However, this issue should also be of concern for counselors working with families with emerging adult children in other cultural constellations. Counselors should be aware of the central role that fathers and mothers play in shaping the transition to residential independence. In this regard, particularly fathers may function as a model of a “close enough” parent who allows and respects separation.</p>
<p>In general, there has been little work on the parenting styles for parents with emerging adult children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2167696813479783">Proulx &amp; Helms, 2008</xref>). However, one study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2167696813479783">Nelson, Padilla-Walker, Christensen, Evans, and Carroll (2011)</xref> revealed several distinctive clusters of parenting styles. A small percentage of parents (11–17%) were controlling and uninvolved, but the largest cluster (40%) showed authoritative parenting. However, because of the negative effects of controlling behavior caused by separation anxiety of the parents during the leaving home process, parenting styles need to be researched more thoroughly and relevant findings integrated into working with troubled families.</p>
<p>There is an urgent need to more examine how mothers and fathers in different cultures deal with their child’s departure, so that culture-appropriate prevention and intervention strategies are developed and implemented. With average life expectancies exceeding 75 years, the longest period of parent–child relationships today takes place in the adult years for both generations. Although research summarized in this article suggests that in Western cultures, coresiding is not necessarily characterized by dissatisfaction and conflict between parents and emerging adult children, there is evidence that it impacts parents’ marital relationships and, in particular, the mother’s health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2167696813479783">Dennerstein et al., 2002</xref>). Yet, the research is unbalanced: There is much research on parental support, but little on the support provided by emerging adults to their parents. This may have reinforced a negative stereotype of emerging adult children as being needy (<italic>They just won’t grow up</italic>). In this regard, it may be argued that from a life course perspective, it may seem reasonable to suggest that parents, who nowadays can expect to live longer, should care longer for their children, because their children will have to care longer for them later. Intergenerational solidarity, which has a long tradition in many collectivistic cultures, has been increasingly regarded as an important value in individualistic cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2167696813479783">Bengtson, 2001</xref>). In addition, it is important to acknowledge that the family life cycle is no longer a fixed set of developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2167696813479783">Settersten, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-2167696813479783">White, 1994</xref>) and that change and reversal occur in many family life stages. The complex, intergenerational nature of family living arrangements today requires more social debate about the increasing need for young people to delay the decision to leave home and the ways parents can be supported in their longer parenting period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2167696813479783">Cobb-Clark, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>A Final Comment</title>
<p>Although high parental support (or nontransferable material resources; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2167696813479783">de Jong Gierveld et al., 1991</xref>) may be one reason for delayed home leaving, other factors (e.g., economic hardships, weak social welfare structures, poor housing market conditions, etc.) can contribute to delayed home leaving. Social policy analysts may not want to hear this, but delayed departure clearly has significant and problematic consequences. For one, when young people stay home into their 30s, they are less likely to marry and have children. The drop in birthrates is endangering the long-term vitality of social security systems of many countries (e.g., Greece, Italy, Japan, and Spain). The currently bleak economic and occupational perspectives for young people in many countries make it hard to imagine that the trend toward delayed home leaving will be reversed in the near future.</p>
