<abstract>
<p>The existing literature on the political economy of taxation explores how the mobility of firms affects the ability of governments to tax capital. In this article the author tests the relationship between corporate tax rates and multinational investment decisions in advanced, industrialized economies. He utilizes a time-series cross-sectional general error correction model to explore the impact of corporate taxation rates and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in up to 19 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development economies from 1980 to 2000. To mitigate potential endogeneity problems, the author’s identification strategy takes advantage of delays between the passage of tax reductions and the implementation of these policies. The author finds no relationship between corporate tax rates and flows of foreign direct investment. This finding has implications on the link between globalization and domestic politics.</p>

<p>Influential political science scholarship, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010414011428594">Levi (1988)</xref>, shows that raising revenue is central to governance. Revenue generation is technically complicated, has major intended and unintended distributional consequences, and has serious impacts on economic activity. Recent studies discussed in the next section have examined if the increasing mobility of capital limits the ability of states to raise revenue from capital, potentially generating a “race to the bottom” in taxation.</p>
<p>In this article I address the relationship between rates of capital taxation and one form of international capital, foreign direct investment (FDI). FDI is a less liquid form of capital where a company invests in a foreign country and asserts some degree of control over the enterprise. For governments attempting to generate jobs and technological spillovers, attracting this form of capital can have serious implications for political survival. Do cutting corporate taxes affect flows of FDI?</p>
<p>This question is of substantive importance beyond studies of tax competition. More broadly, does globalization constrain the state in ways that generate tremendous costs for governments raising rates of taxation? Do the heated rhetorical battles between politicians over tax policy represent real choices over the raising revenue at the expense of driving away productive capital?</p>
<p>My empirical analysis of the relationship between FDI inflows and tax rates in 19 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries from 1980 to 2000 suggests the answer to both questions is no. Controlling for the nonstationary aspect of data and using a unique identification strategy based on lags in implementation of tax policy yields a null result. Tax policy has no discernable impact on FDI flows. Although null results (or any empirical result) can lead to criticisms of operationalization, model choice, and omitted variables, I show that this nonrelationship is remarkably robust. Sweeping tax reforms are not associated with substantial changes in FDI flows.</p>
<p>The outline of this article is as follows. In the second section I review the existing literature on capital taxation and FDI, and the third section introduces data on three types of corporate tax rates. In the fourth section I analyze how tax policy changes affect FDI flows in up to 19 OECD countries from 1980 to 2000. The fifth section concludes.</p>
<sec id="section1-0010414011428594">
<title>Capital Taxation and FDI</title>
<p>In this article I address the relationship between corporate taxation and FDI. Understanding this relationship is central to studies of tax competition and specifically addresses an implicit assumption of numerous studies on taxation. For example, an important literature in political science and public policy explores the “race to the bottom” in tax rates, environmental policy, and business regulations. Although most political scientists do not endorse a complete loss of autonomy in tax policy, influential works such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414011428594">Andrews (1994)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414011428594">Cerny (1990)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0010414011428594">Kurzer (1993)</xref> argue that global markets apply intense pressure on governments to lower levels of capital taxation and government spending.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0010414011428594">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Numerous political scientists have assumed that taxes affect mobile capital, yet this does not necessarily lead to a race to the bottom. A number of recent articles explore how partisanship and domestic political institutions affect tax policy in an era of global capital flows. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010414011428594">Basinger and Hallerberg (2004)</xref> determine that although countries are sensitive to the tax policy changes of competitor countries, a government’s ability to alter tax policy is tempered by its institutional environment and the ideology of its core constituents. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414011428594">Hays (2003)</xref> shows that there is a convergence of effective tax rates in the middle. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010414011428594">Plümper, Troeger, and Winner (2009)</xref> develop a formal model that includes labor taxation and concerns about tax fairness. These works argue that even in an era of global capital flows, domestic politics still matter and often dominate tax rate setting.</p>
<p>Thus, political scientists have argued that domestic politics limit tax competition. An alternative explanation suggests that there simply are not market pressures for lower taxes. Levels of corporate taxation may not be significant determinants of FDI inflows. Although this seems initially unlikely, political scientists such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010414011428594">Garrett (1998b)</xref> contend that larger governments, financed by high tax rates, supply market enhancing public goods. If these high tax rates provide for an educated workforce, a well-developed infrastructure, or other public goods, multinational corporations may choose high tax countries rather than low tax countries as an investment location.</p>
<p>Although ignoring the provision of public goods is problematic for the race to the bottom thesis, there is a more serious theoretical flaw in this argument. The theoretical literature on the micro determinants of FDI inflows is based on models of market imperfections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414011428594">Aliber, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414011428594">Caves, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414011428594">Dunning, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414011428594">Hymer, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414011428594">Kindleberger, 1969</xref>). Many of the models based on market imperfections find that tax rates are a minor determinant of FDI inflows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0010414011428594">Markusen, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>These country-level studies do not negate the potential impact of taxes on firm activity, and a number of firm-level studies have documented how taxes shape economic activity. Although tax policy is not the primary determinant of multinationals’ decisions, tax policy can affect FDI inflows.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0010414011428594">2</xref></sup> Using a cross-sectional research design, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414011428594">Altshuler, Grubert, and Newlon (2001)</xref> estimate the impact of tax rates on U.S. manufacturing investment in 1984 and 1992. They discover that tax rates have a significant impact on multinational investments, and this relationship becomes stronger over time (elasticity of 1.5 in 1984 and 3 in 1992). In a review of the empirical studies on capital taxation and FDI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010414011428594">Hines (1999)</xref> concludes that tax rates affect the level and location of FDI. And according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010414011428594">Mutti (2003)</xref>, corporate tax rates have a strong impact on manufacturing multinationals’ decisions. A 1% decrease in the cost of capital leads to a 3% increase in production.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0010414011428594">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>These firm-level studies leave a number of questions unanswered. First, numerous project explore how taxes affect multinational production, not necessarily investment decisions. Second, how large is the aggregate impact of tax policy on FDI flows? For self-interested politicians, can reductions in corporate taxes lead to tangible benefits that can be communicated to voters? Third, given that tax policy is not exogenous, how can we be assured that tax rates are not proxies for other factors that lead to a business friendly environment?</p>
<p>In this article, I focus on country-level data with the goal of exploring the dynamic between tax policy changes and FDI inflows in a set of advanced, industrialized economies. Empirically testing this argument is an important step for the literature on the relationship between globalization and the welfare state. Influential works such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0010414011428594">Swank and Steinmo (2002)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414011428594">Hays (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010414011428594">Basinger and Hallerberg (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010414011428594">Franzese and Hays (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0010414011428594">Swank (2006)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010414011428594">Plümper et al. (2009)</xref> all focus on the national level, modeling the determinants of tax policy decisions. Exploring the impact of these tax policies on FDI can have important implications for our understanding of the relationship between globalization and government autonomy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, much of the existing literature on taxes and FDI has failed to appropriately control for the nonstationary nature of the time series.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0010414011428594">4</xref></sup> This is surprising since the nonstationary problem was pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414011428594">Devereux and Freeman (1995</xref>, p. 92), criticizing an influential article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414011428594">Slemrod (1990)</xref>:
<disp-quote><p>[T]hese studies are all rendered problematic by the poor quality of the data and by the strong upward trend of FDI over the estimation period. For example, the inclusion of other strongly trended values (in particular the unemployment rate) eliminated the effect of taxes in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414011428594">Slemrod (1990)</xref>.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>They conclude that standard regressions techniques could find a spurious relationship between reductions in tax rates and increases in FDI.</p>
<p>In this article I have designed my empirical tests to analyze the relationship between corporate tax rates and overall FDI inflows, taking into account the complex structure of my data. Specifically, I test the relationship between changes in corporate tax rates and changes in the level of FDI inflows.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0010414011428594">
<title>Data</title>
<p>Measuring tax rates placed on multinational corporations is not a straightforward matter. Some scholars argue that average or maximum statutory tax rates (the published corporate tax rates) are a reliable source of multinational taxation levels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0010414011428594">5</xref></sup> Even though multinationals often negotiate lower levels of taxation, statutory tax rates provide the status quo from which taxes are negotiated. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010414011428594">Mutti (2003)</xref> finds that these statutory tax rates influence the jurisdiction in which a firm declares its taxable income.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0010414011428594">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although statutory tax could influence multinational activity, many scholars find that these tax rates are a crude measure of the costs imposed on multinationals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010414011428594">Mintz (2001)</xref> argues that average tax rates are inappropriate for analyzing the tax liabilities of U.S. multinationals for a number of reasons and recommends using the effective marginal tax rate (EMTR). This tax rate measures the marginal taxation on an additional dollar of pretax profit. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414011428594">Devereux and Griffith (2003)</xref> develop a new measure, the effective average tax rate (EATR), which is the ratio of taxes paid to pretax profit.</p>
<p>Given all these contrary theories, the debate on the appropriate measure of calculating corporate tax rates is unsettled. Since my article is agnostic as to what is the most appropriate measure of corporate taxes, I present an empirical analysis the relationship between the two most standard measures of corporate tax rates, statutory and EMTRs, but I note that my empirical results are robust using EATRs as the dependent variable.</p>
<p>Do low-tax countries attract higher levels of FDI inflows? To test the impact of tax policy and FDI inflows, I built a number of models using net FDI inflows as a percentage of GDP from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414011428594">World Bank (2004)</xref> World Development Indicators.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0010414011428594">7</xref></sup> My core model utilizes a number of standard control variables from the FDI literature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0010414011428594">8</xref></sup> These models including the size of the domestic market (log of population), the level of economic development (log of GDP per capita), the level of international trade (exports plus imports divided by GDP), and the level of host country wages (log of average manufacturing wage).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0010414011428594">9</xref></sup> I include descriptive statistics and sources for these data in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010414011428594">appendix</xref>. Unfortunately, wage data limit the sample to 16 countries, from the maximum of 19 OECD countries. My empirical analysis is consistent across both samples, thus I present the regressions including wage data. Moreover, these results are robust to alternative measures of these core variables, including log of GDP for market size and tariffs as a percentage of government revenue for level of international trade.</p>
<p>Beyond these country-level factors, I include a number of international variables. One variable measures the average level of FDI inflows for the other <italic>N</italic> – 1 OECD countries at time t (<italic>world FDI</italic>). For example, Ireland’s <italic>world FDI</italic> in 1995 is the mean of the 18 other countries’ FDI inflows in 1995. This variable captures the worldwide increase in FDI inflows over time. For example, in the boom years of the mid-1990s, multinationals from the United States and Europe were greatly expanding their production abroad in multiple OECD and non-OECD countries. I expect there to be a positive relationship between a country’s success in attracting FDI inflows (the dependent variable) and increases in FDI inflows in other countries.</p>
<p>Second, in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010414011428594">Basinger and Hallerberg (2004)</xref>, I include a measure of the world average tax rate and the average tax rate change of all other <italic>N</italic> – 1 countries, calculated the same as the world average FDI inflows (<italic>world tax</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0010414011428594">10</xref></sup> The race to the bottom thesis would predict that the relative relationship between a country’s own tax rates and the other <italic>N</italic> − 1 countries should affect FDI inflows. Lower taxes in other <italic>N</italic> − 1 countries, holding all other factors constant, should reduce a country’s ability to attract FDI. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010414011428594">Basinger and Hallerberg (2004)</xref>, I estimated these models using different operationalization of the <italic>world tax</italic>, including a number of different weighting schemes. This includes a <italic>world tax</italic> control that is weighted by the size of the domestic market, the level of FDI inflows, or the average tax rate of all bordering countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0010414011428594">11</xref></sup> All of these different specifications have little impact on the key independent variables, tax rates and tax rate changes.</p>
<p>It is important to note that a number of other national-level factors have a considerable impact on FDI inflows. The first of these, the level of political risk, is tremendously important to investments in developing countries. The threat of expropriation, contract frustration, and corruption all reduce the amount of investment flowing into high-risk countries. Fortunately for this study (and for investors), the countries of the OECD, though far from homogenous, are the lowest risk countries in the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0010414011428594">12</xref></sup> Another potential factor that can drive FDI is the existence of high levels of natural resources. However, few of the economies in the OECD are dominated by natural resource investment. In the empirical analysis section, I demonstrate that the results are robust to the inclusion of other control variables, different lag structures, and alternative estimation techniques and country fixed effects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0010414011428594">
<title>Empirical Analysis</title>
<p>In this article I empirically assess the impact of corporate tax rate changes on FDI inflows into OECD countries. Studying tax competition for FDI in the OECD has three distinct advantages. First, data quality problems plague global time-series cross-sectional studies, but these data quality problems are much less acute in OECD countries. Second, focusing only on OECD countries allows me to minimize a number of policy and institutional differences that can affect FDI inflows. OECD countries tend to have democratic governments, open policies toward FDI, strong property rights protections and are members of bilateral and multilateral institutions that protect foreign direct investors. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010414011428594">Blonigen and Miao (2005)</xref> argues that there are significant differences between the determinants of FDI into OECD and non-OECD countries. In this study, I focus on the how taxes affect FDI into OECD countries and leave investigation of taxes and FDI into non-OECD countries for future research.</p>
<p>One problem with the analysis of the relationship between corporate tax rates and FDI flows is that trends of decreasing tax rates and increasing FDI flows over time raise the concern that the dependent variable and the key independent variable are nonstationary. With statutory and effective tax rates revealing a downward trend and an explosion in FDI inflows in the mid-1990s, this could lead us to the spurious conclusion that reductions in tax rates lead to higher levels of FDI inflows. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414011428594">Im, Pesaran, and Shin (2003)</xref> test for nonstationarity for both the dependent variable and statutory tax rates confirm that these variables are nonstationary and not cointegrated. Consequently, ordinary least squares estimates are most likely biased and inconsistent.</p>
<p>To empirically test the relationship between national corporate tax rates and FDI inflows, I employ an error correction model in the following form:</p>

<p>I model deviations from past FDI inflows as a function of the levels of variable X at t-1 and changes in X from t-1 to t. For example, I model the change in FDI in Sweden from 1990 to 1991 using the Swedish corporate tax rate in 1990 and the change in the level of taxes from 1990 to 1991.</p>
<p>I estimate four models on the relationship between taxes on FDI and present the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414011428594">Table 1</xref>. In the first two models I test how the level and changes in statutory tax rates affect FDI flows. Model 1 includes controls for the level of development, domestic wages, trade, population, and world FDI flows. Model 2 includes country fixed effects. This second model is an important robustness test since there are a number of country-specific factors that could influence FDI, such as geographic location or levels of human capital. In Models 3 and 4 I perform the same test but this time using EMTR as the tax rate variable. Although there are some similarities across the random effects and fixed effects models, including the insignificance of the tax rate variables, a simple comparison of coefficients on the control variables, and a formal Hausman specification test indicates the random effects model is inappropriate. There are country-specific factors that affect FDI inflows that are not captured in the random effects models. The following discussion focuses on the fixed effects results.</p>

<p>A simple interpretation of error correction models is as follows. The coefficient on the level variables is the long-run relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables, and the change variables are the short-term adjustment. In all specifications the past level of FDI inflows is negative and statistically significant. These results are interpreted as an error correction, where we can see patterns of FDI inflows as rather volatile with countries reverting to their equilibrium FDI inflows.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0010414011428594">13</xref></sup> Years of above-average FDI booms are followed with a return to equilibrium levels.</p>
<p>The control variables are generally significant and have the expected signs. Wealthier countries and countries with high and growing levels of trade are all associated with more FDI inflows. Countries with increasing manufacturing wages lead to decreases in FDI flows. Years when there are high and growing levels of FDI are associated with more FDI inflows.</p>
<p>The only control variable that is not clearly consistent with the existing FDI literature is the negative sign on the population variable. Countries with larger populations are associated with lower levels of FDI. There are two explanations for this result. First, the dependent variable is FDI/GDP. Countries with larger populations should have a larger denominator. Second, this finding is most likely driven by the success of a number of small countries in attracting FDI, such as Ireland, and the low levels of FDI by large countries such as Germany and Japan. Thus, these results are consistent with our understanding of FDI patterns in the OECD.</p>
<p>There is little evidence that an individual country’s level or change in capital taxation has any impact on FDI inflows.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0010414011428594">14</xref></sup> Although the level of statutory tax rates is weakly significant at the .1 level, indicating a modest long-run relationship between FDI and taxes, this result is not robust across specifications. Also, there is no evidence in any specification that passing tax rate reforms (Δ<italic>tax rate</italic>) has any immediate impact on FDI flows.</p>
<p>Although <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414011428594">Table 1</xref> provides preliminary evidence for the lack of a clear relationship between tax changes and FDI flows, one possible concern is that it suffers from omitted variables. Other variables such as capital endowments and capital controls could affect FDI inflows. Countries with fewer capital controls and less domestic capital would attract more FDI.</p>
<p>I tested the robustness of these findings in Models 1–4. First, I included control variables including measures of capital controls and the capital endowments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0010414011428594">15</xref></sup> I also included measures of world tax rate averages and changes as described earlier. The empirical results are robust to these alternative specifications.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0010414011428594">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>A second potential criticism is that the results may be driven by the empirical specification or the estimation strategy. First, I estimate the models from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414011428594">Table 1</xref> with a number of alternative lag structures and find that tax rates have no impact on FDI inflows.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0010414011428594">17</xref></sup> Second I estimate these models using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414011428594">Arellano and Bond (1991)</xref> modeling strategy to deal with dynamic panels. This method, increasingly popular in political science, has been applied to nonstationary time series and makes no distributive assumptions about the residuals. I estimate Model 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414011428594">Table 1</xref> using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414011428594">Arellano and Bond (1991)</xref> dynamic panel method, which is a general method of moments estimator that utilizes a lagged dependent variable and first differences in exogenous variables with robust standard errors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0010414011428594">18</xref></sup> My empirical results on the null relationship between tax rates and FDI inflows are robust to this alternative estimation method.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0010414011428594">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Third, these results could be driven by outliers or other omitted variables. I estimate the core model (Model 2) by dropping one country at a time. I also estimate Model 2 without outlier countries of Ireland (high FDI flows) and Japan and Germany (both low FDI flows). I also include controls for government consumption spending as a percentage of GDP,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0010414011428594">20</xref></sup> as a control for provision of public goods, and controls for the government partisanship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0010414011428594">21</xref></sup> These robustness tests lead to the same substantive conclusion. Tax rate changes have no impact on FDI flows.</p>
<p>The final and perhaps most important possible criticism of this research design strategy is that even if I find tax rates have no impact on observed changes in FDI inflows, taxes could still affect FDI flows. Politicians could appropriately anticipate the need to lower corporate taxes when their country is not a competitive FDI location (e.g., when other countries lower their tax rates) and adjust taxes before there is an observed reduction in FDI inflows. If countries perfectly alter their tax rates to compensate for their disadvantages, we would observe a tax rate change and no changes in the pattern of FDI. In equilibrium, tax rates are important for FDI, yet there is no observable relationship between taxes and FDI flows.</p>
<p>Thus, it is theoretically possible that taxes affect FDI, but in equilibrium we would not observe changes in taxes affecting FDI flows. Yet influential public finance scholars, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010414011428594">Bucovetsky (1991)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010414011428594">Wilson (1991)</xref>, model tax competition where we do observe capital flow changes in equilibrium. Empirically, the majority of the firm-level (micro) and country-level (macro) studies of taxation and FDI test this relationship and find capital flows responding to tax rates. I show that after controlling for the nonstationary, there is no observable impact of taxes on FDI.</p>
<p>There are also political reasons why we should observe FDI responding to tax rates, if tax rates have a major impact on investment decisions. First, tax policy changes are relatively rare events, where less than 18% of our observations are corporate tax policy reductions. Although these rare events are temporally clustered, there is no year in our data set when the majority of countries (10 of 19) cut corporate taxes in the same year. Even in the wake the famous 1986 tax reform in the United States, only three other countries reduced taxes in 1986 with another six following in 1987, and many important “competitor” countries did not respond to U.S. tax cuts. Although I think there is considerable evidence that tax policy reform is being diffused across countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0010414011428594">Swank, 2006</xref>), the variation in country responses should allow us to evaluate the relationship between tax rates and FDI.</p>
<p>There are two other important theoretical reasons why we would expect that even with forward-looking policy makers, governments would fail to enact tax policies in response to competitors that equalizes FDI flows. For example, when there is uncertainty about the responsiveness of capital to taxation or the productivity of these investments, governments will enact smaller corrective policies than if there were perfect information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010414011428594">Auerbach &amp; Hines, 2001</xref>). Also, even under full information, political institutions temper the ability of governments to respond to these external shocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010414011428594">Basinger &amp; Hallerberg, 2004</xref>). Politicians in a country such as Germany may want to pass labor market reforms and corporate tax policy reductions to remain competitive in the global economy, yet the number of veto players makes any policy reform difficult. In both cases, we expect governments to either delay tax reform or enact insufficiently small tax cuts to maintain the equilibrium amount of investment. If taxes matter to firms, we should still expect to observe taxes to affect inflows of FDI.</p>
<p>Although this theoretical defense of my research design strategy may be of comfort to some scholars, skeptical readers may still have concerns about the endogeneity of tax setting. Politicians enact tax laws when their countries are becoming less competitive in attracting international capital. One solution to this problem is to find an instrument for tax changes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0010414011428594">22</xref></sup> Thus, my final set of empirical tests mitigates this endogeneity problem by taking advantage of the timing of tax policy changes.</p>
<p>My research design is to explore the “out-of-equilibrium” relationship between tax rates and FDI, specifically examining the cases where countries have made the choice to reduce corporate taxes, but these taxes are not immediately implemented. The logic is relatively straightforward. If countries pass tax reduction because of competitive tax pressures, yet the implementation of these tax cuts is delayed, we should expect a temporary reduction in FDI.</p>
<p>Theoretically, forward-looking investors could respond to future tax cuts by investing before the tax cuts are enacted. Yet one concern for investors is how, when, and if these tax cuts will be implemented. One clear example of this uncertainty is documented in South Korea’s delay in the implementation of corporate tax reforms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0010414011428594">23</xref></sup> If foreign investors are responding to tax rate changes, we would expect these responses to be based on more complete information of the formal implementation of the new tax policy and ultimately how this would change the firm’s tax liability. Thus, this delay in implementation of tax reform provides a brief window to examine out-of-equilibrium tax rates.</p>
<p>A new data set from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010414011428594">Jensen and Lindstädt (in press)</xref> uses a number of academic and media sources to code major tax policy reforms in OECD countries from 1980 to 2000. Although many countries pass corporate tax reduction legislation that is enacted either immediately or in the following year, many other countries have tax policy changes that are delayed or phased in over a number of years. In some cases rate changes can also be the result of existing tax laws expiring and tax rates reverting back to previous rates. It is during this period, after a tax law is passed yet before it is fully enacted, that we should expect a reduction in FDI inflows. Then once the tax cut is enacted, FDI flows should increase back to equilibrium levels. Thus, if there is no reduction in FDI flows in the period between the passing of a tax law and the implementation, and the implementation of a rate cut does not increase FDI, we have yet more evidence on the lack of relationship between taxes and FDI.</p>
<p>Examining the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010414011428594">Jensen and Lindstädt (in press)</xref> data, there are 53 cases of clear statutory rate reductions, 29 of which were implemented in either year t or t-1 of a tax law. Thus, in 29 cases countries passed a tax law and implemented the tax rate cut within a year. But in 24 cases, tax rates were implemented more than a year after the tax law was passed, such as Ireland’s passage of tax laws in 1998 that were first implemented in 2003 and Canada’s phasing in of tax reductions over a couple of years. Thus, if the endogenous tax policy reforms made by governments are not implemented immediately, the error correction strategy can examine the dynamic effects of changing tax policy. Tax rates may be endogenously determined, but the delay in the implementation provides a unique identification strategy.</p>
<p>I present the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414011428594">Table 2</xref> using the same controls and method as Model 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414011428594">Table 1</xref>, but I replace Δ<italic>tax rate</italic> with dummy variables in Models 5 and 6. In Model 5 I include the dummy for a major tax legislation change that reduces corporate tax rates (<italic>tax law passed</italic>) as the key independent variable. This is not a direct test of any of the hypotheses in this article, but it shows that the previous results on changes in tax <italic>rates</italic> having no effect on FDI also hold for when we examine when corporate tax <italic>laws</italic> are passed.</p>

<p>Yet the key contribution of using these data on the passage of tax laws is to use them as an identification strategy to confront the problem that tax rates are endogenously determined. As I note earlier, although many governments pass tax laws that are immediately implemented or are implemented the following year, there are 24 cases of major delays in the implementation of tax rate changes. In Models 6, 7, and 8 I take advantage of the delay in the implementation of tax rate changes in a number of ways.</p>
<p>In Model 6 I include a dummy variable for the 24 tax rate changes that occur without a tax law being passed in year t or t-1 (<italic>tax law enacted</italic>). These rate changes should be associated with an increase in FDI inflows. The logic goes as follows: Imagine a country passes a law cutting corporate taxes in response to corporate tax cuts in other competitor countries, yet the enactment of these rate changes are delayed 3 years, leading to a brief reduction in FDI inflows. When these rate changes are finally enacted, FDI inflows recover. My empirical analysis, the error correction model, is designed to detect these changing patterns of FDI. We should expect an increase (recovery) in FDI inflows after the tax policy is implemented. I find no evidence that these tax rate changes have any effect on FDI.</p>
<p>I perform similar tests in Models 7 and 8, using continuous variables for delayed rate changes. Models 7 and 8 include the size of the statutory tax rate change or EMTR rate change (<italic>delayed rate cut</italic>) where the variable is equal to the total size of the rate cut for cases of tax cuts that are not coupled with tax legislation, and all other cases are coded as zero. Thus, country-years of no tax cuts or tax laws that are implemented in years t or t-1 are coded as zero. Only cases of delayed rate cuts are nonzero.</p>
<p>To illustrate, we can again imagine a country passes a law to reduce corporate taxes to stay competitive, say a −10% tax change, but this law is not enacted for 3 years. We would expect a short-term reduction in FDI flows, yet these flows should recover after the tax reduction. Thus, negative rate changes should be associated with higher FDI flows.</p>
<p>For cases of delayed rate changes, the size of these rate changes is similar to the other tax rate changes, where statutory rates were reduced an average of 2.91% and EMTR was reduced an average of 1.3%. The expectations on the signs of these variables should be the opposite of the dichotomous variable in Model 6. Large rate changes should be associated with an increase (recovery) in FDI flows. I find no evidence that these tax rate changes were associated with changes in FDI.</p>
<p>In total, I find no systematic relationship between tax policy changes and FDI flows. Yet defending null results can be difficult, where criticisms on the inclusion of control variables or endogeneity can lead to identification concerns. My analysis includes theory-driven control variables, country fixed effects along with a number of robustness tests. In a series of additional tests, I examined the conditional relationship between tax policy reform and FDI flows. For example, in one set of tests I examined if reduction in tax rates had an impact on FDI when a country’s rates are well above the average of other OECD countries. I also tested if tax rates are conditional on public goods provisions, where countries with high tax rates are less likely to be punished by markets if taxation is used for the provision of public goods. Finally, I tested for conditional effects, where the partisanship of the government enacting the tax reform could have different effects on the FDI inflows. In all cases, FDI flows were not responsive to tax policy reforms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0010414011428594">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Does this mean that taxation has no impact on FDI flows? Corporate tax rates may have little meaning where firms negotiate special tax incentives with host governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010414011428594">Li, 2006</xref>). Equally important, although taxes may have little impact on investment decisions, they may shape where firms declare profits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414011428594">Hines, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0010414011428594">Peralta, Wauthy, &amp; van Ypersele, 2006</xref>). This article focuses on national-level tax rates and FDI inflows, and thus I am far from concluding that tax policy does not matter to firms.</p>
<p>Future research would ideally include a broader set of countries, including those in the developing world, and include an analysis of tax rates at the level of the firm. Yet the purpose of this article is to explore an assumption on the relationship between taxation and FDI that exists in a number of influential articles on taxation in the OECD. The substantive conclusion of this article is that if globalization pressures the welfare state, it is not through the aggregate flows of foreign directly investment. The universe of national-level tax policy reforms in the OECD on average has no impact on flows of FDI. I leave the analysis of firm-specific taxation and explorations of this question beyond the developed world for future research.</p>

<sec id="section4-0010414011428594">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The mantra that governments must remain competitive in the global marketplace by slashing levels of corporate taxation permeates public policy debates and has influenced academic scholarship. To date, few studies have systematically analyzed the impact of lowering levels of corporate taxation on changes in FDI inflows. Utilizing dynamic tests for up to 19 OECD countries from 1980 to 2000 and isolating the impact of time-varying factors on FDI inflows, I find no empirical relationship between corporate taxation and FDI inflows. Using a number of different tax rate variables, control variables, and estimation techniques, I find no relationship between corporate tax rate changes and FDI flows. This null results remains even after using delayed tax rate changes as an identification strategy to mitigate endogeneity concerns.</p>
<p>This result has the potential to drive the tax policy literature and the broader literature on globalization and the states in a slightly different direction. Rather than explaining the lack of the race to the bottom by exploring how domestic politics affect tax policy, we can focus on a different question. Why, given the lack of evidence of corporate taxation affecting FDI flows, are there serious attempts at tax policy reform in many OECE countries, often in the name of global competitiveness?</p>
<p>One theory is that tax reductions are meaningful for some powerful interest groups and globalization is simply the marketing tool used to push for these reforms. Politicians continue to pursue their partisan preferences, only changing the public rhetoric and justification for their tax decisions. Thus, right governments, already prone to cut corporate taxes, may simply change their rhetoric to include globalization for the motivation for tax cuts.</p>
<p>Yet there is at least one other possibility. A recent survey in the United States found that 70% of Americans believe that taxes are “very important” for the location decisions of firms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0010414011428594">25</xref></sup> Politicians may use tax policy as a mechanism for taking credit for new investment in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414011428594">Biglaiser &amp; Mezzetti, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414011428594">Jensen, Malesky, Medina, &amp; Ozdemir, 2010</xref>). Although the clear counterfactual is whether the country would have attracted the investment without the tax policy change, it is plausible that information asymmetry among voters, firms, and politicians may lead voters to reward incumbent politicians for the investments made after corporate tax cuts.</p>
<p>A third possibility is that politicians believe that firms respond to tax rates, and thus tax competition is driven by perceptions of the competitive environment. This incorrect belief on the importance of taxes for FDI could stem from the information asymmetries between firms and government officials. Firms have the incentive to use the threat of exit or bargain over taxes on entry, claiming that taxes are central to their investment location decisions.</p>
<p>These are just three of many potential avenues of inquiry, yet the core point is simple. The universe of OECD tax reforms seems to have little aggregate demand on one of the most important forms of mobile capital, FDI. Understanding this simple point can have important implications on understanding the political economy of taxation and the relationship between globalization and the state.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414011428594">Arellano and Bond (1991)</xref> argue for these estimates to be consistent, the first-difference residuals should display negative first-order serial correlation but not second-order serial correlation and passes the Sargon test of overidentifying restrictions. I do not present these results because of weak instruments (as indicated by the Sargon test) and some models do not display negative first-order serial correlation. The substantive results are consistent with the error correction results, yet the violation of some assumptions of the Arellano and Bond method makes the error correction model the preferred estimation strategy.</p>

<p>This is an imperfect proxy for public good provision. Ideally, public goods would be coded not by expenditure but by value to firms. Specifically, policy that improves transportation and electricity provision should be privileged by firms.</p>

<p>Using data from the World Bank’s Database of Political Institutions, I test if “right” executives or “right” legislatures affect FDI flows. Although these controls did not affect the results on tax policy, right governments (both executives and legislatures) were associated with <italic>lower</italic> FDI flows. Yet these results are not robust across models.</p>

<p>There are two serious problems with instrumenting for tax policy reform. First, tax reforms are rare and often difficult to predict, compounding the “weak instrument” problem. Second, an appropriate instrument should be correlated with the endogenous variable (tax reform) and not correlated with the error term. This requires a theoretical justification for an instrument. Instruments such as the partisanship of government or the structure of domestic institutions affect other types of policy reforms that affect FDI. In short, I am unaware of any instruments for tax policy change that do not suffer from one of the above problems.</p>

<p>More than 93% of respondents selected taxes as a “very important factor” or “fairly important factor” and fewer than 7% as “not a factor” or “not very important.” The other four factors (labor costs, environmental costs, proximity to raw materials, and proximity to customers) had lower levels of “very important” and “fairly important” responses.
