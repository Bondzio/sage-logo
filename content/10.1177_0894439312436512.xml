<abstract>
<p>The article presents analysis of a Polish Internet political discussion forum, characterized by significant polarization and high levels of emotion. The study compares samples of discussions gathered at three periods during a 2-year time, during which events occurred that significantly increased the already strong political division of Polish society (the sudden death of the President in a plane crash, snap elections, accusations of assassination and treason). Despite these circumstances, we observe a remarkable stability of individual political support. Extensive discussions among the forum users did not lead to changes in their political affiliations or specific opinions. In contrast, emotions expressed by the forum users, mainly negative, were found to vary from post to post and between the discussion threads. An automatic emotion recognition algorithm is presented, giving results closely corresponding to human evaluations. The authors also show that differences in a user interface between the two alternative forum webpages, especially effects of features promoting direct one-to-one communication, have significant impact on message content and decrease negative emotions. Implications of such changes on promoting communication across a political divide are discussed.</p>

<title>Internet Discussion Forums as Research Ground</title>
<p>Internet discussion forums are very fertile grounds for research on human communication patterns and dynamical social structures, where the links between people can literally be observed as they form, together with the content, timing, and emotional tone of the communication. Such discussions are often only slightly moderated, allowing various kinds of expressions, ranging from elaborate texts to single words or emoticons; from polite debate to exchanges of obscenities. The Internet allows users to remain relatively anonymous, freeing them from fear in expressing extreme views due to possible retributions, typical for face-to-face contacts or formal correspondence. At the same time, stability of nicknames allows participants to recognize each other within the discussion platform, so that social networks may form, grow, and evolve. These networks may stretch across geographic distances, social status, age, and political divides and may involve thousands of participants and millions of messages. The existence of hard records makes the environment a very good study subject. Indeed, the Internet may serve as a huge psychological lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894439312436512">Skitka &amp; Sargis, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The Internet discussions are driven by a great variety of motivations. They range from helpful assistance (e.g., in computer technology), virtual gatherings of aficionados of particular activity (sports, music fans, entertainment. .), reviews and opinions concerning specific products or services (hotels, gadgets, books. .) to hot ideological debates (related to politics, religion, or even Linux vs. Windows). We focus on highly polarized Internet discussion boards, which are important from the point of view of political attitudes and responses to policies. Extended out-group networking, based on strong differences of opinion, is quite unusual outside the Internet, because in real life voluntary social links are mostly based on common interests and views, whether political or nonpolitical. The discussions may provide the evidence for or against various models of reactions to opposing views, such as the deliberative model or the biased processing approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439312436512">Delli Carpini, Cook, &amp; Jacobs, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894439312436512">Lord, Ross, &amp; Lepper, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894439312436512">Mutz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894439312436512">Nickerson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894439312436512">Price, Cappella, &amp; Nir, 2002</xref>; Wojcieszak, 2012) or motivated reasoning approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894439312436512">Kunda, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894439312436512">Lebo &amp; Cassino, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894439312436512">Slothuus &amp; de Vreese, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0894439312436512">Taber, Cann, &amp; Kucsova, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>The Political Situation in Poland During the Studied Period</title>
<p>The general political situation in Poland exhibits extreme political divisions. The two main political parties—Prawo i Sprawiedliwosc (Law and Justice, PiS) and Platforma Obywatelska (Civic Platform, PO)—have since 2005 been in the state of intensifying conflict. This conflict, for some researchers, is an example of “Polish political paranoia” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894439312436512">Korzeniewski, 2010</xref>). The tragic crash of the plane carrying the President Lech Kaczynski (PiS) resulted in snap presidential elections in a highly loaded atmosphere. While the mourning period initially introduced some calm into the political debate, it has quickly reverted to combative rhetoric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894439312436512">Jakubowski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894439312436512">Niżyńska, 2010</xref>). As no candidate received a majority of votes in the first round, a second round was held on July 4, 2010, in which Bronislaw Komorowski, candidate of PO, defeated Jaroslaw Kaczynski, candidate of PiS (twin brother of the president who died in the catastrophe). The elections had relatively high turnout (55.31%) and have split the voters almost half in half (53.01–46.99%). For detailed data, see webpage of the National Electoral Commission (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://prezydent2010.pkw.gov.pl/PZT/EN/WYN/W/index.htm">http://prezydent2010.pkw.gov.pl/PZT/EN/WYN/W/index.htm</ext-link>).</p>
<p>After the lost elections, PiS has dropped the conciliatory image and by July 2010 the party fully adopted position accusing the government and PO officials of negligence that lead to the crash. While official statements were somewhat restrained (assigning guilt and need for trial but not openly calling the crash a sabotage), the latter idea was quickly taken up by the streets and PiS-related media (such as <italic>Nasz Dziennik</italic> daily or TV Trwam). This resulted in an apparently unbridgeable split of the society at all levels. One side treats the crash as a tragic accident, the other as a sabotage in which the PO government played an active role (e.g., <italic>Gazeta Polska Codziennie</italic> publishes almost every week stories such as “Tupolev was shot down” [September 27, 2011]; “10 pieces of evidence for Smolensk assassination” [September 30, 2011]; and “The President was murdered” [October 8, 2011]. The last of these stories appeared a day before parliamentary elections and its aggressive rhetoric was generally held to be one of the reasons for the loss of the parliamentary elections by PiS—admitted even by Jaroslaw Kaczynski.</p>
<p>For PO supporters, Poland is, despite the European economic crisis, an economically healthy and fast growing country (this view is confirmed by economic growth figures of the Eurostat <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsieb020">http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsieb020</ext-link>). For PiS, it is on the verge of economic catastrophe or maybe already collapsed (official Report on the State of Poland, issued by PiS directorate in January 2011, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pis.org.pl/download.php?g=mmedia&amp;f=raport_o_stanie_rzeczypospolitej_1.pdf">http://www.pis.org.pl/download.php?g=mmedia&amp;f=raport_o_stanie_rzeczypospolitej_1.pdf</ext-link>). Voting data of the National Electoral Commission show that there is a significant correlation between the voter preferences and city size, education and industrialization level (PO supporters dominating in large cities and for voters with higher education, PiS support concentrated in rural areas and with voters with lower education levels). As a result, in many cases personal contact between the supporters of the two camps is limited. As we noted, Internet discussions provide the possibility of such contact, with little or no limitations on content or attitude. The news source is not neutral (the newspaper has clearly an anti-PiS stance), but participants from both camps use openness and popularity of the forum as a convenient “battleground.” While PiS supporters are a minority of the forum users, they are, nevertheless, quite active. It should also be noted that the broadband Internet access in Poland is still limited in rural areas, so the geographical correlation of support for the two parties may further influence the pro-PO affiliation bias. This argument is, however, weakened by the presence of many pro-PiS websites with active majority of PiS supporting users. Interestingly, there are no “neutral” forums devoted to Polish political issues. Non-neutrality of the forum, resulting from the political sympathies of the newspaper that provides the basic news items, is strengthened by automatic hiding of posts that have strong negative score, done by the administrative routines. For such comments, there is only “comment hidden” note and the score visible during normal browsing; the post may be made visible by individual clicking on a dedicated link. In our analysis, we have found that automatically hidden comments are not significantly more abusive than the rest, the distinction is that they represent minority view. Their disappearance therefore enhances the effect of “false consensus” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0894439312436512">Wojcieszak, 2008</xref>); on casual reading, the minority (PiS supporters) becomes even less visible than the true writer participation ratio. It should be noted that this visual hiding of the comment is separate action from administrative deleting comments reported as illegal, aggressive, and so on. The latter option is exercised relatively infrequently (for less than 1% of the posts) and is indicated by separate administrative message without data on the evaluation score. Of course, there was no possibility to determine political support of such deleted messages.</p>

<title>The Goals of the Article</title>
<p>Our article presents a multifaceted study of an active political discussion forum in Poland, based on data gathered during a 2-year period and analyzed from the networking, content, and emotion points of view. The forum exhibits extreme political division and significant aggression, representative of the state of Polish society. Human-based evaluation of content and emotions are compared with results of automated analysis, based on specific rule set. Main goals of our article are as follows:</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>The Internet communication environment has attracted interest of researchers focused on mechanisms of attitude and opinion change. The topic is important in view of increasing polarization of societies with respect to many issues, especially political and ideological. Internet discussions involve high numbers of people, and in contrast to traditional media which serve relatively passive audiences. In some Internet environments, such as social media hubs (e.g., Twitter, Facebook) and discussion forums, large number of users actively express their views. These media prosper, thanks to such active participation. This extends the hypothesis put forward by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894439312436512">Mutz and Martin (2002</xref>), that media would surpass face-to-face communications across political divides. The Internet-based discussions provide not only access to facts and opinions “packaged” by professionals and presented in shortened form, typical for press or TV, but also exposure to raw, diverse views of “normal people,” and they complement the traditional media in this eye-opening role. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894439312436512">Guadagno and Cialdini (2005</xref>) review research on computer-mediated communication, comparing the interactive and noninteractive environments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439312436512">Lee (2006</xref>) studied the effects of lack of information allowing identification in discussion groups (depersonalization). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894439312436512">Price, Nir, and Cappella (2006</xref>) found that overall “climate” of discussions strongly influences final individual opinions—individuals “mimic” the general tenor of the group, even in strongly informational discussions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0894439312436512">Wojcieszak (2010</xref>) studied self-organized, assortative grouping of people sharing the same interests and views into online communities that may become separated from each other and relatively homogenous. The descriptions of reality that are offered by such communities become impossible to combine into one coherent personal worldview, especially when accompanied by polarized traditional media and biased selection of information sources by the users. Similar worldviews may be shared within a group, but may be incompatible between them. The divisions may be so deep that they would make meaningful communication between supporters of the conflicted camps—especially face-to-face—extremely difficult due to emotions, separating the society. It is interesting to note that in-group influence goes beyond opportunistic conformism, resulting in deep changes in memory, as shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894439312436512">Meade and Roediger (2002</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439312436512">Loftus (2005</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0894439312436512">Wright, Memon, Skagerberg, and Gabbert (2009</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894439312436512">Edelson, Sharot, Dolan, and Dudai (2011</xref>). Such effects would influence the future opinions of the people who see only uniform or mostly uniform opinions within a political group. Thus, the effect of group pressure would have long-term effects beyond those characterized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894439312436512">Cohen (2003</xref>). Promoting exposure to contrary opinions, even if it does not lead to true value judgments and opinion/attitude change, decreases chances of such socially induced distortion of perception and memory, simply by observing that there are people with different views.</p>
<p>People focused on such subset of sources may be under impression that it presents a homogenous and complete view, because they see no reference to contrary data and explanations. This phenomenon is called false consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0894439312436512">Wojcieszak, 2008</xref>), and it leads to more extreme perception of in-group norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439312436512">Lee, 2006</xref>). Armed with one-sided information, people are strengthened in their opinions and less ready to participate in discussions with opponents when they encounter them, and even less to work for a consensus. Such behavior has been studied in laboratory environment by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894439312436512">Cohen (2003</xref>). He has noted that group influence not only affects attitudes on key subject but may “define the very meaning of the objects in real world.” Opinions of trusted in-group members are accepted without deliberation, regardless of the merit of the content. The existence of Internet discussion forums where conflicted sides are, at least, trying to communicate may be a way to combat extremism related to false consensus. Allowing the users to interact with each other, even if this interaction is, in many cases, in the form of abuse and invectives may, paradoxically, lead to better communication. An interesting question is: what characteristics would increase the chances of deliberative treatment of contrary views, especially in computer-mediated communication?</p>
<p>Discussing polarization and fragmentation of society, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894439312436512">Stroud (2010</xref>) has noted that selective exposure may have two effects on the population. First, using only the information provided by one side would limit a person’s ability to deliberate and choose. Second, such separation might lead to lesser tolerance and extremism. We must, however, remember that simple exposure to the opposite views is no recipe for open-mindedness and tolerance. Experimental study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894439312436512">Lord et al. (1979</xref>) has clearly shown that opinions held before being exposed to other viewpoints strongly bias the reception. This bias covers not only debatable opinions but also acceptance of hard, empirical facts. People would choose only the evidence that supports their views. Thus, to achieve effective communication between conflicted groups, more is needed than just combining opposing messages in one place.</p>
<p>In a large-scale meta-analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894439312436512">Pettigrew and Tropp (2008</xref>) have identified three ways of reducing intergroup prejudice: increasing the knowledge about the other group, reducing anxiety related to contact, and increasing empathy. The study shows that increased knowledge has the weakest effect in diminishing prejudice. On the other hand, Internet forums are not good environments to promote empathy; anonymity of the contacts prevents it. This leaves anxiety reduction resulting from intergroup contacts as a possible way of improving communication across political divisions.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894439312436512">MacKuen, Wolak, Keele, and Marcus (2010</xref>) introduce an interesting concept of two idealized types of participants in political debates: a deliberative citizen (who considers all arguments, including these opposite to his views) and a partisan combatant, passionate supporter of single viewpoint. In real situations, people behave somewhere between these two extremes. The authors argue that it is emotions that define the deliberative versus combative stance. Moreover, their results show that effects of emotions would differ if the source is aversion due to negative feelings such as fear of the other group or anxiety, due to lack of knowledge or new situation. These authors opposed anxiety, defined related to uncertainty with aversion, related to anger, disgust, contempt, or hatred. Aversion strengthens reliance on the views already held, while anxiety encourages seeking out more information. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894439312436512">MacKuen et al. (2010</xref>) have shown that in experimental setting, when the situation is perceived as familiar threats (leading to aversion) possibility of a compromise decreases dramatically. When the situation is treated as novel and challenging, people are more open-minded and allow a compromise to form.</p>
<p>Literature on the social influence and persuasion documents many situations where opinions and attitudes toward specific topics are very persistent. A thorough review of message-based persuasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0894439312436512">Wood, 2000</xref>) contains references to specific field studies and models for the field. It lists three main motives for possible change of opinion: desire for internal coherence and favorable self-evaluation; ensuring satisfactory relationships with others, especially viewed in the context of reward/punishment; and finally understanding the issue in question. The first two reasons were typically grouped into normative category, where agreement with someone’s opinion was mainly due to conformity while the last category is described as informative, where opinion change is due to accepting information or evidence about reality. Recent research, as reported by Wood, challenges the older view that informative influences are enduring, while normative ones (both private and public) are transitory.</p>
<p>Laboratory studies of attitude changes due to different motivations show that the treatment of available arguments and messages describing different opinion choices strongly depends on motivations. Requirement for accuracy leads to a balanced access to sources that are pro/contra currently held opinion and facilitates informative influence. On the other hand, in defending one’s own position, information is chosen selectively. Similar selectivity is present when the motivation comes from desire to show loyalty to in-group. This last category has been demonstrated to be particularly persistent, leading to fixation of attitudes.</p>

<title>Data Sources</title>
<p>We have gathered our data from discussions related to news stories published in category “politics” by the Internet branch of the largest Polish newspaper <italic>Gazeta Wyborcza</italic>, (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.gazeta.pl">www.gazeta.pl</ext-link>). The choice of the forum was due to its high popularity, active discussions, as well as due to the fact that we wished to expand on the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894439312436512">Sobkowicz &amp; Sobkowicz, 2010</xref>), which compared basic network properties for different subjects of discussions (politics, sport, and science) in the same environment.</p>
<p>Posting comments requires a registered user account. While only users’ nicknames are visible, the privacy policy warns the users that IP address and other data are logged and may be given to the relevant state agencies in the case of law-breaking, in principle providing some restraint. There is possibility for a single person to register multiple times, but as we have no access to such information we treat each nicknames as a separate user.</p>
<p>In the current article, we analyze four sets of comments, denoted by their time of origin: January 2009 (JAN09), second half of July 2010 (JUL10), and two data sets gathered in February 2011 (FEB11 and FEB11Q). The difference between the two latter data sets shall be explained shortly. Gathered data consist of a discussion thread identification, user comment text, the user identification (nickname), the timing of the post within a discussion thread, and, depending on the specific forum, direct comment-to-comment relations (JAN09 and FEB11Q data sets) and comment evaluation by readers (JUL10 and FEB11 sets). The latter are provided by thumbs up/thumbs down scoring done by registered readers.</p>
<p>The forum is split into two separate user interfaces, with two distinct web addresses (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.gazeta.pl">www.gazeta.pl</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="forum.gazeta.pl">forum.gazeta.pl</ext-link>). The first, denoted hereafter as “old” interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894439312436512">Figure 1</xref>), allows users to post replies to other users’ comments with a single click. This resulted in the observed high proportion of exchanges of posts between pairs of users. The graphical form of presentation of the discussion threads favored easy recognition of such exchanges by other users, which increased the ratio of comments directed to comments, rather than to the original news stories.</p>

The screenshot presented here highlights an example of a quarrel between two users. On the other hand, to read each comment in full, the viewer must click on particular link. Discussion forum is placed beneath a summary of the news item, rather than the original story, where only number of comments is provided.</p>

<p>The second version, the “new” interface, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0894439312436512">Figure 2</xref>) does not allow one-click individual responses to specific posts. Thus, there is no longer a simple mechanism supporting quarrels that we have described. The change has been criticized by many users, some of them calling for boycott of the forum. The critics openly state that they want to interact with the other users. Interestingly, these criticisms come from users from both political camps and are probably the sole topic on which the two groups agree. The new forum allows evaluation of the posts by registered readers. The evaluation results are prominently visible to other users: current score of a post is displayed along the post, in boldface, green/red font to increase visibility. Users refer to these evaluations in their subsequent posts.</p>

The discussion forum is placed directly beneath the full news item.</p>

<p>The old forum preserves long-term person-to-person exchanges observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894439312436512">Sobkowicz and Sobkowicz (2010</xref>). The tree-like structure of the posts is prominently visualized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894439312436512">Figure 1</xref>), so that the most active exchanges between pairs of commentators are immediately visible and draw a lot of attention from other users. It is worth noting that the base news stories for the FEB11 (new interface) and FEB11Q (old interface) data sets are essentially the same on both. This situation gives us unique opportunity to study the influence of presentational aspects in Internet communications on the user behavior and expression of emotions.</p>
<p>In the current article, we have focused on discussions with more than 50 posts, typically in the range of 100–500. Selection of the threads used for analysis was based solely on their size, with no prescreening of content of comments. We note here that the size of a discussion obviously depends on the “hotness” of the commented topic. Some news stories were in themselves quite provocative (e.g., commenting negatively on prominent PiS politicians) so that one could expect that they would provoke a lot of comments. But sometimes long threads resulted from relatively low profile news. The use of only selected, long discussions in our analysis makes direct comparisons of post statistics with data gathered from <italic>total</italic> records of other Internet discussion forums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894439312436512">Chmiel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894439312436512">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894439312436512">Ding &amp; Liu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894439312436512">Si, Liu, Cheng, &amp; Zhang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894439312436512">Si, Liu, Xiong, et al., 2010</xref>) impossible. For example, longer threads are likely to address more contentious issues, resulting in more quarrels between users and higher emotions. The reason for this selective approach comes from our interest in studying statistical properties of the social networks formed among the users and their comparison with computer simulation models, which is a topic of a separate publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894439312436512">Sobkowicz &amp; Sobkowicz, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Spontaneous Versus Paid-For Participation</title>
<p>We must comment here on a particular weakness of our work that has surfaced after the data were acquired. Throughout the study, we have assumed that all users participated in the discussions because they wanted to spontaneously express their views and reactions to other users. This “free choice” participation does include party activists, representing voluntarily the point of view of their community. However, one of the Polish newspapers has reported (<italic>Polska The Times</italic>, May 30, 2011) that some of the posts resulted from paid services, ordered by political parties, election committees, or other organizations. The phenomenon was reported to cover many websites (although no names were provided), and has supposedly become “a regular industry,” with payments of 0.1–0.5 USD per posted comment. Indeed, posts containing accusations of being “on the payroll” of PO or PiS are quite frequent in the studied data sets, either aimed at particular users or at opponents in general, but there were no proofs. The initial report stated that the Polish state prosecutor is conducting an investigation covering posting inflammatory comments on discussion boards, paid for by political parties and associated institutions. Later information limited the official investigation to a couple of specific cases of personal attacks, directed at individual state officials, not an investigation of the general phenomenon.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of concrete information about the reality of such paid-for and therefore “directed” participation, its mere possibility throws a very interesting light on the discussions. If some of the emotions expressed by the comments would be faked, written according to some Public Relations instructions prepared by political parties, then the general landscape of the discussions would change from pure person-to-person or person-to-many messaging to include organization-to-people messaging, more typical for party advertisements or presence of politicians on TV shows. The difference is that while such traditional political media messages are usually toned down and use less aggression, the anonymized environment of the Internet discussions allows comments of highly aggressive nature. Such posts would rightly deserve being in the “provocative” category. In the context of our analysis, some of the users whom we have treated as separate (and included in statistical measures) might turn out to be multiple avatars of a smaller number of “professional” participants.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of orchestrated propaganda mimicking communication of individual people is not limited to Polish politics; there are some indications that, for example, product reviews on websites are written and posted by the representatives of interested companies or that evaluations of services are not genuine. Unfortunately, there are little data (either generally or in our specific case) that would allow valid estimation of the scope of the phenomenon. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894439312436512">Jindal and Liu (2008</xref>) studied the domain of product reviews looking for <italic>opinion spam</italic>, and its effects on trustworthiness of opinions in reviews. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894439312436512">Dellarocas (2006</xref>) presents theoretical analysis of such manipulation in commercial environments. The topic of effectiveness of institutionalized provocative activities in political environment is an extremely interesting one. However, due to the lack of hard data, in the present work we use the assumption that all posts represent individual statements of the participating users.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0894439312436512" sec-type="methods">
<title>Analysis Methods</title>
<p>Each of the data sets analyzed consisted of a few thousand posts in a few tens of separate discussion threads. We have identified user-to-user messages (forming a network) and posts addressed to the world at large. We have also classified comment type (content) and emotions of each post and political sympathies of the forum users. The classification was carried out by the authors. Categorization of the comment type was done using the following six categories, devised to reflect the intent of the post:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Agreement (Agr)—the comment agrees with the covered material (either the original news coverage or the target comment in a thread);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Disagreement (Dis)—the comment disagrees with the covered material;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Invective (Inv)—the comment is a direct invective and personal abuse of the previous commentator;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Provocation (Prv)—the comment is aimed at causing dissent, often, but not always, only weakly related to the topic of discussion;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Neutral (Neu)—the comment is neutral in nature, neither in obvious agreement nor in disagreement;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Off-topic (Off)—the comment is off-topic, unrelated to the topic of discussion, but without malicious intent;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Switch (Swi)—the comment signifies a switch in participant’s position, leading to agreement between two previously opposing commentators.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>For the emotions, we have used a graded numerical scale from +1 to −3. The scale was applied separately to emotions versus politicians/political issues and versus other forum users. Resulting total emotion was a sum of the two values. Usually, posts are focused either on political issues or on other users, so combinations of emotions directed at both are rather infrequent. As a result, the observed range for total emotion is between +1 and −5, with the lowest value present in very small number of cases. To preserve consistency in emotion evaluations, we used the following rules defining each category:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>+1 = Positive emotions: expressed as support for another post or statement by politician described in the news item.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>0 = Neutral emotions: statements of facts (either agreeing or disagreeing with the target of the post), explanations; worded in neutral language.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>−1 = Light negative emotions: expressed via single instances of vulgar language, suggestions that politicians or other users are idiots, and so on.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>−2 = Strong negative emotions: repeated use of vulgarities, comparing politicians or other users to Nazi/Stalinist personages, excessive use of capitalized letters, and so on.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>−3 = Excessive negative emotions: posts combining many elements described above.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Because categorization of the posts is done by the authors of this study, it is possible that the results include systematic errors due to our idiosyncrasies. The definitions presented above allowed, for most of the comments, straightforward classification. To check the consistency of judgments in “borderline” cases, we performed a second evaluation (for about 1/4 of the data), several months after the first one. The differences between the two were found to be minimal (less than 1% of the cases). We thus assume, that while our evaluations may have underlying tendencies (e.g., to over- or underestimate emotional content of a message), they are intrinsically consistent. When the coders differed in their evaluation, the final category was decided in discussion. Unfortunately, because of the limited resources (the work was not funded by any institution nor public grant), we were unable to extend the number of independent coders. We recognize this as a major deficiency of the work and within limited resources took the actions to limit the systematic errors, possible especially in the attribution of emotions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0894439312436512">
<title>Automatic Emotion Analysis</title>
<p>The problems mentioned above have prompted us to construct an automated emotion recognition application. Such methods are already known in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894439312436512">Chmiel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894439312436512">Mitrovic, Paltoglou, &amp; Tadic, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894439312436512">Prabowo &amp; Thelwall, 2009</xref>). Our automatic engine is based on combination of lexical analysis and memory of classification of user activities. Word list used to determine high emotions is built using two separate sources. The first contains popular Polish swearwords. Because the users employed a wide range of tricks to extend their aggressive vocabulary beyond standard swearwords, for example using ad hoc intentional misspellings of names and word games on political party names, turning them into near-swearwords, we could not limit ourselves to the standard dictionary in the analysis. The second is built from words commonly used in community to make fun of and/or to irritate other users. Words in the second list are taken from subset of data set (less than 10% of randomly selected posts from JUL10, FEB11, and FEB11Q sets) for each data set by human choice. The final post emotion is calculated by combining the lexical score of the comment and the average emotion from previous posts in the thread by the same author (memory effect).</p>
<p>Because most of the data we have gathered can be analyzed and treated as single observation, we report the absolute numerical values or averages of the observed characteristics. In situations where we compare the data from different data sets to look for similarities or changes, we have used Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests, due to the fact that the actual distributions, in most cases cannot be described by the normal distributions.</p>
<p>Human and automatic emotion recognition values were compared via average data set emotion values and through distributions of posts with total emotion equal to +1, 0, −1, . . , presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0894439312436512">Table 1</xref>. The automatic algorithm, although “trained” only on a very small subset of our data, gives reasonable results when compared to human analysis. Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests for similarity of distributions of emotions evaluated by authors and automatically were 0.020, 0.012, and 0.005 for JUL10, FEB11, and FEB11Q sets, respectively.</p>

<italic>Note.</italic> The parameters of the automated analysis algorithm have been tuned to give best fit to less than 10% of posts in each set. Despite this limitation, the assignment of emotions of posts into different levels of emotion by automated process gives the same results as the human analysis, as measured by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. We draw attention to the fact, that despite the facts that comments in FEB11 and FEB11Q sets correspond largely to the same news stories and share significant core of authors, the negative emotions for the FEB11Q set are much lower. Difference in the distributions is confirmed by the K-S test.</p>

<title>User and Comment Network Properties</title>
<p>Within each thread, each discussion forum, we may treat users as nodes in a social network, with directed links provided by comments addressed to other users. Comments attached to source news (and not to other users’ comments) may be considered as marking the presence of active but isolated nodes. The network allows possibility of multiple links between a pair of users.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0894439312436512">Table 2</xref> summarizes, for each data set, the basic network parameters. The old interface with its one-click reply mechanism facilitated extended network formation. For both JAN09 and FEB11Q data sets, the largest connected component comprised of more than 60% of the users. One can think in these cases about forming a percolation network for information flow among the users. We recall here that the users are largely coming from opposing political camps, yet the network is not divided into two weakly connected subsets, as observed in the case of blogs by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894439312436512">Adamic and Glance (2005</xref>). The existence of large connected component comprised of users with mixed political sympathies shows that they react to viewpoints used by their opponents. On the contrary, much weaker network structure of the new forum suggests that the majority of users post comments which do not relate to other users and indicate their own viewpoint only, addressing it to the readers at large. With a similar number of posts, the largest connected component is almost 3 times smaller for the new interface data; there are 4 times more isolated users and 6 times less links.</p>

<p>
<italic>Note.</italic> JAN09 and FEB11Q facilitate user-to-user exchanges and show much greater proportion of links and pairs of users connected by multiple links. The difference is especially visible in the number of isolated users (i.e., users who posted a comment directed at the main news story, without commenting other users) and in the relative size of the largest connected component of the user network, which reaches over 60% in the old, quarrel-promoting, interface. Small differences between ratios of political affiliation calculated for users and for posts reflect generally lower activity of the users whose affiliation is undefined and higher activity of the committed users. This confirms the hypothesis of the forum being used as “battling ground” between the two opposing parties. July 2010 data were gathered just after the presidential elections won by PO candidate, when his supporters were elated by the outcome.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Overall, our data sets contained 6,404 users. Of these, 5,132 were present in only one of the sets, 940 in two of them, 274 in three, and 58 users participated in discussions contained in all four data sets. The presence of a user in more than one set of data is correlated with general activity. The average number of posts per user for the small core of 58 users was 27.2, compared to the overall average of 4.03. For the users who were found in at least three data sets, the average number of posts was 16.6. Another way of looking at the extended activity measures is to check the most active users (as given by the overall number of posts). From the top ten, characterized by an average of 152 posts per user, two were present in only one set, two in two data sets, four in three, and two in all four.</p>
<p>The user activity, measured by the number of posts written by a user and number of discussions he or she participated in, and user indegree (which measures how interesting to others are the user posts) are all relatively well described by power laws, the only significant deviation is in FEB11 data on number of threads, which shows unusual behavior at low range. The power law exponents were −1.75 for the number of posts written and −2.0 ± 0.25 for the indegree distribution. We confirm therefore the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894439312436512">Sobkowicz and Sobkowicz (2010</xref>) that communication network based on conflict exhibits the same basic statistical properties as networks connecting people sharing similar views. We also confirm the existence of pairwise exchanges of comments between users, represented by multi-edge pairs in data sets. In the discussions using the new user interface, we were able to identify only a few extended quarrels involving pairs of users, the longest comprising of four posts. This is drastically shorter than in JAN09 and FEB11Q data, where we observed many exchanges of comments between two users longer than 10 consecutive posts. This is obviously due to technical properties of the new portal which make dialogue more difficult to maintain—a user has to watch for replies to his or her own comment without graphical guideline to help, which makes responding more difficult.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0894439312436512">
<title>User Political Affiliation Statistics</title>
<p>An important element of our analysis is the relative number of participants supporting the political parties. We divided users into three categories: PO, PiS, and Unknown (UNK). The last category is actually comprised of two distinct groups: users who openly declare support for one of the remaining parties in Poland or are openly against both PO and PiS and the second group, roughly the same in size, composed of users for whom assignment of political support was impossible to determine from the content of the posts. Not surprisingly, supporters of PO form the majority of readers and commentators (average values are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0894439312436512">Table 2</xref>), PiS being a significant minority. This polarization of the forum participation has been observed by the users themselves and was often mentioned in the posts.</p>
<p>The distribution of party support varies in the discussion threads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0894439312436512">Figure 3</xref>). In July 2010, the polarization of the forum was at the highest level in the studied periods, but in all cases there are quite large deviations from the averages in particular threads. We have found that JAN09 and JUL10 data sets have statistically different distributions from both FEB11 and FEB11Q sets, which are similar to each other. Despite overall PO dominance, in both data sets from February 2011 there are 12 threads where PiS supporters posted a majority of comments. The topics of these discussions varied, but in six cases they were related to newspaper articles critical of PO. This may indicate that such publications (in a generally pro-PO medium) were rallying cries for PiS supporters.</p>
<fig id="fig3-0894439312436512" position="float">
<label>Figure 3.</label>
<caption>
<p>Distribution of user affiliations for threads in JUL10, FEB11, and FEB11Q data sets. In July 2010, dominance of PO supporters was very high in all studied discussion threads. In February 2011, we observe some threads where there is similar dominance and also threads where supporters of the two parties are almost in equal numbers or even when PiS supporters dominate. The latter situation is especially interesting, bearing in mind strong pro-PO stance of the newspaper. Comparing the distributions (via the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test), we find that the JUL10 data set is statistically different from both the FEB11 and FEB11Q sets, while the two sets gathered in February 2011 share the same distribution of PO and PiS supporters. This makes the observed difference in emotional characteristics between the two sets more interesting.</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0894439312436512-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>While the forum seems to be visually dominated by PO users (due to the hiding of comments), PiS supporters are not silenced because they believe their positions are marginal and isolated, as postulated by the spiral of silence theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894439312436512">Slater, 2007</xref>). There are two reasons for this: first, while PiS supporters are minority in the <italic>Gazeta Wyborcza</italic> forum, they are significant part of the society (as indicated by the election results). Second, their views are visible on other media, such as the pro-PiS websites (some cross-copying of the messages between different forums confirms that there is cross-participation between pro-PO and pro-PiS venues).</p>
<p>User affiliation was determined first within each data set and then compared between them. Political affiliation has been remarkably stable for the studied forum. Only 15 users changed their sympathies, all of these changes happening between July 2010 and February 2011. In one case, the change was from PiS to PO support, in another from Unknown to PiS. Thirteen PO supporters, in all cases dissatisfied with perceived lack of activity by the PO government (explicitly mentioned in their posts), changed their affiliation, 12 of them switching to support to newly formed political parties (thus moving to Unknown category), and only 1 declaring support for PiS. Taking into account that the number of changes is only 0.23% of the total number of participants, we may conclude that participation in political discussions did not encourage change political opinions and support in general sense.</p>

<title>Discussions Content</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0894439312436512">Table 3</xref> summarizes the distribution of various types of comments. First, we note relatively stable ratios of positive (Agreement), negative (Disagreement, Invective, or Provocation), and neutral comments. The average values for all data sets are 17%, 70.5%, and 12.5%, clearly indicating that majority of comments are confrontational in nature. There is significantly lower number of posts classified as neutral in JAN09 data. We observe an increase of neutral comments as we move to later data sets. Another observation is that the old interface discussions contain more positive comments than the new interface sets, a finding which we shall discuss in more depth later on.</p>

<italic>Note.</italic> Only comments linked to other comments are classified. The α factor denotes the ratio of observed number of comments linking within faction group, between groups, and to/from agents with unknown affiliation to values expected from the user affiliations if the posts were placed randomly. For example, for inter-faction comments, we observe α value higher than 1, which means that users prefer to address the supporters of the opposite faction. Value smaller than 1 corresponds to lower preference for placing a comment. Comparison of the distributions of types of comments for all data sets is not wholly conclusive due to small number of categories. The Kolmogorov–Smirnow test suggests that the JAN09 data are significantly different from the JUL10 and FEB11, while they are not different from FEB11Q, also the JUL10 and FEB11 data are similar according to the tests. This underscores the importance of the user interface and the interpersonal communication network structure resulting from the interface on the content of exchanged messages, not only on their emotions.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0894439312436512">Table 3</xref> shows also distribution of comments linking various groups of users and various types of comments. We observe that the largest numbers of links are between the conflicted parties (inter-faction), rather than within each group (intra-faction). This stands in contrast with previous observations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894439312436512">Adamic and Glance (2005</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894439312436512">Hargittai, Gallo, and Kane (2008</xref>), who analyzed links between political blogs in the United States. The main difference is that for blogs the process of creation of the network is radically different. The links between blogs are inserted by the authors as integral part of the blog text, often to support the presented point of view. Moreover, many blog entries combine multiple topics, data sources, and links. In contrast, quick comments in discussion forums are usually focused on one topic (either the original source or some previous comment) and are rather reactive. The links are usually to a single comment only, with very few exceptions. It is easier (and more rewarding emotionally), in a short time and space, to attack an opponent than to construct elaborate presentation of one’s own position by linking with other supporters. In fact, in research focused on blog content rather than on simple presence of direct links, even this more deliberative medium shows dominance of the attack approach. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894439312436512">Trammell (2006</xref>) noted in his analysis of blogs during the US 2004 elections, more than a half of the blogs discussed the opponent, and of these, almost 80% contained an attack.</p>

<title>Analysis of Emotions</title>
<p>Emotions exhibited by users in their posts have been recently the subject of intensive studies aimed at quantitative description of emotional motivations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894439312436512">Chmiel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894439312436512">Mitrovic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894439312436512">Prabowo &amp; Thelwall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894439312436512">Schweitzer &amp; Garcia, 2010</xref>). While there is a rough correspondence between the intent of the comments (informative, provocative, quarrelsome) and the associated emotions, the mapping is not perfect. Posts categorized as agreements may be expressed in highly emotional fashion—or stated neutrally. Similarly, disagreement may be stated with or without agitation. Users may use emotional, vulgar, impolite language, or well-mannered sarcasm in a cold and calculated manner. The two directions of analysis of messages—intentions and emotions—are thus complementary.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0894439312436512">Figure 4</xref> presents distribution of emotions expressed in posts JUL10, FEB11, and FRB11Q data sets. It is worth to note much larger ratios of positive comments in Threads 3, 22, and 25–27 in JUL10 set. In all these cases, they were concerned with news items regarding comments strongly against PiS politicians made by perceived “outsiders” of the political field. Positive emotions were mostly of the form of personal support for courage and decisiveness of single persons, perceived as acting outside political establishment. In FEB11 data set, there is only one discussion with high ratio of positive emotions. In Thread 26, positive emotion has been generated by relatively large number of PiS supporters, expressing the admiration for statements by a PiS politician accusing the PO government of treason. A reverse situation is present in Threads 27 and 32 of FEB11Q set; here the PO supporters express their positive emotions at statements denouncing PiS by the prime minister and by a popular sportsman.</p>

<p>Distribution of emotions within threads chosen for analysis in JUL10 and FEB11 data sets. Figure shows percentages of posts within each thread with total emotions ranging from +1 to −4 (the latter is possible if one post expresses negative emotions against both politicians and forum users).

<p>We note here that FEB11 and FEB11Q data have quite different emotion averages (−0.461 vs. −0.338), despite similarity of the discussed topics. This difference is further supported by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test comparing the distributions of opinions. For both human and automatic analyses, the K-S test gives 0.075, which clearly indicates that the distributions for the two data sets as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0894439312436512">Table 1</xref> are significantly different.</p>

<title>Estimating Readers’ Political Sympathies</title>
<p>Internet discussion forums attract more people than the active authors of comments. Internet slang calls users who only read the discussions, without posting themselves, “lurkers,” and usually there is little that we can do to study the statistical properties of this group. An exception is the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894439312436512">Lawrence, Sides, and Farrell (2010</xref>), who has presented results on political blog readers, obtained from external 2006 Cooperative Congressional Election Study survey. The readers were found to be strongly polarized: about 94% of political blog readers read only blogs representing one side of the ideological spectrum. The remaining 6% read blogs from both sides.</p>
<p>We do not have the benefit of data outside the forum itself. Fortunately, it was possible to use data on how forum readers <italic>evaluated</italic> the posts shortly after they were written. This feature is present in the “new interface” data sets (JUL10 and FEB11), thanks to thumbs-up/thumbs-down buttons. This provides a measure of reactions of readers to the views presented by other users. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0894439312436512">Figure 5</xref> presents distribution of average opinions (normalized to the number of evaluations received) for supporters of different political options. PiS supporters, who are minority in the forum receive very few positive opinions and distribution increases toward totally negative −1 opinion/number of evaluations ratio. Opposite phenomenon is seen for PO supporters. Users with unknown political sympathies are as likely to get positive as negative opinion. This demonstrates that the readers share many characteristics of the active, writing participants of the forum.</p>

<p>Statistics of user evaluations (normalized to the number of evaluations received) as function of their affiliation in JUL10 and FEB 11 data sets.

</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0894439312436512-fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>We compared these distributions with a simple computer-based model of user behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894439312436512">Sobkowicz &amp; Sobkowicz, 2012</xref>). The model is based on an assumption that supporters of one party would give thumbs up to all posts recognized as supporting this party, and thumbs down to all posts supporting written by its opponents, while the undecided users would not give the evaluations. In such model, there is only one fitting parameter, PO/PiS support among the registered readers, and the best fit value estimates the sympathies of users who gave the evaluations. These were found to be very close to the ratio for the authors of the posts. The PO/PiS ratio for the evaluating readers, estimated from the best fit to the distributions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0894439312436512">Fig. 5</xref>, was 82.5/17.5 for JUL10 and 75/25 for FEB11 data. This should be compared with respective values of 84/16 and 75.6/24.4, as given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0894439312436512">Table 2</xref>. As the number of evaluations was much greater than the number of comments (on average each comment in the JUL10 set received 10.4 evaluations, and in FEB11 7.6), this almost exact correspondence of estimated political sympathies of the readers and the writers was somehow surprising.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>Our observation that only minuscule fraction of users changed their general political sympathies, and even less changed attitudes within a particular discussion thread is not particularly surprising. The general observations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0894439312436512">Wood (2000</xref>) may present two key reasons why political discussions in Internet forums that we studied lead to no significant opinion changes. First, highly emotional messages (such as invectives or provocations) serve to strengthen the political division. For the writers, they serve as self-identification statements, building the coherence within the in-group as well as the status of its active members. Any change of opinion by such writer is emotionally difficult. For the readers from the opposing camp, who are the targets of abuse, such messages arouse defensive mechanisms, protecting their self-valuation, which is a very strong psychological factor.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a mere presence of informative messages may not lead to deliberation and opinion changes. When the motive is other than achieving factual accuracy, selective processing focuses on bolstering own arguments. Even careful analysis of arguments and messages does not automatically increase tolerance and acceptance. Thoughtful consideration may be far from objective and unbiased; mental effort is often devoted to producing counterarguments, especially when the encountered arguments challenge strongly valued aspects of the self.</p>
<p>From the fact that political sympathies of the forum users in both camps was very stable, one might be tempted to conclude that the discussions serve no desirable social purpose. While the amount of abuse is, indeed, staggering, it is our opinion that providing users with a common agora has some positive effects, which may be improved through promoting certain types of activity.</p>
<p>The reason for our belief is an observation that without direct communication the two communities of supporters of PO and PiS would increasingly diverge in worldview, basing their opinions of totally separate sets of “factual” data and authorities. This goes beyond selection process mentioned in the previous section; there are examples when information sources simply do not contain any information “from the other side.” This phenomenon is observed especially in the context of the Smolensk plane crash, where the pro-PiS readers have gathered around several webpages containing claims supporting various conspiracy theories. These websites bear no relation to the official investigation and are cross-linked extensively among themselves, much like 9/11 conspiracy sites in the United States. Resulting false consensus leads to extremism of views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0894439312436512">Wojcieszak, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Participants of the studied discussion forums are, despite their political differences, rather special; they want to express their views in a way that reaches the other side. In fact, they want to communicate with the other side. In our analyses, we found many examples of users emphatically expressing their negative reaction to making person-to-person debate difficult. It was “the only topic on which they agreed,” to quote one of the posts. Forum administrators became a common enemy for both political camps, because they denied the right to personal exchanges. This may be compared to behavior of football hooligans, who fight each other, but unite when confronted by police trying to separate them. But perhaps there is more positive view of this unity—the need to talk.</p>
<p>The new forum interface with its diminished capacity for pairwise exchanges is dominated by “one shot” comments, which are not addressed to a concrete user but rather express writer’s view to world at large. To gain attention, these comments are usually more provocative and do not have to refer to opposite views. In contrast, when a user posts non-invective reply to another post, it is probable that he or she has read it. Experimental study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894439312436512">Palmer (2010</xref>) has shown that while simple exposure to negative argumentation leads to more extreme positions, this effect may be moderated by actual evaluation of messages, leading to more deliberative stance.</p>
<p>One of the main results of this study is related to the change of the user interface, which has led to drastically diminished number of inter-user exchanges. As most of these (in the old forum) have been in the form of quarrels between supporters of opposing political views, one may be tempted to claim that the interface change would lead to lessening of direct confrontations and, presumably, the level of conflict. This hypothesis is not confirmed by comparison of February 2011 data on discussions in two parallel forums with different interfaces. In fact, the “quarrel promoting” old interface FEB11Q data set shows much less emotion and more even distribution of links.</p>
<p>There may be several reasons for the less aggressive characteristics of FEB11Q discussions. The first is smaller role of the <italic>trolls</italic>. These are usually defined as users who post many comments aimed solely at provoking fights. Typical advice for discussion board users is “do not feed the troll,” which leaves trolls with significantly smaller indegree than the number of posts. Prolonged dialogues do not involve trolls. FEB11 set includes 13 users identified as trolls, while FEB11Q none.</p>
<p>The second difference comes from the opposite end of the user spectrum—one-time writers, who direct their posts at the source news message. The average emotion of such users in FEB11 set is −0.45, while for the FEB11Q set is only −0.35 (the distributions are dissimilar according to the K-S test). We attribute this difference to anticipation of the scoring mechanism present in FEB11 forum. Getting a large score (positive or negative) is a goal for many users—this is clear from the texts of the comments. It is less important whether the score is positive or negative, what counts is being noticed. This quite naturally motivates the users to more extreme positions in the forum where the evaluation mechanisms are present. The two versions of the forum differ also in the ways they promote reactions to agreeable/disagreeable post. Pushing the evaluation buttons does not really require thorough reading of the post, much less formulating any response. All it necessitates is a recognition of “a friend” or “an enemy.” In contrast, the old interface promotes person-to-person exchanges. Even though many of these consist of invectives, the users are forced to actually state what is it that they disagree with. Sometimes, even to explain in detail why they disagree. Quite often the flame and abuse on one side are met with calm and deliberation on the other side. Our findings indicate that person-to-person communication adds to the three modes reducing intergroup prejudices proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894439312436512">Pettigrew and Tropp (2008</xref>). Answering remarks of a concrete user increases understanding. It is still far from agreement or empathy, but there were numerous occasions where a dialogue evolved from accusations and invectives to explanations and arguments, decreasing emotional temperature. A reply to a post is treated as personal communication, not as general statement. This would not be possible if the only tool at the disposal of the reader is a simple approve/disapprove button—which is a direct suggestion related to design of the forums aimed at increasing social communication.</p>
<p>At the same time, the need to answer messages addressed directly to us may be exactly the challenge found as the source of open-mindedness—as observed by MacKuen et al. (2010).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894439312436512">Slater (2007</xref>) has postulated existence of a spiral of selective media use, leading to polarization of beliefs, actions, and attitudes, which again influences media use to become more selective. This process is clearly visible in Polish society; moreover, it has reached another level of positive feedback. The whole landscape of the media has changed, adjusting to polarization of the population. There is a clear division of pro-PO and pro-PiS newspapers, weeklies, and TV broadcasters. The polarization of media is so extreme that one of the nationwide TV stations has never invited any PO politician (even during 4 years PO has been in government), while prominently featuring PiS activists. The same split applies to journalists: lacking any pretense of neutrality and impartiality they have grouped themselves in journals that are clearly fighting on both sides of the political barricade. The positive feedback driving this change is not only via personal beliefs of the journalists. Polarized media sells very well; a new weekly publishing only anti-PO texts has catapulted to second place in circulation numbers just after 3 weeks after introduction.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we might look at the discussion forums with more hope than fear. Despite the generally negative emotions, the discussions provide a way of exposing oneself to the views of others and also require participants to formulate their positions in communicable way. Especially when two users engage in a meaningful dialogue, they use explanations rather than invectives. Based on the results, we suggest that to achieve better results in promoting understanding and bridging the polarization gap, the technology should facilitate user-to-user exchanges as much as possible. Instead of anonymous like/dislike polls, the interface should emphasize personal networking and also visibility of dialogs to other users. It is important that onlookers would see that it is possible to communicate across political division. Of course, large part of these messages would be, as we have shown, provocative or abusive. But the comparison of FEB11 and FEB11Q data shows that bigger fraction of person-to-person exchanges diminishes the negative emotional and confrontational status. Thus, properly designed Internet discussion forums might become one of the forces that pull people together, despite their differences, toward democratically desirable goal of participation and communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894439312436512">Stroud, 2010</xref>), even if the users remain fixed in their opinions. Such design considerations have already been subject of theoretical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894439312436512">Ren, Kraut, &amp; Kiesler, 2007</xref>). Taking into account observations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894439312436512">MacKuen et al. (2010</xref>), one might postulate a change in the role of moderators (representing, in our case, news company). They might, in addition to “policing” functions, add links to factual resources related to discussions, making the discussion more informative. As we argue here, the visual presentation plays an important role in shaping the reactions of the readers. Therefore, instead of simply hiding or deleting posts that are considered to break the rules of communication, the moderators might visually promote discussions that are based on novel argumentation and informative exchanges rather than those using invectives and provocations. This would diminish the visibility of trolls and provocateurs, and “set the tone” of the forum, without actually banning the extremist views.</p>
<p>Another approach to the improvement of quality of discussions has been suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0894439312436512">Wojcieszak and Mutz (2009</xref>), who observed that there is more deliberation in online groups, when politics is not a central purpose of discussions. An important argument for facilitation of user-to-user comments has been proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894439312436512">Kelly, Fisher, and Smith (2009</xref>). He points out that extremist users who have nothing interesting to state are actually avoided by other users, in a form of self-moderating mechanism.</p>
<p>Finally, we return to the possibility that some of the posts were written by paid agents of political parties, following specific scripts aimed at specific goals (such as sowing the discontent). In such a case, our observations would have to be reinterpreted. The paradigm of free, even anarchic, exchange of views between individual members of society would have to be replaced by a game between the “professionals” (representing PR branches of the political parties) and the rest of society interested in politics. While interesting from research point of view, this picture is a very disquieting one.</p>
