<abstract>
<p>This special issue of Small Group Research, entitled Teaching People about Groups, features six articles on the ways in which instructors of group courses (in several disciplines) can creatively teach group concepts and theories. Each article not only describes an actual course, some of which have been taught many times, but also identifies some of the issues that can arise in teaching a groups course. Taken together, the articles represent a valuable resource for anyone who teaches (or plans to teach) a course on small groups.</p>

<body>
<p>When I took my first and only faculty position, at the University of Pittsburgh back in 1978, one of the first undergraduate courses that I taught was Small Groups, and I have been teaching that course ever since. This (advanced) course is offered once a year and generally attracts 30 or so students, most of them Psychology majors.</p>
<p>The first time I taught Small Groups, I wasn’t sure what to do. I had never taught the course before; indeed, I don’t think the university where I went to graduate school even offered such a course. But I had taken some graduate courses on small groups, and several of my new colleagues in the Pittsburgh area were knowledgeable about groups (and thus could offer valuable advice), so it was possible to patch together a reasonable offering. Naturally, I made some mistakes that first time, but I was able to fix them in subsequent years (although my fixes sometimes turned out to be mistakes in their own right, requiring further changes later on). The course thus improved, slowly but surely, and although it is still far from perfect, I am proud of it. In fact, I was pleased to discover that my course shares several features of the courses described in this special issue.</p>
<p>But that whole learning experience would have been far easier if only I could have read something like the special issue you are reading now—a collection of articles by people who are actually teaching (and in many instances, have long taught) courses on small groups. The articles in this special issue, Teaching People About Groups, not only describe the courses but also include thoughtful discussions of several issues relevant to teaching people about groups (e.g., how much of a student’s course grade ought to depend on group experiences rather than on more traditional criteria, such as examination scores?). Please note that the articles in this special issue are not about using small groups to teach students about other topics, such as literature, science, or fine arts. One can find dozens of articles of that kind in other places. The articles in this issue focus specifically on how to teach students about groups.</p>
<p>How was this special issue produced? I began by broadcasting (in several ways) a general call for papers on teaching people about groups. Interested parties were asked to submit a brief description of their papers to the journal. Fifteen submissions were received. Each submission was then read and rated (independently) by the journal’s editorial staff (Aaron Brower, Lindred Greer, Joann Keyton, and me). These ratings were compiled and the six best submissions were identified. The relevant authors were then asked to submit full-length versions of their articles. I read each of those articles and sent suggestions for improvement to their authors. Each article was also read by the authors from two of the other articles, who submitted suggestions for improvement as well. Finally, I worked through several drafts of each article with its authors, to produce the best possible final version.</p>
<p>The articles in this issue are related to one another in a variety of ways, so it is rather difficult to specify the order in which they should be read. One could almost read the articles in any order and still derive full value from them. But one organizational scheme, it seems to me, is to separate the articles into two sets.</p>
<p>One set of articles in this issue, which includes the papers by McLeod; Schreiber and Valle; and Wildman and Bedwell, describes courses derived from particular theoretical approaches to learning in general and to groups in particular. McLeod, for example, derived many features of her course from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1046496413488803">Kolb’s (1984)</xref> theory of experiential learning. In her course, each week of the term is divided into two sessions. During the first session, students learn about a particular study from the literature on small groups, then try to reproduce that study themselves. During the second session, students read published articles related to the study they conducted, examine the data they collected, and then discuss the phenomenon they investigated, with a focus on its occurrence out in the real world. McLeod describes several ways in which all of these activities can be varied, depending on an instructor’s learning objectives. Schreiber and Valle derived many features of their course from Vygotsky’s views about social construction (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1046496413488803">Wertsch, 1985</xref>). Special features of that course include testing the students’ knowledge of course materials both individually and in groups, and requiring students to carry out group service projects that provide significant aid to community organizations. After completing its project, each group must write a paper and make a classroom presentation that both summarizes and analyzes its work. Finally, several features of the course described by Wildman and Bedwell were derived from the scientist–practitioner model of training, a model that guides education in several areas of psychology. Two special features of the course include requiring student groups to develop charters at the beginning of the term, that to set goals and to establish norms and related sanctions (for use if those norms are violated), and periodic guided group debriefings, meant to monitor the students’ progress on semester-long group projects and make any changes necessary for the successful completion of those projects. Wildman and Bedwell also describe several kinds of interesting data (e.g., measures of shared mental models) that can be collected from students in their course and then analyzed for insights into group work.</p>
<p>A second set of articles in this issue, which includes the articles by Gilson, Maynard, and Bergiel; Lehmann-Willenbrock, Meinecke, and Smith; and Waller, Golchehreh, and Ma, describes courses in which technology is used in some innovative way to enhance the students’ learning about groups. Gilson et al., for example, assigned students to virtual groups, which then spent the term operating a computer simulation of a Hollywood film studio. Some special features of this course are that group members often come from different time zones, or even different countries, and that course grades depend in part on peer evaluations of student contributions to their groups. Gilson et al. also describe several possible changes to their course, including the inclusion of new communication media (besides e-mail) and the addition of other kinds of tasks. Lehmann-Willenbrock et al. explored the use of a blog to teach students (who were taking related courses in the United States and Germany) about groups. Messages posted on that blog either (a) described and analyzed what a student had experienced in some group, relating those experiences to course materials, or (b) summarized one student’s reactions to something that another student had already posted. These reactions involved expressions of interest in, surprise about, or learning from the postings. Lehmann-Willenbrock et al. also offer some preliminary analyses of the blog postings from their course. Finally, Waller et al. trained students in their course to identify and analyze group phenomena shown in <italic>thin slices</italic> of various feature films. The premise of such training is that out in the real world, people seldom have a lot of time to observe and reflect on any group phenomena that occur. They must, instead, react quickly and in the best possible ways, without extensive analysis. The film clips used in the course are identified in the article, and the authors even consider what kinds of group phenomena are most or least suitable for this kind of film analysis.</p>
<p>Although the six articles in this issue cover a variety of interesting issues, there were (inevitably) a few issues that were not considered. For example, no one wrote about how many opportunities undergraduates actually have to take courses on small groups. Someone should investigate how many universities offer courses on groups, which departments sponsor such courses, how often the courses are taught, who is allowed to take them, and what topics are covered. There is broad agreement these days that group-related knowledge and skills are important for everyone, in every work setting, but how many undergraduates have a chance to acquire such knowledge and skills in their coursework?</p>
<p>Another issue involves the long-term practical value of the courses described in this issue. At most, the authors said that they liked the courses they taught and that their students seemed to like those courses as well, given their positive course evaluations. (Note that I cannot say much more than that about the value of my own course on groups either, despite the fact that I have taught it many times). Although these self-report data are encouraging, it would be better to gather more convincing evidence. Research on cognitive dissonance has shown that people often change their attitudes in an effort to justify their efforts, and so insofar as both instructors and students devote more time and energy to courses on groups than they do to courses of other kinds, it is not surprising that evaluations of groups courses are positive. Someone should plan and carry out a research project in which (comparable) undergraduate students who do or do not take courses on small groups are later evaluated to see how well they perform as work group members. Can it be shown that groups courses have real practical value for students? If not, then what can be done to enhance the value of those courses?</p>
<p>Finally, it seems to me that we should all try harder to share our expertise on groups with colleagues who teach courses in other fields where group work plays an important role. At my own university, it is estimated that more than half of all the courses taken by undergraduates require some form of group work. Yet to my knowledge, the students in those courses seldom receive any guidance from instructors about how to ensure that their groups perform well. It should be possible to produce a brief handout or brochure that would help students to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of group work. In my own course, the students often moan and groan as soon as they learn that they will be assigned to groups whose performance will influence their course grades. These negative attitudes seem to stem from bad experiences with group work that the students have already had in other courses. We should try to limit such experiences.</p>
<p>Clearly, there is much to consider when it comes to teaching people about groups. This special issue is just a start. I have been thinking that it might be worthwhile to create a website devoted to teaching people about groups, a website at which various resources could be offered and discussions held. If anyone out there views this as an appealing option, then please contact me; maybe we can put something together.</p>
