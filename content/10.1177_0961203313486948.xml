<abstract>
<p>This study examined the contribution of pain and psychological distress to fatigue.</p>
<sec id="sec7-0961203313486948"><title>Methods</title>
<p>One-hundred and twenty-five adult Caucasian and Hispanic lupus patients participated in this study. Demographic data, patient- and physician-reported disease activity, as well as psychological functioning, were collected. Fatigue, pain, and vitality were measured using visual analogue scales as well as a subscale of the SF-36 questionnaire. Linear and hierarchical regression analyses were conducted. In the regression analysis, ethnicity was entered at the first step, followed by age, income and education at step 2, pain and disease activity measures at step 3, and psychological measurements at step 4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0961203313486948"><title>Results</title>
<p>In the linear regression analysis, Caucasians reported more fatigue. Fatigue positively correlated with income, education, pain, patient-reported disease activity, helplessness, and depression, and negatively with internality, and the energy analysis mirrored the results of the fatigue analysis. In the first regression analysis, fatigue was the dependent variable. At step 1, Caucasians reported more fatigue. At step 2, no other demographic variables were significant. At step 3, pain and disease activity measures were significant when entered as a block; however, pain independently explained a large amount of variance. At step 4, psychological factors were significant as a block, with depression being the strongest predictor. In the second analysis, energy was the dependent variable. At step 1, Hispanics reported more energy. At step 2, demographic variables were not significant. At step 3, pain and disease activity were significant when entered as a block; however, only pain uniquely predicted energy. At step 4, psychological factors were significant as a block, with depression as the major contributor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0961203313486948"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Both pain and depression were found to be strong predictors of fatigue, and negatively correlated with energy. Disease activity did not appear to play a significant role in lupus fatigue. These findings support the importance of managing depression and pain in order to reduce fatigue in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961203313486948" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease that primarily affects women of reproductive age. Multiple factors have been demonstrated to influence quality of life in lupus patients. Previous studies have shown that fatigue is one of the major factors influencing health-related quality of life in lupus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313486948">1</xref></sup> Among the many symptoms often associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), fatigue is the most common complaint, affecting anywhere from 50% to more than 80% of patients in some studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313486948">2</xref></sup> Despite the high prevalence of fatigue in lupus, the mechanisms underlying fatigue are generally poorly understood. Various explanations have been proposed for the association between lupus and fatigue. One theory links fatigue to the disease process itself and the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with it. This theory is supported by the observation that fatigue increases during disease flares. However, this theory cannot explain the persistence of elevated fatigue beyond the time of the disease flare. A contrasting theory links psychological factors, including mood disturbances, and poor sleep to fatigue in SLE. A third hypothesis suggests that while fatigue may start as a physiologic process linked to disease activity, psychological factors may either exacerbate it or contribute to its persistence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313486948">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our study group has focused on examining the role of psychological determinants in different aspects related to quality of life in a cohort of patients from four major academic centers in Southern California (Cedars-Sinai, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), University of Southern California (USC), and Loma Linda University). In our present analysis, we investigated the determinants of fatigue and energy in our Southern California lupus cohort, examining the role of ethnicity, other demographic factors, disease activity, and psychological factors on lupus fatigue and vitality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203313486948" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>One hundred and twenty-five adult Caucasian and Hispanic lupus patients were enrolled in the study. The patients were diagnosed with lupus based on at least four criteria for SLE according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313486948">4</xref></sup> At the time of their routine scheduled appointments, participants were asked to complete a battery of questionnaires. Some questionnaires (including the Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire (SLAQ) and quality of life assessments), were mailed again three months later. However, the results discussed in this paper center on the cross-sectional analyses only.</p>
<p>Disease activity was assessed from both the patient and the physician perspective. Patient-reported disease activity was evaluated by the SLAQ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313486948">5</xref></sup> Physician-reported disease activity was assessed at the time of the visit using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease activity Index (SLEDAI), a well-known validated disease activity measure in SLE studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313486948">6</xref></sup> A SLEDAI score of more than 3 is considered active disease.</p>
<p>Psychological measures included the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) as well as the Helplessness and Internality subscales of the Rheumatology Attitudes Index (RAI), a 15-item questionnaire modified from the Arthritis Helplessness Index.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313486948">7</xref></sup> A study by Engle etÂ al. supported the external validity of the RAI in SLE and also suggested that in lupus the learned helplessness index may be relevant to the outcomes of morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313486948">8</xref></sup> The RAI is composed of two subscales, one measuring helplessness (five items), and the other measuring internality/perceived control (seven items). The PHQ-9 is used as an instrument to measure depression in patients and is based on the nine criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) for the diagnosis of depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313486948">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Quality of life was assessed using the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire, a well-established tool that measures quality of life in eight areas of perceived health: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality (energy), social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313486948">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fatigue was assessed using two types of instruments, the SF-36 vitality subscale and the fatigue visual analogue scale (FVAS). The SF-36 vitality included four questions that assessed energy (two items) and fatigue (two items). As noted, this instrument assesses both vitality and fatigue, not reflecting a single continuum, but rather two different positive (energetic) and negative (tired) states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313486948">11</xref></sup> Visual analogue scales, commonly used instruments in rheumatology and pain management, were used for the assessment of fatigue (FVAS) and pain (PVAS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313486948">12</xref></sup> The patients were asked to assess their pain and fatigue levels by indicating a position on a continuous 10-centimeter scale.</p>
<p>The statistical analysis included linear as well as hierarchical multiple regression analyses, one with fatigue as the dependent variable, the other with vitality (energy) as the dependent variable. The model that we used for the hierarchical multiple regression analyses included four steps to evaluate the stepwise contribution of independent variables. Predictor variables were entered into the equation in the following sequence. Ethnicity was entered at step 1. At step 2, annual income, age, and education (socioeconomic factors) were introduced. At step 3, pain (PVAS) and disease activity measurements (SLAQ and SLEDAI) were added. Finally, in step 4, psychological measurements of depression (PHQ-9), helplessness, and internality (RAI) were included in the analysis. In this manner, the independent contribution of psychological variables was examined after evaluating the effects of all prior variables.</p>
<p>In order to avoid the risk of a type I statistical error in the multiple comparisons that were performed, we applied the Simes correction, a derivative of the Bonferroni procedure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203313486948">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203313486948">14</xref></sup> to all the <italic>p</italic> values for each of the analyses performed. We reported as statistically significant only the <italic>p</italic> values that were found to be statistically significant after applying the Simes correction.</p>

<p>At step 1 of the hierarchical multiple regression analysis, ethnicity was found to be a significant factor, with Caucasians reporting more fatigue. At step 2, while the effect of ethnicity remained significant, the contribution of age, education, and income was not. At step 3, the addition of pain and disease activity measures accounted for significant variability in fatigue (<italic>F</italic> changeâ=â77.54). Higher pain, lower disease activity, and higher education independently predicted fatigue, while the effect of ethnicity remained significant. Pain (PVAS) had by far the strongest relationship (<italic>p</italic>â&lt;â.001) with fatigue. At step 4, the addition of psychological factors (helplessness, internality, depression) was significant (<italic>F</italic> changeâ=â5.2). Depression was strongly correlated (<italic>p</italic>â&lt;â.001) with fatigue. The correlations between fatigue and pain, ethnicity, and SLEDAI remained significant. However, after applying the Simes correction, only pain and depression were found to be correlated with fatigue. Helplessness and internality were unrelated to fatigue.</p>
<p>In the second analysis, energy (measured as a component of the SF-36 questionnaire) was the dependent variable. In the linear regression analysis, Hispanics reported more energy. Energy (vitality) was negatively correlated with age, income, education, pain, patient-reported disease activity, and depression, and was positively correlated with internality, mirroring the results from the fatigue analysis, where almost the same variables were found to be positively correlated with fatigue. Notably, in both cases physician-reported disease activity was not correlated with either fatigue or energy. For the hierarchical regression analysis, the model described above in the Methods section was applied (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0961203313486948">Table 3</xref>). At step 1, ethnicity was found to be again significant (<italic>p</italic>â&lt;â.001), with Hispanics reporting more energy. At step 2, lower age and Hispanic ethnicity were found to be significant (<italic>p</italic>â&lt;â.05), while education and income did not contribute to the variability of energy. At step 3, pain and disease activity measures were significant when entered as a block (<italic>F</italic> changeâ=â15). When examined independently, only pain negatively predicted energy (<italic>p</italic>â&lt;â.001). At step 4, the contribution of psychological factors was significant (<italic>F</italic> changeâ=â6.7). Lower depression was related to higher energy, while the contribution of pain remained significant. No other factors significantly predicted energy at this final step, and this was confirmed by applying the Simes correction.

<sec id="sec4-0961203313486948" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The contribution of disease activity versus psychological factors in lupus fatigue has been an ongoing debate among researchers. While a study by Tayer etÂ al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313486948">3</xref></sup> found that disease status was the only predictor of fatigue over time, somewhat contrasting results have been reported in other studies. As an example, in a first study by Wang etÂ al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313486948">15</xref></sup> fatigue was found to be highly correlated with the presence of depression, and no significant correlation was found between Fatigue Severity Score (FSS) and the SLEDAI. In a follow-up study by the same group,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313486948">16</xref></sup> fatigue correlated strongly with poor health status, as measured by the SF-36, and higher tender point counts. No significant correlation was found with disease activity, measured by the SLEDAI or Systemic Lupus Activity Measure-Revised (SLAM-R), or disease damage, as measured by the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC)/ACR damage index.</p>
<p>Research by Jump etÂ al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313486948">17</xref></sup> found that pain and depression were both positive predictors of fatigue, while perceived social support was negatively related to fatigue scores. Similarly, in the Lupus in Minorities: Nature vs Nurture (LUMINA) cohort, the investigators reported a correlation between increased levels of fatigue and the presence of pain, abnormal illness-related behaviors, helplessness, and constitutional manifestations; however, no correlation was found with lupus-specific measures, such as disease activity and damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203313486948">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our analyses, pain and depression were the main determinants of fatigue in lupus and negatively correlated with energy. None of the sociodemographic and disease activity-related measurements were found to be correlated with fatigue in the hierarchical regression analysis model. Neither fatigue nor energy appears to be the direct result of heightened lupus disease activity. It is possible, however, that disease activity may contribute to fatigue by influencing other variables that contribute to fatigue over time. For example, heightened disease activity may lead to pain and depression that, in turn, exacerbate fatigue. More complex models of lupus fatigue are needed to understand the pathways that link disease activity with fatigue and other functional outcomes. Such analyses would help the development of treatment approaches aimed at the factors that serve as mediators of fatigue. However, the weight of the evidence from this and previous studies does not suggest that reductions in disease activity alone would lead to improvement in fatigue and energy.</p>
<p>Limitations of our study included the cross-sectional nature of the data, the relatively small sample of patients and the fact that the patients were recruited from major academic centers and therefore may not accurately represent the community population. The study included the two prevalent ethnic groups in Southern California, Hispanic and Caucasian; however, other ethnic groups such as Asians and African-Americans were excluded, which is a limitation of our study. Another limitation could be that we did not assess other variables that could have affected fatigue in our population. For example, in a recent study by Murphy etÂ al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313486948">19</xref></sup> anxiety was found to be almost twice as common as depression in patients with arthritic disease. In another study by Bachen etÂ al., patients with lupus were reported to have, besides depression, a high prevalence of anxiety disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203313486948">20</xref></sup> Iaboni etÂ al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203313486948">21</xref></sup> found that primary sleep disorders, sleepiness, and depression were common in lupus patients who reported fatigue. Based on their research, the authors concluded that there is a distinction between tiredness in SLE that is the result of excessive daytime sleepiness and tiredness from depression, and that such distinctions can help identify appropriate treatment for tired patients with SLE.</p>
<p>In our study, we used the visual analogue scale for assessing fatigue, along with the SF-36 vitality subscale. A criticism of the FVAS is that it captures a unique point in time to assess fatigue (it is based on a one-week symptom recollection) and may therefore not reflect the overall fatigue burden, since patients with lupus can have variable fatigue complaints from day to day. Thus, another possible explanation for the lack of correlation of fatigue with disease activity in our study would be that ongoing, daily disease activity, as opposed to a distinct lupus flare, could contribute to fatigue as well. Those could be limitations and potential explanations for the discrepancies noted between fatigue and disease activity in some of the studies, including ours.</p>
<p>Our results support the major role of psychosocial factors in lupus fatigue. In two previous studies from the same cohort, we showed that depression predicts self-reported disease activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203313486948">22</xref></sup> and was the major determinant of quality of life in lupus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203313486948">23</xref></sup> In addition to depression, pain was found to have a significant impact on fatigue. Our data thus support the need for assessing pain and depression among patients with SLE and the importance of treating mood disorders and pain in order to improve lupus fatigue.</p>
