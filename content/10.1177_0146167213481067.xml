<abstract>
<p>We used an achievement goal framework to enhance identity-threatened individuals’ motivation and performance by way of an understudied mechanism, namely, challenge appraisals. In three experiments, women were given a mastery goal (focus on building skills) or a performance goal (perform well, avoid errors) before a mock job interview. Women who focused on mastery rather than performance felt more challenged and less threatened when anticipating an identity-threatening interview; goals did not affect appraisals of a nonthreatening interview (Experiment 1). Mastery relative to performance goals enhanced women’s intention to be assertive (Experiment 2) and their actual face-to-face performance during the job interview (Experiment 3); challenge appraisals (but not threat appraisals) served as a mediator for these effects. Whereas a great deal of prior work has alleviated identity threat by altering construals of one’s identity, the current research uses an alternative strategy—modifying appraisals of the <italic>situation</italic>, leaving one’s self-concept intact.</p>

<p>Turn your wounds into wisdom. You will be wounded many times in your life. You’ll make mistakes. Some people will call them failures but I have learned that failure is really God’s way of saying, “Excuse me, you’re moving in the wrong direction.” It’s just an experience, just an experience.</p>

<p>Oprah Winfrey’s statement succinctly captures how adversity and obstacles may be interpreted in very different ways: as a personal failure, a wrong decision, or a learning experience. The same objective reality can look very different depending on how people appraise or make meaning of the situation. These appraisals then affect how people act, which in turn have important downstream consequences, both short-term and long-term. Consider situations in which professionals face difficulty at work, students struggle with classes important to their major, or musicians stumble over new repertoires. The way in which individuals handle these difficulties is shaped by their mind-set (i.e., their goal orientation) as they approach the situation. A goal to perform successfully or avoiding failure may be demoralizing if one’s performance ends up being mediocre or one’s goals are blocked by unexpected obstacles. However, a focus on learning in a difficult situation casts the same obstacles in a different light, where adversity is an opportunity to acquire new skills. In this case, regardless of performance, individuals can remain engaged and confident in the fact that they can always learn something from the experience no matter the difficulty.</p>
<p>One type of adversity that many individuals face in professional and achievement contexts is social identity threat. This phenomenon occurs when individuals become aware that their social group does not fit in or belong in a particular professional or academic environment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0146167213481067">C. M. Steele, Spencer, &amp; Aronson, 2002</xref>). Sometimes, social identity threat arises in situations that activate a specific stereotype questioning one’s in-group’s ability in a particular domain (i.e., stereotype threat), such as negative stereotypes questioning women’s ability in math and science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167213481067">Spencer, Steele, &amp; Quinn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167213481067">J. R. Steele, James, &amp; Barnett, 2002</xref>). Other times, social identity threat has nothing to do with pre-existing stereotypes. Rather, it takes the form of general belonging threat wherein one feels alienated because one’s in-group is invisible in a situation, even when the situation does not activate group-specific stereotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0146167213481067">C. M. Steele, Spencer, et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0146167213481067">Stout &amp; Dasgupta, 2011</xref>). Whatever its form, social identity threat can make individuals feel unwelcomed, underperform, and leave a domain, or disengage psychologically if they cannot exit.</p>
<p>Social identity threat occurs mostly in high performance contexts where individuals’ primary goal is to demonstrate their ability and avoid mistakes. Paradoxically, this performance orientation may be part of the reason people feel unmotivated and alienated when social identity threat obstructs their goal and undermines their performance. We propose that if individuals approach high performance contexts with a different goal in mind—<italic>the goal to learn and master new skills</italic>—they will appraise the situation as a challenge, which may, in turn, enhance motivation, confidence, and, ultimately, performance.</p>
<sec id="section1-0146167213481067">
<title>Achievement Goals: The Benefit of Focusing on Mastery Rather Than Performance</title>
<p>A large body of research indicates that when individuals are in achievement-oriented contexts such as classes or professional settings, their goals or mind-set influence their thoughts, feelings, and actions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167213481067">A. J. Elliot, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167213481067">Hulleman, Schrager, Bodmann, &amp; Harackiewicz, 2010</xref>). People tend to enter achievement settings with a goal of <italic>demonstrating</italic> competence and focusing on being evaluated (a <italic>performance goal</italic>) or with a goal of <italic>developing</italic> competence and learning new skills (a <italic>mastery</italic> goal; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167213481067">Dweck, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167213481067">E. Elliot &amp; Dweck, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Of particular relevance to our research is the fact that achievement goals have differential effects on how people react to performance failure and poor evaluations. Relative to performance goals, mastery goals tend to make individuals feel less discouraged and perform better after a setback, such as low performance evaluation, especially if they have fragile self-confidence in their ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167213481067">E. Elliot &amp; Dweck, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167213481067">Grant &amp; Dweck, 2003</xref>). This effect can be understood as follows: poor performance signals an inability to <italic>demonstrate</italic> competence, but does not impair one’s ability to <italic>develop</italic> competence. As such, low performance evaluation can be demoralizing when one is focused on performance versus mastery goals. Although past research has shown that mastery goals can maintain motivation and performance after failure, the literature has yet to put forth a clear hypothesis and empirical evidence illuminating the underlying mechanism—<italic>why</italic> do mastery goals facilitate subsequent performance?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0146167213481067">
<title>What is the Root of a Mastery Goal’s Benefits?</title>
<p>We predict that a focus on mastery rather than performance allows one to construe adversity as a challenge thereby facilitating an approach orientation and performance. This prediction is informed by stress and coping theory, which indicates that the demands of an adverse situation may be appraised as exceeding one’s personal resources, which result in feeling <italic>threatened</italic> and is followed by inhibitory responses. Alternatively, the same demands may be appraised as something that can be overcome, which result in feeling <italic>challenged</italic> and is followed by activational responses (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167213481067">Blascovich &amp; Mendes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167213481067">Lazarus, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167213481067">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Threat and challenge have been measured in a variety of ways in psychology including the use of physiological indices (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167213481067">Blascovich &amp; Mendes, 2000</xref>), self-reported emotions that signal inhibition or activation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167213481067">Derks, Van Laar, &amp; Ellemers, 2009</xref>), and cognitive appraisals assessing the personal relevance of a situation and if its demands outweigh one’s personal resources (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167213481067">Folkman, Lazarus, Dunkel-Schetter, Delongis, &amp; Gruen, 1986</xref>). Because of inhibition, threat predicts anxiety and results in avoidance behaviors and impaired performance; because of activation, challenge predicts confidence and results in approach-oriented behavior and enhanced performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167213481067">Folkman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167213481067">Folkman, &amp; Lazarus, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167213481067">Lazarus, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0146167213481067">Tomaka, Blascovich, Kelsey, &amp; Leitten, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>In the current research, we predicted that mastery goals would lead individuals to appraise an adverse situation (social identity threat) as a challenge, which would enhance approach-oriented behavioral intentions and performance. Importantly, we expected that increased challenge (but not decreased threat) will be the underlying process that drives improved performance in response to a mastery goal. Moreover, we predicted that performance goals (compared with mastery goals) would lead individuals to appraise high-stakes situations as a threat, report avoidance-oriented behavioral intentions, and exhibit impaired performance.</p>

<title>The Aversiveness of Social Identity Threat and Ways to Overcome It</title>
<p>Individuals who belong to societally devalued groups are especially attentive to cues in achievement settings that signal whether their in-group is accepted and welcomed therein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167213481067">Walton &amp; Cohen, 2007</xref>). These cues may be overt such as clear instances of discrimination (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167213481067">J. R. Steele, James, et al., 2002</xref>) or covert such as noticing the virtual absence of in-group members (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167213481067">Murphy, Steele, &amp; Gross, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0146167213481067">Stout, Dasgupta, Hunsinger, &amp; McManus, 2011</xref>). Once people pick up on identity threat in an achievement setting, they feel a deflated sense of belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167213481067">Cheryan, Plaut, Davies, &amp; Steele, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167213481067">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>), express less positive attitudes and domain identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0146167213481067">J. R. Steele &amp; Ambady, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0146167213481067">Stout et al., 2011</xref>), less self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167213481067">Stangor, Carr, &amp; Kiang, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167213481067">Walton &amp; Cohen, 2007</xref>), and avoid or drop out of those settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167213481067">Kiefer &amp; Sekaquaptewa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167213481067">J. R. Steele, James, et al., 2002</xref>). Social identity threat also increases anxiety and negative thoughts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167213481067">Bosson, Haymovitz, &amp; Pinel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0146167213481067">Vick, Seery, Blascovich, &amp; Weisbuch, 2008</xref>), as well as a preoccupation with failure avoidance rather than performance enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167213481067">Brodish &amp; Devine, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167213481067">Seibt &amp; Forster, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167213481067">Smith, 2006</xref>), all of which take a toll on actual performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167213481067">Keller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167213481067">Seibt &amp; Forster, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0146167213481067">C.

<p>These findings raise the important question—what strategies help people overcome social identity threat? Research indicates that individuals can focus on alternative, nonstigmatized identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213481067">Shih, Pittinsky, &amp; Ambady, 1999</xref>), reflect on values important to the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167213481067">Cohen, Garcia, Apfel, &amp; Master, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167213481067">Martens, Johns, Greenberg, &amp; Schimel, 2006</xref>), focus on similarities between their in-group and successful out-groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167213481067">Rosenthal &amp; Crisp, 2006</xref>), think about their ability as malleable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167213481067">Aronson, Fried, &amp; Good, 2002</xref>), or benefit from contact with competent in-group role models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167213481067">Marx &amp; Roman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167213481067">McIntyre, Paulson, &amp; Lord, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0146167213481067">Stout et al., 2011</xref>). Collectively, prior research has sought to ward off the negative effects of identity threat by teaching individuals to modify their <italic>social identity</italic> or <italic>self-concept</italic>. In contrast, our research focuses on one’s appraisal of the <italic>situation</italic>, with a goal to learn and grow therein.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0146167213481067">
<title>Theoretical Contributions of the Current Research</title>
<p>Our work integrates theoretical literatures in social psychology—achievement goals, social identity threat, and stress and coping—to make three important theoretical contributions. First, our proposed intervention is predicted to <italic>promote challenge</italic> and confidence in the adverse situation, which will be the driving force behind individuals’ intent to approach and actually do well in the face of identity threat. In contrast, prior research alleviates the pernicious effects of identity threat by focusing on threat reduction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167213481067">Johns, Inzlicht, &amp; Schmader, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167213481067">Schmader, Forbes, Zhang, &amp; Mendes, 2009</xref>). Although a few studies have measured increases in physiological challenge in response to identity threat (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167213481067">Derks et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167213481067">Derks, Scheepers, Van Laar, &amp; Ellemers, 2011</xref>), these studies did not measure its link to subsequent performance, which is an explicit goal of our work. Other work has measured threat and challenge appraisals of an identity-threatening task but did not endeavor to <italic>manipulate</italic> those appraisals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167213481067">Berjot, Roland-Levy, &amp; Girault-Lidvan, 2011</xref>), as was our aim.</p>
<p>Second, whereas other types of interventions have sought to alleviate identity threat by altering how people perceive <italic>their self-concept</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167213481067">Shih et al., 1999</xref>), <italic>their personal values</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167213481067">Cohen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167213481067">Martens et al., 2006</xref>), or their <italic>group identity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167213481067">Derks et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167213481067">Derks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167213481067">Rosenthal &amp; Crisp, 2006</xref>), our intervention alters people’s perception of <italic>their situation</italic>, thereby leaving one’s identity intact. One notable exception to this lies in the recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167213481067">Alter, Aronson, Darley, Rodriguez, and Ruble (2010)</xref> who asked individuals to view an ability test as a tool to increase future performance rather than thinking of it as diagnostic of current ability; the authors found that such an appraisal increased performance. However, they did not identify what underlying <italic>mechanism</italic> (e.g., challenge, threat, or something else) was driving improved performance, which, again, is a key focus in our research.</p>
<p>Third, whereas prior research has compared the impact of an approach-oriented performance goal to an avoidance-oriented performance goal (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167213481067">Keller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167213481067">Seibt &amp; Forster, 2004</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167213481067">Chalabaev, Major, Cury, &amp; Sarrazin, 2009</xref>) or focused narrowly on the detrimental impact of a performance-avoid goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167213481067">Brodish &amp; Devine, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167213481067">Smith, 2006</xref>) on performance in identity-threatening situations, we sought to pit all three goal types against each other with the clear prediction that mastery will be most beneficial in terms of psychological challenge processes and downstream effects on behavior.</p>

<title>Overview of Experiments</title>
<p>Across three experiments, female college students participated in a mock job interview—a professional situation that is highly relevant to college students as they prepare for the job market after graduation. They were told to enter the job interview with either a mastery goal or a performance goal in mind. In one condition, the interview was made identity threatening when women discovered that the interviewer consistently used gender-exclusive language as he spoke to them, which tacitly ignored women by referring to all future employees as “he” and “him.” In another condition, the interview was made nonthreatening when the interviewer consistently used gender-neutral language (e.g., “one,” “them”). We tested participants’ stress appraisals (how challenged vs. threatened they felt) of the ensuing job interview (Experiments 1-3), their behavioral intentions to be assertive therein (Experiment 2), and their actual behavior during the interview (Experiment 3). We then examined whether increased challenge (or decreased threat) mediated changes in behavioral intentions and actual behavior in the job interview (Experiments 2-3). Importantly, we also disaggregated two different types of performance goals—striving for success (performance-approach goal) versus avoiding failure (performance-avoid goal)—and compared the impact of each performance goal versus a mastery goal on women’s stress appraisals and behaviors in the job interview. Across all three experiments, we predicted that compared with the two performance goals, women who adopted a mastery goal would feel more challenged and less threatened. Greater challenge (rather than less threat) would elicit more assertive behavioral intentions and better performance.</p>

<p>Social identity threat was manipulated during a “pre-interview” meeting with the interviewer where he offered a brief overview of the type of job for which participants were interviewing. In the identity-threatening condition, the interviewer always used gender-exclusive language (e.g., he, him, guys) in describing the job. Our prior research using this type of manipulation has demonstrated that women perceive gender-exclusive language to be sexist and identity threatening compared with gender-neutral language but that men are personally unaffected by gender-exclusive language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0146167213481067">Stout &amp; Dasgupta, 2011</xref>). The specifics of the job were left vague so that participants’ own career interests could easily fit into the hypothetical job description. The job overview described an entry-level position that encouraged creativity and individual expression in a fast-paced and competitive work environment; the organization also distributed employees’ workload fairly and utilized a reward system for superior work performance. See <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0146167213481067">Appendix A</xref> for both versions of the job description.</p>

<title>Threat and challenge measures</title>
<p>Perceived threat in anticipation of the job interview was assessed by asking participants to rate the extent to which they felt “anxious” and “worried” as they thought about the upcoming interview using a scale ranging from (1) <italic>not at all</italic> to (7) <italic>very much</italic> (α = .85). Challenge in anticipation of the job interview was assessed by asking participants to rate the extent to which they felt “confident” and “determined,” using a scale ranging from (1) <italic>not at all</italic> to (7) <italic>very much</italic> (α = .86). These emotion items were borrowed from classic research on appraisal theory, which used these stimuli to measure threat (anxiety; fear) and challenge (confidence, eagerness; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167213481067">Folkman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167213481067">Folkman, &amp; Lazarus, 1985</xref>). Contemporary research continues to use these types of emotion items to measure threat and challenge (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167213481067">Chalabaev et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167213481067">Derks et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167213481067">McGregor &amp; Elliot, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, these two groupings of emotions nicely map onto the inhibitory versus activational nature of threat versus challenge, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167213481067">Blascovich &amp; Mendes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167213481067">Lazarus, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167213481067">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</xref>).</p>

<title>Manipulation check</title>
<p>The following three items assessed the extent to which the interviewer was perceived as sexist in the social identity threat condition compared with the nonthreat condition: “Was the way in which the interviewer described the work environment sexist?” (1) <italic>not at all sexist</italic> to (7) <italic>very sexist</italic>; “Was the way in which the interviewer described the work environment gender-neutral, or did it favor one gender over the other?” (1) <italic>favored women</italic> to (7) <italic>favored men</italic>; and “Based on the way in which the representative described the work environment, how macho would you estimate the work environment at this organization to be?” (1) <italic>not at all macho</italic> to (7) <italic>very macho</italic> (α = .82).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Upon arrival, participants met a female experimenter who informed them that the study was in collaboration with a career development program at the university. The mission of this alleged program was to prepare students to enter the workforce by offering practice job interviews. The current study was purportedly designed to assess which, among a variety of interviewing formats, was most helpful to prepare students for the job market. Participants were then given either a mastery goal or a performance goal to keep in mind during the job interview. Next, they were taken to a separate room for a “pre-interview” where they met individually with a male interviewer who gave them an overview of the job for which they would interview. The interviewer was played by two male confederates who were dressed in business casual attire and trained to maintain a friendly yet professional demeanor throughout the interview. The confederate interviewer recited a scripted job overview verbatim in a way that sounded natural (his script was the social identity threat manipulation depicted in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0146167213481067">Appendix A</xref>). If participants requested details about the job, interviewers were trained to deflect questions by saying “You will have a chance to ask questions in the next portion of the interview.”</p>
<p>The interviewer then told participants that they would complete a questionnaire relevant to the interviewing process before the actual interview. He then escorted participants to a separate room to complete a computerized questionnaire that included the dependent variables: perceived threat and challenge (counterbalanced), followed by the perceived sexism manipulation check. Once finished, participants were informed that there would be no interview; they were debriefed, probed for suspicion, and thanked for participating.</p>

<p>In sum, Experiment 1 showed that achievement goals altered women’s appraisals of an upcoming job interview with an interviewer who created an identity-threatening environment.

However, as expected, achievement goals did not alter women’s appraisals of a nonidentity-threatening interview. These findings provide initial evidence that a mastery goal is more beneficial than a performance goal for women approaching professional situations that raise the specter of identity threat.</p>

<sec id="section19-0146167213481067">
<title>Experiment 2</title>
<p>Past research indicates that performance goals come in two varieties, such that one focuses on preventing failure (performance-avoid goal) and a second focuses on demonstrating one’s competence (performance-approach goals; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167213481067">A. J. Elliot, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167213481067">A. J. Elliot &amp; Church, 1997</xref>). Importantly, a performance-avoid goal predicts higher anxiety, lower intrinsic motivation, and greater self-doubt than both a mastery goal and a performance-approach goal (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167213481067">Dickhäuser, Buch, &amp; Dickhäuser, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167213481067">McGregor &amp; Elliot, 2002</xref>). Performance-approach goals, although somewhat better, also tend to produce worse outcomes than mastery goals, such as a fear of failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167213481067">A. J. Elliot, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167213481067">A. J. Elliot &amp; McGregor, 1999</xref>) and deflated motivation, lower self-worth, and impaired performance after negative feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167213481067">Grant &amp; Dweck, 2003</xref>). In sum, both types of performance goals tend to be less beneficial than mastery goals, but performance-approach goals tend to be better than performance-avoid goals.</p>
<p>In Experiment 2, we sought to compare the impact of all three types of achievement goals on women’s stress appraisals as well as their behavioral intentions in an identity-threatening job interview. We predicted that a mastery goal would lead women to feel most challenged and least threatened; in comparison, a performance-avoid goal would lead to least challenge and most threat; and a performance-approach goal would fall in between. Having established in Experiment 1 that goals do not change women’s appraisals of a nonidentity-threatening interview, we did away with this condition in Experiment 2. Instead, the control condition in Experiment 2 was one in which women were not given any explicit goal instruction for their upcoming (identity threatening) interview.</p>
<p>A second goal of Experiment 2 was to capture women’s behavioral intentions to confront the identity-threatening situation rather than shy away from it by examining the degree to which they intended to be assertive during the upcoming interview. Finally, we investigated whether appraisals of challenge (but not threat) serve as the underlying process that mediates the beneficial effect of mastery goals on women’s behavioral intentions in the job interview. Of interest, threat and challenge are correlated in our work (<italic>r</italic> = .57, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, collapsed across all three experiments), but there is a large amount of nonoverlapping variance between the two constructs, suggesting that they are distinct phenomena. The multiple mediation analyses in this experiment and Experiment 3 also indicate that threat and challenge are related yet distinct in their effects on intentions and behavior. Based on previous research showing that challenge is associated with activating emotions, activating physiological responses, and the motivation to overcome obstacles but threat is associated with inhibiting emotions, inhibiting physiological responses, and the motivation to avoid harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167213481067">Folkman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167213481067">Lazarus, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0146167213481067">Tomaka et al., 1993</xref>), we predicted that challenge would be the critical mediator. That is, increased challenge, but not decreased threat, would significantly mediate and strengthen women’s intentions to be assertive in an identity-threatening context.</p>

<p>During the interview, try to focus on performing as well as you can. Being the best interviewee is important right now. If you focus on demonstrating your ability and performing well during this interview, it will be helpful later on when you apply for jobs.</p>

Two of these new items gauged participants’ motivation to avoid or retreat, which is part of feeling threatened: “I just want to finish the interview quickly and leave” and “I want to get the interview over with.” These were added to the previous threat items (“I feel anxious” and “I feel worried”); the measure’s α = .75.</p>
<p>The remaining two new items gauged participants’ eagerness and interest in approaching a difficult task, which are part of feeling challenged: “I am really looking forward to the interview”; “I am glad that I will get to do the upcoming interview.” These were added to the previous challenge items (“I feel confident” and “I feel determined”); the measure’s α = .79.

Our comparison of theoretical interest was between women who held mastery versus performance goals (both approach and avoid); we expected that mastery goals would promote stronger assertive intentions than performance goals because women felt comparatively more challenged (but not less threatened). However, because women who focused on mastery felt significantly more challenged than women who held a performance-avoid goal (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), but did not differ from women who held a performance-approach goal (<italic>p</italic> = .22), we only compared the mastery goal condition to the performance-avoid goal condition.</p>
<p>We found that adopting a mastery goal rather than a performance-avoid goal produced more assertive behavioral intentions (outcome variable), <italic>B</italic> = .54, <italic>SE</italic> = .14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and made women feel less threatened (potential mediator), <italic>B</italic> = −.47, <italic>SE</italic> = .17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, and more challenged (potential mediator), <italic>B</italic> = .47, <italic>SE</italic> = .10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Controlling for challenge and threat rendered the effect of goals on assertive intentions nonsignificant, <italic>B</italic> = .27, <italic>SE</italic> = .16, <italic>p</italic> = .09. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for challenge did not contain zero [.0773, .5300], but the 95% CI for threat did [−.1288, .0991], indicating that challenge, but not threat, mediated the relationship between goals and assertive intentions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0146167213481067">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Experiment 2 qualified our findings from Experiment 1 by showing that the benefits of holding a mastery goal versus performance goal in an identity-threatening situation may be contingent on the type of performance goal one holds. That is, women felt most challenged and least threatened when they adopted a mastery goal compared with a performance-avoid goal, with a performance-approach goal falling in between. However, women intended to be significantly more assertive when they had adopted a mastery goal compared with both types of performance goals (performance-approach and performance-avoid). Finally, women’s intention to be assertive elicited by a mastery goal versus performance-avoid goal was mediated by increased feelings of challenge (not reduced threat).</p>
<p>We should note that women who held no goal sometimes responded more negatively than their peers in the mastery goal condition but other times did not differ from the mastery goal condition. One reason for this may have been that women in the “no goal” condition adopted idiosyncratic goals of their own accord because they had not been given any specific instruction about how to behave. Most important for our hypotheses are the predicted differences between the mastery goal condition versus the performance-avoid goal condition with the performance-approach goal condition falling in the middle. The obtained results are largely consistent with these predictions, with a mastery goal actually outshining <italic>both</italic> types of performance goals in terms of assertive behavioral intentions.</p>

<title>Experiment 3</title>
<p>Experiment 3 focused attention on women’s actual performance in an identity-threatening job interview by covertly recording women’s interviews. Later, trained coders evaluated women’s nonverbal behavior to identify how much positive and negative affect they displayed during the interview (affective performance) as well as the degree to which coders would want to hire each participant (hireability). We focused on participants’ positive and negative affect during the interview in addition to hireability because, not surprisingly, having a positive demeanor is an important predictor of positive first impressions during job interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167213481067">Keenan, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167213481067">Macan, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>We simultaneously assessed whether challenge, but not threat, mediated the effect of goals on nonverbal affect.

<title>Hireability</title>
<p>Recall that women tended to appear less hireable when they held a performance-avoid goal versus mastery goal (<italic>p</italic> = .076). A multiple mediational analysis comparing women in the mastery goal to performance-avoid goal conditions indicated that neither threat nor challenge served as mediators for this effect. It may be the case that a more in vivo measure of stress appraisals (e.g., physiological measures) could better assess the mechanisms behind women’s hireability performance. Or, something other than stress appraisals might have been driving hireability ratings (e.g., evaluative concerns). Future research might assess these hypotheses.</p>

<sec id="section51-0146167213481067">
<title>Relation between perceived hireability and affective behavior</title>
<p>Correlational analyses indicated that women’s hireability was more strongly correlated with their affective performance when they held a mastery goal (<italic>r</italic> = .39, <italic>p</italic> = .056) than when they held a performance-approach goal (<italic>r</italic> = .12, <italic>p</italic> = .59), performance-avoid goal (<italic>r</italic> = .19, <italic>p</italic> = .34), or no goal (<italic>r</italic> = .28, <italic>p</italic> = .11). One explanation for these differential correlations could be that women who focused on mastery were free to think of the interview as a learning (positive) experience; thus, greater positive affect elicited during the interview correlated with higher ratings of hireability. However, in the remaining goal conditions, women’s hireability ratings may have been driven more by performance concerns rather than positive affect per se. Of course, this is speculative and future research should empirically test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>In sum, Experiment 3 extended the previous experiments by examining women’s <italic>actual performance</italic> in an identity-threatening interview. We predicted and found that focusing women on mastery rather than both types of performance increased their affective performance during a job interview, which was driven by increased feelings of challenge rather than decreased threat. Finally, as expected, a mastery goal did tend to give women an edge in perceived hireability compared with women who held a performance-avoid goal, though neither our challenge nor threat measure was able to account for this effect.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>People sometimes feel they do not belong in certain situations or are just not good at certain things because identity threat in the situation rattles their confidence and undercuts their performance. However, as Winfrey’s quote at the beginning of this article suggests, what some call threatening, others call an opportunity to learn and grow. Our research suggests that individuals can appraise identity-threatening situations in positive ways, which can affect how they feel and act. Specifically, when individuals construe identity threat as a learning experience (rather than a time to perform at one’s best or avoid errors), it allows them to feel challenged, engaged, and ultimately perform well.</p>
<sec id="section53-0146167213481067">
<title>The Benefit of a Mastery Goal and Why It Works</title>
<p>The current work provides support for achievement goal theory by reinforcing the beneficial nature of holding a mastery goal and takes it further by shedding light on the underlying mechanism driving its benefits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0146167213481067">1</xref></sup> Although prior studies have shown that mastery goals protect individuals’ intrinsic motivation and facilitate performance following negative performance feedback (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167213481067">E. Elliot &amp; Dweck, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167213481067">Grant &amp; Dweck, 2003</xref>), it has not been clear <italic>why</italic> mastery goals produced these benefits. Our work answers the “why question” using theoretical insights from the stress and coping research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167213481067">Folkman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167213481067">Folkman, &amp; Lazarus, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167213481067">Lazarus, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0146167213481067">Tomaka et al., 1993</xref>) and by providing empirical data to back up these insights. We provide empirical evidence that adopting a mastery goal is a markedly better strategy than adopting a performance-avoid goal, and, to some degree, a performance-approach goal (we discuss inconsistencies regarding the effects of performance-approach goals below). We found that the benefits of a mastery goal on behavioral intentions and behavior itself were driven by feeling more challenged rather than less threatened. Thus, the current work suggests that threat and challenge responses to adversity may be different psychological processes (this is consistent with prior work such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167213481067">Berjot et al., 2011</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167213481067">Derks et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>At a practical level, our work also provides a simple and effective means by which individuals might feel confident, feel engaged, and do well in identity-threatening contexts by changing the way they <italic>think about the situation</italic>, such that identity threat is framed as an opportunity for learning and mastery. Such an approach is rooted in theories of emotion regulation whereby individuals learn to reappraise aversive situations to change their subjective meaning to promote positive emotional reactions, which influence behavior later on (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167213481067">Gross, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167213481067">Lazarus, 1966</xref>). In other words, although one cannot always prevent occurrences of identity threat, one can control one’s perceptions and appraisals that subsequently shape emotions and behaviors.</p>
<p>The importance of our focus on real job interviews is twofold. First, identity threat and achievement goal research via dynamic face-to-face interactions is rare, and work that bridges these two research areas tends to focus mainly on written test performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167213481067">A. J. Elliot &amp; Church, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167213481067">Grant &amp; Dweck, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167213481067">Schmader, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167213481067">Spencer et al., 1999</xref>). We, however, studied people’s reactions to identity threat during an actual face-to-face interview as a function of their goal orientation. Second, our intervention overlaps with contemporary business coaches’ advice for individuals to adopt a “growth mindset” while on the job market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167213481067">Dweck, 2006</xref>) whereby they encourage applicants to think about job interviews as opportunities to gain experience to cope with stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167213481067">Fubra, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0146167213481067">Prock, 2011</xref>). Our work provides rigorous experimental evidence supporting this argument, specifically for individuals who face identity threat, which is no doubt stressful during interviews. For these individuals, adopting a mastery goal is likely to allow one to learn and grow from an identity-threatening experience so that they remain engaged rather than lose their motivation to try again.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section54-0146167213481067">
<title>Future Directions</title>
<p>In our work, performance-approach and performance-avoid goals tended to operate similarly, but in prior work, these goals tend to have differential effects on achievement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167213481067">McGregor &amp; Elliot, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167213481067">Smith, Sansone, &amp; White, 2007</xref>). One explanation for this inconsistent trend may be that some obstacles are daunting when one focuses on performance regardless of an approach or avoidance orientation (e.g., a job interview), and other obstacles are daunting only if one is oriented to avoiding failure (e.g., when faced with a negative stereotype about one’s ability; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167213481067">Smith, 2006</xref>). Thus, depending on the situation in which performance goals are activated, the impact of performance-approach versus performance-avoid goals might sometimes converge and at other times diverge. This hypothesis regarding matching specific situational obstacles with the most adaptive goal orientation warrants future research.</p>
<p>We also found that a mastery goal was sometimes but not always more beneficial than holding a performance-approach goal. Prior research indicates that a performance-approach goal’s effects in identity-threatening achievement settings can depend on an individual’s personal achievement motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167213481067">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). Specifically, individuals with higher versus lower initial motivation tend to benefit more from a performance-approach goal. In our work, it may have been the case that women differed in their degree of initial motivation for the interview, yielding unmeasured error variance in women’s reactions to a performance-approach goal and inconsistent results across experiments. Future research might test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>It would also be useful to assess whether adopting a mastery goal in practice situations spills over into and benefit actual high-stakes performances later on. In other words, can repeatedly adopting a mastery goal in many practice “dry runs” eventually become an automatic response in a later high-stakes achievement situation? Such a spillover effect would not only make identity-threatening settings easier to navigate but would also present an opportunity for growth in situations that individuals may have otherwise avoided. Thus, mastery goals might not only temper the sting of social identity threat in achievement contexts but also allow individuals to capitalize on the threatening experience so that they can, in the words of Oprah Winfrey, turn wounds into wisdom.</p>

<title>Job Description Using Gender-Exclusive Language (Emboldened; Experiments 1-3) and Gender-Neutral Language (In Parentheses; Experiment 1)</title>
<p>Our organization is continually growing and thriving. We’re looking to hire enthusiastic and bright college graduates—we usually know a good employee when we see <bold>him</bold> (one).</p>
<p>Our ideal employee is a smart and ambitious <bold>guy</bold> (person). <bold>He is</bold> (They are) someone who can work in a fast-paced and energetic environment—we certainly wouldn’t want an employee’s workload to catch <bold>him</bold> (them) unprepared.</p>
<p>We expect our <bold>guys</bold> (employees) to help us become a leading player in our field, so when a new employee joins us, <bold>he</bold> (they) may be asked to stay after work hours from time to time. Naturally, <bold>he</bold> (they) would be compensated for the extra time that <bold>he puts</bold> (they put) in.</p>
<p>Finally, we believe in rewarding excellent employees. When we come across an outstanding person, we feel that rewarding <bold>him</bold> (them) will boost our overall productivity. Some examples of our reward system are extended paid-vacation and monetary bonuses. Our <bold>guys</bold> (employees) are very pleased with our current reward system; the harder an employee works, the more money <bold>he makes</bold> (they make)!</p>
<p>If you are smart, ambitious, and creative, and this work environment sounds like a good fit for you, we encourage you to apply.</p>

<p>Although we did not find consistent differences between women’s responses to identity threat when they held a mastery goal versus no goal (Experiments 2 and 3), we believe this occurred because the No Goal condition is a muddy comparison group. It is unlikely that women in the No Goal condition truly had no goal in mind. It is more likely that they adopted their goal of choice, thereby promoting individual differences in that condition. The comparison of theoretical interest to us is between performance goals versus a mastery goal. This comparison consistently shows that focusing on mastery in lieu of a performance-avoid goal, and to some extent a performance-approach goal, allows individuals to cast identity threat in a positive light.</p>
