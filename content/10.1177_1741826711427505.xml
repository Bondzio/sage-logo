<p><bold>Background:</bold> This study investigates secular trends in ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke mortality by socioeconomic status (SES) in Australia to determine if absolute and relative differences between low and high SES areas have changed over time.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> IHD and stroke mortality data for adults aged 35–74 years and corresponding population data from Australian censuses for 1979–2006 were stratified into quintiles using an area-based measure of SES and analysed by quinquennia (and 2004–06). IHD and stroke (rates per 100,000) adjusted for age, country of birth, and rurality were compared across SES strata (separately by sex) using Poisson regression.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Mortality declined monotonically over the study period in all SES groups and both sexes. Absolute differences between low and high SES groups narrowed for IHD in females (27 to 23 per 100,000) and stroke in males and females (16 to 13, and 13 to 7 per 100,000, respectively), although absolute differences widened for IHD in males (52 to 63 per 100,000). Relative declines were greater in high compared to low SES groups for IHD (28% average quinquennial decline in high SES; compared with 21% in low SES for males; 30% and 21% for females), and for stroke (25% average quinquennial decline in high SES; 21% in low SES for males; 26% and 23% for females).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Differences in mortality rates between lower and higher SES groups narrowed for both IHD (in females) and stroke (in males and females) from 1979–2006, indicating that the epidemic decline is now at a late stage when low SES groups are benefiting more, in absolute terms, than high SES groups. However males in the lower SES groups are still at an earlier stage of the epidemic decline in IHD mortality.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1741826711427505" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke epidemics have been observed in many countries with differences in timing and peak mortality rates of individual epidemics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711427505">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711427505">2</xref></sup> Mortality rates from IHD have been declining since 1970–80 in North Western Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries which experienced the onset of the epidemic toward the middle of the 20th century.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711427505">1</xref></sup> Some Eastern European countries experienced a peak in IHD mortality much later in the 1990s, and in Russia and other parts of the former USSR mortality rates from IHD continue to increase,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711427505">2</xref></sup> whereas Southern Europe hardly experienced an epidemic at all.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711427505">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>IHD and stroke mortality in Australia peaked in the late 1960s and has since been continuously declining in both males and females.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711427505">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711427505">7</xref></sup> Despite substantial declines in age-adjusted mortality rates since the peak of the epidemic, IHD and stroke remain major causes of premature mortality in Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711427505">5</xref></sup> Socioeconomic status (SES) has been shown to be an important determinant of health outcomes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711427505">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711427505">9</xref></sup> and absolute and relative mortality differences between SES groups have been observed in many countries, including Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711427505">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711427505">13</xref></sup> Higher mortality rates in lower (compared to higher) SES groups have been shown using SES measures based on occupational status,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711427505">9</xref></sup> educational attainment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711427505">14</xref></sup> and income.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711427505">15</xref></sup> Previous Australian studies have also shown inverse associations between SES and IHD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711427505">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711427505">13</xref></sup> and stroke,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711427505">11</xref></sup> however, studies of trends in IHD and stroke mortality by SES have been investigated over a relatively short period (1979–1993) and only in males.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711427505">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some studies have shown relative divergence in social inequalities in IHD and stroke mortality in Europe and the USA over recent decades, in the context of overall declining rates of both IHD and stroke mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711427505">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711427505">19</xref></sup> However, it is not clear in the Australian context whether the decline in IHD and stroke mortality has occurred similarly across SES strata. This study aims to investigate secular trends in IHD and stroke mortality stratified by an area-based measure of SES in Australia between 1979 and 2003, to determine whether (i) absolute changes in IHD and stroke mortality between strata of SES over time and (ii) relative changes in IHD and stroke mortality by SES, have converged or diverged over time.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1741826711427505" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-1741826711427505"><title>Data</title>
<p>Unit-record IHD (ICD-9 codes 410–414, ICD-10 codes I20–I25) and stroke (ICD-9 codes 430–438, ICD-10 codes I60–I64) mortality data were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) for the period 1979–2006 by local government area (LGA) of residence, sex, age, and country of birth. These data cover the period up to 2006 for which area-based cause-specific mortality data are routinely available from the ABS and for which area-based SES characteristics were available. Unit-record mortality data are currently not available from the ABS for the period after 2006, and unit-record data for the state of Victoria are not available for the year 2006 (representing approximately 25% of IHD and stroke deaths and population). Corresponding population data for each LGA in strata of sex, age, and country of birth were obtained from the 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001, and 2006 Australian censuses.</p>
<p>To account for changes in small-area LGA codes and aggregations and disaggregations of small-area classifications over time with successive versions of the Australian Standard Classification of Geographic Areas, all small-area codes were resolved to their corresponding population LGA code at the closest census. Data were aggregated over five periods, for the quinquennia 1979–83, 1984–88, 1989–93, 1994–98, and 1999–2003. Data for a sixth 3-year period for 2004–06 were also compiled – excluding the state of Victoria for 2006. Mortality data without coded documentation on usual area of residence (representing &lt;1% of all deaths) in Australia for the period) were excluded from the analysis. For each quinquennium, counts of IHD and stroke deaths (and corresponding population counts) were arranged in strata of sex, age, country of birth, regional classification, and SES quintile, as described below.</p>
<p>Age was stratified into 10-year age groups. Analyses focused on deaths occurring at ages below 75 years as this is the age group conventionally used to investigate premature death due to IHD and stroke, and the attribution of cause of death becomes more problematic in the elderly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711427505">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711427505">20</xref></sup> Mortality for males and females was considered separately.</p>
<p>Categories of country of birth were defined as: Australia, New Zealand, UK and Eire, Southern Europe, Western Europe, Eastern Europe and the former USSR, Other Europe, Middle East, and Asia. All remaining countries were grouped into an ‘Other’ category. These groupings reflect the Australian immigrant composition from the post-World War II period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711427505">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711427505">22</xref></sup> Many Australian residents born overseas have lower mortality rates, partly from selection (the healthy immigrant effect) and partly because of differences in ‘lifestyle’ risk factors, especially diet, that may be associated with IHD and stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711427505">22</xref></sup> Immigrant populations are also differentially distributed by SES, with a higher proportion of immigrants in lower (compared to higher) SES groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711427505">23</xref></sup> Thus country of birth may confound the relationship between SES and IHD and stroke mortality, and was adjusted for in this analysis.</p>
<p>Rurality was also considered as a potential confounder of the relationship between SES and IHD and stroke mortality, as Australians living in rural and remote areas generally have poorer health and higher mortality rates than those living in major cities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711427505">24</xref></sup> and also there is a higher proportion of lower SES areas in rural compared to urban areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711427505">23</xref></sup> Urban–rural residence was defined using the Rural, Remote, and Metropolitan Area (RRMA) classification system, which depends on population density and population size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711427505">25</xref></sup> Geographic areas were categorized as metropolitan areas (‘capital city’ and ‘other metropolitan areas’); regional centres (comprising ‘small’ and ‘large rural’ centres), and other rural areas (combining ‘other rural areas’, ‘remote centres’, and ‘other remote areas’).</p>
<p>An area-based measure of SES was used for this study, based on the Index of Economic Resources (IER), one of five SocioEconomic Indexes for Areas (SEIFAs) developed by the ABS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711427505">26</xref></sup> The IER from the 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001, and 2006 censuses is based on population characteristics of a given area in terms of income level, home ownership and rental rates, dwelling size, and vehicle ownership.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711427505">26</xref></sup> The IER was selected as the measure of SES for this study as it is conceptually a more internally consistent measure of SES (unlike the Index of Education and Occupation, which combines components of education, occupation, and employment).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711427505">27</xref></sup> As SEIFA indices are not available for the 1981 census, corresponding to the earliest 5-year period in the study (1979–83), the indices from the 1986 census were used for the earlier period. Changes to SEIFA scores over time have resulted in some areas being categorized into a different quintile, but these areas were relatively small in number (approximately 5%). For each period, except 1979–83, each area was assigned to an SES category based on information from the census for the middle year of each period.</p>
<p>The IER was used to stratify small areas into population quintiles. Preliminary analyses of SES quintiles showed similarity in IHD and stroke mortality rates and trends between the three middle SES groups (quintiles 2, 3, and 4) and these were aggregated into a broad ‘middle’ SES group (representing 60% of the population), with the lowest quintile remaining ‘low SES’ (20% of the population) and the highest quintile ‘high SES’ (20% of the population).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711427505"><title>Analysis</title>
<p>Trends in IHD and stroke (annual rates per 100,000) by ‘low’, ‘middle’ (quintiles 2, 3, 4), and ‘high’ SES were examined across each 3–5-year period over 1979–2006 for males and females to determine the extent of absolute decline in mortality in each SES group. For each 3–5-year period, relative differences in IHD and stroke mortality between low and middle SES compared to high SES were investigated in Poisson regression models, separately for each sex, and adjusted for age, country of birth, and rurality. Poisson regression was used to model counts of IHD and stroke within each stratum of sex, age, country of birth, and urban/rural residence, offset by the logarithm of the corresponding stratum-specific population.</p>
<p>Absolute differences in IHD and stroke mortality rates were investigated by multiplying each adjusted relative risk estimate for low and middle SES groups by the IHD and stroke mortality rate in the high SES group for each period. These adjusted IHD and stroke mortality rates were also assembled across each 3–5-year period to investigate trends by SES group over the whole study period (1979–2006), adjusted for confounding by age, country of birth, and rurality. The population attributable risk percentage (PAR%) associated with low and middle SES groups, relative to the high SES group, was also calculated for each period using the adjusted incidence rate ratios. The effect of the exclusion of data from 2006 for the state of Victoria in the most recent period (2004–06) was also examined by comparing relative and absolute differences in IHD and stroke mortality for the period before 2004 in analyses including and excluding Victoria. Excluding the state of Victoria from analyses of relative and absolute differences in IHD and stroke mortality did not substantially affect findings –&lt;5% absolute change in IHD and stroke mortality rates for any low, middle, or high SES stratum across the study period.</p>
<p>The extent of divergence or convergence between low and high SES groups over the study period was assessed by testing whether the interaction term between SES group and period (that is, each 3–5-year period) was statistically significant when modelled across all periods. The statistical significance of the corresponding likelihood ratio statistics from a Type 1 analysis was used to test the divergence or convergence in IHD or stroke mortality by SES. The average decline in low, middle, and high SES groups was also estimated using a similar approach, but with ‘period’ specified as a continuous variable coded as the mid-year for each of the periods in models stratified by SES group (low, middle, high). Analyses were conducted in SAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711427505">28</xref></sup> using PROC GENMOD.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1741826711427505" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study has shown a remarkable decline in mortality from IHD and stroke across all SES groups in Australia for both males and females, although SES differences in mortality (higher mortality in lower compared to higher SES groups) persisted across the study period (1979–2006). A slower rate of decline in IHD mortality and stroke mortality was evident over the study period in the lowest (compared to highest) SES group, indicating a divergence in relative mortality between low and high SES groups. However, the large absolute declines in mortality across all SES groups were such that absolute differences between low and high SES groups were smaller in the most recent period (2004–06) compared to the earliest period (1979–83), with the exception of IHD mortality in males. Estimates of population attributable risk suggest that approximately 10–15% of IHD and stroke mortality in the earlier part of the study period (1979–93) was attributable to lower SES, which increased to approximately 20–30% in the later part of the study period (1994–2006).</p>
<p>There are several methodological issues that need further consideration. There is potential for misclassification bias in this study, as a result of changes in geographical areas (LGA boundaries) used in the census over the study period. The SES ranking of small areas can change from one census to the next, due to the changing characteristics of the area, but also because of the arbitrary reallocation of small-area boundaries (unrelated to any changes to the SES characteristics of the area). However, this misclassification was minimized by resolving all small-area codes to the corresponding LGA at the closest census and stratifying areas into quintiles based on SES, such that the lowest 20% of the population always represented the most socioeconomically disadvantaged and the highest 20% of the population always represented the most socioeconomically advantaged. Coding changes from ICD-9 to ICD-10 may also be a source of misclassification of IHD and stroke mortality. However, this study is based on broad aggregations of ICD codes, subchapter aggregations which have not changed from ICD-9 to ICD-10, and also excluded other diseases of the circulatory system with differing aetiology such as rheumatic heart disease, rheumatic fever, and other and unspecified circulatory diseases.</p>
<p>Another consideration is the ecological fallacy, or cross-level bias, where area-level differences in mortality are correlated with individual data but not attributable to individual characteristics or behaviours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741826711427505">29</xref></sup> Ideally, individual SES measures should be considered with individual-level mortality data to gain a clearer understanding of compositional and contextual effects. However, the ecological associations between area-SES measures and IHD and stroke mortality found in this study are consistent with studies of IHD and stroke mortality by individual-level SES measures, which have shown higher mortality rates in lower SES groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711427505">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711427505">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711427505">14</xref></sup> and divergence in relative differences in IHD and stroke between low and high SES groups over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711427505">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711427505">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Indigenous status was not considered in this study. Mortality from IHD and stroke has been shown to be higher in Indigenous Australians compared to non-Indigenous Australians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711427505">30</xref></sup> Identification of Indigenous status in routinely collected mortality data has been problematic, especially in the earlier part of the study period prior to the mid 1990s, and it is likely to be different from identification of Indigenous status in the Census<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711427505">30</xref></sup> making analysis fraught. Rural populations and low SES area quintiles have higher proportions of Indigenous Australians,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711427505">10</xref></sup> and controlling in the analysis for geographic area would likely minimize effects of differential Indigenous distributions.</p>
<p>Age was also adjusted for in analyses because older age groups have higher mortality from IHD and stroke than younger age groups,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711427505">20</xref></sup> and the age structures may differ between SES quintiles and over time. Males and females were also considered separately in order to eliminate effect modification from this source. Country of birth was included as a potential confounder in analyses, given the differential distribution of migrant population by SES and urban/rural geographic categories,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711427505">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711427505">23</xref></sup> and patterns of IHD and stroke that can differ from the Australian-born population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711427505">13</xref></sup> Some migrant groups, such as those from Southern Europe and South East Asia, have lower rates of mortality from IHD than the Australian-born population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711427505">13</xref></sup> Other migrants, such as those from Eastern Europe, have higher rates of CVD mortality than the Australian-born.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711427505">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>These migrant differentials in Australia reflect large between country differences in both IHD and stroke. Age-standardized rates of IHD in Australia for a comparable period to the present study (2004) are of a similar magnitude to Canada, Sweden, Greece, Denmark, and Norway but are higher than some Southern European countries and Japan, and lower than the UK and USA, for example.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741826711427505">31</xref></sup> Mortality rates for cerebrovascular disease in Australia are similar to, for example, the USA and Canada, but substantially lower than Eastern Europe and parts of Asia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741826711427505">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several other studies have found divergent trends in SES differentials in IHD and/or stroke mortality, in the UK,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711427505">18</xref></sup> Sweden,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711427505">16</xref></sup> the USA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711427505">19</xref></sup> and Western Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711427505">17</xref></sup> The only previous Australian study of trends in IHD and stroke mortality by SES was based on males and showed higher IHD and stroke mortality in manual compared to non-manual occupational groups and relative differences widening between 1979 and 1993.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711427505">11</xref></sup> Other studies have also investigated changes in absolute differences between low and high SES groups, such as studies from Western Europe where relative SES differences in IHD and stroke mortality diverged over time, but absolute SES differences remained stable;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711427505">17</xref></sup> and in New Zealand where the proportion of CVD attributable to SES inequalities was reduced due to decreases in absolute SES differences in CVD mortality over time (1981–99).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711427505">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>SES inequality in IHD and stroke mortality is likely due to the unequal distribution of key risk factors and access to treatments, resulting in inequalities in event rates and case fatality. In Australia, SES has been shown to be inversely related to both incidence and mortality from IHD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711427505">13</xref></sup> Although Australians have universal access to health care, prevention and treatment are taken up differentially among SES groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741826711427505">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741826711427505">33</xref></sup> and socioeconomic disadvantage has been associated with lower rates of interventions, such as angiography, and a reduced chance of receiving optimal coronary care in Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711427505">10</xref></sup> In Canada, where universal health care is also provided, SES is also related to treatment access and mortality after stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741826711427505">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>The majority of absolute difference in IHD is explained by classic risk factors (hypertension, cholesterol, and smoking), because these risk factors are related to the majority of cases of IHD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741826711427505">35</xref></sup> and much of the decline in IHD in Australia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711427505">5</xref></sup> and New Zealand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1741826711427505">36</xref></sup> over the past few decades is attributed to reductions in these risk factors. SES inequalities in these classic risk factors have been shown in Australia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741826711427505">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741826711427505">39</xref></sup> and other countries,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711427505">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741826711427505">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741826711427505">44</xref></sup> and declines in the prevalence of these risk factors in Australia have been faster in higher compared to lower SES groups, for tobacco smoking prevalence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741826711427505">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741826711427505">39</xref></sup> hypertension,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741826711427505">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741826711427505">39</xref></sup> cholesterol,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741826711427505">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741826711427505">39</xref></sup> and sedentary behaviour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741826711427505">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>The effectiveness of health promotion activity aimed at reducing the prevalence of such risk factors has also been shown to be differentially distributed by SES. For example, legislative changes targeting tobacco control in whole populations, such as using taxation to increase the cost of cigarettes, are more likely to influence the socioeconomically disadvantaged,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741826711427505">45</xref></sup> whereas other forms of health promotion, such as media and education campaigns, in promoting smoking cessation are more effective in higher SES groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741826711427505">46</xref></sup> The present findings of widening relative SES inequalities in IHD and stroke in the context of absolute declines may suggest the beneficial effects of legislative approaches, health promotion, and widespread use of treatments and medications including statins. It is possible that the differential distribution of risk factors and the effects of health promotion would also affect how the decline in IHD and stroke mortality moves through SES groups at different points in time. Thus, early uptake and response to health promotion messages in higher SES groups may initially widen absolute differences in mortality inequalities in the initial stages of the epidemic decline. But decreases in SES inequalities occur in later periods as legislative changes targeting whole populations begin to affect mortality rates in lower SES groups as well.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1741826711427505" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study has shown that SES differences (higher mortality in lower compared to higher SES groups) were fairly consistent over the period 1979–2006, although there have been faster declines in IHD and stroke mortality in higher SES groups compared to lower SES groups. These findings are consistent with widespread access to improvements in treatment of IHD and stroke, and SES differences and declines in risk factors in Australia, specifically tobacco consumption, hypertension, cholesterol, and sedentary behaviour. Despite this differential distribution of risk factors associated with IHD and stroke, these findings indicate that the marked general decline in IHD and stroke following the peak of the epidemic in 1970<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711427505">6</xref></sup> has occurred across all social strata in Australia.</p>
