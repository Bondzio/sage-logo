(2012), this paper suggests the need for a more nuanced argument in several respects. Physical geographers need to be brought on board and more clarity is required about the relationship between ‘canons’ and ‘classics’. Above all, the claim that geography is unusual in its historical superficiality and indifference to its earlier generations needs qualification. Only then can the call for canons in geography to create historical depth to our understanding and to aid in disciplinary identity formation, which the authors champion, prove successful.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>canon</kwd><kwd>classics</kwd><kwd>disciplinary formation</kwd><kwd>human geography</kwd><kwd>physical geography</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Are there texts that every (human) geographer should read? If so, why? Do such texts induct us into a disciplinary conclave, thereby acting as guarantors of our assimilation of an intellectual identity? Or is identity formation subordinate to quality: is it the timeless – or, <italic>per contra</italic>, the very historically and geographically situated – quality of certain texts which mean we should all read them not to belong, but for our intellectual health? As soon as one starts to discuss the idea of a canon of geographical texts, such questions are raised, and in airing these issues, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468536">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>) do us all a considerable service in their paper, ‘On canonical geographies’, by asking us to contemplate the vexed intersections of history and identity, of compulsion and choice, of quality and value judgement that canonicity encodes in its very fabric. Like many a schoolchild, I can well remember struggling in spelling tests with ‘canons’ and ‘cannons’: which was a text to be read; which the weapon of choice in early modern warfare? In this brief comment, whilst welcoming the contribution of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468536">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>), I would like to suggest that there are points where their argument is a little too much that of the cannon, knocking down discursive battlements that no one was defending. Therefore, I would also like to suggest they might want to make their argument a little more precise or, to retain my military metaphors, they might more effectively wield the rapier to tell us as geographers what they value in the notion of a geographical canon and why.</p><p>Cannons first. There seem to be two points where the argument offered in ‘On canonical geographies’ is overdrawn in ways which do not help the authors to convince their readership. First, with regard to ‘classics’ and ‘canons’. Whilst in John Guillory’s excellent analysis of the wars over canons in literature over the past three decades, (<italic>Cultural Capital</italic>, John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612468536">Guillory, 1993</xref>: 6), he argues that the terminological switch from ‘classic’ to ‘canon’ itself expresses the move from acceptance of the logic of a corpus of great writings all should read to its contestation in the academy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468536">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>) propose a different division for geography. They suggest that ‘classics’ are those contemporary articles and books that are deemed relevant, still having purchase on how we practise human geography today, where a ‘canon’ would be a set of texts of more enduring worth (although how this last judgement would be made is not clear from their argument). This binary is backed up by recourse to the evidence of the historically shallow remit of <italic>Progress in Human Geography</italic>’s regular ‘Classics in human geography revisited’ section. But surely this is a twofold confusion that overplays the point.</p><p>First, one cannot revert to a world prior to the 1970s of seemingly self-evidently canonical works: whilst which texts are deemed canonical is now much more contested in the humanities, surely that is beneficial as it demands not just that scholars and students read certain books but that, in self-critical and hermeneutically astute ways, they also question how and why these texts have been selected. If <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468536">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>) propose that we install a canon on the basis of quality, this must raise all the questions of scholarly empowerment – who is to decide what is canonical and what occlusions do they wreak? – which set off the ‘canon wars’ in literature and cultural studies in the 1970s. I have no doubt that such a recrudescence to a taken-for-granted canon is precisely <italic>not</italic> what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468536">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>) propose, but the tenuous ‘classic-canon’ binary they construct leaves one with a sense of a canon as timeless and classics as evanescent, which is surely not their intention.</p><p>Second, it is aggrandising and misreading the role of the ‘Classics’ section in <italic>Progress in Human Geography</italic> to frame it as defining the shelf life of classics in human geography for the simple reason that the very format of that section demands that the author responds to his or her interlocutors. As such, by its nature the <italic>Progress</italic> section can only address works from the past few decades rather than the <italic>longue durée</italic> of geography’s history. The <italic>Progress</italic> section is akin to ‘oral history’, asking living authors to revisit and debate influential works in the light of the passage of a few decades and never claimed to be more. Surely we would be on safer ground to see those texts addressed in <italic>Progress in Human Geography</italic> as being offered an interim indication of esteem by being so included rather than deeming them a reified corpus of classics. And if so, the binary drawn between canons and classics can safely be dissolved with little lost. <italic>Progress</italic>’s classics do not claim to be the entirety of the geographical canon in terms of historical stretch, whilst the canon’s inductees would surely in routine parlance be framed interchangeably as ‘canonical’ or ‘classics’.</p><p>The second moment that seems to be overdrawn in ‘On canonical geographies’ relates to the image of human geography as peculiarly and singularly prone to forgetting when compared with other disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. There are two elements to this. First, the activity of constructing histories of geography is not a new one; it is at the very least coeval with the academic institutionalisation of geography and if one wants to draw longer histories, both Strabo and Ptolemy, for example, simultaneously practice geography and write about their predecessors. As such, it is hard to see how geography is less historically self-aware than, say, anthropology or sociology. We as human geographers do memorialise our predecessors as assuredly as other disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Indeed, we might suggest, <italic>per contra</italic>, that human geography is unusual in the extent and vigour of the community who, within the discipline, write histories of the discipline rather than leaving this to historians in a separate disciplinary context. Second, if geographers do engage in processes of forgetting, so do those other disciplines which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468536">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>) place in contradistinction to human geography. In the canonical discipline <italic>par excellence</italic> of literature, for example, surely Italo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612468536">Calvino (2000</xref>: 3) is right that when people say they are ‘rereading’ classic works:<disp-quote><p>the iterative prefix ‘re-’ in front of the verb ‘read’ can represent a small act of hypocrisy on the part of people ashamed to admit they have not read a famous book. . . . there will always be an enormous number of fundamental works that one has not read.</p></disp-quote>In other words, scholars across a gamut of disciplines routinely cherish, attack and/or forget works they have not read as well as those they have. All inquiries routinely evoke prior works, and geography seems little different in its dynamics of memorialisation and forgetting from other disciplines, Keighren et al.’s (2012) argument notwithstanding. There is no special problem or nature to human geography’s relationship with its past, and if <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468536">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>) suggest there is, their argument tends towards a somewhat tendentious jeremiad for which there is no need. Questions of canonicity are quite important enough to human geography without being framed thus.</p><p>My detection of two ‘cannons’, two points where ‘On canonical geographies’ uses firepower which is rather too heavy to make its point, is designed to have a constructive outcome, to ask the paper’s authors to be a little more precise about what they see a geographical canon as offering to the sub-discipline of human geography. As it stands, the argument presented suggests a canon is needed for two purposes. First, to offer identity to human geography, or, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468536">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>: xxx) put it, ‘to the shaping of a disciplinary identity or perspective . . . to develop a common understanding of what it means to think geographically’. Second, it is argued that a canon should be of historically important works, these being works that were important in their own age rather than those which proleptically fit our current conceptions of geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468536">Keighren et al., 2012</xref>: xxx). My questions to the authors of ‘On canonical geographies’ are simple: is a canon really needed for identity formation, or for historical awareness, and are the two really self-identical? For surely a discipline could happily have an identity formed around the aggressive, self-satisfied rejection of the work of its predecessors, however historically shallow the results might be, something at which the authors hint (p. xxx)? And surely many areas of contemporary scientific inquiry function as perfectly coherent disciplines with all-but no canonical apparatus? If that is the case, I would ask the authors to wield rapier-like precision to hone their argument about why we need canons in geographical inquiry and instruction: is it really for the sake of identity, or is it not more accurately on the grounds that there are texts which they think we are all better for having read and being able to share in discussion? If it is on the grounds of historical importance not identity formation that we need a canon, so be it, but let us be clear about it. And if it is on these terms that we need a canon in human geography, if it is that a <italic>humane</italic> geography is one where we join a conversation (and argument!) with our predecessors, two further subsidiary questions arise for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468536">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>).</p><p>First, how does physical geography fit in? Whilst their discussion is self-confessedly about human geography, a perfectly reasonable restriction, most of those they name as worthy of memorialisation, such as Ratzel, Mackinder and Hägerstrand, worked with an integrated notion of geography. How should notions of canonicity transfer to physical geography or do they have no purchase? If a canon is to unite geography around shared conversations of historical depth about texts of enduring quality, surely the other 50% of geography needs to be given a vision of how it joins the discussion? Second, the list just rehearsed – Ratzel, Mackinder and Hägerstrand – comes from the close of ‘On canonical geographies’ and raises the question of what types of texts endure and are worthy of historical/canonical remembrance. We now live in an academic world where the audit of research productivity has reached levels which future generations will laugh at as fantasies Borges and Kafka might have invented. But in those fantasies of academic actuarialism, peer-reviewed journal articles are sovereign and books are eccentricities. Are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468536">Keighren et al. (2012</xref>) saying that canons can offer a heterotopia wherein extended, considered and mature inquiries formulated <italic>in extenso</italic> as books will be given their due, even if our state audits fail so to do? Do canons, then, offer us different ways of valuing different types of texts from those which the Research Excellence Framework and other such nonsenses enshrine?</p><p>In sum, the present author detects in ‘On canonical geographies’ a laudable defence of a humane, bookish and integrated geography which values and just plain enjoys conversing with its past. Such a vision may just be the respondent vainly encoding his own desires in the text of others, and if so, they are welcome to ignore his reveries. But if I have detected the aims of ‘On canonical geographies’ aright, the point of my cannons and my rapier is to ask the authors to bring all on board with their vision, both physical and human geographers, and to be more precise about their targets and their ambitions. We may need the odd cannon, but we also need a rapier to make our canons.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2043820612468536"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Calvino</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2000</year>) <source>Why Read the Classics?</source> <publisher-loc>London, UK</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>Vintage</publisher-name>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr2-2043820612468536"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Guillory</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1993</year>) <source>Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation</source>. <publisher-loc>Chicago, IL</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>University of Chicago Press</publisher-name>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr3-2043820612468536"><citation citation-type="other"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Keighren</surname><given-names>IM</given-names></name><name><surname>Abrahamsson</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>della Dora</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2012</year>) <article-title>On canonical geographies</article-title>. <comment>Dialogues in Human Geography</comment> <volume>2</volume>(<issue>3</issue>). <comment>doi: 10.1177/2043820612468534</comment></citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
