<abstract>
<p>Do agency officials hold influence over the policy decisions made by state legislators and governors? For years, scholars have asserted the important informational role that bureaucrats play within the U.S. policy-making process. However, we have only limited knowledge of the theoretical mechanisms that may allow for this influence, or ultimately, whether this influence matters to public policy outcomes. We theorize that the political oversight of the bureaucracy by elected officials not only constrains the bureaucracy but also provides a pathway for agency officials to advance their preferences by communicating their policy expertise. We assess this argument with survey data from almost 600 state agency heads, drawn from the 50 states and across all agency types. Using a multilevel model, we find that the “oversight mechanism” is a key driver of agency influence over gubernatorial policy decisions; however, it does a poor job explaining agency policy influence within state legislatures. These results suggest that oversight allows agency leaders greater success in lobbying governors than more diffuse and diverse state legislatures.</p>

<p>It is hard to ignore the enormous literature measuring the influence elected officials hold over the U.S. bureaucracy’s policy decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0275074012443730">Brudney &amp; Hebert, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0275074012443730">Furlong, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0275074012443730">Gormley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0275074012443730">Kelleher &amp; Yackee, 2006</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0275074012443730">Shipan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0275074012443730">Waterman &amp; Rouse, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0275074012443730">West, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0275074012443730">Wood &amp; Waterman, 1994</xref>). Yet the converse has proved easily overlooked: We know relatively little about the size and nature of the public bureaucracy’s aggregate-level influence over policy decisions made by legislators and elected executives. Stated differently, while it is well acknowledged that the bureaucracy contributes information and expertise to the policy-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0275074012443730">Gailmard &amp; Patty, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0275074012443730">Kaufman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0275074012443730">Kingdon, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0275074012443730">Rabe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0275074012443730">Rourke, 1984</xref>), we have only limited knowledge of the theoretical mechanisms that may allow for this influence, or at the end of the day, whether this influence matters to policy outcomes. This is surprising considering the vast literature in public administration and political science debating the most appropriate conceptualization of the bureaucracy’s position within the broader system of democratic governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0275074012443730">Cook, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074012443730">Demir, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0275074012443730">Demir &amp; Nyhan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0275074012443730">Goodsell, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0275074012443730">Hill, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0275074012443730">Kaufman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0275074012443730">Meier &amp; O’Toole, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, we advance the literature by specifying one such mechanism. We theorize that political oversight provided by legislators and elected executives not only constrains bureaucratic decision making but also creates a pathway for bureaucratic influence. Oversight opens channels of communication and allows agency leaders to influence the policy-making process by sharing their policy expertise. We argue that oversight performed by elected officials increases the amount of time that the agency leadership spends interacting with legislators, elected executives, and their staffs. These exchanges, we theorize, result not only in oversight; they also provide a mechanism for agencies to share information, expertise, and recommendations with elected officials and their staffs. In other words, political oversight reduces the communication barriers between “agents” and their “principals” and, in doing so, augments the aggregate-level policy influence administrative agencies have on legislators and elected executives. Thus, we suggest an important and, to our knowledge, previously overlooked outcome associated with political oversight: increased agency influence on the policy-related decision making of elected officials.</p>
<p>We assess our argument with data drawn primarily from the American State Administrators Project (ASAP), which secured survey information from almost 600 state agency heads from across the 50 states and all categories of public agencies in 2008. We then augment these data with information on state-level institutional powers, environmental characteristics, and partisanship. We use a multilevel model, with agency leaders nested in states, to assess the argument. We find that the hypothesized oversight mechanism is a key predictor of agency influence over gubernatorial policy decisions. However, oversight matters much less to agency influence on state legislators, where we find that agencies with larger policy networks are better able to affect state legislator decision making. Overall, the results suggest that the policy-making authority consolidated in the governor’s office is more open to agency influence as a result of oversight, whereas the larger and more diffuse membership of state legislatures makes communicating an agency’s policy preferences more difficult. Our findings, in the end, imply that agencies hold noteworthy and considerable influence within the broader policy-making process, and, in the case of the elected executive, part of this influence appears attributable to lines of communication opened due to the political oversight of the bureaucracy.</p>

<title>Theoretical Foundations and Argument</title>
<p>The theoretical foundations for this article are rooted in both public administration and political science literatures suggesting how agency officials may influence the broader policy-making process. More specifically, it rests upon two largely distinct bodies of scholarship. The first literature focuses on the political oversight of the U.S. bureaucracy. The second literature highlights the role of the bureaucracy in influencing policy outcomes. We now review select findings from these literatures.</p>
<sec id="section2-0275074012443730">
<title>Political Oversight</title>
<p>The bureaucracy is generally regarded as an important maker and implementer of public policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0275074012443730">Furlong, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0275074012443730">Kaufman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0275074012443730">Kerwin &amp; Furlong, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0275074012443730">West, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0275074012443730">Wilson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0275074012443730">Yackee, 2006</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0275074012443730">Shipan (2004)</xref> concludes that the “political bureaucracy makes the overwhelming majority of public-policy decisions in the United States” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0275074012443730">Shipan 2004</xref>, p. 467). However, this policy-making power raises concerns related to the so-called nondelegation doctrine or the idea that elected principals may not devolve meaningful policy-making decisions to nonelected agency officials. The “solution” to this puzzle, at least the solution put forward in many scholarly accounts, resides with the ability of legislators and executives to oversee the bureaucracy’s work and thereby hold the bureaucracy politically accountable. Elected principals employ numerous tools to ensure this accountability, ranging from hearings and budgets to more informal mechanisms, such as personal phone calls or e-mails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0275074012443730">Aberbach, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0275074012443730">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0275074012443730">Gormley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0275074012443730">Kelleher &amp; Yackee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0275074012443730">McCubbins &amp; Schwartz, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0275074012443730">West, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0275074012443730">Wilson, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Ultimately, numerous scholars conclude that elected officials hold at least some influence over agency decision-making in the U.S. context (for a summary, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0275074012443730">Wood &amp; Waterman, 1994</xref>). Yet, despite this conclusion, bureaucrats can still hold noteworthy political power within these “principal–agent” relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0275074012443730">Epstein &amp; O’Halloran, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0275074012443730">Hammond &amp; Knott, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0275074012443730">Huber &amp; Shipan, 2002</xref>; Rinquist, 1995; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0275074012443730">Wood, 1988</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0275074012443730">Krause (1996)</xref>, for instance, focuses on the president, Congress, and one agency, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He demonstrates that oversight by elected officials influences SEC behavior, but he also finds that SEC actions—as measured by the agency’s enforcement activities—can influence the budgetary preferences of Congress and the president. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0275074012443730">Krause (1996)</xref> then concludes, “To accurately understand administrative behavior one must also understand how it can shape political preferences” (p. 1089).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0275074012443730">Meier, Polinard, and Wrinkle (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0275074012443730">1999</xref>) offer a similar bridge between the political accountability and agency policy influence literatures. They suggest problems associated with bureaucratic politics’ applications of the principal–agent model, while also emphasizing the bureaucracy’s independent ability to affect policy outcomes. Indeed, some 15 years ago, they identified a gap in knowledge that still remains. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0275074012443730">Meier and coauthors (1995)</xref> wrote, “No empirical study has assessed the role of bureaucracies in agenda setting or policy adoption despite the descriptive literature that shows agencies actively lobby their political superiors for changes in law and policy” (p. 428).</p>

<title>Agency Policy Influence</title>
<p>With respect to agency influence on the decision making of elected officials, one thing is clear: Most early scholars suggest that there ought to be little of it. This point is made most clearly in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0275074012443730">Wilson’s (1887)</xref> seminal work laying out the “politics–administration dichotomy,” namely that “public administration is somehow distinct from the political” or, at least, that administration ought to be distinct from politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0275074012443730">Wilson 1887</xref>, p. 210). This proposition set the stage for an entire generation of scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0275074012443730">Goodnow, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0275074012443730">Mosher, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0275074012443730">Waldo, 1980</xref>) and provided the theoretical reasoning behind the “neutral competence” ideal for bureaucrats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0275074012443730">Catron, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0275074012443730">Kaufman, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0275074012443730">Klay, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0275074012443730">McSwite, 1997</xref>). Yet, a varied and equally vast body of work challenges this dichotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0275074012443730">Cook, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0275074012443730">Demir &amp; Nyhan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0275074012443730">Denhardt, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0275074012443730">Fredrickson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0275074012443730">Heyman, 1987</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0275074012443730">Goodsell (2006)</xref> writes, “Politicians obviously are more policy makers and principals than bureaucrats, but to conclude that the latter never engage in formative or constitutive political activity is shortsighted to the extreme” (p. 627).</p>
<p>While the debate as to whether agency influence is normatively good or bad for our representative democracy is relatively well-tilled ground, we know much less, from an empirical standpoint, about the extent of the bureaucracy’s influence on policy making or how it may manifest itself. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0275074012443730">O’Leary (1994)</xref>, when referencing the policy influence of midlevel career professional managers, puts it plainly, “That public managers . . . work with the forces in their environment is almost commonsensical. Yet, there is little empirical evidence in either the organizational-theory literature or the bureaucratic-politics literature of . . . public managers actually attempting to shape their environment” (p. 443)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0275074012443730">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0275074012443730">Kaufman (2001)</xref> writes, it must be acknowledged that bureaucrats “play a prominent part in formulating the directives they receive!” (p. 21). He suggests a number of reasons for this influence, including policy experience, technical expertise, and the need for legislators to secure “practical knowledge” during policy formation. According to this line of thinking, agency officials are influential because their expertise gives them credibility, as well as access to policy makers. Kaufman also extends agency policy influence beyond the legislative arena; he pointedly suggests that the political executives, whom agency officials often serve, regularly solicit policy advice and recommendations from the public bureaucracy.</p>
<p>There is ample case study evidence confirming Kaufman’s claims that the bureaucracy actively advises and lobbies elected policy makers. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0275074012443730">O’Leary (1994)</xref> provides a concrete example of career agency officials holding influence over legislative policy making in her study of the Nevada Department of Wildlife. In so doing, O’Leary suggests that agency officials can, and do, lobby for change when unhappy with the status quo policy. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0275074012443730">Rabe (2004)</xref> provides the example of Bob Shinn, then an environmental agency administrator in New Jersey, pushing Governor Whitman’s decision to restrict carbon dioxide emissions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0275074012443730">Stein (1991)</xref> describes city firefighters lobbying the state legislature in Missouri for pay increases, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0275074012443730">Maynard-Moody (1989)</xref> provides an example of state corrections officers using their policy knowledge to help shape state legislative decision making.</p>
<p>In sum, these case studies, as well as the modern bureaucratic-politics and policy-process literatures, generally align around answers to the <italic>whether</italic> and <italic>why</italic> questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0275074012443730">Kaufman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0275074012443730">Kingdon, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0275074012443730">Ripley &amp; Franklin, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0275074012443730">Rourke, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0275074012443730">Wilson 1989</xref>). Stated differently, it is not a matter of whether agency officials influence the policy-making process; they do. And it is not a matter of why agencies influence policy-related decision making; the answer stems from the technical expertise, academic training, and professionalization that agency officials bring to the broader policy-making process. Yet, despite some consensus on these whether and why questions, we still hold limited knowledge regarding <italic>how</italic> this influence translates into policy change or, at the end of the day, the degree to which this influence affects policy decision making in the United States.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0275074012443730">
<title>Argument—An Oversight Mechanism</title>
<p>We theorize that the political oversight provided by legislators and elected executives (such as presidents and governors) opens up opportunities for agency officials to share policy-relevant information and expertise and, in so doing, to affect the aggregate-level decision making of elected officials. The act of political oversight, we argue, causes agency officials to interact and communicate with those elected officials who have been given the responsibility of overseeing the bureaucracy. We expect some oversight to occur because elected officials depend on the bureaucracy to write regulations, implement policy, provide information, and monitor and enforce compliance with existing law.</p>
<p>We consider political oversight to be communications with agency officials initiated by legislators, the governor/president, or members of their personal staffs that aim to bring some form of accountability to administrative agencies. The literature tends to emphasize mechanisms of oversight that are formal and typically more adversarial in nature. For instance, hearings are often viewed as a main vehicle for congressional oversight of federal agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0275074012443730">Aberbach, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0275074012443730">2002</xref>). These provide a visible signal of interactions between legislators and administrators. However, this may be an unnecessarily narrow and constraining view of how elected representatives manage and direct the behaviors of administrative agencies. Even informal exchanges to obtain information, clarification, or explanation for agency choices or bureaucratic behavior may very well be mechanisms by which elected political principals hold agency officials accountable. For example, an inquiry about service levels may at first blush appear solely informational; yet, such an inquiry may also send a signal to agency administrators that their actions are being monitored. Furthermore, it is possible that these interactions may be neutral or even friendly in nature.</p>
<p>It is important to note that our focus is on “active” forms of oversight, as opposed to “passive” forms; we have no theoretical expectation that passive forms of oversight, such as those proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0275074012443730">McCubbins, Noll, Weingast (1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0275074012443730">1989</xref>) and others, would affect the current policy influence of bureaucrats. Consequently, some form of personal contact must be initiated by an elected official (or their personal staffs) with an agency official for our theorized mechanism to be activated.</p>
<p>Specifically, we hypothesize that oversight opens up lines of communications and, as a result, provides a pathway for agency policy influence over legislators and elected executives. We argue that managers influence the policy making of elected officials due to their position as policy experts. Agency administrators often have specialized academic training and professionalization and hold technical knowledge that is important to the formation of public policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0275074012443730">Kaufman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0275074012443730">Kingdon, 1995</xref>; Ripley &amp; Franklin, 1987; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0275074012443730">Rourke, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0275074012443730">Wilson, 1989</xref>). In contrast, legislators and elected executives are typically generalists who are continually searching for policy solutions that address perceived problems on their political agendas or that are in the interests of their constituents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0275074012443730">Kingdon 1995</xref>). We reason that agency officials hold policy influence because they can educate legislators and executives about the ramifications of potential choices, as well as offer the technical details necessary to actually begin legislative initiatives or executive actions. Moreover, in today’s information environment, the policy expertise of agency officials has become even more valuable. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0275074012443730">Jones and Baumgartner (2005)</xref> demonstrate, the atmosphere in modern legislatures is complicated by an overload of information. Therefore, those individuals—such as agency administrators—who are well positioned to simplify and synthesize data, trends, and policy alternatives will be better situated to influence the policy-making process.</p>
<p>In making this argument, our work falls within a long line of literature on the policy consequences attached to the oversight duties performed by elected officials over the (largely) unelected bureaucracy. Our contribution, however, is noteworthy because we look for aggregate-level policy consequences <italic>not</italic> within the administrative agencies themselves, as has been done in countless studies, but instead, within the broader policy-making process. Moreover, while the current literature often portrays oversight as a unidirectional relationship where the political-principal influences the agent, this argument acknowledges that it may be more cooperative and/or reciprocal. As a result, we see our contribution to be in identifying a previously unidentified consequence of the political oversight of the bureaucracy, namely increased agency influence on legislative and executive decision making.</p>

<title>Testing the Argument</title>
<sec id="section6-0275074012443730">
<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>We rely primarily on data from the 2008 ASAP to test our hypothesis. ASAP collects survey information from all state agency heads active in the American states. The 2008 version of ASAP was a mail questionnaire sent to all state agency heads. The response rate of 25% was confirmed as representative of the full population of state agency leaders contacted by ASAP.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0275074012443730">2</xref></sup> The responses to this survey provide the empirical base for variables that measure the attributes, activities, actions, and attitudes of state administrators. We supplement the ASAP survey data with information on state-level institutional powers, environmental characteristics, and partisanship. This information comes from a variety of sources, which we discuss below in connection with the specific variables.</p>
<p>We draw primarily upon the ASAP data to test our argument for three main reasons. First and most importantly, while we acknowledge that these informed assessments and attitudes of state agency heads do not explain the totality of political reality, our reasoning follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0275074012443730">Hoffmann’s (1967</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0275074012443730">Weick 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0275074012443730">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0275074012443730">2001</xref>), who writes, “[P]erceptions are more than a part of political reality: they mold it, insofar as they are the springs and fuel of action” (p. 57). Thus, we view the informed opinions of state agency heads as a critical and scientifically valid lens for understanding political phenomenon and relationships, while also responding to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0275074012443730">Goodsell’s (2006)</xref> call for more studies focusing on the perspectives and perceptions of public administrators. Second, the use of state agency heads’ perceptions allows us to provide an aggregate-level assessment of agency influence on legislative and executive decision making. Past work on the topic (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0275074012443730">Krause, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0275074012443730">O’Leary, 1994</xref>) is either only descriptive in nature and/or is constrained to single agencies. The use of informed agency opinions allows us to test our hypothesis with data on all agency types and across the 50 states. Third, a variety of scholars have relied on the perceptions of agency heads as a critical indicator of political decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0275074012443730">Bowling &amp; Ferguson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0275074012443730">Brudney, Fernandez, Ryu, &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0275074012443730">Brudney, Hebert, &amp; Wright 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0275074012443730">Jacobson, Palus, &amp; Bowling, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0275074012443730">Kelleher &amp; Yackee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0275074012443730">Palus &amp; Yackee, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>We employ a multilevel linear modeling strategy with individual agency administrators nested in states to test the hypothesis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0275074012443730">3</xref></sup> A hierarchical design offers a multitude of methodological advantages. First, it controls for the clustering of individuals within larger units, and, thus, it does not violate the assumption of statistical independence. Second, it accounts for the possibility of nonconstant variance across different states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0275074012443730">Gelman, Shor, Bafumi, &amp; Park, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0275074012443730">Raudenbush &amp; Bryck, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0275074012443730">Steenbergen &amp; Jones, 2002</xref>). Finally, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0275074012443730">Lynn, Heinrich, and Hill (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0275074012443730">Brudney et al. (2005)</xref>, hierarchical structures of governance drive almost all public programs, and this fact ought to be acknowledged in efforts to explain policy-related decision making. Failure to use a multilevel strategy for nested data can result in biased standard errors as well as incorrect Type I error rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0275074012443730">Steenbergen &amp; Jones, 2002</xref>). In this article, the multilevel models involve the estimation of both a Level 1 (individual) and a Level 2 (state) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0275074012443730">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0275074012443730">Steenbergen &amp; Jones, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>We use two dependent variables in subsequent models—<italic>agency policy influence on governor</italic> and <italic>agency policy influence on legislature</italic>. The ASAP survey probes how agency policy-relevant information and expertise may influence decisions made by other policy actors, such as the governor and legislators. The specific question asks, “Over the past 4 years has your agency influenced the decision-making of any of the following? If yes, please indicate, on a scale of 1 (<italic>low</italic>) to 5 (<italic>high</italic>) the degree of influence.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0275074012443730">4</xref></sup> Respondents who answered “no” in the initial screening question were coded as zero.

<title>Independent Variables</title>
<sec id="section9-0275074012443730">
<title>Oversight</title>
<p>To operationalize our hypothesized theoretical mechanism, we include four variables tapping different aspects of oversight. The first two variables report on the frequency of interactions between political principals and top agency administrators. <italic>Contacts</italic> and <italic>contacts-staff</italic> are included in each model and measure communications with agency heads that were initiated by elected political principals—namely, the governor, the governor’s staff, legislators, and legislative staff. By including these objective indicators of oversight—“objective” in that they are the direct reports of communication exchanges—we are able to mitigate concerns of potential measurement error within these survey-based oversight covariates considerably. These variables are constructed from questions on the ASAP survey that ask agency heads to assess contacts with elected officials, be it daily, weekly, monthly, less than monthly, or never. We then converted this scale to one that is measured in days.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0275074012443730">5</xref></sup> Respondents were then asked to evaluate the percentage of contacts initiated by these political principals, with the options of none, 20%, 40%, 60 %,80 %, or 100%. We multiplied this percentage by the number of contact days to calculate the variables. In the governor model, we include the contacts initiated by the governor and governor’s staff; in the legislative model, we include contacts initiated by legislators and legislative staff with the agency head.</p>
<p>The second two variables capture perceived oversight by legislators and governors more broadly. <italic>Control</italic> is constructed from a question that asked respondents to assess whether the governor or the legislature exercised greater control and oversight over the agency. We convert the survey question into two dummy variables. In the governor model, a value of “1” indicates that the governor was a greater source of control and oversight. In the legislative model, a value of “1” indicates that the respondent pointed to the legislature as the greater source of control and oversight. <italic>Change</italic> is constructed from a question on the survey that reads, “Were any shifts in program priorities the result of policy initiatives or actions originated by any of the following?” Two dummy variables are constructed for the agency heads who checked “governor” and “legislators.” The variable tapping the governor as a source of policy change is included in the governor model, and, alternatively, the variable pointing to legislators is in the legislative model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0275074012443730">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>We include a number of measures to control for other potential drivers of agency policy influence in the states. Two variables are included to operationalize the general policy orientation of the agency leader. Higher values on both variables indicate a greater direct effort and interest in influencing the policy-making process. <italic>Policy development</italic> is from an ASAP question asking respondents to enumerate what percentage of their time is devoted to policy development with governors, legislators, and boards. The variable <italic>give and take</italic> is taken from a survey question which asked respondents to evaluate on a 5-point scale (ranging from <italic>strongly agree</italic> to <italic>strongly disagree</italic>) their feelings about the following statement: “The give and take of public policy making doesn’t appeal to me.”</p>
<p>We include two variables to represent administrators’ perceptions about the regularity and effectiveness of their networking behaviors with external stakeholders and political players. It is possible that administrators who have broader professional networks will be more successful in influencing policy making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074012443730">Berry, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0275074012443730">Heclo, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0275074012443730">Sabatier, 1988</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0275074012443730">Kaufman (2001</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0275074012443730">O’Leary, 1994</xref>) writes that public agencies may use their friends and “constituencies” within their policy and issue networks to pressurize their political superiors for policy change. The first network variable, <italic>clientele groups</italic>, asks respondents to assess their level of influence on the decision making of clientele groups. The second variable, <italic>networking ability</italic>, is an additive scale compiled from a series of questions that ask state agency heads to evaluate the frequency of their contacts with the following parties: personnel in other state agencies, clientele groups, citizens, officials in other states, local officials, and national officials. Choice categories were daily, weekly, monthly, less than monthly, or never, and we then converted this scale into one measured in days.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0275074012443730">6</xref></sup> The alpha for the scale is .73, indicating solid scale reliability and construction.</p>
<p>We also include a series of additional variables to tap dimensions and characteristics of the agency and issue environment. <italic>Agency salience</italic> is a dummy variable, with values of “1” indicating the state administrator leads an agency dealing with functional areas of greater salience. We relied on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0275074012443730">Gormley’s (1986)</xref> definition of salience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0275074012443730">7</xref></sup> One might anticipate that agencies tasked with high salience policy duties would have more influence on political principals. The variables <italic>number of employees</italic> and <italic>size of budget</italic> measure characteristics related to the size of the agency. Again, one might expect that larger agencies would hold greater influence on the governor and legislators than would smaller agencies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0275074012443730">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>We include a number of state-level controls in our analyses, as well. In both models, we include an indicator tapping <italic>interest group registrations</italic>, as measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0275074012443730">Gray and Lowery (2001)</xref>. This measure picks up the density of state interest group environments. It may be that a denser environment of organized interests will decrease overall agency policy influence. We also include a number of variables tapping state institutional characteristics. In the governor’s model, we include Beyle’s measures, <italic>institutional powers</italic> and <italic>personal powers of the governor</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0275074012443730">Beyle, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0275074012443730">9</xref></sup> Higher numbers on these scales indicate greater authority. It is possible that in states where the governor’s powers are stronger, there will be less agency influence on the decision making of the top executive. In the legislative model, we include two institutional characteristics, <italic>term limits</italic> and <italic>legislative professionalism. Term limits</italic> is a dummy variable with values of “1” indicating the presence of terms limits in 2008 and is collected from the national conference of state legislatures. <italic>Legislative professionalism</italic> is a rank, which is collected from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0275074012443730">Squire (2000)</xref>, with higher values representing more professionalized legislatures. We control for both factors because agency-provided expertise may be more valuable in term limited state legislatures and in less professionalized institutions.</p>
<p>Finally, several variables measure specific characteristics of the agency head. <italic>Party match</italic> measures whether the administrator’s self-identified political party is the same as the governor or the legislative majority. Agency administrators from the same political party as the elected executive, or from the majority party in the legislature, may be better positioned to see their policy preferences enacted. Using similar logic, <italic>appointment</italic> is included as a dummy variable to control for the appointment process of the state agency heads, with a value of 1 indicating that the administrator was appointed by the governor and a zero otherwise. Finally, a number of standard demographic controls are used: education, gender, race, years in agency, and age.</p>

<title>Results: Assessing the Oversight Mechanism</title>
<p>An initial step in multilevel analysis is beginning with an “unconditional” or null model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0275074012443730">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>, p. 24; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0275074012443730">Steenbergen &amp; Jones, 2002</xref>, p. 224) to estimate the variation in each dependent variable attributable to state-level differences. Such a model includes no predictors at either the individual or state level. The Level 1 model—essentially a one-way ANOVA with random effects—follows for the first dependent variable tapping perceptions of policy influence on governor.</p>
<p>Agency policy influence on governor<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> = β<sub>0<italic>j</italic></sub> + <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub></p>
<p>The Level 2 model then seeks to explain β<sub>0<italic>j</italic></sub> via the following equation,</p>
<p>β<sub>0<italic>j</italic></sub> = γ<sub>00</sub> + <italic>u</italic><sub>0<italic>j</italic></sub></p>
<p>By substituting the Level 2 equation into Level 1, the full hierarchical model to be estimated is</p>
<p>Agency policy influence on governor<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> = γ<sub>00</sub> + <italic>u</italic><sub>0<italic>j</italic></sub> + <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub></p>
<p>where γ<sub>00</sub>, the constant, represents the average level of agency policy influence on the governor, <italic>u</italic><sub>0<italic>j</italic></sub> (the state-level random effect) is the variance component of the Level 2 units, and <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> (the individual-level random effect) is the variance component of the Level 1 units. Essentially, at this stage in the analysis, we are primarily interested in <italic>u</italic><sub>0<italic>j</italic></sub>, which tells us whether significant state-level variation (or clustering) is present. In other words, this effect captures whether the agency influence on the governor varies significantly at the state level in the sample. As the coefficient for the random effect is significant, we conclude that there is some important variation at the state level that must be acknowledged, and, therefore, the multilevel model is an appropriate strategy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0275074012443730">10</xref></sup> A similar result is observed for the second dependent variable, the agency policy influence on legislature.

<p>With respect to the influence agency heads have on the decision making of governors, we see strong evidence supporting our hypothesis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0275074012443730">12</xref></sup> In the presence of greater oversight, the influence of administrators on the decision making of the governor is augmented. As evidenced in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0275074012443730">Table 4</xref>, all four of the indicators for oversight are statistically significant and in the hypothesized, positive direction. For instance, when the number of contacts initiated by the governor or the governor’s staff increases, so too does the influence of the agency leader on the decision-making processes of the governor. Overall, these results suggest that gubernatorial oversight opens channels for communication and interaction and, ultimately, increases agency policy influence. Moreover, these findings emerge even with statistical controls for the administrator’s appointment process and the partisan alignment of the governor and the agency head included in the models.</p>
<p>To more effectively understand the magnitude of these coefficients, we calculated the predicted values of the statistically significant variables. In the final column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0275074012443730">Table 4</xref>, we present the results of these calculations for the governor’s model. Here, we varied the independent variable from its minimum to its maximum observed value in the data, while holding all other variables constant at their mean. Thus, the value in the table may be thought of as the percentage shift in the perceived influence of the administrator on the governor’s decision making under these scenarios. The most pronounced results are observed for the two variables tapping the contacts initiated by the governor and his or her staff. Moving from the minimum of zero daily contacts initiated by the governor to the maximum of 200 contacts per year, we see an increase of nearly 22% in the level of influence of an administrator. Similarly, with respect to contacts initiated by the governor’s staff, we likewise see an increase in about 15% when we move from the minimum to the maximum value in the data. When both of these variables move together, we see even greater agency influence on gubernatorial decision making with increases of as much as 36%. Recall that the contacts and contacts-staff measures simply report the frequency of interactions between the governor and agency head. Thus, neither do these measures rely on the <italic>perception</italic> of oversight nor do they leave room for interpretation regarding the scale of influence; instead, these tap actual day-to-day communications patterns.</p>
<p>The two variables that measure the policy orientation of an administrator also have significant, positive effects. First, administrators who spend more time on policy development have greater influence on the governor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0275074012443730">13</xref></sup> In addition, those who embrace the “give and take” of the policy process hold more influence. Substantively, the direct efforts of administrators to engage in the policy-making process appear to matter, with the predicted values of the dependent variable indicating a near 20% increase in perceived policy impact. For give and take, there is a 9% increase, moving from the minimum to the maximum value (again, with all other variables set at their mean).</p>
<p>The variables assessing networking practices present a mixed picture. The first variable tapping the networking explanation, clientele groups, is positive and substantial in size, which suggests that administrators who are more involved, connected, and influential within their network are also more influential on gubernatorial decision making. However, the second variable tapping this construct, the <italic>networking scale</italic>, is insignificant.</p>
<p>Of the six variables included in the model measuring the agency and issue environment, only one had statistically significant effects—the number of employees. This result implies that in larger agencies, greater influence on gubernatorial decision making is perceived. Two of the variables tapping differences in administrator characteristics have a statistically significant effect. When the administrator is of the same party as the governor, the administrator has greater influence. Thus, it appears that political alignment is an important predictor with respect to explaining administrator impact on the executive branch. In addition, in agencies in which the governor appoints the administrator, the level of policy influence on the governor rises.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0275074012443730">Table 5</xref>, we present the findings from our model with agency policy influence on the legislature as the dependent variable. The pattern of results here is noticeably different than those observed in the previous model. Here, we see little support for the hypothesized “oversight mechanism.” While the indicators of oversight were quite important for an agency head’s influence with the governor, with respect to the legislature, only the change variable is statistically significant. However, the predicted value indicates that it is of little substantive effect. This implies that the communication generated via oversight does not appear to change the overall patterns of administrative influence on legislative decision making. That said, it is certainly plausible that the null findings with regard, in particular, to the legislative contact variables reflect the fact that some portion of these interactions are directed toward legislative involvement with constituent services or other project-specific requests. While our conceptualization of oversight purposively includes such legislator–agency head interactions, it may be that these communications provide a weaker vehicle for agency officials to exert policy influence than other forms of legislative oversight.</p>
<p>However, we see that direct policy efforts and the administrator’s policy-making orientation do positively shape the influence he or she is able to hold over the legislature. The substantive effect of the time spent on policy development is substantial, with the predicted value of influence on the legislature increasing by more than 21% when policy development moves from low to high.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0275074012443730">14</xref></sup> With respect to the agency leader’s prioritization of involvement in the process, we also observe a positive and significant effect, accompanied by a more than 6% increase in the dependent variable’s predicted value.</p>
<p>The two networking indicators are both statistically significant and positive. When we calculate the predicted values of each of these independent variables moving from their minimum to maximum observed values in the data, the resulting shifts in the legislature dependent variable is 28% and 12%, respectively. And when both of these variables move together from their minimum to maximum, we see more clearly the importance of agency networks to the broader policy-making process, with agency influence on legislative decision making increasing by 39%. These results indicate that the breadth of an agency’s network is an important predictor of agency influence within the legislature.</p>
<p>The pattern of results for the remaining variables generally parallels what was observed in the model of agency influence on the governor, with the exception of variables related to the issue environment. In this category of variables, there are no statistically significant results. However, in the group of indicators tapping administrator characteristics, again we see that political party matters, such that when the administrator is of the same party of the legislature, agency heads are more likely to perceive higher levels of influence. In neither model do any of the state-level variables matter. Considering the minimal variance attributable to state characteristics, however, this is not surprising. In addition, the demographic administrator characteristics that are often demonstrated to play a role in managerial successes do not matter here—such as, levels of education, age, gender, race, and tenure—and thus, they have little effect on an administrator’s perceptions regarding their influence over the governor or the legislature.</p>
<p>Overall, the results suggest that the channels of communication opened by the political oversight mechanism appear more influential on gubernatorial decision making than on that of the legislature. As a result, our hypothesis is only partially confirmed, which necessitates placing these findings in a broader context to help reconcile the divergent patterns. In particular, they suggest that agency policy influence may be conditional on the institutional differences between the office of the governor and state legislatures. Power is concentrated in the governor and his or her staff, while it is more dispersed among diffuse and diverse state legislatures. As a result, an oversight contact from a single legislator—even if he or she is a party leader or committee chair—may be less effective in shaping the policy outcomes than a contact from the governor. Not only are there numerically more legislators but also the legislative branch is governed by institutional rules which may further decrease the effectiveness of the oversight mechanism. Three stand out in particular. First, legislatures operate under majority rule. Thus, convincing one member does not necessarily translate into policy success. Second, 49 states have bicameral legislatures, and, thus, success in one chamber does not necessarily lead to broad influence. Finally, legislative districts are drawn such that they represent specific interests, and, therefore, legislators are more likely to be responsive to narrow, local interests as opposed to the statewide concerns of agencies. Thus, we conclude these institutional differences appear to influence how agencies can best affect policy decision making.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We began this article with a puzzle: There is a well-developed literature devoted to measuring the influence elected officials hold over the U.S. bureaucracy’s policy decisions and an equally important literature suggesting a “politics–administration dichotomy.” Both imply that bureaucratic influence within the broader policy-making process ought to be limited. Yet the practice of government and a smaller subset of the academic literature posit the opposite: Agency administrators play an integral role in policy development by providing information, expertise, and ideas. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0275074012443730">Rabe (2004)</xref> goes one step farther characterizing some agency officials as <italic>policy entrepreneurs</italic>, who are “well positioned to see opportunities for new policy and to literally translate ideas for innovation into workable policies” (p. 23). Yet, surprisingly, we have only limited knowledge of the theoretical mechanisms that may allow for agency officials to hold influence during legislative and gubernatorial policy making.</p>
<p>Our contributions are both theoretical and empirical. First, we put forward a new argument rooted in both public administration and political science scholarship that suggests how agency officials may influence the broader policy-making process. We theorize that the active oversight of the bureaucracy instigated by elected officials can provide a means for agency leaders to advance their policy recommendations and broaden agency policy influence. Stated differently, we suggest that oversight first reduces the communication barriers between “principal” and “agent” and, in doing so, increases the influence of administrative agencies with legislatures and elected executives. This argument augments the dominant perspective highlighting the political control of the bureaucracy. Past work tends to focus on the direct effects of oversight on bureaucratic outputs, while leaving little room for the agency official to play an active role. This article begins to fill this gap by specifying one key mechanism by which political oversight of the bureaucracy may open up pathways for information exchange and, at times, influence over the policy-making process.</p>
<p>Second, in our empirical analysis, we uncover strong evidence in support of our hypothesized “oversight mechanism” within gubernatorial decision making. However, oversight matters much less to agency influence in state legislatures, where we find that agencies with larger policy networks are better able to affect state legislative decision making. In both cases, the direct efforts of agency leaders to affect policy making also matter a good deal on their broader patterns of influence. These results suggest that agency leaders have greater success lobbying governors than more diffuse and diverse state legislatures. In the end, we conclude that agencies hold noteworthy influence within the broader policy-making process and, in the case of the elected executive, part of this influence appears attributable to lines of communication opened due to the political oversight of the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Our theory and findings build on the vast literature in public administration and political science debating the most appropriate conceptualization of the bureaucracy’s position within the broader system of democratic governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0275074012443730">Cook, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0275074012443730">Demir, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0275074012443730">Demir &amp; Nyhan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0275074012443730">Goodsell, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0275074012443730">Hill, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0275074012443730">Kaufman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0275074012443730">Meier &amp; O’Toole, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0275074012443730">Warner, 2001</xref>). In addition, this article holds several implications for scholars, as well as practitioners. For instance, our findings acknowledge the important role that state-level administrators play in the policy-making process. Indeed, agency heads perceive their policy influence over decisions in legislatures and governor’s office to be important, noteworthy, and influential. Moreover, political oversight, which is often portrayed in a negative fashion and as a vehicle for the political “control” of ostensibly “out-of-control” public agencies, is—at least in some circumstances—a mechanism that drives agency policy influence. Yet, of course, more work remains to be done. Future research ought to develop over time measures of agency policy influence across multiple agencies, as well as investigate how, specifically, agency officials use their expertise and information to bring about policy change. In doing so, future work may wish to extend its data collection to local layers of government, as well. In addition, new research should push beyond our perception-based measures of agency influence and build on this article to establish a fuller understanding of the construct. For instance, future work ought to gather non-perception-based measures that allow a researcher to separate out purely informational communications from those “oversight” contacts that also serve to bring about some form of agency accountability. Finally, more theoretical work ought to be brought out to fully understand the normative implications of these findings for the place of agency officials within the United States’s system of representative democracy.</p>

<p>One possible exception to this characterization is scholarship on “iron triangles”—the broad idea that agency officials, congressional committee members, and interest group representatives make policy together within a closed policy subsystem; here agency officials play a substantial role in the legislative policy-making process. However, this frequently cited hypothesis is largely discredited and has given way to a more permeable and fluid characterization of the modern policy-making process. Another exception is the bureaucracy’s ability to influence policy directly through its writing of regulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0275074012443730">Furlong, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0275074012443730">Golden, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0275074012443730">Kerwin &amp; Furlong, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0275074012443730">West, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0275074012443730">Yackee, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0275074012443730">2012</xref>). In this way, the bureaucracy influences policy through its interpretation and implementation of existing statutes and executive orders. The bureaucracy’s policy influence during rulemaking is clear and well documented by a growing empirical literature. However, given our interest in the decision making of elected policy makers, it is not our focus here.</p></fn>

<p>We have also estimated the models using only the scale of 1 (<italic>low</italic>) to 5 (<italic>high</italic>) the degree of influence, thereby excluding those answering “no” to the initial screening question. The results are consistent with those presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0275074012443730">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0275074012443730">5</xref>.</p></fn>

<p>For example, when contacts took place daily between the governor’s staff and an agency head, we coded this observation as 250; weekly contacts as 50; monthly as 12; less than monthly as 6; and never as 0. We assumed 50 weeks of work per year (2 weeks of vacations) and based our conversion into days on this assumption. Thus, daily contact is calculated as follows: 50 weeks × 5 work days per week = 250 contacts.</p></fn>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0275074012443730">Gormley (1986)</xref> writes “[a] highly salient issue is one that affects a large number of people in a significant way” (p. 598). The salient categories of agencies were Income Security and Social Services, Education, Health, Natural Resources, Environment and Energy, Economic Development, and Criminal Justice. The nonsalient categories were Elected Officials (e.g., State Treasury), Fiscal Staff, Nonfiscal Staff, Regulatory, Transportation, and Other (e.g., State Library).</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-0275074012443730">

<p>We also estimated the models using the log of both the Size of Budget and Number of Employees variables. There were no substantive differences for the key independent variables.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn9-0275074012443730">
<label>9.</label>
<p>The Institutional Powers Index is composed of measures tapping the election of executive branch officials, the tenure potential of governors, appointment powers, budgetary powers, veto power, and party control. The Personal Powers Index uses measures of the governor’s electoral mandate, political ambition, personal future, and job performance. These are averaged for 2005 and 2007.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn10-0275074012443730">
<label>10.</label>
<p>We also calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), which indicates how the overall variance in the dependent variable is divided between the individual and state level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0275074012443730">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>). For both dependent variables, approximately 2 percent of the variance is attributable to state-level differences. Although this ICC percentage is small, it is not inconsistent with other articles using similar modeling strategies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0275074012443730">Rahn &amp; Rudolph, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0275074012443730">Steenbergen and Jones (2002)</xref> suggest, due to the individual-level measurement of the dependent variable in all multilevel models, we should expect to see the vast majority of the variance explained at the individual level.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn11-0275074012443730">
<label>11.</label>
<p>The sample size of the models is somewhat smaller than the full ASPA survey due to some missing values on the independent variables.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn12-0275074012443730">
<label>12.</label>
<p>To address potential endogeneity concerns, we also estimated both models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0275074012443730">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0275074012443730">5</xref>) with the subset of respondents who had greater than 4 years of work experience in their state. In responding to the survey questions measuring oversight, these individuals drew upon their prior histories with respect to relationships and interactions. For instance, two of the key measures of oversight (Contacts and Contacts-Staff) ask the administrator to assess “average” communication patterns. Consequently, in answering these questions, longer serving administrators drew upon experiences that precede the measurement of the dependent variables used in the analyses. In our sensitivity tests, we uncover no evidence of endogeneity and find no substantive differences from those presented in the article.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn13-0275074012443730">
<label>13.</label>
<p>As a sensitivity analysis, we assessed the potential correlation between the dependent variable (Agency Policy Influence on Governor) and the predictor variable (Policy Development). They are not correlated at a high level (0.24). In addition, we reran our main model results excluding this variable, and there were no substantive differences in terms of the oversight variables.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn14-0275074012443730">
<label>14.</label>
<p>The variables Policy Development and Agency Policy Influence on Legislature are not highly correlated and the exclusion of Policy Development from the model does not change the results for the key explanatory variables.</p></fn>
