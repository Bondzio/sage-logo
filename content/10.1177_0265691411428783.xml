<p>Although there are no explicit references to past works on the history of peace, this book by Antony Adolf (an independent scholar born in Montreal, Canada) shares the perspective and normative orientation of recent Spanish, German and Anglophone scholarship, which has made peace a specific field of historical inquiry. As the title suggests, the aim and scope of the book are ambitious. The author starts with prehistoric conflict and peace, drawing on insights from biology and palaeontology, then highlights the profound change in the nature of violent conflicts and their resolution after the ‘Neolithic revolution’ and the birth of urbanism. In a line of thought which can be traced back to Kropotkin, the author stresses the importance of cooperation in human survival. Subsequent chapters explore notions and practices of peace in the major ancient civilizations, Greece and Rome, as well ancient India, China and Japan; monotheistic religions and their impact on world history; and concepts and practices of peace in European history from the Middle Ages to colonialism. A separate chapter is devoted to the analysis of peace in early economic discourse. Two chapters outline the history of peace in the twentieth century, and one deals with the ‘presents of peace’. The book ends with a theoretical essay on the meanings and dimensions of peace in history, in the present and the future, which appears quite detached from the world history depicted in the preceding chapters and not very persuasive from a theoretical standpoint.</p>
<p>A necessary starting point for a history of peace is a clear definition of the subject, as well as the clarification of its complex relationships with its conceptual opposite – war. Adolf rejects the simple view of peace as a mere absence of violent conflict: it is a multi-faceted concept, which embraces social justice, protection of individuals, and the ability to settle conflicts peacefully. At the outset the author defines three heuristic categories of peace and peacemaking: individual peace, social peace, and collective peace – respectively, the psychological, societal and international dimensions of peace. The first of these broad categories, however, finds relatively little coverage in the subsequent text. Due to the vastness of the field, the reader will not miss this absence. Adolf covers topics such as conflict settlement within societies, peace movements, the theory and practice of nonviolence, the history of ideas related to peace in religion, philosophy, economics and political thought. In the course of his analysis, a vision of ‘one world, many peaces’ emerges.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, a presentation of the topic of peace with such a vast scope is deeply fascinating. On the whole, the reader gets a broad picture of how peace has been at the same time an elusive goal and a desperately sought one across history and societies. Adolf handles a vast quantity of facts, sources and conceptual threads and weaves them together in a rich text. Along the way, a number of ad hoc qualifications and specifications are added to the concept of ‘peace’: one of the most interesting is ‘oppressive peace’, describing states that maintain peaceful relations externally, but are oppressive within their boundaries. These qualifications, however, do not add up to a complex, consistent concept of peace in history.</p>
<p>The text suffers from several further limitations. The crux of the book lies precisely in the complex relationship between peace and war. The limits of peace are inherently drawn by the appearance of violent conflict. Being complementary to war as a central category of political and social history, an enquiry into the history of peace has to take into account its logical opposite, and the factors that transform peaceful relationships into warlike ones (and vice versa). Otherwise the description offers only a partial account of peace. More often than not, this is the case in Adolf’s inquiry. For example, the author describes the well-known concept of the ‘Minoan peace’, introduced almost a century ago by Sir Arthur Evans, but does not mention its demise and the rise of the aggressive, expansive Mycenaean civilization. Another relevant limitation, which lies in the nature of such a work, is the lack of precision in details. Other shortcomings include information that is missing and a lack of reference to more recent scientific findings. At times, examples of peaceful events, symbols, or personalities are not mentioned. One example is the development of codified law in Roman civilization, which effectively regulated private disputes within Roman society and has been one of its lasting inheritances to the present day. Another stunning absence, in the chapter devoted to women who played an important role in the peace movement, is Virginia Woolf.</p>
<p>An even more relevant shortcoming of the text are the often entangled threads of history of events, myth and cultural history. Even worse, the author treats topics such as ancient Jewish history referring to the Old Testament, or the foundation of Rome relying on the traditional, Livian account as historical facts, without interpreting or contextualizing their mythologic or legendary content. Similarly, in the chapters devoted to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Adolf constantly moves between political and diplomatic history, cultural history and history of social movements, within the same section or paragraph, offering little logical justification for this continuous shift of focus. Adding up the myriad of minor and major inconsistencies, absences and errors, the text loses the necessary precision to make it a robust scholarly reference for the subject. To achieve this, a collective effort will be needed in the future.</p>
<p>Is the endeavour of a universal history of peace at all feasible and is it worthy of being pursued? In our opinion, Adolf’s book shows that such an intellectual project holds the promise of unearthing genealogies of peaceful cultures, behaviours and strategies across time; while this particular oeuvre has several limitations, it has a distinct fascination and encourages further development of the field. <italic>Peace: A World History</italic> is an inspiring book offering a broad-brush introduction to the history of peace. The end result does not reach the very high standard of a universal history of peace the author has set for himself: it cannot aspire to become the sole reference for students and scholars interested in the subject. It makes, however, intriguing reading: it reinforces the idea that the history of peace is a distinct subfield in the study of history.</p>
