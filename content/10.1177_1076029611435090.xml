<abstract>
<p>Phytosterolemia is a rare autosomal recessive disease of plant sterol metabolism, the pathophysiological features of which are high plasma levels of plant sterols and xanthomatosis caused by mutations of <italic>ABCG5</italic> and <italic>ABCG8</italic> genes, and the combination of hemolysis and macrothrombocytopenia is an unusual clinical manifestation. All the patients of the 3 unrelated phytosterolemia first presented with prominent macrothrombocytopenia and stomatocytosis. They were either homozygous or compound heterozygous for <italic>ABCG5</italic>/<italic>ABCG8</italic> gene mutations and had significantly elevated serum plant sterols levels quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. The in vitro study demonstrated that sitosterol can cause changes in shape and osmotic fragility of red blood cells. These findings suggest that macrothrombocytopenia and stomatocytosis could be initial and main features in some patients with phytosterolemia and that serum phytosterols and relevant genes should be analyzed in patients whose macrothrombocytopenia and/or stomatocytosis are unexplained, especially whose parents are of consanguineous marriage.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Phytosterolemia (sitosterolemia) is a rare autosomal recessive disease of plant sterol metabolism causing significantly elevated plasma levels of plant sterols in the form of sitosterol, cholestanol, and stigmasterol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076029611435090">1</xref></sup> To date, there are only about 100 known cases worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076029611435090">2</xref></sup> Phytosterolemia has been confirmed to be caused by mutations in genes of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) subfamily G members 5 and 8 (<italic>ABCG5</italic> and <italic>ABCG8</italic>) encoding sterolin-1 and sterolin-2, respectively, which preferentially excrete plant sterols out of intestinal cells into the gut lumen and out of liver cells into the bile ducts, thereby decreasing sterol absorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076029611435090">3</xref>

</p>
<p>The most common clinical features of phytosterolemia are tendinous and cutaneous xanthomas, premature coronary atherosclerosis, arthritis, and arthralgia.<sup>1,6-10</sup> In addition, a number of associated hematological abnormalities, including hemolysis, iron deficiency anemia, thrombocytopenia, large platelets, and splenomegaly, have been reported in some patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076029611435090">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076029611435090">11</xref></sup> In 2005, Rees and his coworkers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1076029611435090">10</xref></sup> in their attempts to genetically map hereditary stomatocytosis, identified 5 pedigrees with specific macrothrombocytopenia/stomatocytosis, which had significantly elevated levels of plant sterols in the blood and mutations in <italic>ABCG5</italic> and <italic>ABCG8</italic>, diagnostic of phytosterolemia. A year later, we also reported the clinical, biochemical, and molecular genetic features of 3 siblings of a Chinese family with phytosterolemia characterized by remarkable macrothrombocytopenia/stomatocytosis. We then suggested that blood cells could be a target for the toxic effect of elevated plant sterols in circulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076029611435090">9</xref></sup> In the present study, we describe 6 patients from 3 unrelated families of phytosterolemia who presented with a highly specific coexistence of macrothrombocytopenia and stomatocytosis and investigated the effect of high level of sitosterol on erythrocytes in in vitro study to demonstrate the clinical significance of hematological abnormalities in this condition.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>Three family trees were consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1076029611435090">Figure 1</xref>
). All the affected patients presented similar clinical problems to various degrees: thrombocytopenia, anemia, xanthomas, and splenomegaly. All the patients had an otherwise normal physical development with no obvious evidence of premature atherosclerosis or cardiovascular disease. Their blood smears showed large platelets, some of which were as large as erythrocytes, and abnormal erythrocyte shapes, mainly as stomatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1076029611435090">Figure 2</xref>
). Bone marrow examination showed normoplasia with normal megakaryocytic series. The platelet aggregation in response to adenosine diphosphate and ristocetin were generally normal. Platelet glycoproteins Ib/IX and IIb/IIIa measured by flow cytometry were also normal. The patients' erythrocytes showed an increased osmotic fragility. Hemolysis began at concentrations of 0.48% to 0.64% of saline solution and was complete at 0.32% to 0.40%. The results of other hemolytic tests, including Coombs test, Ham test, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose phosphate isomerase, and pyruvate kinase activity, were either negative or within normal ranges. The plasma levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein (apo)B in all patients were slightly higher than those in normal individuals, whereas the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apoA were not changed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1076029611435090">Table 1</xref>

<p>Apart from the common features mentioned above, the proband of family A (A-II-2), whose parents are first cousins, had frequent gingival bleeding and menorrhagia. After splenectomy, at the age of 12 because of thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly, xanthomas started to emerge on her bilateral eyelids and gradually expanded. Her aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase were slightly elevated, and she had evidence of cholelithiasis. She underwent hysterectomy because of severe postpartum hemorrhage at the age of 21. In family B, the proband (B-II-1) was once diagnosed as Evans' syndrome due to thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. After her large spleen had been removed, her anemia was markedly improved, but she noticed xanthomas that gradually grew on eyelids and right shoulder. The patient had no significant bleeding history, and intermarriage had not occurred in her recent generations. In family C, the proband (C-II-4) and her 2 brothers (C-II-2 and C-II-3) had very similar case histories. At the ages of 10 to 12, they had thrombocytopenia, anemia, and splenomegaly. They all underwent splenectomy at about 15 years old. C-II-2 had large fibromas (6 × 8 cm and 7.5 × 10 cm) in the 2 cheeks of his face. C-II-4 had iron deficiency anemia caused by menorrhagia. The oldest sibling (C-II-1) showed only mild anemia, small xanthelasma, and a palpable spleen. Their parents are not consanguineous. This study was approved by our institutional ethical committee.</p>

<p>Blood smears showed normal red cell morphology in the group of appropriate cholesterol dose. In the high-cholesterol group, there was a slight change in the red cell morphology with some spur cells appearing. However, various abnormal shapes of red cells were noted in the sitosterol group, mainly as stomatocyte, and some as target cell, spherocyte, and irregularly appearing erythrocyte, just like the findings in peripheral blood smears of the patients with phytosterolemia.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>All the affected individuals reported here showed specific hematological problems as well as extremely high plasma levels of plant sterols ascertained by HPLC, which are the biochemical hallmark of phytosterolemia. The identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in <italic>ABCG5</italic> and <italic>ABCG8</italic> genes further confirmed the diagnosis of phytosterolemia in these patients.</p>
<p>The coexistence of macrothrombocytopenia and stomatocytic hemolysis is an unusual condition, similar clinical feature was previously found only in individuals with Mediterranean macrothrombocytopenia/stomatocytosis, originally described in Mediterranean migrants living in Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1076029611435090">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1076029611435090">15</xref></sup> However, the related reports ceased over a 5-year period, indicating that the condition was not persistent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1076029611435090">16</xref></sup> In a later investigation also in Australian residents of Mediterranean migrants, no more evidence of such blood cell changes could be detected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1076029611435090">14</xref></sup> Conversely, similar hematologic characteristics have been found in some patients of phytosterolemia reported by Rees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1076029611435090">10</xref></sup> and by us.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076029611435090">9</xref></sup> And this study showed 3 other pedigrees with same specific features. It should be noted that there are several important differences between these 2 disorders: (1) Mediterranean macrothrombocytopenia/stomatocytosis occurred only in small population of Australian immigrants from Italy and Greece,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1076029611435090">14</xref></sup> whereas phytosterolemia appears on no ethnic prevalence; (2) in Mediterranean macrothrombocytopenia/stomatocytosis, no evidence of inheritance was suspected,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1076029611435090">17</xref></sup> while phytosterolemia has been confirmed to be an inherited disease; and (3) Mediterranean stomatocytosis/macrothrombocytopenia was seen in otherwise healthy individuals, while patients with phytosterolemia often present with various relevant symptoms or signs. Therefore, Mediterranean macrothrombocytopenia/stomatocytosis seems unlikely to be a separate entity but perhaps due to the diet rich in plant oil, especially olive oil.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1076029611435090">18</xref></sup> Although both clinical and laboratory features are rather variable among the patients with phytosterolemia, the results of this study, together with the 2 previous reports, demonstrate that macrothrombocytopenia/stomatocytosis could be the most prominent or initial clinical features in some patients. The precise mechanisms underlying this interesting link between defective plant sterol metabolism and hematological abnormalities remain unclear so far. The <italic>ABCG5</italic> and <italic>ABCG8</italic> genes are not expressed in hematologic cells, but an excess of sterols can be detected in both platelets and erythrocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076029611435090">1</xref></sup> In addition, the in vitro experiment also showed an increase in osmotic fragility with obvious dysmorphism when normal erythrocytes were incubated in the presence of sitosterol. In animal model experiments, Kruit et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1076029611435090">19</xref></sup> observed overt macrothrombocytopenia in a <italic>Abcg5</italic>-deficient phytosterolemia mice. Wild-type mice transplanted with bone marrow from <italic>Abcg5</italic>-deficient mice appeared normal, whereas <italic>Abcg5</italic>-deficient mice transplanted with wild-type bone marrow still showed macrothrombocytopenia. In addition, Chase et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1076029611435090">20</xref></sup> described the spontaneous mouse <italic>Abcg5</italic> mutation characterized by macrothrombocytopenia. Crosses with mice doubly transgenic for the human <italic>ABCG5</italic> and <italic>ABCG8</italic> genes rescued platelet counts and volumes. Both of these mice models demonstrated that accumulation of plant sterol is responsible for development of macrothrombocytopenia, although hemolytic stress was not or only mildly affected because of species difference. Therefore, all these results support our previous hypothesis that the hematological abnormalities would be due to the toxic effect of plant sterols on blood cells, rending them more prone to dysmormophism and rupture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076029611435090">9</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The question why only a few, but not all, patients with phytosterolemia prominently or initially present with the specific hematological abnormalities is unanswered. It could probably be due to other background genetic factors, or it might be contributable to various environmental influence on hematologic cells. These presumptions need further more investigation.</p>
<p>During the past 5 years, we have found 5 pedigrees of phytosterolemia in our single institute via hematology, including the one previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076029611435090">9</xref></sup> and another one, the gene mutation of which is to be identified. This fact indicates that this disease is certainly not as rare as originally thought.</p>
<p>Of note, the usual assays for cholesterol levels cannot differentiate between cholesterol and plant sterols, and plant sterol measurement is not yet routinely available. In fact, many of the patients originally diagnosed with pseudohomozygous familial hypercholesterolemia were subsequently found to have phytosterolemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076029611435090">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076029611435090">7</xref></sup> Therefore, it is essential that plasma plant sterols should be measured in patients with unexplained stomatocytosis and/or macrothrombocytopenia especially their parents are of consanguineous marriage, in order to determine if they have phytosterolemia. This is clinically important for early treatment with diet low in plant sterols, bile acid-binding resins,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1076029611435090">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1076029611435090">21</xref></sup> and a new sterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076029611435090">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1076029611435090">22</xref></sup> which have been proved to improve the prognosis and then probably to decrease the risk of early mortality. Statins are of no use because endogenous cholesterol syntesis is suppressed by the exogenous load.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we identified 3 new phytosterolemia families with specific hematological abnormalities which are caused by the toxic effect of plant sterol on blood cells and identified 3 novel mutations of <italic>AGCG5</italic> and <italic>ABCG8</italic> genes (A20883G of <italic>ABCG5</italic>, del43683-43724 and del43866C-43867G/ins43866T of <italic>ABCG8</italic>). We suggest macrothrombocytopenia/stomatocytosis associated with phytosterolemia would represent a distinguishing subtype of phytosterolemia.</p>
