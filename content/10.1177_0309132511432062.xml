<abstract>
<p>This report considers how human geographers and other urban scholars are starting to explore city-regionalism from the vantage point of the politics of distribution. It begins with an examination of city-regionalism as a contingently produced geopolitical project in late capitalism. It then reviews work that examines the distributional dilemmas found in city-regions, including related work on post-suburban development politics. The final section argues that the city-region concept affords a useful platform for examining struggles for social justice and urban environmental politics in late capitalism.</p>

<title>I City-regionalism: questions of distribution and politics</title>
<p>In recent years, the city-region concept has reappeared in certain branches of human geography and cognate disciplines such as urban and regional planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309132511432062">Harrison, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0309132511432062">Neuman and Hull, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0309132511432062">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309132511432062">Parr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309132511432062">Tewdwr-Jones and McNeill, 2000</xref>). Traceable to the early years of the 20th century, and in particular the work of Patrick Geddes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132511432062">Hall, 2009</xref>), the concept is generally associated with the work of planners and regional scientists in the 1950s and 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0309132511432062">Rodríguez-Pose, 2008</xref>). Ostensibly rooted in a neo-Keynesian project to develop a more rational and cost-efficient state space with respect to the delivery of strategic infrastructure and services, city-region analysis has always been tinged with more than a hint of political-economic functionalism. The spatial analysis tradition continues to inform contemporary policy as exemplified by recent efforts to map English city-regions based on criteria such as productivity, skills, labour market characteristics, and travel-to-work areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309132511432062">Harding, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132511432062">ODPM, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>At a conceptual level, it has oft been asserted that the state’s role in managing and regulating economic growth and distribution in late capitalism has been supplanted by that of globally competitive city-regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132511432062">Florida, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0309132511432062">Scott, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0309132511432062">2001b</xref>). Accordingly, much of the recent intellectual kerfuffle about city-regions has produced a focus on their competitiveness function rather than on how city-regionalism is politically constructed through state-orchestrated processes of redistribution and social provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309132511432062">Jonas and Ward, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0309132511432062">Ward and Jonas, 2004</xref>). Yet it is becoming increasingly difficult to disentangle the new economic geography of city-regionalism from its geopolitical construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309132511432062">Harrison, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309132511432062">2010</xref>). In this respect, the city-regional concept holds the promise of inspiring further research into geographies of the state in late capitalism, including studies that critically examine the relationship between neoliberalism, progressivism, conservatism, anti-capitalism, etc., and the transformation of state space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309132511432062">Harding, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309132511432062">Jonas and Ward, 2007b</xref>).</p>
<p>My first report in this series argued that the analysis of regionalism in general could benefit from closer attention to territorial politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132511432062">Jonas, 2011a</xref>). This second report gets to the substance of territorial politics and considers how geographers are starting to explore city-regionalism from the vantage of struggles around governance and distribution. In the first section, I suggest that city-regionalism represents a contingently produced geopolitical project in late capitalism. This insight informs a review of work which addresses the distributional dilemmas underpinning the politics of city-regionalism including new research on the politics of post-suburban development. Finally, I examine how the city-region concept is affording new critical insights into social justice and urban environmental politics in late capitalism.</p>

<title>II City-regionalism: the contingent geopolitics of capitalism</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0309132511432062">Scott (2001b</xref>) argued in a definitive analysis of the concept, global city-regions are to be regarded as spatial-regulatory drivers of wealth creation and distribution in capitalism in their own right. There are at least two geopolitical consequences of this city-region economic resurgence that warrant further scrutiny. First, if the nation state is no longer the taken-for-granted scale at which capitalism is organized, regulated and indeed contested, it can be anticipated that new modes of governance and political participation are being forged around city-regions. This begs the question: in what respects is city-regionalism becoming a geopolitical project of late capitalism? Second, processes of economic globalization and state restructuring are underpinned by various distributional struggles within city-regions. So there is an urgent need to investigate the forms these struggles take, and how they shape city-regional institutions and politics. The first of these two themes is addressed in this section and the second question is discussed in subsequent sections.</p>
<p>Just as the state played an important role – provided the spatial context – for the global spread of capitalism, so too the reconfiguration of territoriality in late capitalism around functional city-regions could signal a new form of geopolitics. Yet much of the focus hitherto has been on the geo-economics of city-regions, emphasizing their external relations to the global economy, rather than on the ways in which the political geography of the state is being reconstituted. Capitalist territoriality is expressed contingently through diverse geopolitical projects, which relate in some ways to the switching of capital between different circuits of production, investment and consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309132511432062">Harvey, 1985</xref>; and see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309132511432062">Christophers, 2011</xref>). City-regionalism could be one such geopolitical project in late capitalism: a project to create a ‘metropolis state’ in which certain city-regions facilitate the internationalization of capital and the territorial integrity of the competition state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309132511432062">Moisio, 2011</xref>: 171).</p>
<p>Various empirical studies suggest that city-regions are indeed throwing up new forms of governance in order to enhance their strategic development roles and infrastructural capacities in the global economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132511432062">Herrschel and Newman, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309132511432062">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132511432062">Leibovitz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132511432062">Nunes Silva and Syrett, 2005</xref>). Examples of these new competitive forms of city-regionalism can be found throughout North America, Europe and Asia, and they take such forms as cross-border city-regions, city-region networks of governance, and formal metropolitan government structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0309132511432062">Vogel et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is far from clear that these new governance and institutional arrangements facilitate stronger international relations such that the city-region can be said to operate as a geopolitical construct in its own right. Countertendencies could be at work serving to fragment the political geography of the state and that of its constituent city-regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309132511432062">Harrison, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Further examination of the state context remains central to understanding the diverse ways in which city-regionalism is constructed as a geopolitical project in late capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309132511432062">Moisio, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309132511432062">Sagan and Halkier, 2005</xref>). For instance, one cannot understand the political construction of a global city-region like London without some reference to a national context marked by uneven development and growing income disparity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132511432062">Ancien, 2011</xref>: 2484; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309132511432062">Massey, 2007</xref>). Moreover, the political construction of global city-regionalism relates to the reconstitution of capitalist class relations and political capacities inside the state. One could, for example, follow a Poulantzasian line of argument (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0309132511432062">Martin, 2008</xref>) to argue that in certain places new class and political alliances are forming around the channelling of transnational investments to the global city-region. Such activity gives rise to an appearance of territorial competition as transnational factions of capital lobby national governments in order to introduce tax and regulatory regimes favourable to preserving the role of their host city-region as a global economic centre. Adopting a state-theoretical perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309132511432062">McGuirk (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309132511432062">2007</xref>) argues that the political construction of the global city-region (in her case, Sydney) is a process that has involved the central state in practical acts of discursive production and strategic selectivity with respect to investment, jobs and economic development.</p>
<p>This way of thinking about city-regionalism – as a contingently expressed geopolitics of capitalism – bears upon what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132511432062">Sassen (2006</xref>) calls ‘denationalized’ citizenship wherein the nation state no longer represents a rallying point for citizenship, identity and democracy in a globalized world. Pursuing this line of reasoning further, one can see how city-regionalism is politically constructed contingently in relation to other kinds of struggles; struggles around, for example, globalization, inward investment, income redistribution, human rights, nationalism, and so forth. Quite unexpectedly, city-regions can become strategic and symbolic sites in wider struggles against ruling national political elites, as witnessed recently in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, perhaps even reinforcing a long-held viewpoint that Cairo is a vast, populous and diverse city-region ‘out of control’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309132511432062">Rose, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0309132511432062">Sims, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A somewhat different take on city-regionalism and citizenship is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0309132511432062">Sparke (2011</xref>). Focusing on Seattle, USA, he suggests that citizenship is being reconstituted and, in effect, rescaled through the actions of philanthropic capital, which seeks to structure city-regional investments in health, charities and social support systems. If global city-regions are attractive to new economy sectors, they remain so only as a result of strategic charitable interventions on the part of new economy elites and, in the process, certain other modes of performing democratic rights, welfare and citizenship are excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0309132511432062">Purcell, 2007</xref>). The political construction of city-regionalism is not an automatic outcome of a rescaled or denationalized citizenship; it is not, for example, a return to a romanticized or idealized form of democracy to be found in the classical city-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309132511432062">Pierce, 1993</xref>). Instead the very geographical essence of citizenship and political participation is changing as people struggle to reproduce ‘ordinary geographies’ of the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132511432062">Amin and Graham, 1997</xref>).</p>

<title>III The politics of distribution inside city-regions</title>
<p>The importance of distributional politics is often implied in global city-region research but rarely examined in great depth, not least with respect to structures and processes of city-region governance and political participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309132511432062">Moualert et al., 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132511432062">Ancien (2011</xref>) puts the issue quite forcefully in her discussion of the housing question in London, a pre-eminent global city-region:<disp-quote>
<p>London’s housing problem and the ways it has been dealt with … sheds light, in particular, on the significance of the <italic>governance</italic> arrangements and <italic>political</italic> mechanisms that unfold across multiple scales, allowing for the reproduction of London as a global city. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132511432062">Ancien, 2011</xref>: 2485, emphases in original)</p>
</disp-quote>The keyword here is in fact ‘reproduction’ or, more precisely, <italic>social</italic> reproduction. For if there has been considerable progress in understanding the city-region as a locus of production and economic growth in late capitalism, there has hitherto been scant attention to corresponding processes of social reproduction.</p>
<p>Recent research on collective consumption (housing, infrastructure, etc.) suggests that the city-region has become an important site of political struggle. Ancien’s (2011) emphasis is on housing provision in London and the role of national state in mediating between obstructionist local boroughs, on the one hand, and the needs of the City, on the other. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0309132511432062">While et al. (2004</xref>) examine how housing and infrastructure have provided a rallying call for the growth coalition involved in the high-tech development of the Cambridge city-region in England. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309132511432062">McCann (2007</xref>) shows how class and race underpins struggles around housing and community relations in Austin, Texas. These various studies examine the role of new economy interests in orchestrating city-region governance in the so-called ‘creative cities’ much vaunted by the likes of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132511432062">Florida (2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A different perspective on social reproduction comes from research in city-regions struggling to adjust to new workfare regimes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309132511432062">Etherington and Jones (2009</xref>) examine the case of Sheffield in the UK, focusing on the interrelationships between urban competitiveness and state policies dealing with labour market governance and welfare state restructuring (i.e. work-welfare regimes). They argue that work-welfare policies focused on city-regions tend to reinforce rather than redress processes of uneven development and sociospatial inequality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132511432062">Ayda (2011</xref>) revisits previous work on Istanbul, Turkey, to show how uneven development and distributional inequalities have led to regulatory re-interventions at the city-regional scale. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309132511432062">Jarvis (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309132511432062">2007</xref>) demonstrates the ways in which contemporary city-regional imaginaries fail to conceal a failure of the state and capital to reproduce what she calls ‘the infrastructure of everyday life’. These studies indicate the value of broadening the scope of city-regional analysis to consider the uneven distributional impacts of contemporary welfare and labour market policies.</p>
<p>While questions of collective consumption are rightly moving more to the fore of contemporary city-regional research, whether distributional struggles contribute to stronger political ties across city-regions is far from clear. The hyphen in the city-region concept implies a functional territorial unity between the ‘city’ and the ‘region’; it is a conceptual unity which might not in fact reflect empirical reality. There is no doubt that cities and metropolitan areas are becoming bigger and more complex to manage under existing state jurisdictional arrangements, necessitating inter alia that our concepts of the ‘urban’ (politics and power) be stretched out to encompass that of the ‘metropolitan’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132511432062">Cox, 2011</xref>). At the same time, the interests that seek to construct city-regions as a political space are in effect turning inwards as they compete to draw down state powers and resources to <italic>their</italic> spaces of the city-region but not to that of others. So it could be that distributional struggles are fragmenting the political geography of city-regions in ways that throw into doubt their internal territorial coherence.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309132511432062">Phelps and Wood (2011</xref>) suggest, the new settlement geographies appearing across city-regions increasingly disrupt metropolitan political arrangements set up at the zenith of Fordism. Ongoing research into these settlement trends suggest <italic>inter alia</italic> that local governments in the outer-suburban reaches are becoming more proactive around economic development, thereby eroding established functional and political ties to the urban core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309132511432062">Phelps and Wood, 2011</xref>). For example, it could be that struggles around collective consumption and distribution in late capitalism are producing not so much a new city-regionalism as one of further fragmentation in the form of ‘post-suburban regionalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309132511432062">Jonas 2011b</xref>) or perhaps a ‘granular politics’ of private neighbourhood governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309132511432062">McGuirk and Dowling, 2011</xref>). At the same time, there are emerging all sorts of ‘inbetween spaces’ of the city-region; these are the inner suburbs and poorer districts of the central city which tend to get excluded from decision-making processes involving global city-regional investments in strategic infrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309132511432062">Keil, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132511432062">Keil and Young, 2011</xref>). These empirical findings lend further weight to the principle that city-regionalism is a contingently produced geopolitical project of late capitalism.</p>

<sec id="section4-0309132511432062">
<title>IV City-regions, social justice and environmental politics</title>
<p>The political construction of city-regionalism is frequently permeated by discourses and practices of social justice and environmentalism. For one thing, the economies of ‘global’ and ‘ordinary’ city-regions would not survive without the toil of low-paid and informal economy workers along with an army of unpaid and voluntary labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309132511432062">Fairbanks, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309132511432062">Robinson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0309132511432062">Sassen, 1991</xref>). Low-wage workers have suffered under neoliberal work-welfare policies but their attempts to press for higher wages often price them out of the labour market of global cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0309132511432062">Wills et al., 2009</xref>). Nonetheless low-paid workers in many cities have started to fight back. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0309132511432062">Wills et al. (2009</xref>) have conducted a detailed analysis of living wage campaigns in London, focusing on alliances between religious organizations, trades unions and local authorities. They reveal how London Citizens, a broad-based alliance of some 120 different organizations, began its campaign by targeting health and public sector organizations in the East End of London before broadening out to the finance sector, higher education, cultural industries and employers involved in the developments for the 2012 Summer Olympics. This research illuminates how one global city-region’s external economic relations shape and influence its internal geographies of distributional politics.</p>
<p>Given that city-regional boosters like to make a connection between jobs, economic development and quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309132511432062">Jonas et al., 2005</xref>), examining city-regionalism through the lens of environmentalism and sustainable development has offered fertile ground for recent critical urban research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309132511432062">Krueger and Savage (2007</xref>) argue that ‘sustainable development’ is an inadequate concept for capturing the broad array of social, environmental and economic issues found in the modern city-region. They prefer the term ‘just sustainability’ in order to suggest that contemporary struggles around services, jobs, economic development, health and amenities are informed by a sense of social injustice. For example, in an examination of city-region governance in Canada, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0309132511432062">Mendes (2008</xref>) uses the lens of social sustainability to investigate how food security has made its way into urban policy at different scales.</p>
<p>The drive towards low-carbon economy is featured in other work on city-region governance. Insofar as city-regions are becoming less reliant on established fossil fuel-based transportation, industry and housing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309132511432062">Hodson and Marvin, 2009</xref>), a new geopolitics of city-regionalism and sustainability could represent a way of overcoming long-standing economy-environment tensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309132511432062">Dierwechter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0309132511432062">Rice, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309132511432062">Jonas et al. (2011</xref>) point to evidence that new governance spaces are developing around those city-regions involved in ‘carbon control’ but suggest that this might have more to do with place promotion and inter-urban competition than is motivated by environmental and social sustainability. Of course, there are huge vested economic interests in preserving and promoting existing city-regional forms; one should not underestimate the capacity of developers and other interests to structure local geographies of consumption across city-regions in ways that continue to extract value from the built environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132511432062">Cox, 2011</xref>). Indeed, profound territorial divisions persist between city and suburb on environmental policy issues like climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309132511432062">Dierwechter, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>V Conclusions</title>
<p>This progress report has emphasized the ways in which city-regionalism has come about as a contingently produced geopolitical project of late capitalism. There is a strong case to be made that there has been too much emphasis in recent research on a functional economic view of city-regions and too little on how city-regions represent geopolitical constructions of/inside the state. Central to this task is to understand the contested role of city-regions in circuits of distribution in capitalism. Relocating city-regionalism in the territorial politics of distribution is not just a question of how better to theorize capital-state-space relations at an abstract level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0309132511432062">Ward and Jonas, 2004</xref>). It is also about how we should begin to think of city-regions as tied up in the ‘ordinary geographies’ of class, social reproduction, environmentalism and political struggle in the late modern city. As the current global crisis continues to work unevenly through the world’s diverse city-regions, we can anticipate further research in this vein.</p>
<p>In fact, Jane Jacobs, an influential early proponent of the city-region concept, showed the way in making explicit the connection between city-regional economies and territorial distribution. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309132511432062">Jacobs (1984</xref>) argued that the functional linkages between cities and their ‘regional’ hinterlands underpin global circuits of distribution in capitalism much more than the fiscal, currency and regulatory policies of nation states. To that end, Jacobs was critical of national governments engaged in ‘faulty’ fiscal-distributional policies by, for example, sending out the ‘wrong’ regulatory signals to producers in city-regions. These claims were never examined in great depth by Jacobs and her followers. Now might be a propitious time to revisit these considerations in the light of new concepts of city-regionalism and its contingent geopolitical construction.</p>
