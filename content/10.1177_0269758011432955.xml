<abstract>
<p>This article investigates the discrepancy between victimization surveys and police data, or the extent to which crimes that are reported in one source can be traced back to the other. We used traditional reverse and forward record checks to investigate reciprocal validity. In addition, we designed a new, more comprehensive measure that is more optimally geared towards calculating the total discrepancy between the two data sources. We used victimization surveys and police data from Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Results of the reverse record check showed that in 48% of cases a survey respondent did not mention victimization, even though it appeared in police registration. Results of the forward record check showed that only 35% of reported victimization in the survey could be traced back to police data within the reference period. Forward telescoping occurred in 28% of cases. In 7% of cases, respondents reported victimization experienced by household members. Furthermore, 29% of victimization reported to the police according to survey respondents could not be traced back to police data. Finally, we calculated the total discrepancy between the police data and the victimization survey and found that reports of 18% of respondents in the victimization survey were not congruent with the police data.</p>

<body>
<p>Criminological and victimological research relies heavily on victimization surveys and police data. Although both types of data resources have become increasingly commonly used for research, our knowledge on the pitfalls of these sources is still limited. This is surprising given that data reliability and validity have a great impact on the conclusions that can be drawn from research. It is therefore important to increase our understanding of these data.</p>
<p>Police data have long been known to have methodological problems when it comes to measuring crime. To allow for an alternative data source that would not have these problems, researchers started developing victimization surveys in the 1960s and 1970s. But soon, a number of studies tested the discrepancy between victimization surveys and police data and found that victimization surveys also suffer from methodological flaws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269758011432955">Dodge, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269758011432955">Fiselier, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269758011432955">Genn, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269758011432955">Murphy and Dodge, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269758011432955">Schneider, et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269758011432955">Turner, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269758011432955">Van Dijk, 1992</xref>). These studies used so-called ‘record checks’ and ‘forward record checks’ in which victim accounts from victimization surveys were compared to police reports. Reverse record checks examine whether incidents in police records are also reported in victimization surveys. Forward record checks investigate whether incidents reported in victimization surveys can be traced back to police records. Results pointed to major flaws in both data sources for the measurement of crime.</p>
<p>All known studies on the discrepancy between victimization surveys and police data were conducted in the 1970s. For several reasons, more recent research on this topic is needed. Not only are methodological issues still unresolved, police registration practices and survey methods have also changed since the 1970s. For example, police practices regarding the recording of crimes have undergone significant improvements. In addition, technological developments are expected to have increased the quality of victimization surveys. On the other hand, non-response in surveys has increased (possibly selectively), and the increasing tendency among households to use mobile phones instead of fixed phone lines makes it more difficult to reach them. It is currently unclear to what extent these changes have resulted in changes in the congruence between police data and victimization surveys. This calls for a new wave of research on the congruence and discrepancies between the two major sources for the measurement of crime.</p>
<p>In order to investigate the discrepancy between victimization surveys and police records, the current study examines the extent to which crimes that are reported in one source can be traced back to the other. As mentioned, reverse and forward record checks have traditionally been used to investigate these questions. We argue that these are not optimally designed to investigate the research questions at hand. Therefore, in addition to using these traditional measures, we design a new, more comprehensive measure to calculate the total discrepancy between the two data sources. Results are based on victimization survey and police data from Amsterdam, The Netherlands.</p>
<p>In the following, we first discuss methodological issues in the measurement of crime using police data and victimization surveys, and introduce methods that can be used to measure the discrepancy between both sources. Subsequently, we review earlier studies that have compared police and survey data. Data and results are presented in the sections thereafter, concluded by a discussion section.</p>

<title>Measuring crime using police data and victimization surveys</title>
<p>Police data have long been used to measure crime, but they have also long been recognized to have methodological problems. To end up in police records, crime events must be reported to the police. Hence, police measures of crime only reflect reported crimes, and to report a crime ‘people must define an event as falling into the domain of events about which “the police must do something”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269758011432955">Skogan, 1975</xref>: 20). Whether or not victims report a crime to the police has been found to depend strongly on the type and seriousness of the crime and to a lesser extent on victim and contextual characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269758011432955">Goudriaan, 2006</xref>). Fear of reprisal, insurance requirements, confidence in police effectiveness and the time or trouble it takes to go to the police station also affect decisions to report crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269758011432955">Ennis, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269758011432955">Junger-Tas and Haen Marshall, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>When complainants <italic>do</italic> contact the police, this does not necessarily mean that the crime is recorded. The recording of crimes by the police is not perfect and sometimes the police mistakenly fail to register a crime. Police recording of crimes is also influenced by the seriousness of the offence, the probability of clearing up a crime, problems regarding whether the act is an offence, police priorities, and organizational requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269758011432955">Junger-Tas and Haen Marshall, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269758011432955">Skogan (1975)</xref> states that the recording of crimes is an organizational activity that depends on extra-legal factors such as the relational distance between participants, the complainants’ preference, the status of the victim, and the assessment of the complainant’s culpability. These factors all influence the likelihood that a crime is recorded. In addition, there are also factors that increase the number of recorded crimes when they should not. For example, citizens may report non-existing crimes for reasons of personal dispute or revenge, or for (fraudulent) insurance claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269758011432955">Skogan, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>Until the 1970s, the only source for the measurement of crime was police registration. In 1965, US President Lyndon Johnson asked for a research report on the extent and nature of crime in the US. The President’s Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice (LEAA) took on this task and found official police records to be an insufficient data source for the measurement of crime. In response to this conclusion, the LEAA instigated experiments with survey data as an alternative data source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269758011432955">Biderman et al., 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269758011432955">Ennis, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269758011432955">Rand, 2007</xref>) and in 1972 the US National Crime Survey was implemented. Other countries followed (for an overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269758011432955">Fiselier, 1978</xref>). In Britain for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269758011432955">Sparks et al. (1977)</xref> conducted one of the first victimization surveys and later on, in 1982, the first British Crime Survey went into the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269758011432955">Hough et al., 2007</xref>). The first victimization survey in The Netherlands was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269758011432955">Fiselier (1978)</xref>. Currently, a number of national and local victimization surveys are administered in The Netherlands every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269758011432955">Wittebrood, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although victimization surveys were seen as highly promising, researchers soon recognized that they have deficiencies when it comes to accurately describing the frequency and nature of victimization events. One of the most often cited problems of survey research concerns memory problems or recency bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269758011432955">Biderman and Lynch, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269758011432955">Bradburn et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269758011432955">Penick and Owens, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269758011432955">Skogan, 1975</xref>). Memory bias generally occurs in two forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269758011432955">Turner, 1984</xref>). The first, memory failure, occurs when a respondent fails to remember a crime incident altogether. Research has revealed that the extent to which respondents remember a crime decreases with the time that has passed since the crime occurred. An experiment by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269758011432955">Bushery (1981)</xref> showed that victimization reporting was significantly higher for a 3-month reference period than for a 6- or 12-month reference period.</p>
<p>The second type of memory bias is partial memory failure, which occurs when a respondent fails to remember certain aspects of the crime. A well-known example of this is ‘telescoping’, when incidents that occurred outside of the reference period are reported to the interviewer. Victimization surveys often focus on victimization in a certain recent timeframe, for example the last 12 months. Respondents may place a victimization incident inside the reference period even though the incident actually took place before the last 12 months; this is called ‘forward telescoping’. In other cases, respondents may place an incident that did in fact occur within the last 12 months before the reference period; this is called ‘backward telescoping’. Telescoping effects have been found to be quite strong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269758011432955">Skogan, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>When victimization incidents <italic>are</italic> correctly remembered, other response errors may occur. Victims may not be willing to report crimes to the interviewer. For example, victims are often unwilling to report clashes with family members or friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269758011432955">Skogan, 1975</xref>). Very sensitive incidents such as rape have also been found to be underreported in most surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269758011432955">Koss et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269758011432955">Skogan, 1975</xref>). Victims may also be unwilling to report an incident due to a ‘reporting load effect’, meaning that victims know or expect interview time to increase when they report a crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269758011432955">Bushery, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269758011432955">Turner, 1984</xref>). Crimes for which the victim feels partly responsible are also underreported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269758011432955">Turner, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, the method of administration of the survey and characteristics of the interviewer have been found to influence self-reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269758011432955">Junger-Tas and Haen Marshall, 1999</xref>). Methods of administration include, for example, face-to-face interviews, computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI) or mail surveys.</p>
<p>Another source for error is potential miscommunication between interviewer and respondent. Respondents may not always understand the survey question or may interpret it differently from the interviewer’s intention. For example, the question ‘Were you the victim of violence?’ is ambiguous. Violence has different meanings to different people, and the term ‘victim’ is suggestive. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269758011432955">Reiss and Roth (1993</xref>; Appendix B) note that ‘What constitutes a violent crime is the result of societal determinations of what is violent behaviour and which violent behaviour is violent crime. Social constructions of violent behaviour are dynamic and change both temporally and organizationally’ (1993: 406). The interpretation of survey questions is often left to the respondent. Sometimes examples are given to clarify the intention of the question, but this in turn can lead to a more narrow interpretation of the question than intended. Victims may also report incidents that are not crimes, or misclassify crimes. For example, they may report an incident as a robbery when in fact the crime was a burglary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269758011432955">Doerner and Lab, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, respondents may have conscious or unconscious intentions in answering the interviewer’s questions. For example, respondents sometimes want to give their opinion about safety in society and hence may not take restrictions on time or person too seriously. Social desirability in reporting may also be a problem, especially when questions are asked about reporting crimes to the police. Respondents may feel that it is their responsibility to report crimes, and they may therefore say that they reported a crime that happened to them to the police when in fact they did not.</p>
<p>In addition, respondents may report events of which family members were the victim. This is not necessarily unjustified. Family members and friends of the primary victim often feel victimized too. This is called vicarious victimization. Although vicarious victimization may be experienced very intensely by respondents, victimization surveys are generally focused exclusively on incidents of victimization experienced by direct victims. Hence, this type of victimization reporting leads to bias.</p>
<p>Finally, and more in general, victimization surveys suffer from non-response. Non-response is often selective, with the most victim-prone individuals being the least likely to participate in surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269758011432955">Averdijk, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269758011432955">Lohr and Sun, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269758011432955">Ybarra and Lohr, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Summing up, due to flaws in police data, victimization surveys were introduced in the 1970s as an alternative data source for the measurement of crime but were soon found to have methodological difficulties themselves. This prompts the question of how survey and police data compare. More specifically, can crimes that are reported to the interviewer during a survey be traced back to police data? And are crimes recorded by the police also reported to the interviewer during a survey? To what extent are police data and victimization surveys discrepant in measuring crime? In the following section, we discuss the methods that can be used to investigate these questions.</p>
<p>Note that in order to compare victimization registered by the police to that reported in victimization surveys, one should only consider victimization that survey respondents say not only happened, but also said were reported to the police. If victims did not report a crime to the police, they cannot appear in the police data by definition,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269758011432955">1</xref></sup> and discrepancy necessarily occurs. Fortunately, many victimization surveys not only ask whether respondents have been victimized, but also whether they reported this victimization to the police. In the following, we focus solely on victimization that respondents say they reported to the police.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269758011432955">
<title>Measuring the discrepancy between victimization surveys and police data</title>
<p>We distinguish two methods that have previously been used to study the reciprocal validity of victimization surveys and police data. The first method is called the ‘reverse record check’, and examines whether incidents in police records were subsequently also reported in victimization surveys. More specifically, a sample of persons who reported a crime to the police is contacted for a victimization survey and interviewed about their victimization experiences. Responses from the interview are then compared to the information obtained from the police records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269758011432955">Penick and Owens, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>To illustrate the computation of the discrepancy between victimization surveys and police data based on reverse record checks, consider <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269758011432955">Table 1</xref>, which depicts the mutual relationship and potential mismatches between victimization survey reports and police records. We consider two groups of survey respondents: those who say they did not report victimization to the police, and those who say they did. We start with the first group. When a respondent in a victimization survey says (s)he did not report any victimization incidents to the police, and for the same respondent we find no victimizations registered in the police data, no discrepancy occurs (case ‘A’ in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269758011432955">Table 1</xref>). However, when we do find a victimization incident registered in the police data while the victim does not report this incident to the interviewer, discrepancy occurs (case ‘B’). The second group of survey respondents is those who say they did report a crime to the police. When, in a victimization survey, a respondent says they reported a victimization incident to the police, but for the same respondent we find no victimization registered in the police data, discrepancy occurs (case ‘C’). However, when we do find a victimization incident for this respondent registered by the police, no discrepancy occurs (case ‘D’). In sum, discrepancies occur in cases ‘B’ and ‘C’, while victimization survey and police registration concur in cases ‘A’ and ‘D’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0269758011432955">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In order to calculate discrepancy according to the reverse record check, researchers draw a sample B + D from the police data and interview these individuals in a victimization survey to ask whether they did (D) or did not report (B) a victimization incident to the police within the reference period, for example. Such studies report the reverse record check discrepancy

<p>The second method that has been used to calculate the discrepancy between victimization surveys and police data is the ‘forward record check’ and investigates whether incidents reported in victimization surveys can be tracked back to police records. In this design, a general sample of citizens is selected for a victimization survey. Those respondents who report that they were the victim of a crime <italic>and </italic>that they reported this crime to the police are then compared to police records of reported crimes. In this design those crimes that were not reported to the police are set aside.</p>
<p>In terms of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269758011432955">Table 1</xref>, a forward record check study investigates C and D and reports the quantity that indicates the percentage of discrepancies within that group of cases, i.e. the forward record check discrepancy

Whereas RRCD only captures B as divided by B + D, FRCD only captures C as divided by C + D. As is well known, the relationship between the cells in a two by two table is critically dependent on all four cells, and thus all should be included in the calculation. In this study, we therefore propose a measure for the number of discrepancies as a percentage of the total number of individuals interviewed, i.e. the total discrepancy

<p>As discussed above, reverse record checks examine whether crimes that are reported to the police are also mentioned when victims are interviewed for a victimization survey. When they are, victimization surveys and police data ‘match’. When they are not, no match can be established between both data sources.

<p>The first three reverse record studies were part of a series done in the US for the National Crime Survey. The first was the Washington recall study described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269758011432955">Dodge (1981)</xref>. Dodge found a fairly high percentage of congruence between police records and victimization survey results; 83% of victims mentioned the reported crime to the interviewer (i.e. RRCD = 17%). The second study, described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269758011432955">Murphy and Dodge (1981)</xref>, was the Baltimore study. This study resulted in a much lower percentage of congruence; only 67% (i.e. RRCD = 33%). This is probably due to the difference in the length of the reference period: the Washington study used 11 months, whereas the Baltimore study used only 6 months. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269758011432955">Penick and Owens (1976</xref>:37) note that the Washington and Baltimore ‘match’ percentages are probably artificially high since ‘in both cases interviewers knew that the respondents had been victims of crime and in both cases respondents were contacted by telephone in advance of the actual interview’. In the last reverse record check in the NCS series, the San Jose study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269758011432955">Turner, 1972</xref>), the interviewers had no knowledge of respondents’ victim status and did not contact respondents in advance of the actual interview. In this study, it was found that 74% of police recorded crimes were reported in the survey by respondents (i.e. RRCD = 26%).</p>
<p>Outside the US, we located two reverse record studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269758011432955">Genn (1976)</xref> based her research on police records in London in 1972. Results show that a relatively high percentage of 92% of victims reported the incident to the interviewer (i.e. RRCD = 8%), but in 40% of cases telescoping was found. A reference period of ten months was used and, similar to the San Jose study, interviewers did not know that respondents had been victims and did not contact respondents in advance of the actual interview. Interviewers tried to maximize incident reporting through two strategies. First, victimization questions were asked at the end of an hour-long interview in which respondents talked and thought about many different aspects of crime, thus giving them time to think about their own experiences with crime. Second, the reference period was established by giving memory prompts and having respondents recall events that had occurred in the past year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269758011432955">Genn, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>In The Netherlands, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269758011432955">Fiselier (1978)</xref> conducted a reverse record check, and found that 74% of respondents reported the incident to the interviewer, that 16% did not, and that in 10% of cases the result was unclear. The study was conducted through written questionnaires in the city of Nijmegen in 1973 and used a reference period of three years. When the analysis was restricted to a reference period of one year, results were somewhat different: 89% of respondents did report the incident in the survey, while 11% did not (i.e. RRCD = 11%).</p>

<title>Forward record checks</title>
<p>As explained, in a forward record check citizens are first contacted through a victimization survey. Those respondents who say they reported a crime to the police are then selected and compared to police records. When they are found in the police records as having reported a crime, a ‘match’ is established. When this is not the case, discrepancy occurs. When respondents say they reported a crime, but police records indicate that this occurred before the reference period of the victimization survey, forward telescoping occurs. Examples of forward record checks are described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269758011432955">Schneider et al. (1978)</xref> and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269758011432955">Van Dijk (1992</xref>; based on research by Steinmetz and Docter-Schamhardt in 1978).

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269758011432955">Schneider et al. (1978)</xref> investigated whether victims who said they reported victimization to the police could be traced back to police records. In total, 53% of incidents could be identified in the police data, but only 42% were within the reference period. A further 11% cases were telescoped forward into the reference period. No less than 47% of incidents could not be identified in police records (i.e. FRCD = 47%).</p>
<p>Results obtained by Steinmetz and Docter-Schamhardt and described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269758011432955">Van Dijk (1992)</xref> are remarkably similar, finding that 56% of incidents were also found in police records and that 44% were within the reference period. A total of 44% of incidents could not be identified in police records (i.e. FRCD = 44%).</p>
<p>The reverse and forward record checks described above indicate that there is a substantial discrepancy between official and self-report victimization data. These results are backed by more recent findings obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269758011432955">Kilpatrick et al. (1998)</xref>, who conducted a survey on the effectiveness of legal protection among 2,245 victims of crime. They found that 30% of crime victims contacted denied that they or their family members had been victimized recently. Whether this finding is due to memory failure, unwillingness to cooperate with the survey, or otherwise is unclear.</p>
<p>However important the results of the described forward and reverse record check studies are, all studies were conducted in the 1970s, while more recent research is lacking. Not only is the discussion on the reliability of victimization surveys and police data still interesting due to the widespread use of both for scientific and policy goals, changing times have also prompted the question whether the reliability of victimization surveys and police data has changed over the years. There are several reasons to expect that it has.</p>
<p>With regard to victimization surveys, it is reasonable to suspect that technological and societal changes have had their impact on methodology and subsequent results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269758011432955">Cantor and Lynch, 2007</xref>). An overall decreased willingness to respond to survey requests and the widespread use of mobile phones have led to lower and arguably more selective response rates. On the other hand, technological changes suggest that questionnaires have become more reliable. One of the major technological changes is the application of computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI). CATI has a positive influence on survey data quality for several reasons. First, it allows for more complex skip patterns in the questionnaire. Second, the interviewer is led through the questionnaire automatically, which makes it more difficult to forget or skip a question. And third, administration is centralized, leading to tighter quality control over the interviewer’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269758011432955">Cantor and Lynch, 2000</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269758011432955">Cantor and Lynch (2007</xref>: 283–284) ‘Computer-assisted interviewing has improved the quality of survey responses […], increased the accuracy and speed of data entry, and improved responses to sensitive questioning […]’.</p>
<p>Not only victimization surveys, but also police recording have profited from technological changes. Computerization and standardization have led to more systematic recording practices as well as higher quality. In many countries, police have improved their crime-recording practices. Procedures have been further developed and monitored, and hence it should be expected that difficulties in crime measurement through police records have decreased. It is currently unclear to what extent these changes in police practices and in survey methods affect the discrepancy between both data sources. New research is therefore warranted.</p>
<p>The current study assesses the discrepancy between victimization surveys and police data in measuring victimization. We will use reverse and forward record checks as well as the introduced measure of total discrepancy (TD) to investigate: 1) to what extent crimes that are reported to the police are also reported in victimization surveys; (2) to what extent victimizations that survey respondents say they reported to the police can be identified in police records; and (3) what the overall discrepancy between both data sources is.</p>

<sec id="section6-0269758011432955">
<title>Data</title>
<p>Data from two different sources were used. First, we used the <italic>Social Safety</italic> <italic>Monitor</italic> (SSM), the victimization survey of the city of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This survey contains questions pertaining to demographic characteristics, victimization events, and feelings of unsafety. The SSM is a telephone survey which is conducted on a year-round basis. Citizens are asked whether they have been the victim of a range of different crime types<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0269758011432955">3</xref></sup> in the past 12 months and whether they reported the crime to the police.</p>
<p>The dataset contains all telephone interviews conducted between 1 April 2006 and 31 January 2007. Names and addresses of non-respondents (whom interviewers were unable to reach, who refused, who could not participate due to language issues, etc.) were also confidentially provided by the city of Amsterdam for additional analyses. In total, the data file contains 8,887 respondents. Of these, 4,300 respondents (48%) said they were victimized within the past 12 months.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0269758011432955">4</xref></sup> Of these 4,300 respondents, a further 1,675 (39%) said they reported the crime to the police. This percentage is higher for those who experienced multiple victimization. Of those who experienced one incident, 28% reported the crime to the police. Of those who experienced more than three incidents of victimization, 78% said they reported at least one of the crimes to the police.</p>
<p>It should be noted that selective sampling is likely to be an issue in the Amsterdam survey since respondents are sampled from the registration of the Dutch Telecom Company (KPN). People with unlisted phone numbers and most mobile numbers are not sampled.</p>
<p>The second data source used is the Amsterdam police registration. In order to be able to take into account telescoping effects, all reported crimes from 1 January 2004 to 31 January 2007 were selected. Incidents in this registration were either reported by citizens or (in a small amount of cases) by a police officer. A relatively broad range of crime types was included in order to accommodate the crime types included in the SSM. In total, the data file includes 281,181 records. Of these, 87% are reported crimes, and 6% are crimes that were recorded by the police for information purposes rather than reported crimes.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the same citizen can be listed in police records more than once. While 85% of respondents only reported one crime, 15% of victims in the police registration are repeat victims.</p>
<p>The police file and survey file were matched at the person level. In order to match individuals in both files successfully, there had to be overlap on a number of characteristics of these individuals. We used the following characteristics to determine whether this overlap existed: initials, last name, postal code, street, house number, age, phone number and sex. No crime characteristics were used. For each overlapping characteristic, points were assigned. Cases were identified as a match when a certain minimum of points was assigned. This system in which points are assigned for each overlapping characteristic allows for the maximum possibility of matching and minimizes the problem of differential notation and hence unjustified failed matching of both data sources. In order to see whether a stricter matching procedure would change our results, we re-analysed our findings with a procedure in which only persons with the exact same name, address, age and sex were matched. In this stricter matching procedure, the use of maiden names and false or informal names is more problematic than in the more liberal procedure with the points system. However, results obtained with both methods were substantially the same. Since the first procedure allows for more matching possibilities, we present the results obtained with the first procedure. Although our matching procedure is reasonably sophisticated, it is not perfect and we cannot be completely sure that all persons were matched correctly. However, the finding that our results were similar for both a stricter and a more lenient procedure suggests that our results are not critically dependent on the matching procedure.</p>
<p>For the reverse record check, we focus on the categories ‘match’ and ‘no match’. For the forward record check, we developed two additional categories of identification leading to the following categorization:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Direct match</italic>: The survey respondent was identified in the police data within the reference period.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Telescoping</italic>: The survey respondent was identified in the police data but <italic>outside</italic> the reference period.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Household member match</italic>: The survey respondent is a household member of the same household as the person identified in the police data. This match only applies to personal crimes, since household property crimes (such as burglary) were considered to apply to all household members.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>No match</italic>: The survey respondent could not be identified in the police data.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<sec id="section7-0269758011432955">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>It should be noted that reverse and forward record checks have some inferential difficulties. First, individuals who are identified in police records as victims can be very hard to locate for an interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269758011432955">Penick and Owens, 1976</xref>). Second, incidents reported to the police may be more likely to be remembered during the interview than incidents that were not reported. Some authors suggest that incidents that are reported to the police are more serious, and that the reporting process itself enhances the incidents’ salience to the victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269758011432955">Penick and Owens, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to account for possible selective response, we investigated whether individuals who were registered as victims in the police data were more likely to participate in the survey than individuals who did not report a crime to the police. This appears to be the case, but only to a limited extent; of those who did not appear as having reported a crime in police records, 35% participated in the survey. Of those who appeared in police records in the last year, 39% responded. Of those who appeared in police records, but more than a year ago, 42% participated.</p>

<title>Reverse record check</title>
<p>In the reverse record check, we examine whether crimes that are reported to the police are also mentioned by respondents in interviews. The reverse record check discrepancy is as follows:<disp-formula id="disp-formula4-0269758011432955">

</disp-formula></p>
<p>The results show that 48% of victimization incidents recorded by the police were not mentioned as reported in the victimization survey.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0269758011432955">5</xref></sup> This percentage is considerably higher than in prior studies, where the relevant percentages were between 8% (Genn, 1976) and 33% (Murphy and Dodge, 1981).

<sec id="section10-0269758011432955">
<title>Forward record check</title>
<p>Forward record checks are used to assess how many reported incidents in the victimization survey can be traced back to the police records. Our calculation of FRCD shows the following:<disp-formula id="disp-formula5-0269758011432955">
<mml:math id="mml-disp5-0269758011432955">

</disp-formula></p>
<p>Thus, in total 65% of incidents that respondents said they reported to the police could in fact not be traced back to the police records. We further split out these cases to investigate whether some of these cases could not be traced back due to issues of telescoping or because victimizations were assigned to household members of the respondent.

<p>According to the police records, a large number of incidents mentioned in the interviews (28% of 1,675 cases) could be traced back to the police records, but occurred before the reference period of the survey. These incidents can thus be characterized as forward telescoping. A further 7% of incidents that were found in police records appear to have happened to household members of the interviewee. This 7% only includes personal crimes; household crimes (burglary, car theft etc.) were assigned to any household members and thus categorized as correct identification from the start. About one-third (29%) of incidents mentioned in the interviews as having been reported to the police could not be traced back to the police records at all.</p>
<p>In order to investigate whether the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269758011432955">Table 4</xref> differed between groups of people, we tested whether there were any significant differences according to sex, age, number of household members, education, employment status, income, ethnicity, country of birth, place of residence, and number of different crime types reported. All differences were non-significant (α = 0.05, two-tailed).</p>

<sec id="section11-0269758011432955">
<title>Total discrepancy</title>
<p>We argued earlier that reverse and forward record checks are suboptimal measures because each covers only part of the overall discrepancy between victimization surveys and police data. We therefore designed a new coefficient, Total Discrepancy (TD). Calculation of this statistic yields:<disp-formula id="disp-formula6-0269758011432955">
<mml:math id="mml-disp6-0269758011432955">

<p>Thus, reports of almost one out of five respondents (18%) in this victimization survey were not congruent with police records. Over-reporting (mentioning cases that could not be traced back to police registration) was twice as abundant as under-reporting (not mentioning cases that could be traced back to police registration).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigated the discrepancy between police data and victimization surveys by examining the extent to which crimes reported in one source could be traced back to the other. We applied reverse and forward record checks to investigate the discrepancy between the two data sources. Reverse record checks examine whether incidents in police records are also reported in victimization surveys. Forward record checks investigate whether incidents reported in victimization surveys can be traced back to police records. However, we argued that these methods are not optimal for indicating the overall discrepancy between police data and victimization surveys and we therefore designed a new, more comprehensive measure to test the discrepancy between victimization survey results and police data. We used victimization surveys and police data from Amsterdam, The Netherlands.</p>
<p>Results of the reverse record check show that in 48% of cases a survey respondent did not mention the crime in the survey, even though it appeared in police registration. This percentage is much higher than results from research 30 years ago. A potential explanation might be that, other than previous studies, we did not interview a sample of victims that was originally selected from police records. Instead, selection of cases was primarily based on the sample selected for the victimization survey. Selective response may work out differently in both approaches.</p>
<p>Results of the forward record check show that only 35% of reported victimization in the survey could be traced back to police records within the reference period. Forward telescoping occurred in 28% of cases. In 7% of cases, respondents reported victimization from household members. Finally, 29% of victimization that was reported to the police according to survey respondents could not be traced back to police records at all. Comparing our findings with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269758011432955">Schneider et al. (1978)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269758011432955">Van Dijk (1992)</xref>, a number of things stand out. The size of the telescoping effect in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269758011432955">Table 4</xref> is much larger than that found by Schneider et al. (11%) and Van Dijk (12%). The first likely explanation for this difference is that the study by Van Dijk used an ‘internal bounding’ procedure, whereas ours did not. In ‘internal bounding’ procedures, respondents are first asked about victimization experienced in the past five years, (or, in the case of Van Dijk, about victimization ever experienced), followed by a question whether this victimization took place in the past year, which is the actual period of study. This procedure enables respondents to more accurately remember when the victimization took place and also allows them to talk about emotional events they may want to mention. Sometimes respondents want to talk about victimization that happened to them, but that occurred before the reference period. In these cases, respondents may telescope this victimization into the reference period on purpose. An ‘internal bounding’ procedure allows respondents to mention this victimization, but at the same time does not force them to place these inside the reference period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269758011432955">Scherpenzeel, 1992</xref>). Dutch research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269758011432955">Scherpenzeel (1992)</xref> revealed that an internal bounding procedure substantially reduced the amount of victimization in the past year reported by survey respondents. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269758011432955">Van Dijk’s (1992)</xref> study used an internal bounding procedure, we are not aware that such a procedure was used in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269758011432955">Schneider et al. (1978)</xref>.</p>
<p>The second likely explanation for our different results regarding telescoping effects compared to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269758011432955">Van Dijk (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269758011432955">Schneider et al. (1978)</xref> is the larger time frame used in our study. The police records searched in our study preceded the interviews by a minimum of 27 and a maximum of 36 months, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269758011432955">Schneider et al. (1978)</xref> only considered police records preceding the survey by 16 to 21 months and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269758011432955">Van Dijk (1992)</xref> by around 18 months. Consequently, the percentage of cases that could not be matched is much lower in our study (29%) than in the studies by Schneider et al. (47%) and Van Dijk (44%). Another explanation for our lower number of un-matched cases is that we also distinguished identification of personal victimization by household members (7% of cases). The selection procedure used by Schneider et al. (1978: 24) generally categorized these cases as un-matched.</p>
<p>Finally, we calculated the total discrepancy between police data and the victimization survey. We found that the reports of 18% of respondents in the victimization survey were not congruent with the police data.</p>
<p>The unavoidable question that arises is to what extent the discrepancies between victimization surveys and police records can be attributed to either of the sources. It is not our goal to examine which of the two data sources, police or survey, is a ‘better’ measure of crime. Police and survey measures of crime are very different in the way they are gathered, in the goal for which they are gathered and in their methodological flaws (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269758011432955">Schneider et al., 1978</xref>). Having said that, this research can help us understand the how the discrepancies came about.</p>
<p>Almost half of the survey respondents whose victimization was registered by the police did not report that victimization to the survey interviewer. This suggests that respondents did not want to report these crimes in the survey, forgot that the crimes had happened altogether, or thought that the crime had happened before the reference period.</p>
<p>In addition, a large part of the crimes reported in the survey could not be traced back to the police data at all. It is unclear whether this is due to socially desirable answers by respondents, mistakes in registration of reported crimes by the police or misclassification by either respondent or police. It can also be due to miscommunication between the citizen and the police: when citizens seek help from the police or when they inform the police about a crime, they may perceive this as if they are officially reporting a crime.</p>
<p>The telescoping effect that we found is a survey rather than a police data issue, and thus can reasonably be attributed to the victimization survey. It is, of course, possible that police officers make mistakes in recording crime. But the computerized registration process at police stations in combination with the size of the effect and earlier research on telescoping make it more likely that this problem can be attributed to memory decay of respondents. Salient incidents are often experienced as if they happened a relatively short time ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269758011432955">Junger-Tas and Haen Marshall, 1999</xref>). In addition, it is likely that victims focus on the event that they are being asked about (victimization) rather than the reference period. Our findings suggest, as has prior research, that telescoping remains an important issue in survey research. Thus, it is important that telescoping effects be minimized, for example by including (internal) bounding questions. For example, like the earlier mentioned procedure for internal bounding, the current Dutch safety monitor first asks about victimization incidents in the past five years, and then zooms in on victimization that occurred within the past year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269758011432955">Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek, 2009</xref>). Future research should further investigate the discrepancy between surveys that utilize such a bounding question and police records. We expect that including bounding questions decreases the discrepancy between the data sources.</p>
<p>To better understand why the discrepancy exists, there is an urgent need for rigorous and detailed studies of the processes behind both victimization surveys and police practices. Regarding police data, we need more knowledge of the process of recording crimes by police officers and the factors influencing this process. With such knowledge, we might be better able to understand whether and how systematic factors in the police recording process are responsible for the finding that many victims who appear in police records as having been victimized do not report such victimization in victimization surveys. We also need more insight into the cognitive processes behind victimization survey responses. General principles from cognitive research on survey methods (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269758011432955">Sudman et al., 1996</xref>) need to be applied to crime statistics. Without this knowledge, interpretation of either source remains challenging.</p>
