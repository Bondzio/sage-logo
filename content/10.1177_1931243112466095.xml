The authors used a web-based national survey of news managers at network affiliated stations to look at what forms of social media are being used in the newsroom, who is using it and how it is being applied. The results show stations are embracing social media as a means of connecting with news consumers and raising their newsrooms’ profile in the community, and are encouraging their news staff members to have an individual social media presence. Stations also report their news staff are using social media as a newsgathering tool, but the value and reliability of information gathered through this means is up for debate.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>new media/social media</kwd><kwd>news format</kwd><kwd>broadcast</kwd><kwd> twitter</kwd><kwd>web/online</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-1931243112466095"><title>Introduction</title><p>With the explosion of social media use, news organizations already scrambling to keep pace with the evolution of digital media have yet another new series of challenges. With this plethora of new, interactive social tools now available to journalists, those challenges include: how can journalists best integrate these tools into the newsgathering process? Should they even be viewed as reliable news platforms? What ethical standards should be applied to information gathered through social media? What is the appropriate role of journalists as social media users—what personal information and opinion should they blog or “tweet” about? These are intriguing questions, and as the answers develop and change, they will no doubt play a major role in the debate over the future direction of journalism.</p><p>The primary social media now being widely used in newsrooms include Facebook, a social networking website, and Twitter, a microblogging and social networking site whose users send and receive messages with a limit of 140 characters. For journalists, the power of social media use has been seen quite substantially in the realm of breaking news. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1931243112466095">Jewitt (2009</xref>) notes Twitter has beaten traditional mainstream news outlets on several recent breaking international stories. Not only has Twitter provided coverage faster, Jewitt notes in his article, it has also given participants and observers the opportunity to share their experiences with each other. Journalists, Jewitt concluded, are increasingly seeing Twitter as a productive tool in their professional routines. And yet in the tenuous and fluid environment of breaking news, accuracy remains a priority for journalists.</p><p>The live updating capability of social media like Twitter has emerged as a both a strength and vulnerability. In his article, Jewitt has words of caution, noting while the success of Twitter in breaking news situations is notable, the unreliabililty of some early posts cannot be overlooked. It should be noted that the first updates posted on Twitter in these developing stories are often written by nonjournalists, who are not necessarily concerned with verification. Furthermore, stories that break via social media are subject to misinformation and errors as details about the story may not be initially verifiable and become more clear over time.</p><p>Though social media obviously play an important role in news dissemination, they also have implications for newsgathering. Crowdsourcing is an example of an early use of social media by journalists in this regard. Defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1931243112466095">Howe (2006</xref>) issue of <italic>Wired</italic> magazine, crowdsourcing “represents the act of a company or institution taking a function once performed by employees and outsourcing it a an undefined (and generally large) network of people in the form of an open call.” Those open calls have started to find a place in the newsgathering process. Reporters frequently seek out the anecdotal “people living the story” interview, based on the widely-held belief that news stories are more appealing to viewers if they are centered around a relatable character.</p><p>But locating individual anecdotal interviews has frequently been a challenge; the main problem being the lack of an efficient means by which the reporter could cast a wide net seeking people who, in the case of many news stories, have had a very specific, usually narrowly defined experience. Enter Facebook, Twitter, and various other social media networks. Now, in a matter of seconds, reporters can post or “tweet” their request to find the all-important interview that will put a “human face” on their story. Through crowdsourcing, the reporters can receive numerous responses, without ever leaving their desks and laptops. Those who for years have relied on phone calls, e-mail, Internet searches, and personal contacts to gather such interviews now can call on the considerable resources of popular social networking services.</p><p>Blogs and web reader comments have been another social media source of potential interviews for reporters. Especially for local traditional media, locating and interviewing the authors of these online commentaries can result in the discovery of new community voices. But due to the anonymous nature of many of the comments posted by those participating in the online discussion, many journalists are understandably wary. As Kate Phillips, online editor for the New York Times, noted in a roundtable discussion of political blogging in the 2008 presidential election:</p><disp-quote><p>It’s very unusual for a reporter to quote in the paper someone who has commented on one of our blogs, on the Web, whatever the blog may be if it is not a real name or if we can’t reach that person through the e-mail address that they’ve filed, because we need that level of verification.</p><p>Basically we just have a heavy responsibility to look at people who are using monikers, people who are using aliases, and allowing it as long as it is in a certain boundary. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1931243112466095">Perlmutter, 2008</xref>)</p></disp-quote></sec><sec id="section2-1931243112466095"><title>Purpose of the Study</title><p>This study is aimed at determining what forms of social media are currently being used in local television newsrooms, how they are being used and who is using them, and what results are being seen. This information can be helpful to journalists who are considering how to use social media for both newsgathering and increasing their interaction with viewers. The study results could also guide news managers that are drawing up policy guidelines for the use of social media in their newsrooms. Finally, journalism educators can use the information as they reshape curriculums to respond to the challenge of educating students who will work in newsrooms which are only increasing their emphasis on digital and mobile content platforms.</p></sec><sec id="section3-1931243112466095"><title>Literature Review</title><p>The 2010 survey by Radio Television Digital News Association (RTDNA) poses some questions about social media and the radio and television industries and is, thus, a fruitful place to begin this examination. Though the report indicates that while just over three fourths of television stations are integrating social media on their websites, a somewhat smaller number of stations (58%) are incorporating it into storytelling. Only about 1 in 10 stations (9%) said they are doing nothing with social media. This number is significantly down from the 2009 survey in which more than a third (36%) of stations were not using social media.</p><p>In a survey of newspaper and trade publication business journalists, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1931243112466095">Lariscy, Avery, Sweetser, and Howes (2009</xref>) found that 8% of respondents indicated that social media was “very important” to their work and that an additional 25% believed it be “important.” Furthermore, in examining the most consulted online resource in source gathering, the researchers found that social media networks like Facebook and Twitter were identified as the most used source by a mere 3% of respondents. The researchers found, however, that almost 20% of respondents identified a social media source when writing a story, with a majority of journalists first seeking out blogs and then using social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace. Overall, the researchers conclude that business journalists use social media very little and that the majority of business journalists surveyed do not see social media as playing a vital role in their newsgathering behaviors.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1931243112466095">Cohen (2009</xref>) writes about the importance of journalists including social media sites like Twitter in their source mix, observing that breaking news often occurs via channels of social media before those of the mainstream media. In his article, he cites events such as the landing of U.S. Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River and the terrorist attacks in Mumbai in November 2008 as empirical examples of his claim. Similarly, others have also addressed the critical importance of journalists turning toward social media. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1931243112466095">Gleason (2010</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1931243112466095">Palser (2009</xref>) both concentrate on social media audiences and users, citing that social media users tend to be younger than traditional media users and that the news media landscape is theirs to inherit.</p><p>In researching the role that social media play in News24, the largest online news website in South Africa, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1931243112466095">Stassen (2010</xref>), using a qualitative case study as methodology, concludes that social and interactive media will undoubtedly play a significant part in the future of journalism. Specifically, the researcher deduces that the dominant uses for social media in the newsroom are to “distribute information” (in the form of micro-stories), as a source of story ideas, information, and user feedback, as a promotional platform for the news agency, and to help build a community of users who use social media to feel connected to the news provider (p. 13). From her findings, the researcher concludes that since the future of social media in journalism is a sure thing, news outlets need to embrace it rather than try to compete with it for consumers’ attention.</p><p>While the fact that social media will undoubtedly play a role in the future of journalism is undisputed, what exactly that role will entail has yet to be determined. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1931243112466095">Ludke (2009)</xref> writes that social media “can bring greater depth and breadth to journalists’ work,” though the avenues through which journalists can go about achieving such depth remain to be seen. Basing his claims on the assumption that social media are ultimately about audience participation, hyperlocality, and interactivity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1931243112466095">Miller (2008</xref>) writes that it is the obligation of the 21st-century journalists “to find ways to incorporate the audience into the news production process” (p. 34). Regardless of how contemporary journalism incorporates social media into their practices and routines, Emmett (2008) observes that the real issue is how much (and when) social media can contribute to news outlets’ bottom line: namely, monetizing social media users’ activities with respect to the consumption and sharing of news information.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1931243112466095">Skoler (2009</xref>) observes that while most social media sites are not actually doing journalism, “they do serve the new culture and point to how news organizations must change to be considered relevant and value-creating” (p. 39). Interestingly, Skoler highlights a change in the way in which news is being consumed rather than created, but his claim is suggestive of the fact that news content creators will ultimately need to alter their newsgathering behaviors and practices in order to keep up with the current culture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1931243112466095">Alysen (2009</xref>) concludes that “new” journalistic practices, rooted in interactive and participatory practices, seemingly a departure from the past, actually have their roots there. Thus, to abandon these practices or to think of them as having no influence on the future of journalism—including that journalism that is being born out of social media practices—is myopic.</p><p>Newsgathering habits are influenced by such journalism practices as balance, accuracy, fairness, and objectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1931243112466095">Rupar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1931243112466095">Schudson, 2003</xref>). In the case of broadcast journalism, reporters and other newsroom staff strategically use and employ whatever resources are at their disposal in order to present daily (sometimes even multiple times per day) local newscasts, covering stories of local, national, and international interests. How these stories are manufactured is consistent with principles across other forms of journalism: reporters rely on sources to establish truth claims in order to assemble meaningful stories (or—culturally—news). These news stories are then packaged and relayed to audiences via several different mechanisms. While the news production process offers several invitations for studying news (e.g., objectivity, truth claims, framing, etc.), this study is primarily concerned with broadcast journalists’ newsgathering habits and the effect that social media have on these habits.</p><p>We know objectivity, accuracy, and credibility are paramount where news production is concerned. What’s less apparent is whether these same tenets are expected of social media (such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter) as possible news sources and, if so, to what extent. It follows that the role that social media can play in the newsgathering process has yet to be identified. Furthermore, the function that other newsroom personnel aside from reporters (e.g., station managers, producers, web staff, etc.) play in dictating that role is also unclear. While the use of available technology has always been crucial for the newsgathering and news distribution processes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1931243112466095">Boczkowski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1931243112466095">Reich, 2008</xref>), social media presents a unique case as a potential newsgathering source that is neither strictly technological (e.g., computers, satellites, etc.) nor strictly social (i.e., it is different from pursuing a face to face or telephone interview with a potential source).</p><p>On account of this potential, it is logical to assume that reporters and newsroom staff will take advantage of social media as sources for newsgathering. Though the extent to which social media are being used is unknown, it also important to inquire how other variables might also affect social media use in the newsroom. Thus, variables such as designated market area (DMA), newsroom size, and newsroom resources all might affect the extent to which newsrooms strategically employ social media as a newsgathering source.</p></sec><sec id="section4-1931243112466095"><title>Research Questions</title><p>Given the limited existing research on the relationship between social media and journalism in the local television newsroom, the authors framed the study through the following basic questions:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: What forms of social media are local television newsrooms using?</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: How are journalists in local television newsrooms using social media?</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Research Question 3</italic>: What if any policy do stations have for their journalists who are using social media?</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Research Question 4</italic>: Who is responsible for the content posted on social media that bears the newsroom’s name?</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Research Question 5</italic>: How has the use of social media impacted the content produced by local television newsrooms?</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="section5-1931243112466095" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>In the summer of 2010, the researchers conducted a nationwide web-based survey of news managers at network affiliate television stations (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox) that present local news. The website Newsblues.com maintains a current listing of the names of local television news directors. Using that list, the researchers obtained the e-mail addresses of news directors through a combination of Internet searches and phone calls to newsrooms. An e-mail invitation was then sent to station news directors at 613 news stations with a request for the survey to be completed by the director or a representative.</p><p>The survey was sent out a total of 5 times between August and October 2010. Approximately, 75 e-mails (roughly 12%) were returned as undeliverable. Phone calls were placed to those stations to obtain the news director’s e-mail address, and the survey was then again sent to those stations. Ultimately, a total of 129 news stations accepted the invitation to participate in the study, indicating a response rate of approximately 21%. Three fourths of the responses to the survey were from markets 51 to 210. Only about a quarter of the larger markets returned the survey, and it is a limitation of this study.</p></sec><sec id="section6-1931243112466095"><title>Design and Layout</title><p>The layout of the survey was designed to gauge social media usage as well as to invite feedback from station directors about how social media is affecting local broadcast news. The questionnaire began by collecting demographic information (staff size and DMA) and by asking participants to identify which social media are used in their newsrooms. Participants were then asked to identify the number of reporters and other news staff with accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace, as well as to identify how many keep a blog affiliated with the station’s website. The next set of questions dealt with frequency and newsroom policy regarding social media. Frequency of social media use was measured along a standard 5-point Likert-type scale (ranging from <italic>never</italic> through <italic>always</italic>); policy was explored with one measure asking participants to identify the extent to which social media use in the newsroom is required and a second open-ended question allowing participants to comment on their station’s policy about social media use. One final measure asked participants to identify which social media sites had been used in the past year to gather sources or information that was reported in the newsroom’s on air or online story.</p><p>The next set of questions explored more in-depth newsrooms’ Facebook and Twitter usages. For each site, participants were asked to identify who was responsible for updates. Answer choices included executive producer, newscast producer, web producer, assistant news director, managing editor, news director, and other (participants selecting <italic>other</italic> were asked to specify). Next, participants were asked if reporters and other staff members kept both professional and personal social media accounts. Possible answers included: yes, reporters/other news staff members have both; no, all reporters/other news staff members have just a professional one; no, all reporters/other news staff members have just a personal one; it is not monitored in my newsrooms; and other (participants selecting <italic>other</italic> were asked to specify).</p><p>The final set of questions asked participants to identify the frequency with which they discussed staff postings on Facebook, Twitter, and blogs. Frequency was measured using a standard 5-point Likert-type scale (ranging from <italic>never</italic> through <italic>always</italic>). Next, participants were asked to identify how often during the past year they were concerned about tipping off competitors through the staffs’ use of social media. In this case, frequency was measured using a standard 7-point Likert-type scale (ranging from <italic>never</italic> through <italic>always</italic>). Participants were then asked to give their opinions on the following statements: social media like Facebook and Twitter have improved your interaction with viewers; the information provided on a Facebook profile page is public information and can therefore be used in news reporting; social media like Facebook and Twitter have influenced which local stories your newsroom covers; and in your experience, social media like Facebook and Twitter have enhanced your newsroom’s reporting of local stories. Answers choices ranged from <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to <italic>strongly agree</italic> along a standard 5-point Likert-type scale. The final open-ended question asked participants to provide any other thoughts and opinions about how social media are used in local TV newsrooms.</p></sec><sec id="section7-1931243112466095"><title>Results</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: What forms of social media are local television newsrooms using?</p></list-item></list><p>The large majority of stations, regardless of market size, use social media for newsgathering, mostly Facebook (98%) and Twitter (97%).

As noted earlier in this article, a 2009 RTDNA survey indicated 36% of local television newsrooms were not using social media. Just a year later, the 2010 survey showed that number had dropped to 9%. The explosion of social media use was clearly a development which local television newsrooms could not ignore. More and more of their viewers were using social media for personal and professional communication; that itself was a news story. It followed that television newsrooms became social media users. However, the survey of TV newsroom managers that serves as the basis of this article indicates views on the journalistic value of social media varies greatly. It has been embraced for its role in connecting viewers with newsrooms and vice versa, but not as directly endorsed as a tool for the nuts and bolts of news gathering.</p><p>We know, for example, that reporters and newsroom management are using social media to increase their profile in the communities they cover. With 85% of stations responding to the authors’ survey indicating that they regularly post links to their news stories on Facebook, and nearly as many using Twitter for the same purpose, social media has already become a valuable promotional tool. The news managers responding to the survey also firmly believe that social media use has improved both the reporting of local stories and their newsrooms’ interaction with viewers. This could logically lead to a study of how social media influences editorial decisions, that is, which stories are covered locally and what emphasis is placed on them. If a story generates a great number of Facebook posts or tweets on Twitter, does it move up in the 6 p.m. newscast rundown, thus signaling to viewers that it has higher priority? Is a reporter assigned to “go live” on the story, even though by traditional news judgment standards, it would only be deemed worthy of a 20 second script read by the anchor.</p><p>The survey results indicate there is less support for social media when it comes to the issue of its reliability as a tool in the actual newsgathering process, and how the information gathered through social media should be incorporated into reporting. While the majority responding to the survey indicate their newsrooms have aired information obtained directly from social media sites, the open-ended comments also reveal a wariness about the reliability of such information. Several news managers indicated independent confirmation of the information is still necessary. With Facebook in particular, nearly a quarter (24%) did not agree with the statement that information posted on that social site is “public” and thus could be used freely in newsgathering. Based on the comments and survey responses, there appears to be growing support for the idea that social media is a valuable tool to be used early in the newsgathering process, but cannot take the place of well-established sources. And yet with the increasing prevalence of social media in our daily lives, it stands to reason that it could become the primary channel of communication for more newsmakers and news sources, taking the place of not only press conferences and news releases, but also “breaking” developments.</p><p>Accordingly, one area that also seems open to additional study is the development of newsroom policy and guidelines for social media use by journalists. Journalists looking for guidance about the use of social media as a newsgathering tool have few aides overall, but they can look to the “Social Media and Blogging Guidelines” established by the RTDNA and Al Tompkins, group leader for broadcasting and online at the Poynter Institute. Among the recommendations for social media use as it relates to the journalistic principles of truth and fairness:</p><disp-quote><p>Social media comments and postings should meet the same standards of fairness, accuracy and attribution that you apply to your on-air or digital platforms.</p><p>Information gleaned online should be confirmed just as you must confirm scanner traffic or phone tips before reporting them. If you cannot independently confirm critical information, reveal your sources; tell the public how you know what you know and what you cannot confirm.</p><p>Twitter’s character limits and immediacy are not excuses for inaccuracy and unfairness. (RTDNA)</p></disp-quote><p>Writing about the journalism hallmarks of accountability and transparency, the RTDNA guidelines again maintain that the standards applied to on-air and digital platforms should also be applied to journalists’ use of social media:</p><disp-quote><p>You should not write anonymously or use an avatar or username that cloaks your real identity on newsroom or personal websites. You are responsible for everything you say. Commenting or blogging anonymously compromises this core principle.</p><p>Be especially careful when you are writing, Tweeting or blogging about a topic that you or your newsroom covers. Editorializing about a topic or person can reveal your personal feelings. Biased comments could be used in a court of law to demonstrate a predisposition, or even malicious intent, in a libel action against the news organization, even for an unrelated story.</p><p>Just as you keep distance between your station’s advertising and journalism divisions, you should not use social media to promote business or personal interests without disclosing that relationship to the public. Sponsored links should be clearly labeled, not cloaked as journalistic content. (RTDNA)</p></disp-quote><p>Additionally, this study’s authors believe a clearly communicated policy about how social media will be used to report and update breaking news would benefit any news operation. It would seem in the highly charged and competitive atmosphere of local television news, stations that neglect to have such a discussion with their news staff are running the risk of having hastily posted and unconfirmed, retweeted information sent out into cyberspace, bearing the station’s brand and also quite possibly compromising its hard-earned reputation.</p><p>As television newsroom veterans, the primary authors of this study also believe a best practices policy that should be implemented for news operations would be to consider Facebook and Twitter posts by public officials as “fair game,” but that which is posted by private citizens regarding sensitive and controversial stories should not be used on air or republished without the permission of the author of the original post or his or her family. With the latter, we acknowledge it is likely the post would have already been seen by potentially hundreds of the author’s Facebook “friends,” and yet we are asking the newsroom to withhold the reporting of the information to the larger community it serves until contact with the author or family can be made. It can be argued that this is contradictory to the core mission of the newsroom—to inform its audience. But while Facebook and Twitter have developed as global sources of news and information—they do not have any substantial editorial vetting. The very social nature of social media does not make accuracy, verification, or appraisal a priority. Members of the public who are social media users do not need to use the judgment that must be a hallmark of a newsroom’s operation; thus journalists would be wise to be as skeptical about information obtained through social media as they are about that received from a new source who has come recently come forward.</p><p>This is not to say adhering to such a policy would not be challenging in the competitive arena of television news. Consider this scenario: in a Facebook post, a private citizen accuses a public official of financial misconduct and includes documents that appear to support the claim. The public official denies the claim, and reporters cannot reach the author of the Facebook post, even as the story gains steam in local online community chat rooms, comment boards, and is reposted on numerous Facebook pages. When does a newsroom go with the story? Following the guideline proposed by this study’s authors, newsrooms would not publish or air the allegations until the Facebook post author can be interviewed. Yet it would be expected that, many newsrooms would want to publish or air the story if while the accuser could not be reached, the documents posted on his or her Facebook page could be independently verified. So it must be acknowledged—like most newsroom guidelines, the policy this study’s authors propose about using Facebook posts in reporting may not necessarily provide a foolproof answer, but it is a starting point for the ensuing discussion and debate. Newsroom managers responding to the authors’ survey also strongly support social media as a way to connect with viewers, and the majority encourage their staff to have a social media presence. In the open-ended comments sections of the survey, some news directors indicated that they expect their reporters will not post anything that compromises their credibility. Certainly news directors can be lauded for assuming their reporters will exercise good personal judgment. And yet as social media continues to permeate our lives, it could be argued these directives to journalists—embrace the “social” so that you are not perceived as detached from viewers and yet maintain your professionalism—can in some circumstances backfire. The very essence of social media involves engagement and discussion, which in many cases leads to opinion. This is another area of potential study—is social media a platform where traditionally neutral journalists will be more free to offer a recommendation or take a side, based on what they have learned through their research and reporting? And taking it a step further, would that policy only apply to certain local issues and subjects, and not extend to political candidates? Using more traditional storytelling models, the answer is clear: there is reporting and there are editorials. But with social media, the lines are blurry. Journalists and their newsroom managers would be wise to continue to evolve the discussion of how professional standards and reputations can be upheld in this newly social newsroom.</p><p>Finally, the study authors also believe the results point to the need for the inclusion of social media components in college journalism curriculums. In their personal lives, student journalists frequently see social media as a way to connect with friends and family, to share informal updates and other matters of mutual interest. These same aspiring journalists need to recognize that social media can be an advantage in the news gathering and reporting process, particularly when trying to track down people with a vital personal account of a story or topic. And yet, this instruction must be coupled with an understanding of the journalistic limitations of social media, especially in breaking news situations. This study indicates many news executives view social media as a tool for news gathering, but like many other sources of information, one that must be carefully evaluated. Given its increasing role in newsrooms, journalism educators would be wise to include assignments involving the use of social media for newsgathering and also critiques of the credibility of social media sources in their curriculum’s news writing and reporting foundation courses—right along with basic lessons on writing a lead and selecting quotes and sound bites.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn2-1931243112466095"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The authors declared no conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn3-1931243112466095"><label>Funding</label><p>The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1931243112466095"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alysen</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2009</year>). <article-title>Reporting in the “new media” environment: How today’s television journalists are recycling work practices of the past</article-title>. <source>Global Media Journal, Australian Edition</source>, <volume>3</volume>, <fpage>1</fpage>–<lpage>12</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr2-1931243112466095"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Boczkowski</surname><given-names>P.
