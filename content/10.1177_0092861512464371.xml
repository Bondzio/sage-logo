        <p>Conducting randomized controlled trials entails a prolonged, costly study start-up (SSU)
          process that may create significant delays. Optimizing the operational aspects of
          multisite trials requires identifying benchmarks in the SSU process and the potential
          delays associated with them. We engaged in a collaborative effort to identify and describe
          key SSU intervals that correspond with necessary procedures and processes for activating
          multisite clinical trials in the US. After developing definitions for SSU benchmarks and
          obtaining data from research coordinating entities, we identified factors that were
          significantly associated with reduced cycle times, including the use of central
          institutional review boards for study approval and status as a private practice or
          independent research site. However, small sample sizes and large proportions of missing
          data hamper the interpretability of our results. Future development of standard measures
          of SSU efficiency will be critical to analyzing and improving study initiation processes
          at US research sites.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the most reliable means for assessing the balance
        of benefit and risk associated with medical therapies.<sup>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512464371">1</xref>
        </sup> However, conducting RCTs entails a prolonged, costly process<sup>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512464371">2</xref>
        </sup> that may delay access to new interventions, hamper research into new uses for
        existing medical products, and impair critical comparisons among alternative treatment
        strategies. In addition, the perceived inefficiency of the US clinical trials enterprise (CTE)<sup>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861512464371">3</xref>
        </sup> is one of the reasons that industry is pushing research (including federally funded
        projects) abroad, despite doubts about whether findings from such research will be
        generalizable to US populations.<sup>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512464371">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512464371"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861512464371">6</xref>
        </sup> Although current data suggest that most clinical studies involve a single research
        site and small numbers of participants,<sup>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861512464371">7</xref>
        </sup> clinical trials capable of generating meaningful evidence that can inform practice
        are typically large, complex, multisite investigations. </p>
      <p>If meaningful evidence is to be generated quickly, the operational aspects of multisite
        trials must be performed rapidly and with high quality. At the highest level, this requires
        minimizing the time between when an important medical question is formulated and when it is
        answered. One key factor in multisite trials is the time needed to ensure that all sites
        have completed the administrative activities required to begin enrolling patients. While
        considerable time may be spent on study feasibility, presite visit selection, and site
        selection, a convenient time to begin measurements for multisite studies that can be
        compared across trials is when a final study protocol is sent to participating sites,
        representing a benchmark “start time” for evaluating the duration of study initiation at a
        given site. Several critical checkpoints for study start-up (SSU) occur between the time a
        protocol is submitted to the site for review and the time that the first study participant
        is enrolled: institutional review board (IRB) submission, time of IRB final approval, and
        time of contract execution. Potentially costly delays can occur at or between any of these
        checkpoints. In a systematic review, Abbott and Grady<sup>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512464371">8</xref>
        </sup> showed that US IRBs differentially apply federal regulations and display large
        variations in time required to review studies and in the decisions made. However, across the
        CTE as a whole, measurable outcomes of SSU remain poorly characterized. </p>
      <p>In this article, we describe a collaborative, 2-stage effort to identify and describe key
        SSU intervals that correspond with necessary procedures and processes for activating
        multisite clinical trials in the US. Our aims were to (1) develop a collaborative approach
        to describing the current efficiency of SSU in the US CTE and (2) create effective
        approaches for improving it, including the development of standard terms and time points to
        be collected.</p>

      <title>Methods</title>
      <p>In November 2010, the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI,
        https://www.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/), a public-private partnership that seeks to identify
        generalizable, effective practices for clinical trials, organized a retrospective data
        analysis of multicenter clinical trials. This analysis sought to identify SSU
        process-related data already being captured by sites and sponsors and to determine whether
        several high-level attributes of sites or sponsors/clinical research organizations (CROs)
        contribute to shorter SSU time among participants. </p>
      <sec id="section3-0092861512464371">
        <title>Retrospective Data Analysis</title>
        <p>CTTI members represent stakeholders from across the CTE. Membership is open to
          organizations that are interested in working with others to identify ways to make clinical
          trials more efficient and of higher quality. Current membership includes 17 academic
          institutions, 8 pharmaceutical companies, 7 government members and liaisons, 6
          biotechnology companies, 4 professional societies, 4 CROs, 4 trade organizations, 3
          nonacademic clinical investigator groups, 3 device/diagnostics companies, 2 IRBs, 1
          professional service organization, 1 industry–other, and 1 standard setting organization.
          CTTI invited 34 of its member organizations (8 academic, 6 academic research organizations
          [AROs]/CROs, 4 investigator, 3 biotechnology, 3 medical device, 2 government, and 8
          pharmaceutical) to submit retrospective data for its “Site Metrics for Study Start-Up”
          project. A total of 19 organizations submitted data (2 academic, 4 ARO/CRO, 2
          biotechnology, 2 medical device, 1 government, 2 investigator, and 6 pharmaceutical) for
          an overall response rate of 54.3%. Each participating organization was asked to provide
          data for all phase 3 studies in SSU mode across all therapeutic areas from January 1, 2009
          through January 1, 2010. If an organization did not have data for an interval, they were
          asked to submit data for a 1-year window as close to the defined interval as possible. In
          some instances, sites did not have phase 3 data, and these organizations provided data for
          phase 2 studies only. Of the 5396 studies, 5216 were phase 3 (96.7%), 101 were phase 2
          (1.9%), and 79 were device only (1.5%). </p>
        <p>Twelve data fields reflecting simple, broadly available metrics were requested from each
          organization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092861512464371">Table 1</xref>). Data
          were stored in Excel 2010 for Windows (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA, USA). Statistical
          analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA) and R
          software (R version 2.13.1, R Project, Wirtschafts Universität, Vienna, Austria).
          Qualitative variables were analyzed by calculating absolute and relative frequencies.
          Cycle times were calculated by determining the number of days between relevant date
          fields. Cycle time metrics were then analyzed by calculating medians and interquartile
          ranges (IQR) and compared by various subcategories using the Kruskal-Wallis 1-way ANOVA
          test for nonparametric data.<sup>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512464371">9</xref>
          </sup> We used a Bonferroni-adjusted threshold level of significance of .007 for each
          cycle time to account for multiple testing across 7 cycle times to arrive at an overall
          threshold level of .05 for the analysis. Missing observations were not included as a
          category for these analyses. When the results for the Kruskal-Wallis test were
          significant, post hoc multiple comparisons were run to help determine which groups were
          different while appropriately adjusting for pairwise comparisons. The type of IRB used by
          site type and by therapeutic area was both analyzed using the Fisher exact test to account
          for small sample sizes.</p>

          cycle: (1) the date the protocol was sent by the sponsor/CRO to the site, (2) the date the
          protocol was received by the site, (3) the date the protocol was submitted to the IRB, (4)
          the date of the IRB’s final decision, (5) the date the contract was executed, and (6) the
          date the first study participant was enrolled. When definitive records were not available,
          organizations submitted approximate dates, and these deviations from requested fields were
          reviewed prior to inclusion in the final dataset. From the submitted date fields, we
          defined 7 cycle times of interest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0092861512464371">Table 2</xref>). All cycle times were computed as a simple difference between the 2
          dates.</p>

        <p>The 19 participating organizations collectively submitted 10,673 lines of original data.
          Some organizations submitted additional data outside of specified parameters; data from
          these organizations were restricted to include uniform phase data (ie, phase 2, phase 3,
          or device only) spanning a 1-year interval. Following this restriction process, 5396 lines
          (50.6%) corresponding roughly to 5396 sites remained. A precise number of unique studies
          could not be obtained. While we recognize that there could be some duplication of studies
          in the data (eg, clinical researcher and CRO/sponsor might have reported on the same
          study), we did not attempt to collect this data because (1) collecting this information
          would have been onerous since organizations tend to track studies by their own unique
          identifiers, and (2) we did not anticipate that the volume of duplication would be large
          and therefore did not attempt to qualify it. Pharmaceutical companies submitted 63.9% of
          final data lines, AROs/CROs submitted 13.0%, academic organizations submitted 10.4%, and
          biotechnology organizations submitted 9.5%. The remaining 3.2% of data were submitted by
          other organizational types (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0092861512464371">Table

          allergy/respiratory (8.9%), pain (4.7%), and inflammation (4.6%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0092861512464371">Table 3</xref>). Just over half of the data came from
          trials using central IRBs (CIRBs) (51.5%); the remainder was collected under local IRB
          oversight (33.9%) or was missing IRB type data (14.6%). Private practice and independent
          sites were more likely to use a CIRB, while academic, hospital-based, and VA sites were
          more likely to use local IRBs (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .001). CIRBs were used more often
          than local IRBs in all major therapeutic areas except for “other,” infectious disease, and
          device studies (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .001).</p>
        <p>Because participating organizations were required to submit data within approximately 2
          months, the amount of missing data in this study serves as a proxy for the technical and
          logistical feasibility of collecting certain data elements across disparate organizations.
            <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0092861512464371">Table 4</xref> summarizes the
          amount of missing data for each of 6 date fields and for site type classifications.
          Academic centers and government organizations had the highest rates of missing data across
          all categories, with the exception of the date of the IRB’s final decision for academic
          centers and the date the protocol was sent by the sponsor for government organizations,
          with rates of 100% missing data for some variables. Biotechnology companies completely
          lacked data for the date the site received the protocol, and device and biotechnology
          companies both had high rates of missing data for the date of first patient enrollment.
          For investigator sites, complete data were available for the date the site received the
          protocol, the date of protocol submission to the IRB, and the date of the IRB’s final
          decision.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The results of our retrospective analysis illustrate the need for improvements in data
        capture before SSU can be rigorously characterized and investigated and a reliable baseline
        established. The definitions that we provided were not sufficiently detailed, and many data
        elements were not routinely captured—factors that highlight the limitations of our
        understanding SSU metrics for the CTE as a whole. Although we identified factors
        significantly associated with reduced cycle times, the small sample sizes for many
        subcategories, large proportions of missing data, and lack of standard data element
        definitions limit the interpretability of these results. Furthermore, since only 54.3% of
        invited CTTI organizations participated in this study, the generalizability may be limited,
        particularly if nonresponding organizations were different in some way from those that
        responded.  </p>
      <p>However, our study shows that lengthy SSU cycle times are prevalent within the current US
        CTE. Ample documentation exists that a much more efficient system will be needed to provide
        the evidentiary basis for new product development<sup>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861512464371">7</xref>
        </sup> and for informing clinical practice; currently, more than 85% of clinical practice
        guideline recommendations in the US lack high-quality supporting evidence.<sup>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512464371">10</xref>

        <sup>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512464371">11</xref>
        </sup> In addition, numerous recent examples of erroneous clinical practices<sup>
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861512464371">12</xref>
        </sup> underscore the deleterious effects that operational inefficiencies of multisite
        clinical trials have on the public health since decisions and recommendations will be made
        even if evidence does not accrue to supply appropriate evidence for practice.</p>
      <p>Despite the large amount of missing data in this retrospective analysis, there was a clear
        association between IRB type and cycle time metrics. For 6 of the 7 cycle times investigated
        in this study (site cycle, site to IRB cycle, site to contract cycle, site to patient cycle,
        IRB cycle, and post-IRB to patient cycle), CIRBs had significantly shorter cycle times
        compared with local IRBs. For example, CIRBs took an average of 7 days to reach a decision
        on protocols submitted for final review compared with 35 days for local IRBs. These
        significant differences could reflect more efficient processes employed by CIRBs and
        industry or could be due to the types of trials and centers that tend to use CIRBs rather
        than local IRBs. A prospective analysis of data collected across multisite organizations
        could identify the cause of these differences.</p>
      <p>Our data also suggest variations in cycle times by sponsor and site type. For all cycles
        except post-IRB to patient, significant differences in cycle time by site type were
        observed. Follow-up analysis revealed that academic, hospital-based, and VA sites generally
        had longer cycle times than did independent and private practice sites. For example, the
        site to patient cycle took an average of 168 to 247 days for academic, hospital-based, and
        VA sites compared with an average of 100 to 123 days for independent and private practice
        sites. Prospective analysis of SSU data across site types may elucidate the causes of these
        differences. One possible explanation for this difference is that site type and study type
        are correlated. For example, the sites with longer site to patient cycle times could be due
        to a site conducting in-patient studies in which research participants cannot be actively
        recruited, such as occurs in surgical studies for instance. </p>

        <title>Prospective Study: Data Elements and Cycle Time</title>
        <p>While our retrospective data analysis identified important trends in SSU, a well-planned,
          clearly defined prospective analysis is needed to overcome limitations of the
          retrospective analysis and elucidate the root causes of these trends, some of which may
          have far-reaching effects. Longer start-up times are problematic for patients and
          providers, for companies trying to develop treatments, for persons formulating policy, and
          for the US economy. Based on our findings, we recommend measuring key intervals in the
          cycle as a standard for performing multisite trials. At the site level, this provides
          metrics for internal quality assurance and improvement and helps ensure sponsor integrity.
          In addition, these metrics will allow sponsors to identify high-performing sites and
          reward them by selecting them for future studies, thus yielding additional cost savings
          for sponsors. Finally, at the level of the national CTE, this standard will help us
          quantify the efficiency of the enterprise and identify areas that need improvement.</p>
        <p>When subject matter experts gathered at the May 2011 meeting described above,
          participants agreed that the following key data should be collected for US sites
          participating in multicenter trials: (1) the date the final protocol was sent to the site,
          (2) the date of the IRB’s decision (both local IRBs and CIRBs), (3) the date the contract
          was sent to the site (applies to the initial draft contract template only and does not
          include a separate budget metric), (4) the date the site contract was executed (ie, the
          date that the final signature is obtained after agreement of terms from both the sponsor
          and the site), (5) the date of site activation (the date upon which the site has full
          permission to enroll after completion of all contractual, regulatory, and prestudy start
          requirements), and (6) the date of the first patient’s consent (the date of the first
          signed informed consent form for the protocol at the site). Standard definitions for key
          data elements were also agreed upon and are listed in Supplementary Table S1.</p>
        <p>Cycle time metrics for this prospective quality improvement system could be defined as
          the time elapsed between each of the elements described above as well as composite elapsed
          times. Additional date-related elements that impose additional data collection burdens on
          sites will be considered at a later time. These elements include the following: the date
          the protocol was received by the site, the date the sponsor executed the contract, dates
          of drug supply milestones, dates of regulatory compliance/approval components, dates of
          budget negotiation milestones, and dates of protocol amendments.</p>
        <p>Meeting participants also identified a key question affecting multicenter SSU: What is
          the interval between a site receiving a final protocol and enrolling the first
          participant? Follow-up questions include the following: (1) After a site receives a final
          protocol, how long until all patients are enrolled at that site? (2) What is the interval
          between formulating a research question and answering it? Answering these questions will
          require that we determine how best to measure such broad “outcomes” without incorporating
          detailed process metrics that vary considerably among sites. Meeting participants elected
          to collect data that capture a “big picture” overview and then assess gaps in an iterative
          fashion.  </p>

        <title>Limitations</title>
        <p>Despite our attempts to provide simple data element definitions, certain fields proved
          problematic for many collaborating centers, and extensive data cleaning was required. Many
          data elements were missing, although blank fields were evaluated to see whether missing
          data could be reasonably derived from other data fields, for example, identifying the site
          type from the site’s name or calculating actual dates from elapsed times. Sites may also
          have used their own data definitions, especially for trials that crossed therapeutic
          areas, thereby confounding classifications. In addition, sites and sponsors may have
          reported the same trial more than once, thus skewing the findings. Our data collection
          methods collected the date the protocol was sent by the sponsor or CRO but did not collect
          information regarding protocol amendments. Understanding the role that amendments have on
          the SSU process is worth additional research. Lastly, only cycle time was assessed in this
          study. The quality of the process was not investigated, a particularly relevant point with
          regard to IRB processes. </p>

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>In summary, we found that the US CTE is not collecting standardized measures of cycle
        times, although such practice is routine in most other industries. Although problems with
        data quality limit the robustness of our conclusions, CIRB use is clearly associated with
        shorter cycle times compared with local IRBs, and private practice and independent sites
        initiate trials faster than other types of sites. To furnish the knowledge needed to support
        evidence-based health care, the US CTE should develop standard measures of efficiency and
        focus on systematic reforms to provide this crucial evidence in a timely manner. By
        convening a meeting of subject matter experts to identify and define critical data elements
        that should be prospectively collected across sites, we have taken a first step in this
        direction. Continued collaboration across stakeholder groups will enable progress in both
        measuring and improving the SSU process.</p>
