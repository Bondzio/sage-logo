<abstract>
<p>Gastric reactance has been proposed as a measure of mucosal ischemic injury in the critically ill. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of gastric mucosal injury as measured by gastric reactance in different subgroups of critical patients. We studied 100 adult patients admitted to 7 different hospital intensive care units, requiring a nasogastric tube. Gastric impedance measurements were continuously obtained from each patient for 24 hours. Patients were managed based on conventional protocols by hospital staff, blinded to the changes in gastric impedance parameters. The low-frequency central reactance (<italic>X</italic>
<sub>L</sub>) reflects tissue edema caused by prolonged ischemia. The previously reported threshold of <italic>X</italic>
<sub>L</sub> ≥ 13 − jΩ was used to classify injured mucosa; 80% of all patients had mean <italic>X</italic>
<sub>L</sub> above this threshold. No significant differences were found in the incidence of mucosal ischemia between medical versus surgical, hemodynamic versus respiratory or neurological patients. Significant lower urine output was found in patients with <italic>X</italic>
<sub>L</sub> above threshold (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01); also, there was a significant effect of fluid balance in those patients (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). More complicated patients had higher average reactance. This study shows that gastric ischemia as estimated by gastric reactance has a very high incidence in the critically ill, independently of the reason for admission. High reactance is related with higher morbidity in agreement with other reports using different methods of assessing splanchnic hypoperfusion in this patient population.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Shock is characterized by acute systemic hypoperfusion, leading to tissue hypoxia and vital organ failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885066612450415">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885066612450415">2</xref>
</sup> An association between abnormal gastrointestinal (GI) perfusion and critical illness has been suggested for many years; and largely circumstantial evidence continues to implicate the GI tract in the pathogenesis of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066612450415">3</xref></sup> Inadequately oxygenated, the splanchnic tissues may become prone to ischemia-related complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885066612450415">4</xref></sup> However, at present, there is no clinically useful method to directly monitor the level of mucosal ischemia. In particular, it may be of benefit not only to measure the adequacy of perfusion but also to detect the onset and monitor the level of ischemic injury.</p>
<p>Ischemic damage of the GI tissue is characterized by alterations in cellular function and energy metabolism. After a certain period of ischemia, the GI tissue becomes vulnerable to damage due to reperfusion, in which restored oxygen supply produces free radical species, which lead to further tissue injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885066612450415">5</xref></sup> The mucosal injury increases as ischemia persists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066612450415">6</xref></sup> For an effective and correctly timed therapy, it may be very useful to know the ischemic level and the tissue damage in a continuous and simple manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885066612450415">7</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Impedance spectroscopy, the study of the passive electrical properties of biological tissues as a function of frequency, has been proposed as a tool for monitoring mucosal tissue dysoxia and damage in different organs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885066612450415">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885066612450415"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885066612450415"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885066612450415">11</xref>
</sup> On a conceptual level, the cell cytoplasm and extracellular space act as conductive media isolated from each other by the cell membrane. The conductivity of the extra- and intracellular space contributes to the overall resistance of the tissue, while the cell membrane contributes to the capacitive effect.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885066612450415">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885066612450415">12</xref>
</sup> Impedance measurements, tissue reactance in particular, have been shown to reflect changes in a tissue structure; namely, the intracellular to extracellular volume ratio and cell membrane ion permeability, both of which are directly affected during ischemia. A specific device and system has been developed and tested for this specific application<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885066612450415">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885066612450415"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885066612450415">15</xref></sup> (Critical Perfusion Inc, California). Along with the technique, a Gastric Impedance Spectroscopy Probe (GISP) (Critical PerfusionInc, California)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885066612450415">16</xref></sup> allows the direct acquisition of an electric impedance spectrum of the mucosa, which can be used to identify and continuously monitor the level of tissue damage.</p>
<p>The impedance of biological tissues results from the interaction of an electrical current with the tissue at cellular and molecular level. Impedance has 2 components: the electrical resistance which restricts the flow of electrons and dissipates energy, and the electrical reactance which is related to the capacity to store and release energy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885066612450415">17</xref></sup> All the impedance parameters increase with duration of ischemia as ion pumps fail, cells swell, and ion membrane permeabilities decrease, allowing cellular membranes to store greater amounts of electrical energy, and reducing the available extracellular current paths. Reactance has been shown to be directly proportional to intracellular to extracellular volume ratio, and therefore an increase in reactance is relatively specific to ischemia. Other forms of injury such as apoptosis, fluid overload, or tissue breakdown actually decrease reactance. An algorithm was developed to calculate the characteristic electrical values that best describe human gastric impedance measurements and simplify the information obtained with this method.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885066612450415">18</xref>
</sup> It was reported that hypoperfusion and ischemia cause changes in the impedance measurements of the gastric wall in cardiovascular surgery patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885066612450415">19</xref></sup> The value of these measurements as a prognostic index of postoperative outcome in cardiovascular surgery patients was validated by Beltran et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885066612450415">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The objective of this study is to describe the incidence of abnormal gastric reactance in different subgroups of critically ill patients. A secondary objective is to evaluate the effects of highly positive fluid balance and increased intraabdominal pressure (IAP) in gastric reactance.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The target population of this study was general critical care patients that required nasogastric tube for gastric decompression or feeding. All the patients were onTotal Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) and some patients were on Proton-PumpInhibitor (PPI) therapy, following standard procedures for each hospital. We did a previous unpublished study in healthy volunteers to demonstrate that suction and feeding did not significantly affect the measurements of gastric impedance spectroscopy. The study was approved and supervised by the Ethical Research Committee of 7 different hospitals in Mexico City. Informed consent from the patient or his next of kin was obtained in all cases. Patients with massive GI bleeding, esophageal obstruction, or nasopharyngeal obstruction were excluded from the study. GISP was positioned in the stomach to measure tissue reactance. For all cases, GISP positioning was confirmed by chest or abdominal radiography. Exclusion criteria included improper GISP positioning or less than 12 hours of continuous monitoring. Patients entered in the study were followed up prospectively until intensive care unit (ICU) discharge or after 28 days of follow-up during the study period. Age, sex, primary diagnosis, Acute Physiology and Chronic Heath Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were recorded upon admission.</p>
<p>During ICU stay, patients were managed based on the conventional hemodynamic and respiratory protocols by the health care staff, blinded to the changes in gastric impedance parameters. All patients were mechanically ventilated and sedated. Patients were monitored until they no longer required a nasogastric tube, after 3 days of monitoring or death. Impedance measurements obtained from these patients, automatically recorded every 15 minutes, were processed to calculate the central reactance at low frequencies (<italic>X</italic>
<sub>L</sub>), as the characteristic gastric impedance parameter of interest, as reported by Beltran et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885066612450415">20</xref></sup> To analyze differences in <italic>X</italic>
<sub>L</sub> between the different groups, we calculated the average reactance over the first 24 hours of monitoring for each patient (mean <italic>X</italic>
<sub>L</sub>).</p>
<p>Mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure, lactate, base excess, arterial blood gases, and urine output were obtained hourly to evaluate disturbances in hemodynamics and organ function. The study protocol prospectively defined SIRS, sepsis, and shock patients according to the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) guidelines<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885066612450415">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885066612450415">22</xref>
</sup> after ICU admission by medical staff, during the first day of impedance monitoring. The SIRS was manifested by 2 or more of the following conditions: (1) temperature &gt;38°C or &lt;36°C; (2) heart rate &gt;90 bpm; (3) respiratory rate &gt;20 bpm or PaCO<sub>2</sub> &lt;32 mm Hg; and (4) white blood cell count &gt;12 000/mm<sup>3</sup> or &lt;4000/mm<sup>3</sup>. Sepsis was manifested by 2 or more of the previous conditions as a result of infection. Septic shock was manifested when sepsis was induced with hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg) despite adequate fluid resuscitation along with the presence of perfusion abnormalities that may include lactic acidosis or oliguria. We compared patients with SIRS, sepsis, and septic shock.</p>
<p>The subgroups of critically ill patients by reasons of ICU admission were classified as surgical or medical patients with a classification of hemodynamic, respiratory, or neurological, according with their principal problem and monitoring necessity upon ICU admission. Patients with cardiovascular disorders (arrhythmia, tachycardia, unstable angina, etc) or hemodynamic instability were classified as hemodynamic; patients with low oxygen saturation, respiratory insufficiency or failure were classified as respiratory; and patients with cerebrovascular diseases or any neurological problem were classified as neurological.</p>
<p>Because a large proportion of patients in the ICU have highly positive fluid balance as part of their therapy, we evaluated the effect of large positive fluid balance on mean <italic>X</italic>
<sub>L</sub>, comparing patients with highly positive fluid balance (&gt;20 mL/kg in 24 hours) against patients with negative fluid balance (&lt;0 mL/kg in 24 hours). Some studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885066612450415">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885066612450415"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885066612450415">25</xref>
</sup> have demonstrated the hemodynamic effects of increasing IAP and its correlation with low gastric tonometry pHi and lactic acidosis. We also evaluated the effect of high IAP on gastric reactance measured indirectly using a pressure transducer to the bladder. To determine the IAP transvesiclely, 50 mL of sterile saline was instilled into the empty bladder through a Foley catheter. The tubing of the drainage bag was clamped and a needle was advanced through the aspiration port and connected to a pressure transducer.</p>
<p>Changes in gastric reactance were evaluated according to the thresholds proposed previously to predict postoperative complications in 55 higher risk cardiovascular surgery patients with cardiopulmonary bypass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885066612450415">20</xref></sup> <italic>X</italic>
<sub>L</sub> &lt; 13 is considered as normal tissue and <italic>X</italic>
<sub>L</sub> &gt; 26 as very injured tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885066612450415">20</xref></sup> We sought to use impedance parameters as early indicators of splanchnic hypoperfusion. According to the receiver–operating characteristics (ROC) curves, setting <italic>X</italic>
<sub>L</sub> threshold at 13, the sensitivity was 0.9. This value better identified patients at risk. Below this level, all healthy volunteers from a previous unpublished study would be classified as normal. Setting the <italic>X<sub>L</sub> </italic>threshold at 26, the specificity was 0.9, allowing more accurately to identify patients who developed complications.</p>
<p>The Student <italic>t</italic> test was used to evaluate the differences in continuous variables. Analysis of variance controlling for the effect of shock was used to evaluate the effect of positive fluid balance in <italic>X</italic>

Of the 15 patients with highly abnormal reactance, 7 were surgical patients, 1 neurological, and 7 abdominal surgeries with hemodynamic instability. Main complications that these 15 patients developed during their ICU stay included sepsis (10 cases), hydroelectrolytic imbalance (5), renal failures (4), reinterventions (4), respiratory failures (4), and death (4). It is important to mention that 67% of those 15 patients developed sepsis and 20% septic shock.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Gastric reactance was conceived under the assumptions that GI hypoperfusion is common, is an early indicator of hypoperfusion (the Canary of the body), is directly related to further complications in the ICU (the gut is the motor of MOF), and no other generally available measurement provides specific information about the adequacy of mucosal perfusion. Gastric reactance is easy to use: Catheters are placed in the same way as standard naso gas trictube (NGT), with no additional training required. The measurement is reliable and robust, does not require calibration, and is an absolute measurement, and if the sensor is not in a good contact with the mucosa, the device will give an error message but will not give false measurements (very much like a pulse oximeter). The technology is not yet commercially available but cost could be in the same order as other monitoring technologies such as pulse oximetry or mixed venou soxygensaturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>). However, before we may advocate the clinical use of this technology, we need to first answer the following questions: (1) Is the measurement clinically relevant and independent of other available indicators? (2) What patients are at risk and may benefit from gastric reactance monitoring? and (3) Can we use this information to improve patient management and treatment? This last question is the hardest to answer and will require further research and experience. This study was primarily designed to give a first answer to question no. 2, but we also hoped to corroborate our previous findings that the measurement is relevant and independent of other indicators of perfusion, in a broader population of patients.</p>
<p>This is the first observational study designed to obtain a database of human gastric reactance under varied conditions and pathologies to identify the incidence of gastric mucosal injury in critically ill patients. The target population of this study was the general critically ill with a broad range of diagnoses including trauma, sepsis, and respiratory distress, because we want to identify subgroups of patients who may benefit from this technology. Overall, we found that 80% of all critically ill patients had a mean reactance <italic>X</italic>
<sub>L</sub> above the normal values for healthy tissue (<italic>X</italic>
<sub>L</sub> ≥ 13 − jΩ) and 15% of the patients had very high measurements (<italic>X</italic>
<sub>L</sub> &gt; 26 − jΩ), indicating significant level of tissue damage. This incidence matches the previously reported incidence of mucosal ischemia in the ICU as measured by gastric tonometry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885066612450415">26</xref></sup> As expected, patients with cardiovascular and respiratory problems had the highest incidence of abnormal mean reactance. However, no significant difference was found in any of the patient subgroups, and all had very high incidence suggesting splanchnic hypoperfusion is very common, and any intubated ICU patient may be at risk.</p>
<p>Patients with a mean <italic>X</italic>
<sub>L</sub> ≥ 13 − jΩ had significantly lower urine output and lower MAP, though not quite significant (as patients were under standard treatment protocols to control blood pressure). This is what we would expect of patients with compromised splanchnic perfusion. Accordingly, these patients also had significantly higher SOFA and APACHE scores as compared to normal <italic>X</italic>
<sub>L</sub> patients. Most importantly, patients with abnormal mean reactance had a significantly higher mortality in the ICU. We did not see a difference in ICU length of stay. This is probably due to the very long average stay seen in this sample of Mexican ICUs (as compared, eg, to US hospital averages).</p>
<p>Other measurements are used as indicators of hypoperfusion such as lactate, base deficit, or SvO<sub>2</sub>. These measurements are very specific indicators of systemic hypoperfusion but are very insensitive to splanchnic hypoperfusion and already have been shown in our previous animal and clinical studies to correlate very poorly with gastric reactance. As expected, in this study, lactate did not correlate with gastric reactance: <italic>X</italic>
<sub>L</sub> is identifying patients at risk well before significant changes in lactate are observed; this means we may be able to identify patients and adjust treatment earlier.</p>
<p>Patients with sepsis or septic shock also showed higher mean reactance. However, this study was designed to provide a 1-day snapshot of ICU patients, and as can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885066612450415">Figure 1</xref>, reactance is a poor diagnostic marker for sepsis and septic shock. But gastric reactance is proposed not as a diagnostic but as a monitoring tool for these patients. We would expect septic patients with normal mean <italic>X</italic>
<sub>L</sub> to develop higher reactance in subsequent days. (Some studies have shown that the GI microvasculature is injured in the development of sepsis, causing hypoxia and cell necrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885066612450415">27</xref></sup>) By the same token, we could expect, according to the theory that the gut is the motor of MOF, that nonseptic patients with high reactance may subsequently develop sepsis. Our study did show that patients with mean reactance <italic>X</italic>
<sub>L</sub> &gt; 26 − jΩ had hemodynamic instability or sepsis, and the others developed sepsis or septic shock during their ICU stay; but this study was not designed to test these hypotheses. Indeed, based on these and other earlier results, a longitudinal study of changes in reactance over the length of an ICU stay as related to patient outcomes would be an excellent next research step.</p>
<p>We observed a strong relationship between increased IAP and high mean reactance <italic>X</italic>
<sub>L</sub> (greater than 26 − jΩ). Some studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885066612450415">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885066612450415"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885066612450415">25</xref>
</sup> demonstrated the hemodynamic effects of increasing IAP and its correlation with low gastric tonometry ph<sub>i</sub> and lactic acidosis. Elevated IAP may collapse major veins within the abdominal cavity and induce a decrease in venous return from the abdomen and the lower extremities to the heart.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885066612450415">28</xref></sup> Moreover, experimental and clinical studies have shown that an acute increase in IAP on the normovolemic model has territorial circulatory repercussions, such as decreased splanchnic blood flow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885066612450415">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885066612450415">30</xref></sup> If gastric blood flow is adversely affected with IAP &gt;15 mm Hg, gastric reactance should be a useful tool for monitoring tissue damage, which can be used in combination with other measures capable of identifying regional ischemia. The interpretation of individual values of any parameter should be avoided, as suggested by Vincent,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885066612450415">31</xref></sup> and an evaluation of the trend in values should be better.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study showed a very high incidence of abnormal gastric reactance, which is a measure of mucosal ischemic injury, in all medical and surgical critically ill patients, independent of the reason for ICU admission. Overall incidence of abnormal reactance agrees with previously reported incidence of gastric ischemia in 80% of intubated patients in the ICU. These patients had significantly worse indicators of perfusion and prognosis and had a significantly higher mortality. These results are in agreement with our understanding of the measurement and the physiology behind it and show that gastric ischemic damage is highly prevalent and relevant to ICU patient outcomes. The measurement itself is easy and reliable and provides information currently not available to the physician. Further research is recommended to understand how these measurements change with the evolution of disease and treatment in order to understand whether and how this measurement may be used as a useful clinical monitoring tool.</p>
