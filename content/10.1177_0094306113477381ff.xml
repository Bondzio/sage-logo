<p>In assembling a volume on the sociology of diagnosis, P.J. McGann and David Hutson have pursued an area of inquiry in medical sociology which they note was first suggested by Phil Brown in 1990. In the preface, Renee Anspach writes that diagnosis may constitute <italic>the</italic> central feature of medical work, separating medical work from the patient experience, and establishing an objective and orderly framework for subsequent medical treatment. David Hutson, in the introduction, notes the way in which diagnosis characterized the late nineteenth and early twentieth century development of allopathic medicine. Hutson describes the typical scene of a patient surrounded by physicians, with the lead physician detailing the symptoms and administering a public physical examination, the ultimate goal being that of naming the pathology or disease. Drawings and paintings illustrating such early “heroic” medical practice are familiar to medical sociologists and medical historians. Hutson’s observations and the offerings in this volume underscore that “diagnosis” with its reliance on observation of evidence was key to the rise of modern scientific medical practice, and that many of its turning points revolve around changes in diagnosis. In the summary chapter, P.J. McGann completes this framing of modern medicine via diagnosis and brings us to current practice by introducing the valuable notion of “diagnostic turns.” The two editors have assembled a dozen empirical contributions delineating cultural, political, comparative, and technological influences on diagnosis, including the entrance of stakeholders other than medicine. In these chapters (organized into sections entitled Frameworks, Context, Contestation, Identity, and Social Control) the authors examine a number of illustrative diagnostic problem areas that taken together, illustrate why diagnosis, disputed diagnosis, and the consequences of diagnosis demand sociological investigation.</p>
<p>In organizing the anthology, the editors call for framework(s) for a sociology of diagnosis, rightly beginning with an excellent conceptual overview by Annemarie Jutel, who has been working in the field for a number of years. Jutel reviews relevant contributions and sets out parameters for research, concluding that investigation of social forces influencing diagnosis is significant because, “Diagnoses do not exist ontologically…they are concepts that bind the biological, the technological, the social, the political, and the lived” (p. 26). The editors and authors underscore that “diagnosis” is not the same as “medicalization,” a process whereby medicine increasingly asserts its authority over non-medical phenomena. Rather, diagnosis marks an official labeling of pathology and a turning point from which various consequences—institutional, political, and personal—emerge. Because the consequences of diagnosis are so significant, it is not surprising that misalignments occur among diagnosticians and conflicts arise among stakeholders. Diagnostic misalignments can be seen between countries and regions marked by historical and political differences, as in the stark differences between French and American psychiatry with respect to the diagnosis of ADHD. In cases described in other chapters, conflicts between medical providers and “patient” stakeholders are underscored. The contributions under the “Contestation” section describe the highly significant influence of social movements on diagnosis, as in the case of intersex rights activists resisting and challenging diagnoses of pathology firmly held by medicine.</p>
<p>If “diagnosed” groups challenge medical labeling, contest a diagnosis, and assert normalcy, just as significant are those who seek the legitimacy of diagnosis. People who have experienced social trauma (war, killing, slavery, sexual abuse) may work toward obtaining a diagnosis that will enable them to get needed help, and also bring them to a hoped-for transcendent position, enabling them to better manage a troubled past. To name the problem is to begin solving it, and from this vantage point social movements are significant because framing, and thus naming, the problem can bring it into the public mind and create empathy. An important point not to be missed is that activists seek diagnosis as a means to individual treatment and also to address the social etiology of the problem: the social world must be “cured” for the individual to be healthy.</p>
<p>The book is thought-provoking, particularly for medical sociologists wanting to remove diagnosis from “the folds of medicalization,” and specifically examine social control and other consequences resulting from diagnoses. One can also conclude from these readings that diagnosis provides a “frame” useful in delineating the argument of various stakeholders regarding what should be attended to and what should be ignored when it comes to a medical label, as has been argued similarly in applying social movement framing to medical work (Snow and Lessor 2009). A minor disappointment of this book is the concentration on psychiatric diagnoses of one kind or another. From discussion in the opening chapters, one would expect to see, in addition to behavioral maladies, the inclusion of disputed diagnoses over physical ailments. Conrad and others have discussed such conditions under the heading of the “illness experience.” For example, in the case of fibromyalgia, what does it mean to need the company of other “fibromites” to call attention to physical symptoms and to assert a diagnosis? This excellent collection however, is a call for such work, and should spur investigators to pursue studies of diagnosis across the physical, emotional, and behavioral spectrum.</p>
<p>Initiating systematic study of diagnosis and its social and political moorings could not be timelier. At the time of this review, the Government Accountability Office is reporting that despite promises by the newly merged Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to expedite medical evaluations of wounded and disabled service members, processing times have actually risen significantly; active-duty troops and National Guard members wait an average of 394 days and 420 days respectively to begin treatment. Much of the bottleneck occurs at <italic>diagnosis</italic>, including the collection, reporting, and evaluating of data necessary to make a diagnosis. Whether one does the sociology <italic>of</italic> medicine aimed at identifying the sociological dimensions of health and medicine as a fundamental social institution, or whether one pursues sociology <italic>in</italic> medicine, contributing sociological insights to solving critical health problems, it is apparent that plenty of work is needed in the sociology of diagnosis.</p>
