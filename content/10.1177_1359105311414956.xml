<abstract>
<p>Most patients are decisionally incapacitated at the end of life, leaving final treatment decisions to proxies, whose substituted judgment is often inaccurate. We investigated the reluctance to burden others (RBO), a commonly cited patient value, as a possible source of proxy inaccuracy. In a sample of 202 elders and their proxies, elders responded to three burden-related questions and the Life-prolonging Treatment Preferences Questionnaire. Proxies used substituted judgment to respond to the same questions. Although RBO predicted treatment preferences for both elders and proxies, elders rated RBO significantly more important than did proxies. In addition, larger elder–proxy differences in RBO were associated with more inaccurate substituted judgment.</p>

<body>
<p>Only a minority of Americans participate in decision making at the end of their lives, as a consequence of dementia, coma, delirium, or other conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311414956">Field and Cassel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311414956">Silveira et al., 2010</xref>). When a patient is decisionally incapacitated and a treatment decision must be made, proxies, usually next-of-kin family members, are often charged with using the standard of substituted judgment, according to which they must apply the patient’s wishes, rather than the proxy’s own, in decisions about care. Yet proxy decision makers are known to be inaccurate in their understanding of their relatives’ wishes for care. Research examining the correspondence between patients and their proxies, in which individuals complete advance care directives while their designated proxies complete the same on their behalf, has shown proxy accuracy to be poor (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311414956">Fagerlin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311414956">Hare et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311414956">Marks and Arkes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311414956">Silveira and Schneider, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311414956">Zettel-Watson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311414956">Zweibel and Cassel, 1989</xref>). Proxies have been found to be wrong about their relatives’ wishes approximately one-third of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311414956">Shalowitz et al., 2006</xref>). Inaccurate substituted judgment undermines the goal of patient autonomy because proxies cannot exercise good substituted judgment if they do not accurately understand patients’ wishes.</p>
<p>Elders and proxies apparently bring different considerations to bear in decisions about medical treatments, or weight them differently. The present study examined one particularly strong candidate to help explain proxy inaccuracy, patients’ reluctance to burden others (RBO) and the wish to remain independent. McPherson and her associates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311414956">2007</xref>) reviewed both qualitative and quantitative research on the self-reported sense of being a burden to others, including its prevalence, correlates, implications for decision making, and differences between patients and their proxy decision makers. The prevalence of the desire to avoid burden to others has been widely documented among patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311414956">Zweibel and Cassel, 1989</xref>) and nonpatients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311414956">Tomlinson et al., 1990</xref>). Patients report placing considerable importance on family-burden considerations in terminal care decision making (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311414956">Bookwala et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311414956">Cohen-Mansfield et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311414956">Jecker, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311414956">Sehgal et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311414956">Mead et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311414956">Zweibel and Cassell, 1989</xref>). Consistent with this, research on characteristics of the good death has identified avoidance of burdening others as a prominent value for many people (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311414956">Singer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311414956">Steinhauser et al., 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311414956">2000b</xref>). Some research has investigated differences between patients and their proxies, documenting that proxies place less importance on family burden and more on pain (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311414956">Hare et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311414956">Steinhauser et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311414956">Tomlinson et al., 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>A more limited research literature has shown that RBO is empirically associated with actual treatment preferences regarding end-of-life care. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311414956">Doukas and Gorenflo (1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311414956">Doukas and McCullough, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311414956">Doukas et al., 1992)</xref> identified family burden as one of three factors in their Values History and found it to be the only factor that predicted preferences for life- rolonging care. Those most reluctant to burden others wished for less aggressive medical treatment. A small qualitative study of dialysis patients documented the same association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311414956">Ashby et al., 2005</xref>). Clearly, the RBO holds an important place among patient values, presenting a potential explanation for proxy inaccuracy in substituted judgment.</p>
<p>Our research expanded on existing research by evaluating the role of this value in proxies’ substituted judgments, as well as elders’ own treatment preferences, and also the effect of differential (elder vs proxy) RBO ratings on inaccuracy in proxy substituted judgment. We posed four specific questions: (1) Do elders rate RBO more highly as a consideration than their proxies do on their behalf? (2) To what extent is RBO predictive of elders’ preferences for life-prolonging treatments vs for proxies’ substituted judgment? (3) Are elder–proxy differences in ratings of the importance of RBO associated with proxy inaccuracy? (4) If so, whose RBO ratings – elders or proxies – are more strongly associated with this inaccuracy?</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Participants were 202 community-dwelling elderly men and women (70 years of age or older) and their proxies, for a total of 404 participants. Elders, who resided in the Philadelphia area, were recruited into the study through a variety of sources, including announcements placed in the bulletins of two Philadelphia senior centers, fliers distributed at two continuing care retirement communities and two senior housing developments, display ads in two Philadelphia newspapers, and mailings to patients of two large family medicine practices. Each elder identified a proxy, defined as an individual whom the elder would choose to make healthcare decisions on his/her behalf if he/she were unable to make such decisions. All elders and proxies were cognitively intact as measured by the MMSE telephone version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311414956">Roccaforte et al., 1992</xref>), which was administered to both. The mean age of elders was approximately 79, of proxies approximately 60. The pluralities of proxies were adult daughters, and one-quarter were spouses. Most were female. Slightly over half were White. Characteristics of the elders and proxies are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105311414956">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Proxy inaccuracy in substituted judgments for elders’ treatment preferences</title>
<p>Proxy inaccuracy was operationally defined as the difference between the elder’s treatment preferences and those of his/her proxy for the same treatment in the same circumstances. Treatment preferences (for both elders and proxies) were measured using a modified version of the Life Support Preferences Questionnaire (LSPQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311414956">Bookwala et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311414956">Coppola et al., 1999</xref>). This instrument elicited preference ratings for four medical treatments – antibiotics, gall bladder surgery, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and tube feeding for acute life-threatening conditions. For each treatment, participations were asked how much they would want it in the context of each of eight prospects of health, varying in severity, prognosis, and level of pain, and the prospect of ‘return to current health’. The LSPQ format approximates clinical situations common in the experiences of elderly patients, in which a decision for or against a treatment (e.g. tube feeding) for an acute life-threatening condition is made in the context of a chronic health condition (e.g. dementia) that dictates quality of life. Thus, participants consider how much they would want life-prolonging treatment in the each scenario. The <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1359105311414956">Appendix</xref> presents the seven scenarios.</p>
<p>Instructions emphasized that the life-prolonging treatment under consideration would be for the relevant <italic>acute</italic> condition only (i.e. gall bladder surgery for an inflamed and infected gall bladder, antibiotics for pneumonia, CPR for cardiac or respiratory arrest, tube feeding for inability to eat or drink) – not for treatment of the chronic condition that forms the context of the question (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease). Preferences for each treatment were elicited on five-point Likert scales (0 = definitely would not want, 1 = probably would not want, 2 = unsure, 3 = probably would want, and 4 = definitely want). The LSPQ is written at the eighth-grade reading level.</p>
<p>Proxies were instructed by the investigators as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I would like you to respond to these questions as if you had to make decisions on behalf of (name of elder), because s/he is unable to speak for himself or herself. Please base your decision on what you think (the elder) would want. If you are not sure what (he/she) would want, please make your best guess.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For each treatment in each health scenario, a score was computed representing the difference between the elder’s preference and his/her proxies’ preference.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1359105311414956">
<title>Reluctance to burden others</title>
<p>This construct was operationally defined using ratings of three values: (1) the wish to avoid burdening family and friends emotionally; (2) the wish to avoid burdening others financially; and (3) the wish to avoid being dependent on others (i.e. to remain independent). These were part of an eight-item end-of-life values scale that included other items, such as the wish to follow the teachings of one’s religion, to avoid pain, and to live as long as possible (End-of-life Values Scale; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311414956">Winter, 2011</xref>). Instructions were as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I have some questions about things you may think about in relation to treatment decisions. I will ask about several types of things that people often consider and ask you to rate how important each one is in your thinking.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants responded to each item on a Likert scale from 0 (not at all important) to 5 (extremely important). Proxies were instructed to use substituted judgment for these values, that is, to respond as the elder would, to the best of their knowledge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1359105311414956">
<title>Demographic characteristics</title>
<p>For both elders and proxies, age, race (coded White or nonWhite), gender, years of education, occupation, financial difficulty, and marital status were elicited. The financial difficulty question required the participant to rate how difficult is it to pay the basics like food, housing, and healthcare, using a scale from 0 (‘not at all’) to 3 (‘very difficult’).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1359105311414956">
<title>Cognitive status</title>
<p>Cognitive status was assessed in both elders and proxies using a telephone version of the Mini-Mental State Exam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311414956">Roccaforte et al., 1992</xref>), which excludes items that must be administered face to face. Possible scores range from 0 to 23, with 23 indicating no errors. All participants scored 17 or higher, with a mean MMSE score of 21.4 (SD = 1.6).</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section8-1359105311414956">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>People interested in the study called the research office or completed and returned a stamped self-addressed postcard and were contacted by telephone. A trained interviewer explained the study fully and confirmed the person’s eligibility by age and willingness to participate. Informed consent was elicited using an IRB-approved verbal consent script. The 35-minute interview was conducted immediately or scheduled for a later time. All interviews were conducted on the telephone. Participants were offered a $25 honorarium for their participation.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<sec id="section10-1359105311414956">
<title>Reliability of RBO</title>
<p>To estimate internal consistency for the RBO scales, Cronbach’s alpha was computed for the three reluctance to burden items for elders and proxies separately. RBO was found to be internally consistent for both elders (alpha = .75) and proxies (alpha = .82). Accordingly, mean RBO were calculated for elders and proxies, ranging from 0 to 5 for both elders and proxies. The mean RBO scores for elders was 4.54 (SD = 0.91), for proxies 4.12 (SD = 1.23).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1359105311414956">
<title>Elder–proxy differences in rating of RBO</title>
<p>The difference between elders and proxies in RBO scores was computed using a paired <italic>t</italic>-test (paired because elders and their proxies are matched, since each elder chose his/her proxy).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1359105311414956">
<title>Selection of covariates</title>
<p>To select covariates for subsequent analyses, mean preferences for life-prolonging treatment across all treatments and health prospects was examined in relation to sociodemographic covariates (race, age, gender, and financial difficulty). Pearson product moment correlations or <italic>t</italic>-tests were conducted as appropriate. Mean elders’ treatment preferences were found to be associated with the elder’s age (<italic>p</italic> = .011), race (<italic>p</italic> = &lt; .0001), gender (<italic>p</italic> = .050), and financial difficulty (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). Mean proxies’ treatment preferences were associated with proxies’ age (<italic>p</italic> = .016), financial difficulty (<italic>p</italic> = .014), and race (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). For the analyses using elder–proxy differences in treatment preferences, only the elder’s gender was associated (<italic>p</italic> = .014), with greater differences found when the elder was female. Therefore, the subsequent analyses were adjusted for the variables found to be associated with the respective dependent variables.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1359105311414956">
<title>Effect of RBO on treatment preferences</title>
<p>For elders and proxies separately, repeated-measures analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were conducted to assess the association between treatment preferences and reluctance to burden others, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. Dependent variables were preferences for four life-prolonging treatments in seven prospects, with RBO as the independent variables and age, race, and gender as covariates. The purpose of including the seven prospects and four treatments in a within-subjects design was to allow for possible interactions by prospect and treatment types.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1359105311414956">
<title>Effects of RBO differences on elder–proxy discordance in treatment preferences</title>
<p>We computed difference scores between the proxy preferences and the elder preference for each treatment in each prospect, yielding 28 discordance scores. To assess the effect of RBO on elder–proxy discordance in treatment preferences, a repeated-measure ANCOVA was conducted on these elder–proxy difference scores for four treatments (antibiotics, CPR, gall bladder surgery, and tube feeding) in seven health prospects. Proxy–elder discordance scores were examined in a repeated-measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with repeated measures on the seven health prospects and four types of treatments. The independent variable was reluctance to burden, and race served as the covariate.</p>
<p>Finally, as a test of the differential impact of RBO for elders and proxies, an ANCOVA was conducted on elder–proxy differences in life-prolonging treatment preferences (across all seven prospects and four treatment types), using elders’ RBO and proxies’ RBO as independent variables and adjusting for elders’ gender, the sole sociodemographic variables associated with elder–proxy differences in treatment preferences.</p>

The repeated-measures ANCOVA for elders revealed a main effect for RBO (<italic>F</italic>[1, 196] = 5.69, <italic>p</italic> = .018, eta<sup>2</sup> = .028) but no effects for health prospect (<italic>F</italic>[6, 191] = .974, <italic>p</italic> = .444, eta<sup>2</sup> = .030) or treatment type (<italic>F</italic> [3, 194] = .315, <italic>p</italic> = .815, eta<sup>2</sup> = .005). Demographic differences in treatment preferences were revealed for race (<italic>F</italic> [1, 196] = 4.57, <italic>p</italic> = .007, eta<sup>2</sup> = .037), elder’s age (<italic>F</italic> [1, 196] = 5.41, <italic>p</italic> = .021, eta<sup>2</sup> = .027), and financial difficulty (<italic>F</italic> [1, 196] = 9.778, <italic>p</italic> = .002, eta<sup>2</sup> = .048). Stronger preferences for life-prolonging treatment were expressed by nonWhites. In addition, younger age and greater financial difficulty were associated with stronger preferences for life-prolonging treatment.</p>
<p>The ANCOVA for proxies revealed main effects for RBO (<italic>F</italic>[1, 193] = 11.37, <italic>p</italic> = .001, eta<sup>2</sup> = .056), for health prospect (<italic>F</italic>[6, 188] = 4.149, <italic>p</italic> = .001, eta<sup>2</sup> = .117), and for treatment type (<italic>F</italic>[3, 191] = 5.429, <italic>p</italic> = .001, eta<sup>2</sup> = .079). Main effects for race (<italic>F</italic>[1, 193] = 22.85, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, eta<sup>2</sup> = .106) and elders’ financial difficulty (<italic>F</italic> [1, 193] = 4.563, <italic>p</italic> = .034, eta<sup>2</sup> = .023) were found, indicating stronger preferences for life-prolonging treatments among nonWhites and those reporting greater elders’ financial difficulty.</p>

<title>Proxy inaccuracy in treatment preferences and differences in reluctance to burden</title>
<p>Inaccurate substituted judgment (i.e. elder–proxy discordance in treatment preferences) was associated with differences between elders and their proxies in RBO (<italic>F</italic>[1, 198] = 7.172, <italic>p</italic> = .008, eta<sup>2</sup> = .035). The greater the difference in RBO, the larger the proxy inaccuracy – in the direction of stronger proxy preferences for life-prolonging treatment compared to elders’ preferences. Main effects were found for treatment type (<italic>F</italic>[3, 196] = 2.738, <italic>p</italic> = .045, eta<sup>2</sup> = .040) and elder’s gender (<italic>F</italic>[1, 198] = 4.797, <italic>p</italic> = .030). No main effect was revealed for health prospect (<italic>F</italic>[6, 193] = .677, <italic>p</italic> = .668, eta<sup>2</sup> = .021).</p>
<p>Finally, inaccurate substituted judgment was found to be associated with elders’ RBO ratings but not proxies’ RBO ratings. The ANCOVA on inaccurate substituted judgment for life-prolonging treatment preferences showed a significant effect for elders’ RBO (<italic>F</italic>[1, 197] = 4.125, <italic>p</italic> = .044, eta<sup>2</sup> = .021) but not for proxies’ RBO (<italic>F</italic>[1, 197] = 3.285, <italic>p</italic> = .071, eta<sup>2</sup> = .016), adjusting for elders’ gender. For ease of displaying this effect, we dichotomized RBO ratings into highest possible RBO score (5) or lower RBO scores (&lt; 5). Among elders, 64.5 percent had a RBO score or 5 (extremely important); among proxies, 44.6 percent had a score of 5. Thus, for both elders and proxies, a score of 5 was coded as high RBO and scores less than 5 were coded as lower RBO. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1359105311414956">Figure 1</xref> displays mean elder–proxy differences in treatment preferences for high- and lower-RBO elders and high- and lower-RBO proxies. The greatest proxy inaccuracy was revealed for elders who weighted RBO the highest (5), the lowest for elders who weighted RBO less heavily (&lt; 5). By contrast, proxies’ high vs lower RBO scores were not significantly associated with elder–proxy discordance in treatment preferences. This illustrates the substantial impact of elders’ RBO on the size of elder–proxy discordance in treatment preferences.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Study findings answer the four questions posed earlier: (1) elders rated RBO more highly as a consideration in their medical decision making higher than did proxies, but the difference was quite small; (2) RBO predicted preferences for life-prolonging treatments for both elders and for proxies’ substituted judgment. Higher RBO ratings were associated with weaker preference for life-prolonging treatments; (3) concerning elder–proxy differences in ratings of RBO in relation to discordance in treatment preferences, the greater the elder–proxy difference in RBO, the less accurate the proxy’s substituted judgment. Larger differences in RBO were associated with relatively strong proxy preferences for life-prolonging care, compared to elders’ preferences; (4) concerning the question of whose RBO ratings – elders or proxies – were more strongly associated with elder–proxy discordance, we found that elders’ RBO ratings were strongly associated with proxy inaccuracy. By contrast, proxies’ RBO ratings were not significantly associated with proxy inaccuracy. In summary, reluctance to burden others is a factor in proxy inaccuracy in representing their relatives’ wishes for medical treatment.</p>
<p>The reluctance to burden others has long been recognized as a powerful value for older adults’ decisions about treatment care. The present findings confirm the work of Doukas and his colleagues as well as other seminal researchers in end-of-life values as factors in patient decision making (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311414956">Hare et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311414956">Zweibel and Cassell, 1989</xref>) and extend this research in several important ways. First, reluctance to burden others predicted elders’ treatment preferences of elders and also the substituted judgment of their proxies. Despite this parallel phenomenon, however, proxy inaccuracy was associated with differences in elders’ and proxies’ ratings of RBO: the larger the difference in RBO, the less accurate the proxy. Larger differences in RBO predicted relatively stronger proxy preferences for life-prolonging care, compared to elders’ preferences. Thus, differential ratings of reluctance to burden others help to account for proxy inaccuracy. Finally, proxy inaccuracy was associated with <italic>elders</italic>’ reluctance to burden ratings but not proxies’ ratings. Inaccuracy was greatest among elders who rated RBO highest (5), lowest among elders who rated it lower (&lt; 5). For proxies, high vs lower RBO ratings were not associated with proxy inaccuracy. Although this may seem inconsistent with the finding that RBO ratings of proxies predicted proxies’ treatment preferences, proxy inaccuracy is not the same outcome as treatment preferences themselves; it represents the <italic>difference</italic> between elders and proxies in treatment preferences. This finding should serve as a caveat for drawing conclusions based on parallel results of analyses from elder and proxies separately.</p>
<p>Findings underscore the importance of patient values in end-of-life decision making, and especially the pre-eminence of elders’ wishes not to burden other people and to remain independent. Patient values have been a somewhat neglected topic in research on medical decision making and deserve more systematic attention. This would be a worthwhile direction for both qualitative and quantitative research on end-of-life decision making.</p>
<p>One clinical implication is that values-based advance care planning documents should include items concerning burdening others and remaining independent. In addition, elders should discuss their feelings about these concerns in discussions with physicians and families. Healthcare providers and family members should recognize that this may be a value of great importance to patients. Providers should anticipate that proxies may underestimate their relatives’ position on it. Proxies’ inaccuracy in this regard may impair their substituted judgment about their relatives’ wishes. Full and frank discussions are essential to supporting patient autonomy.</p>
<p>Use of advance directives, including living wills and durable powers of attorney for healthcare, is increasingly common in the USA, with recent estimates as high as 70 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311414956">Silveira et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311414956">Teno et al., 2007</xref>). Numerous benefits of advance care planning have also been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311414956">Degenholtz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311414956">Detering et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311414956">Silveira et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311414956">Teno et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311414956">Wright et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105311414956">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). As advance care planning comes into more widespread use, efforts to improve the usefulness of care planning documents and discussions should recognize the importance of the reluctance to burden others as a pre-eminent value and a predictor of patient preferences for care at the end of life.</p>

<list-item><p>Artificial Feeding and Fluids: Doctors use artificial feeding and fluids when people are unable to take enough food and water to stay alive. The food goes through a feeding tube. Usually, the feeding tube is inserted into the stomach through the left side of the abdomen during surgery. The stomach is stitched closed around the tube. Without the treatment, patients die within 7–10 days.</p></list-item></list>
