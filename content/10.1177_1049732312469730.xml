<abstract>
<p>In a growing body of social research it is suggested that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a low priority for people who inject drugs. We expand on the evidence to explore the link between identity and health using biographical adaptation theories. We examined experiences of HCV infection and illness among women who inject drugs, women who are no longer injecting drugs, and women who have never injected drugs. We investigated the relationship between identity and illness experience and found that illness does not simply dislocate one’s biographical trajectory. For women who used drugs the shared symbolism of HCV infection was understood and accepted via a self-identity linked to poverty and experience of injecting drugs. Rather than disrupting their expected life trajectory, the narratives of most women incorporated the disease experience within their life story, confirming their identity as a person who injected drugs and as someone with constant and serious life stressors.</p>

<body>
<p>There are an estimated 212,000 people living with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Australia, and around 12,000 notifications annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312469730">National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research, 2010</xref>). This rate of infection poses a significant public health problem. Around 75% of people who have been exposed to HCV develop chronic infection, which is defined as the presence of the virus in the bloodstream for longer than 6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312469730">Commonwealth of Australia, 2010</xref>). The remaining 25% spontaneously clear the virus but continue to have detectable antibodies, which do not provide immunity.</p>
<p>HCV, a blood-borne virus, is predominantly transmitted through sharing injecting equipment. Transmission related to injecting drug use accounts for approximately 90% of new infections and 80% of existing infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732312469730">Razali et al., 2007</xref>). Other causes of transmission include blood transfusions and other medical and dental procedures, although such iatrogenic causes have become rarer since national screening of donated blood for HCV was implemented in Australia in 1990. Needle-stick injuries, body piercing, and tattooing are also commonly cited potential modes of HCV infection not related to injecting drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312469730">Commonwealth of Australia, 2010</xref>). For some people, the source of their infection is unclear.</p>
<p>Chronic HCV infection is associated with a number of physical morbidities and can result in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment is 50% to 80% effective (when the virus is no longer detected in the blood), depending on a number of factors including genotype of HCV, age, gender, and the extent of liver damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312469730">Cornberg, Wedemyer, &amp; Manns, 2002</xref>). Although HCV infection can cause considerable morbidity and contributes to escalating rates of liver cancer in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312469730">Amin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312469730">El-Serag, 2002</xref>), there is a low uptake of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312469730">National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research, 2010</xref>), which has led to HCV infection becoming a major chronic illness.</p>
<p>A number of debilitating psychosocial aspects of living with chronic HCV infection were revealed in previous research. High levels of psychological distress and impaired quality of life were commonly reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312469730">Coughlan, Sheehan, Hickey, &amp; Crowe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049732312469730">Spiegel et al., 2005</xref>). Anxiety, depression, reduced quality of life, feelings of loss of control, and difficulties in coping were also associated with diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312469730">Conrad, Garrett, Cooksley, Dunne, &amp; MacDonald, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1049732312469730">Zickmund, Ho, Masuda, Ippolito, &amp; LaBrecque, 2003</xref>). Perhaps the most common psychosocial impact of chronic HCV infection is stigma, especially in health care settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312469730">Gifford, O’ Brien, Bammer, Banwell, &amp; Stoové, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312469730">Hopwood &amp; Treloar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312469730">Hopwood, Treloar, &amp; Bryant, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732312469730">Richmond, Dunning, &amp; Desmond, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049732312469730">Temple-Smith, Jenkinson, Lavery, Gifford, &amp; Morgan, 2006</xref>). Felt stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049732312469730">Scrambler, 2009</xref>) is also commonly described by people reporting low self-esteem and low self-worth arising from a sense of guilt and shame about their “spoiled identity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312469730">Fraser &amp; Treloar, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Most research on the lived experience of HCV has been conducted on a broad range of people who acquired the virus via different means, including both current and former injecting drug users. In the few studies that included only people who injected drugs (PWID), it was suggested that there might be differences in their lived experience of HCV in comparison with those with iatrogenically acquired HCV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312469730">Davis &amp; Rhodes, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312469730">O’Brien, Day, Black, &amp; Dolan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312469730">Rhodes, Davis, &amp; Judd, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049732312469730">Southgate, Weatherall, Day, &amp; Dolan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1049732312469730">Wozniak, Prakash, Taylor, &amp; Wild, 2007</xref>). The debilitating physical and psychological impacts of HCV were less prominent in the reports of PWID.</p>
<p>Research conducted in North America, the United Kingdom, and Australia suggests that HCV infection is a low health priority for PWID. Some researchers have attributed this ambivalence to drug dependence and an overwhelming focus on acquiring and using drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312469730">Faye &amp; Irurita, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732312469730">Roy, Nonn, Haley, &amp; Cox, 2007</xref>). Other researchers found that PWID often believe that HCV is an unavoidable and inevitable outcome of injecting drugs. In the narratives of PWID, HCV was often constructed in comparison with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), and HCV was experienced as less serious or life threatening than HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312469730">Davis &amp; Rhodes, 2004b</xref>). Relative to more immediate material, health, and interpersonal concerns, HCV was also commonly described as comparatively inconsequential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312469730">Davis &amp; Rhodes, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732312469730">Rhodes &amp; Treloar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1049732312469730">Wozniak et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers who have attempted to understand the transmission and lived experience of HCV from the perspective of PWID have also looked at the interpersonal and symbolic meanings of HCV. A few studies have described the ways PWID incorporate biomedical understandings of HCV into their lives. Research revealed a widespread “normalization” or “social accommodation” of HCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312469730">Davis, Rhodes, &amp; Martin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312469730">Rhodes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1049732312469730">Wozniak et al., 2007</xref>). This normalization of HCV among PWID was at odds with the biomedical definitions and sequelae of the disease, and contrasted with the experiences of psychosocial distress and symptoms reported by other subsets of people with HCV.</p>
<p>To explore the HCV illness experience, we explicitly compare and contrast illness narratives within a diverse sample of women living with HCV. Drawing on sociological insights into narrative constructions or “lived experience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049732312469730">Scheper-Hughes &amp; Lock, 1987</xref>) of illness, we examine women’s descriptions of HCV as expressions of the body, self, and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1049732312469730">Williams, 2005</xref>). Narratives about HCV provide a window into the practical and symbolic consequences of illness as well as reflecting cultural patterns influencing how a person thinks about illness and how our culture constructs “sick” people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312469730">Bury, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312469730">Kelly &amp; Field, 1996</xref>). The use of narrative in research on chronic illness illustrates that with sickness, an individual can encounter physical changes, personal consequences of altered capability, and social and moral expectations of illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312469730">Bury, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312469730">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312469730">Carricaburu &amp; Pierret, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312469730">Corbin &amp; Strauss, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049732312469730">Ville &amp; Khlat, 2007</xref>). These changes, according to Bury, can lead to the rupture, reassessment, and renegotiation of self-identity, thereby disrupting one’s expected life biography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312469730">Bury, 1982</xref>; Corbin &amp; Strauss; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049732312469730">Williams, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312469730">Bury’s (1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312469730">2005</xref>) theory has been applied to specific disease entities to explore and highlight particular issues for affected individuals. Other authors have drawn attention to the applicability of biographical adaptation theory in the context of HCV normalization among PWID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049732312469730">Treloar &amp; Rhodes, 2009</xref>), although few researchers have investigated the ways HCV identity might differ with injecting drug use status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312469730">Harris, 2009</xref>). We apply <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312469730">Bury’s (1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312469730">2005</xref>) theory to a large and diverse qualitative data set to discuss the importance of identity in the symbolic meanings around illness. We examine how meanings of HCV infection among women living with the virus differ with socioeconomic status and the experience of injecting drug use.</p>
<p>Addressing the different experiences among the subgroups, we explore contemporary elaborations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312469730">Bury’s (1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312469730">2005</xref>) notions of personal biography in chronic illness, which suggest that illness might not necessarily be disruptive to the self. Instead, illness experience can be incorporated into an ongoing life story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312469730">Faircloth, Boylstein, Rittman, Ellen Young, &amp; Gubrium, 2004</xref>), interacting with one’s personal narrative to reinforce an identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312469730">Carricaburu &amp; Pierret, 1995</xref>). We argue for the need to incorporate an understanding of the importance of identity in subjective reports of illness experiences, as well as consideration of how socioeconomic forces impact on the experience of disease. In doing so we contribute to the field of chronic illness by highlighting the relationship between identity and illness, rather than only the effects of illness on identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1049732312469730">Wilson, 2007</xref>), and by considering these findings in light of current efforts to prevent and treat HCV infection.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>During 2005 and 2006 we conducted in-depth, semistructured interviews with 109 women living with HCV. Interviews create opportunities for revealing the lived experience and social meanings of the participants as well as exploring how participants interpret and make sense of their experiences through narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312469730">Ezzy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312469730">Lambert &amp; McKevitt, 2002</xref>). Our interest was in the connections women saw, if any, between their HCV status and their sexuality, relationships, contraception, child bearing, and general well-being.</p>
<p>We aimed to recruit a range of women living with HCV, and employed a purposive sampling framework to select both women who were injecting drugs and those who were not. To recruit women from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds we sampled from community organizations, such as HCV councils, as well as peer-based organizations for people who inject drugs, drug treatment services, and health clinics in two urban cities in Australia: Canberra and Melbourne. In the recruitment we relied on the women’s self-reported HCV status. Because our interest was more focused on the perceptions and experiences of living with the virus rather than measurable physiological consequences, we did not request a confirmed HCV diagnosis. A brief, standardized set of questions was used to collect sociodemographic data, and a theme list prompted open-ended questions on past and current contraceptive experiences, drug use histories, reproductive and sexual health, current living arrangements, and future plans. Ethical approval for this research was obtained through the Human Research Ethics Committee at the Australian National University, and all participants gave their informed consent before participating.</p>
<p>We communicated frequently with each other throughout the interviewing process, reflecting on both the conduct and content of interviews, and generating topics for use in additional interviews. We collected data in both cities until it was felt that we had reached saturation of themes around HCV, reproductive histories, and drug use. Eighty-five women who were injecting drugs at the time of the interview or who had injected drugs in the past were recruited, together with 24 women who had never injected drugs.</p>
<p>Interviews were digitally recorded and professionally transcribed. We used Atlas.ti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312469730">Muhr &amp; Friese, 2004</xref>) to assist in the management of data and allow us to share coded data easily. Initially, the analysis of the qualitative data was guided by preexisting themes from the literature and interview questions related to HCV, reproduction, and drug use. To guard against bias, two team members read and reread interviews for these recurrent themes. We then compared and contrasted specific experiences within these topics, such as HCV diagnosis or motherhood. As familiarity with the data grew, we considered other topics such as poverty, housing, and concerns about children, and created new themes. For each theme identified we reread and recoded transcripts. We systematically compared coded sections of the data to build links between themes and condense any that overlapped. To ensure confidentiality, we removed names from the data and women are identified in this article only their by status as an injecting drug user (PWID); never injected (NI); or previously injected (PI). The women in the latter group (previously injected) had not injected in the previous 12 months and most had not injected drugs since their late teens or early 20s, usually a decade or more prior to interview.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section3-1049732312469730">
<title>Diagnosis as Disruption</title>
<p>For a small number of women, their experience of being diagnosed with HCV was unexpected, frightening, and disruptive to their life course and sense of self. This subgroup had generally never injected or had injected in the past. Diagnosis for these women tended to come about as part of routine prenatal screening or because of persistent symptoms. Many of them had little or no knowledge of HCV prior to diagnosis: “Well, I felt a bit—lost. I think that’s what went on in my head, and I felt frightened and I felt infected and didn’t quite know where to go to get help or advice” (PI).</p>
<p>These women indicated that diagnosis led to a “major life transition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312469730">Faye &amp; Irurita, 2003</xref>, p. 96) or a sense of loss of control over their life course. The HCV diagnosis, the potential for ongoing poor health (including the prospect of premature death), and other negative impacts of HCV challenged their identity as a healthy “normal” person with plans for the future:
<disp-quote>
<p>The fact that you would never get better from something. . . . It takes a while to get used to that reality. (PI)</p>
<p>I felt my life had collapsed actually, it was just devastating . . . my life just went bang. She [the nurse who reported diagnosis] had said, “We don’t know how long you will live. We don’t know. It could be five years, it could be twenty years.” . . . I think that without even thinking, I fell pregnant. I just wanted to get a life. (NI)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732312469730">
<title>Demons From the Past</title>
<p>The participants who expressed shock and disruption from their diagnosis were predominantly women who had never injected drugs or who had not injected drugs in many years (in some cases, for decades). For those who had stopped using drugs some time previously, the label of <italic>HCV positive</italic> not only disrupted future plans but forced them to return to past concepts of the self. Several women indicated that the emotional history of their prior drug use had reemerged with the diagnosis of HCV:
<disp-quote>
<p>I really wanted to put all that behind me. . . . The diagnosis was ten years or whatever after I’d stopped using so, yeah, it was the past coming back to bite me right in the arse, essentially, and I didn’t really want to deal with it. (PI)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These accounts show how HCV diagnosis has the potential to expose an earlier identity which might have been left behind when a person ceased injecting drugs:</p>
<p>It is quite unfair having this illness, in that the past is always a little bit with you. (PI)
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s funny talking about all this stuff [family issues, abusive relationship, and psychological illness] in the past. It is so long ago and I wish, if it wasn’t for the hepatitis C, it would be something in the distance. I hate that hepatitis C brings it into the present. I hate that, because I’m not that person anymore, and I am extremely lucky I have a great life. I have a really great job—very responsible job which I love. I have got a beautiful child, great friends, great husband. . . . We’ve just bought a new house. Everything is so wonderful and then to get this horrible thing just hanging over my head. I’d do anything to be able to get rid of it, but you can’t control it, unfortunately. All I can do is try and give interferon [medication] another go. (PI)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The anxiety and guilt that can accompany a disease associated with behavioral causes, even when acquired during a period of youthful fun or a troubled time, can entail repercussions more debilitating than the illness itself. The salience of HCV in the lives of these women was as much symbolic as symptomatic. HCV diagnosis could bring with it both intimate emotional pain but also social shame about drug use and infectiousness:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know if it’s changed much now, but I think there needs to be more support and education when people are diagnosed, because it is terrifying. I can’t say it would be worse if you were still using, but in my case it was like a different lifetime and like I even said to the doctor, “The past has caught up with me.” (PI)</p>
<p>Generally, the thing that distresses me the most about hep [hepatitis] C is the social kind of stigma associated with having an infectious illness. And especially an infectious illness that’s related to something like intravenous drug use. . . . I mean, sometimes it makes me feel bad about myself. . . . Makes me feel like I’m kind of dirty, like I’ve got this shameful secret that I have to keep hidden when I don’t really feel like that about anything else in my life. (PI)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732312469730">
<title>“It’s Probably Inevitable”: Biographical Reinforcement</title>
<p>For most women in the study, diagnosis with HCV was distressing, although the shock of diagnosis was commonly mingled with the perception that HCV acquisition was inevitable or at least an accepted risk of injecting drugs:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know. I guess I felt like a walking disease, I suppose, for a little while, and just like the shame and also, oh well, you know, it’s probably inevitable using drugs intravenously for five or so years. I’m lucky I’ve got away with not having it for that long, and out of all my friends I was the only one who never had it for a long time. . . . I guess, after a while I just came to realize that if I’m going to use heroin I’ll end up with hep C. It’s probably inevitable. . . . hand in hand, you know. (PWID)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Most of the PWID in the sample were in contact with specialist primary health centers and were routinely tested for blood-borne viruses within this context. Women were also tested when entering prison, alcohol and drug rehabilitation, or starting on opioid replacement therapy. Others reported getting regular tests from their doctor as part of their health care regime or requesting tests after an incident that could expose them to a blood-borne virus (such as the sharing of injecting equipment, a needle-stick injury, or a broken condom during sex).</p>
<p>The acceptance of routine testing for blood-borne viruses among this population might have lessened some of the psychological and social shock and distress of diagnosis. Although women experienced fear and anxiety about HCV, the ubiquity of HCV among their contemporaries rendered a positive diagnosis a relatively unimportant life event. HCV was an expected life trajectory for some who injected drugs:
<disp-quote>
<p>It didn’t shock me. It was just, “Oh well.” A lot of people that I know have hep C. It is just so common, more common than hep B. . . . All the people that I knew had hep C, so I wasn’t really that surprised that I would have hep C as well. So it wasn’t like a shock. I am one of the 60 percent of the [drug using] population. (PWID)</p>
<p>But yeah, pretty much everybody I know has got hep C. . . . But out of all the people I know who have got hep C, none of them are sick. So, I don’t know, it’s just one of those things. (PWID)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The accounts of women who were injecting drugs at the time of the interview did not fit the framework of a disrupted biography. Their diagnosis reinforced, rather than challenged, their biography as a drug user:
<disp-quote>
<p>Yeah. I certainly wish I didn’t have it [HCV]. If there was a way that you could just have an injection or some easy treatment, I certainly would do it. And, of course, if I could change the clock then I would do lots of things differently, but I think once you’ve been an addict, too, I am already good at looking at how different I am from other people. And it is just another thing that makes you different. (PWID)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The women who more or less accepted their HCV diagnosis were a discrete majority in this study. Not only were they injecting drugs, they were more likely to have an annual household income of less than $20,000AUS, to live in public housing, to be unemployed, and to be without a car. Most women who were using drugs relied on government financial support and housing, and 40% had completed less than 10 years of education. The relative lack of economic and social resources was reflected in their narratives about HCV:
<disp-quote>
<p>Within this lifestyle I tend to forget I’ve got it [HCV] most of the time. . . . When people ask me what’s wrong with me I sort of reel off the list and that’s the last thing—“Oh that’s right, I’ve got hep C.” (PWID)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to limited resources, many described feeling generally unwell and worried about their health and well-being. Many suspected HCV contributed to their poor health, yet their symptoms were contextualized within a biography already filled with other health issues, tension, and threats, and they tended to focus on these other, more immediate concerns:
<disp-quote>
<p>It [HCV] hasn’t bothered me enough to actually undertake any kind of, you know, process in getting rid of it. But I’m considering it. There’s been a lot of upheaval lately, but my health has been on the back burner. (PWID)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another factor minimizing fear of the virus for some women was repeated exposure to the deaths of friends, family, and acquaintances, none of which were related to HCV:
<disp-quote>
<p>Out of the people that were in my peer group [in the rehabilitation center], three quarters of them are dead and none of them died from hep C. It’s all been overdoses . . . it is more important to know whether you’ve got a fit [needle and syringe] or not. . . . It is as common as the addict . . . from the people that I knew and that I saw, it just was irrelevant if you had it. (PWID)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participant quoted below had had “a real shit year,” including the deaths of several people close to her, and described HCV as inconsequential compared to the dangers of her drug use:
<disp-quote>
<p>But I mean, if you play this game that us drug addicts play well, you’ve got to be prepared to, you know, you’re playing Russian Roulette every day when you’re injecting. It’s [HCV] nothing compared to what’s going on in my life. (PWID)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, in addition to an identity as an injecting drug user, the women for whom HCV was “normalized” also tended to situate their narratives about HCV among the details of other more pressing and concerning issues. Constructed through experiences of poverty, marginalization, and stigma, their life trajectory anticipated sickness and, at its worst, death.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312469730">Bury (1982)</xref>, the meanings and consequences of illness are reflected in individuals’ processes of biographical crisis when faced with ill health. Among the women in our study who did not identify as current injecting drug users, HCV diagnosis brought with it a process of “radical unmaking of their self-stories” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312469730">Krug, 1995</xref>, p. 313). Like many people in other studies of HCV, they found diagnosis to be a serious health concern and reported feeling fearful and stressed about health, relationships, and their mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312469730">Faye &amp; Irurita, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312469730">Glacken, Kernohan, &amp; Coates, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1049732312469730">Zickmund et al., 2003</xref>). In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312469730">Bury’s (1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312469730">2005</xref>) discussions of a disrupted biography, these women talked about being shocked and uncertain or lost. They isolated HCV as something that was frightening and foreign to their health and their sense of self. Identities were perhaps most dislocated among women who had injected drugs in the past. With diagnosis they learned that their blood contained a relic of past activities, and they were confronted by a distanced part of their self or a different identity (Krug). Biographies can be disrupted by the new explanations of self that come with illness, but also by reassessments of one’s past self and its connections to the current state of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049732312469730">Williams, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Certainly for most women in this study diagnosis with HCV was stressful and undesirable. However, those who injected drugs also expressed an expectation of infection and ambivalence toward it. They commonly viewed HCV as a predictable consequence of injecting drugs, or at least an unavoidable occurrence. This finding has been reflected in other literature, which suggests that HCV has become “normalized” among PWID because of its high prevalence within drug-using networks and the perceived lack of severity compared to other concerns, including HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312469730">Davis &amp; Rhodes, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732312469730">Rhodes &amp; Treloar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1049732312469730">Wozniak et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>These narratives of ambivalence toward disease diagnosis conflict with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312469730">Bury’s (1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312469730">2005</xref>) notions of biographical disruption, and more recently researchers in the field of chronic illness have suggested that diagnosis with illness can also reinforce conceptions of self-identity and personal biography. “Biographical reinforcement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312469730">Carricaburu &amp; Pierret, 1995</xref>, p. 65) has been noted among men living with HIV, for whom disease confirmed a particular identity. For those men who were hemophiliacs, the transition to HIV confirmed a lifetime of illness, whereas among gay men an HIV diagnosis reaffirmed a lifelong social struggle. Here, biographical theory is used to not only frame the impact of illness on one’s sense of self, but to provide insight into social connections and shared meanings, especially identity with a reference group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312469730">Harris, 2009</xref>). In the narratives of women who used drugs we can see not only an expectation that injecting behavior would lead to HCV infection but a belief that HCV infection was synonymous with the injecting-drug-user identity.</p>
<p>Our concern is that these narratives might be construed in such a way that PWID are depicted as careless and disinterested in their health. Thus, we stress that the stories of women who were injecting drugs focused on the health issues that mattered most to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312469730">Olsen et al., 2012</xref>). The presence of HCV in the body was, in general, accepted or assimilated within an unstable lifestyle and already distressing health problems. The need to control the HCV-infected body was not their foremost health priority, and their narratives usually expressed complex webs of vulnerability and marginalization, including desires to reduce or end drug use, care for children (including regaining custody), obtain/maintain stable housing and income, and cope with other physical and mental illnesses.</p>
<p>Participants’ narratives contextualized their experiences of health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312469730">Farmer, 1988</xref>), particularly the stressful daily living conditions that impacted on their well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312469730">Bibeau, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312469730">Maher, 2002</xref>). Other Australian researchers have also found that the social circumstances of many people living with HCV—particularly financial strain and problems with drugs—eclipse their concerns about HCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312469730">Copeland, 2004</xref>). The overbearing pressures of poverty can limit individuals’ abilities to avoid HCV and to prioritize HCV-related health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312469730">Australian Injecting and Illicit Drug Users League, 2004</xref>). Meeting basic housing and food needs was difficult for many of the PWID involved in this research, and thus should be considered important issues in the provision of health care and health promotion.</p>
<p>Disparities in health literacy and access to health care, as well as the role of socioeconomic status in disease incidence, are common themes in health inequalities research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312469730">Marmot, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312469730">Najman, 1993</xref>). For example, people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds living with a chronic disease are expected to have a different set of capacities to cope with illness (partly as a function of income, education, and work experience) compared to those from higher socioeconomic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049732312469730">Walker &amp; Peterson, 2003</xref>); disparities in the lived experience of illness, however, are less frequently explored. Little is known about how socioeconomic status or social inequality interacts with the experience of chronic illness (Walker &amp; Peterson), or with illness and identity beyond the classical “sick role” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312469730">Parsons, 1951</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been theorized that there are important class differences in the way people view and experience ill health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312469730">Cornwall, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312469730">Lupton, 1994</xref>), including how socioeconomic forces reproduce an identity which is, in part, “realized through or with the physical body” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312469730">Radley, 2008</xref>, p. 231). General beliefs about health and the degree to which individuals perceive control over their health are expressed in attitudes and behaviors (Cornwall; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312469730">Hardey, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1049732312469730">Williams, 1995</xref>). In Britain, researchers have found in the accounts of the working class a sense of fatalism about illness in which sickness is considered an inevitable aspect of their lives (Cornwall; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312469730">Pill &amp; Scott, 1985</xref>). Commonly held cultural beliefs and practices provide an overarching system of meanings within which to make sense of health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312469730">Mielck, Backett-Milburn, &amp; Pavis, 1998</xref>), and the acceptance of illness can be understood as an expected part of a hard working life. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312469730">Harris (2009)</xref>, the experience of HCV is commonly related to a number of factors, including previous experience of illness, marginalization, and hardship. Those who have already lived with bodily and/or social suffering might experience the diagnosis of HCV as identity reinforcement.</p>
<p>Recently, researchers have delved into the ways we construe expectations of health and experiences of illness by examining agency and control. Although life opportunities are central to control over health, individuals’ sense of control also bears on health outcomes. In addition to realistic notions about one’s situation in life, “cultural fields” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312469730">Davison, Smith, &amp; Frankel, 2008</xref>) such as moral issues of blame and responsibility also influence our health beliefs and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312469730">Bolam, Hodgetts, Chamberlain, Murphy, &amp; Gleeson, 2003</xref>). This sense of control, or its lack, is often reflected in fatalistic health statements in which people talk of luck, chance, and destiny. Fatalistic talk is more often noted among low-income and minority populations, and does not reflect disregard for health but is the result of an experience of a lack of control over health and life circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312469730">Keeley, Wright, &amp; Condit, 2009</xref>). Among the poorer women in our study, for example, many had experienced the deaths of several people close to them. These stressful experiences shaped their health narratives, in which HCV was described as an inevitable fate and a less frightening one than death (an ended biography) from other sequelae of their injecting drug use and marginalized lives.</p>
<p>Important health policy implications emerge from the more nuanced meanings attached to HCV by women who inject drugs. It is clear from our findings and the work of others that the biomedical construction of HCV as a serious cause of morbidity and mortality is reinterpreted and destabilized among PWID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312469730">Carrier, Laplante, &amp; Bruneau, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312469730">Davis &amp; Rhodes, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312469730">Harris, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732312469730">Rhodes &amp; Treloar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732312469730">Roy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1049732312469730">Wozniak et al., 2007</xref>). Not only did women realize that HCV was common among their peers, their identity as a PWID comprised positive HCV status.</p>
<p>Those involved in health policy and practice need to attend to the perceived uncontrollability of infection among PWID. If people identify with HCV as an inevitable part of using drugs, there is little likelihood that individuals or communities will absorb or adopt prevention messages. As others have suggested, there is a need to reinvigorate harm-reduction interventions that specifically address the issue of blood-borne virus transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312469730">Davis &amp; Rhodes, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312469730">Harris, 2009</xref>). For instance, widespread access to clean injecting equipment as well as improved pathways to HCV treatment should be provided for PWID who, despite the low expectations of many health care professionals, adhere well to the difficult regime of treatment for HCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312469730">Dalgard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312469730">Edlin et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>More broadly, research, policy, and public health practitioners need to take into account the lived experience of HCV infection for PWID, including how the embodiment of harmful social and economic forces impacts on well-being. Poverty, housing instability, poor education, low employment, and other aspects of social inequality dominated these women’s everyday existence, and were experienced as both material hardship and marginalization. Better pathways to social programs and improved integration of HCV treatment within social programs and public health strategies would better address the marginalization of PWID and the prevalence of HCV in this population.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article we have expanded on the findings of previous studies which suggest that the experience of HCV diagnosis is not uniformly disruptive, and that HCV infection has become “normalized” among PWID. In contrast to women who were not injecting drugs, positive HCV status was incorporated into the identities of women who injected drugs as a coherent aspect of their life trajectories. Integral to this shared acceptance of HCV were the stark realities of poverty and marginalization for many women who injected drugs, such that HCV concerns were surpassed by more immediate and fear-provoking issues. These findings were elucidated through the theoretical application of a biographical adaptation framework. Social and economic hardship, and marginalization as PWID, shaped key identities drawn on by women as they discussed health needs and concerns. These findings provide an important perspective on chronic illness theory—both the impacts of illness on identity and the ways identities shape our illness experience. Our conclusions also have implications for future responses to HCV health care provision, especially among PWID.</p>
