<p>This volume of insights from US scholars of leadership provides an interesting and eclectic addition to Edward Elgar’s New Horizons in Leadership Studies Series. Previous volumes in the series have been dedicated to more closely defined topics such as leadership’s relationship with capitalism, moral decision-making, democracy, dissent, the Russian view of leadership, and so on. In contrast, this volume explores leadership through various disciplinary lenses: classics (that is, ancient Greek and Roman culture and politics), philosophy, history, sociology (two chapters), psychology, management, education (two chapters), political science, literature and art. Each of these chapters does an excellent job of explaining how a particular discipline contributes to an understanding of leadership. As a spare-time painter, I was intrigued by the final chapter in this section: Anu M. Mitra’s ‘Learning how to look: The art of observation and leadership development’. This chapter shows how art and the practice of looking at and interpreting art works can teach us ‘to see comprehensively, accurately and contextually’. By learning to look at something as if for the first time, as da Vinci did, we can discover ‘how each of us is able to empower ourselves to express our full potential as leaders in our field of inquiry’.</p>
<p>The other discipline-based chapters are equally powerful. Each does an excellent job of explaining how a particular discipline contributes to knowledge of what leadership means. But there is more: we are reminded of how each discipline contributes more generally to knowledge. For example, J. Thomas Wren’s chapter: ‘The discipline of history and the understanding of leadership’, quotes Gaddis, who reminds us that the work of historians is ‘to interpret the past for the purpose of the present with a view to managing the future’. Since this is so, Gaddis says, ‘we might as well do so systematically’ and this is followed by an exposition of the five ‘Cs’ of historical analysis: change, causation, context, character and connections. Exploring leadership using the five ‘Cs’ becomes a lesson in seeing how the five ‘Cs’ help us understand a lot of other things. The ‘extra’ chapter that some disciplines receive brings the focus onto a more specific problem of the discipline (I could equally say a more specific problem of leadership: in each chapter the discipline and the issue of leadership become usefully entwined and mutually informative). For example, Stephen P. Turner’s chapter ‘Classic sociology: Weber as an analyst of charisma’, uses Weber’s work to explore an old issue of leadership: what charisma is, and how it works. I challenge any reader of this book not to be drawn into reading other chapters well beyond his or her own discipline.</p>
<p>The twelve chapters dedicated to specific disciplines are preceded by three introductory chapters. In the first of these we are presented with an argument for studying leadership in an interdisciplinary manner; in the second, a spirited case for leadership to be regarded as an academic discipline in its own right; and in the third, a case history of the efforts of faculty to set up a liberal arts programme in leadership studies at the University of Richmond. (The effort was eventually successful and the result was the Jepson School of Leadership Studies, from which four contributing authors are drawn. The challenges presented by establishing the course are described frankly and solutions are shared fully. The process in general will be recognized immediately by anyone who has attempted to set up a new University course of any kind. Establishing leadership programmes is itself a leadership task, it appears) These chapters lay out the territory in an inviting way, setting out some of the questions and topics to be taken up in the ‘discipline’ chapters.</p>
<p>Following the twelve ‘discipline’ chapters, there is a final, integrative chapter by Michael Harvey, which builds on the case made in the second introductory chapter for leadership itself to be regarded as an academic discipline. While the earlier ‘is leadership a discipline?’ chapter focuses on traditional modes of classifying a body of knowledge as having disciplinary standing, e.g., whether it has distinct ‘laws’, its own taxonomy and so on, this chapter approaches the issue from a different direction, taking leadership as a special, privileged form of inquiry. Groups and their leaders, it is argued, must answer seven questions: Who are we? Where are we? How are we doing? Where are we going? How will we get there? Why should we care? Do we understand? The explication of each question draws on all the disciplines and the chapter shows how they can be organized and understood in terms of a ‘leadership cycle’. While this is a highly insightful chapter, the path to it has already been prepared by the chapters devoted to separate disciplines, each of which shows the discipline’s value to understanding leadership as a form of inquiry.</p>
<p>The book has some limitations. It is somewhat US-centric, perhaps not surprisingly in view of the authors’ US affiliations. Some chapters tend to assume a considerable knowledge of US culture and politics, and the argument that ‘all universities should teach leadership’ examines only US universities. But at least there are acknowledgements of the need to consider other cultures and occasional references to non-Western literary traditions and historical events. My one practical gripe is that the book deserves a better topic index. It is disconcerting not to be able to find such important topics as leadership substitutes and self managing work teams in the index and then to run across excellent treatments of them in the book. The topic index appears to have been assembled from the headings and sub-headings of each chapter, but this does not do justice to the wealth of material in the book.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this is a fascinating volume with something to offer to every serious, or even occasional, scholar of leadership. These days we all claim to appreciate an interdisciplinary approach; this book really puts that idea to work.</p>
