<title>Objective</title>
<p>To systematically review the outcomes of bilateral versus unilateral bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHA) for individuals with bilateral permanent conductive hearing loss (CHL) with the goal of (1) deriving clinically oriented insights into the advantages and disadvantages of bilateral fitting and (2) identifying gaps in knowledge to stimulate future research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0194599812451569">
<title>Data Sources</title>
<p>Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for studies of all languages published between 1977 and July 2011.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0194599812451569">
<title>Review Methods</title>
<p>Studies were included if subjects of any age had permanent bilateral CHL and bilateral implanted BAHAs. Outcome measures of interest were any subjective or objective audiologic measures, quality of life indicators, or reports of adverse events.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0194599812451569">
<title>Results</title>
<p>In all, 628 abstracts were generated from the literature searches; 11 studies met the criteria for data extraction and analysis. All 11 studies were observational. In most studies, comparisons between unilateral and bilateral BAHA were intra-subject. Bilateral BAHA provided audiologic benefit compared to unilateral BAHA (improved thresholds for tones [2 studies], speech in quiet [5 studies] and in noise [3 studies], and improved localization/lateralization [3 studies]) and patients’ perceived subjective benefit from bilateral BAHA (3 studies). Disadvantages of bilateral BAHAs included listening in noise in some conditions (3 studies), presumed additional cost, and presumed increase in adverse event risk.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599812451569">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Bilateral BAHA provided additional objective and subjective benefit compared to unilateral BAHA; however, there was a limited number of studies available with good quality evidence. Aspects of bilateral BAHA that would benefit from further investigation are described, and recommendations for bilateral BAHA candidacy criteria are provided.</p>

<body>
<p>The purpose of this review was to consider original studies reporting on patients with bilateral permanent conductive hearing loss (CHL) and bilateral bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHA). This includes studies evaluating quality of life, patient reports of benefit, audiologic outcomes, and adverse events, with the purpose of deriving clinically oriented insights into the advantages and disadvantages of bilateral fitting. This study intends to aid clinicians who are considering bilateral BAHA implantation by providing an appraisal of the literature to date, as well as to identify gaps in knowledge in this area for the purpose of stimulating future research.</p>
<p>Brånemark first demonstrated in the 1950s that implanted titanium formed a strong connection with bone via a process that he termed <italic>osseointegration</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812451569">1</xref></sup> In 1977, Tjellström inserted titanium implants into the mastoid process of the temporal bone of 3 hearing-impaired patients who wore bone conduction hearing aids (BCHA) and provided them with a vibrator that attached to the percutaneous implant,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812451569">2</xref></sup> marking the first trial of the bone-anchored hearing aid.</p>
<p>The current BAHA consists of a titanium screw, percutaneous abutment, and sound processor/bone conductor that attaches to the abutment. A BAHA can compensate for any degree of air-bone gap; additionally, it can provide gain for a limited range of cochlear (ie, sensorineural) hearing loss. The BAHA is well suited to patients with significant conductive hearing losses and to patients who are unable to wear air conduction hearing aids (ACHA). Audiologic indications for the BAHA include bilateral permanent (or chronic) conductive hearing loss and, more recently, single-sided deafness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812451569">3</xref></sup> Mixed hearing losses may also be aided by the BAHA, but there is a limit to the degree of cochlear loss that can be adequately fit. There is currently little research consistently demonstrating a significant audiometric benefit of BAHA for unilateral permanent conductive hearing loss, although patients may report improved quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812451569">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bilateral fitting of the BAHA in patients with bilateral permanent conductive hearing loss is somewhat contentious, since both cochleae receive stimulation with application of a single bone conduction transducer. However, bone conduction interaural attenuation, although typically assumed to be negligible for the purposes of audiologic assessment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812451569">5</xref></sup> is not always zero, especially at higher frequencies. Transcranial attenuation of bone conduction stimuli is between −5 decibels (dB) and +20 dB between 250 and 10,000 Hz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812451569">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812451569"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812451569">8</xref></sup>; inter-subject variation is quite large.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812451569">6</xref></sup> The cochleae therefore cannot be assumed to be receiving equal stimulation from unilateral bone-conducted stimuli. With 2 bone- conduction transducers, subjects with bilateral congenital aural atresia can detect interaural time differences (ITD) and interaural intensity differences (IID),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812451569">9</xref></sup> demonstrating that binaural hearing can be achieved via bone conduction.</p>
<p>Bilateral implantation of BAHA also overcomes the head-shadow effect for sounds directed to the non implanted ear and reduces the period of disability associated with postsurgical implant complications because it allows patients to continue to have access to 1 BAHA when there is equipment or implant malfunction in the other.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812451569">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>While bilateral BAHA appears to have potential for additional benefit above unilateral fitting, a second BAHA comes with the risks of adverse events associated with surgery, as well as significant additional cost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812451569">11</xref></sup> It is currently unclear whether the potential for benefit outweighs these potential risks. In light of this, we performed a systematic literature review to answer the following question: What is the evidence for bilateral versus unilateral implantation of the BAHA in individuals with bilateral permanent conductive hearing loss?</p>

<title>Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) Research Question</title>
<p>The authors formulated the research question for this study as follows: population: individuals with bilateral permanent conductive hearing loss; intervention: bilateral implanted BAHA; comparison: bilateral implanted versus unilateral implanted BAHA; outcomes: subjective and objective audiologic measures, quality of life measures, and adverse outcomes and events.</p>

<sec id="section8-0194599812451569">
<title>Literature Search Strategy</title>
<p>The following databases were searched: EMBASE (1980 to July 2011), MEDLINE (1977 to July 2011), and Evidence Based Medicine Reviews (1977 to July 2011), using a comprehensive search strategy including the following terms: “bone-anchored hearing aid,” “bone-anchored hearing system,” “BAHA,” “BAHS,” and “BAHA implant” (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812451569"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). Titles and abstracts were obtained for all studies identified by the search strategy.</p>

</fig>
<p>The bibliographies of those studies obtained in full text were hand-searched for any additional relevant studies not identified by the original database search.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0194599812451569">
<title>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</title>
<p>Studies were included if subjects of any age had permanent bilateral conductive hearing loss and received bilateral implanted (percutaneous) BAHAs. Studies from before 1977 were excluded, as the first percutaneous BAHAs were implanted in that year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812451569">12</xref></sup> Studies were required to meet criteria for level 4 evidence or above, as defined by the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812451569">13</xref></sup> which included case series, case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized control trials. Outcome measures of interest were any subjective or objective audiologic measures, quality of life indicators, or reports of adverse events or outcomes. Papers of all languages were included. Duplicate studies were excluded.</p>
<p>Two authors independently reviewed the list of titles and abstracts generated by the literature search for any studies that met the aforementioned criteria, involving the third author when there were conflicts. Full text was obtained for the list of selections. The full-text studies were further evaluated against the inclusion criteria by 2 authors, again involving the third author when there were conflicts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0194599812451569">
<title>Data Extraction and Analysis</title>
<p>Data were extracted from the studies meeting criteria for inclusion. The following data were extracted: study design, level of evidence, number of subjects, description of subjects (age, gender, hearing loss history and etiology, amplification history), description of intervention (time between first and second BAHA, length of experience with bilateral BAHA), and outcome measures. For quantitative outcome measures, mean values, standard deviations, confidence intervals, and/or <italic>P</italic> values were recorded; data were synthesized into tables when methodologies were similar enough to allow it. Authors were contacted to obtain further unpublished data. For qualitative outcome measures, a formal qualitative analysis using thematic coding was conducted.</p>
<p>The authors assessed the quality of the studies with the use of a Quality Assessment Score out of 7 possible points comprised of the following characteristics: (1) inclusion/exclusion criteria clearly stated (yes = 1, no = 0); (2) assessment method validated (yes = 1, no = 0); (3) appropriate comparison group (intra-subject or control group = 1; none or not discussed = 0); (4) observers blinded to condition (yes = 1, no = 0); (5) adequate sample size/power analysis (yes = 1, no = 0); (6) well-defined, consecutive sample (yes = 1, no = 0); and (7) less than 5% lost to follow-up (yes = 1, no or not provided = 0).</p>

<title>Study Selection</title>
<p>A total of 628 abstracts were generated from the database and bibliography searches. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812451569"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref> shows the flow diagram of the search and exclusion process (adapted from Moher et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812451569">14</xref></sup>). A total of 28 studies met the criteria for full-text review; the 600 rejected abstracts were eliminated either because they did not discuss BAHAs, or for those that did, they did not include any subjects with bilateral BAHAs (the vast majority). After this review, 11 studies met criteria for data extraction and analysis; 17 were excluded (see Appendix A for reasons for exclusion at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.otojournal.org">www.otojournal.org</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Study Characteristics</title>
<p>Of the 11 studies that were included for data extraction and analysis, all were observational in nature. Three of the studies provided subjective outcomes (patient questionnaires), 6 provided audiometric outcomes, and 2 provided both audiometric and subjective outcomes of bilateral BAHAs. There were a total of 168 subjects in the 11 studies, 155 of whom had BAHAs and 146 of whom had bilateral BAHAs. Subjects ranged from 5 to 83 years of age; 46% were male, and 54% were female. Sixty subjects had received bilateral BAHAs as children, and the other 108 as adults. There were no articles meeting criteria for inclusion that provided specific reports of adverse events or cost of bilateral BAHA implantation. Heterogeneity of the methodologies precluded meta-analysis. Study characteristics are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812451569"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>.</p>

<title>Bilateral BAHA usage and listening preferences</title>
<p>Dun et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599812451569">24</xref></sup> found that 90% of the children in their study were using both BAHAs 7 days a week. The other 10% of subjects used the BAHAs 5 or 6 days a week for the majority of waking hours. Subjects tended to switch both BAHAs off when there was background noise, or when there was a risk of damage to the devices, such as with sports or bathing. Subjects tended to use only one BAHA when one of the sites was infected, if there was noise, or in situations when the sound of interest was coming from one side, such as when making a phone call, or listening to people on one side.</p>
<p>Dutt et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812451569">22</xref></sup> evaluated BAHA usage with the Chung and Stephens questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0194599812451569">28</xref></sup> in 11 adults. All subjects used both aids for 8 to 12 hours or more every day, 7 days a week. For listening to speech in quiet, most preferred 2 aids to 1. Subjects tended to use both BAHAs when listening to multimedia devices (radio, television, records) and at social/entertainment events such as meetings, church, cinema, and the theatre. Three subjects preferred one BAHA for listening in noisy surroundings, while the other 8 preferred both. The majority found that the use of both BAHAs allowed for localization of sounds, while 2 patients did not find any difference between 1 and 2 aids.</p>
<p>Snik et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812451569">17</xref></sup> reported that their 3 subjects rated bilateral BAHA higher than unilateral BAHA on questionnaire items relating to speech perception in quiet and noise, with the exception of 1 patient who found there to be no difference between unilateral and bilateral BAHA with listening to speech in noise.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A systematic review of bilateral BAHAs for bilateral permanent conductive hearing loss was carried out; 11 studies met criteria for full review and data extraction and analysis. All of the included studies were observational in nature. In most of the studies, comparisons of unilateral and bilateral BAHA were intra-subject.</p>
<sec id="section20-0194599812451569">
<title>Audiologic Outcomes</title>
<p>Bilateral BAHA was shown to confer an advantage to listening to tonal stimuli and speech in quiet and in noise compared to unilateral BAHA. The exception was for listening to speech in noise with noise directed to the unaided ear in the unilateral condition; subjects with unilateral BAHA benefitted from the head shadow effect when the noise was directed at the unaided ear. By providing amplification with a second BAHA, this advantage was lost.</p>
<p>The bilateral BAHA condition was also shown to improve localization and lateralization, although it is difficult to appreciate the magnitude of this effect given that only Priwin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812451569">20</xref></sup> compared the hearing-impaired subjects with a normal-hearing control group. The ability to localize low frequencies, such as 500 Hz, relies on the auditory system’s ability to make use of interaural time differences (ITDs) resulting from the difference in wave phases between the ears when the origin of sound is off zero (or 180) degrees with respect to the head.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0194599812451569">29</xref></sup> For higher frequencies, such as 2000 Hz, the auditory system makes use of interaural intensity differences (IIDs) that result from the head shadow effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0194599812451569">29</xref></sup> The ability to localize both 500 and 2000 Hz-centered noise bursts in the studies described previously indicates that bilateral BAHAs provide access to both binaural cues and that patients are able to make use of them. Additionally, some of the subjects in the studies were adults with congenital aural atresia who, before the BAHAs, wore a single bone conduction hearing aid; binaural hearing therefore seems to be possible even after a lengthy amplification history of a single bone conduction device well into adulthood.</p>
<p>The BMLD test involves signal detection in masking noise, in which a change in phase in either the signal or the noise between ears results in a change in the threshold of detection for the signal. Subjects achieve a release of masking—namely, are able to detect the signal in a lower (worse) signal to noise ratio—when the noise or signal is out of phase between ears, an effect that is larger for low frequencies, and when the phase difference is 180°or π radians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0194599812451569">30</xref></sup> The BMLD is believed to reflect binaural processing of interaural time differences, which also have a role in localization of low frequency sounds, as discussed previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0194599812451569">29</xref></sup> Clinically, the test is performed using air conduction stimuli at 500 Hz under headphones, where the release of masking in normal subjects is between 10 and 11 dB ±2dB with a delivery sound pressure level of 80 dB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0194599812451569">31</xref></sup> The criterion value for a significant BMLD with air conduction stimuli is 7 dB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0194599812451569">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the BMLDs reached statistical significance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812451569">18</xref></sup> the size of the BMLDs was smaller than is expected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0194599812451569">31</xref></sup> Bosman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812451569">18</xref></sup> attribute the decreased magnitude of the BMLD outcome of their study to the effects of cross-hearing with bone conduction stimuli. They point out that while the degree of release of masking appears to be more limited with bone conduction, 6 dB is likely sufficient for the perception of binaural cues.</p>
<p>It is unclear why the results of Bosman et al were significant and not those of Priwin et al; perhaps this is the effect of the degree of sensorineural hearing loss, which has been shown to decrease the magnitude of the BMLD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0194599812451569">31</xref></sup> Subjects in the Bosman et al study had normal bone conduction thresholds at 500 and 1000 Hz on average; Priwin et al report that 9 of the 12 subjects had mixed hearing loss, although the average thresholds at 500 and 1000 Hz were not reported.</p>
<p>Six of the subjects in the Bosman et al study were adults with congenital aural atresia with a lengthy history of using a single bone conduction device, again showing that binaural hearing appears to be possible even after a lengthy amplification history of a single bone conduction device.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0194599812451569">
<title>Subjective Outcomes</title>
<p>Positive results were found on all items in both studies utilizing the Glasgow Benefit Inventory. Results therefore indicated that children and adults with a wide variety of hearing and amplification experiences perceived additional benefit from bilateral BAHA implantation.</p>
<p>Results of bilateral BAHA usage indicate that for the vast majority of children and adults with bilateral BAHAs, patients were very satisfied with their devices and wore both aids most of the time. The subjective reports of the listening conditions in which bilateral BAHA provided an advantage over a single BAHA compared favorably with the audiologic findings of bilateral BAHA benefit. As discussed previously, thresholds for speech and tones in quiet and localization are improved with bilateral BAHA; this is consistent with patient reports of improved localization with bilateral BAHA, and preference for bilateral BAHA when listening in quiet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812451569">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599812451569">24</xref></sup> Bilateral BAHA also performed better than unilateral BAHA in noise, although not when noise was directed to the shadow ear; noise was the reason for turning off one BAHA for 2 children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599812451569">24</xref></sup> and in 3 of 11 adult subjects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812451569">22</xref></sup> perhaps reflecting the advantage of having a shadow side with a unilateral BAHA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0194599812451569">
<title>Adverse Events</title>
<p>Adverse events were not an outcome measure of any of the included studies. Therefore, a qualitative review of the BAHA literature was conducted to obtain an estimation of complication rates associated with BAHA implantation.</p>
<p>Intra- and peri-operative complications of BAHA surgery are fairly rare: In one review of 149 consecutive patients, there were none<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0194599812451569">32</xref></sup>; in another review of 177 implantations, the only intra-operative complication was bleeding, which occurred in 3% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0194599812451569">33</xref></sup> Hobson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0194599812451569">34</xref></sup> reported one case of post-anesthesic laryngospasm requiring tracheostomy in an individual with Treacher Collins syndrome; otherwise, there were no serious complications of BAHA surgery in 602 patients.</p>
<p>Postoperative complications, such as skin overgrowth and skin reactions to the implant, are more common. In a recent review of the literature, Wazen et al list the soft tissue complication rates of several recent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0194599812451569">35</xref></sup>: 9.4% of 149 implants,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0194599812451569">32</xref></sup> 13% of 223 implants,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0194599812451569">36</xref></sup> 12.3% of 248 implants,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0194599812451569">37</xref></sup> 15.3% of 248 implants,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0194599812451569">38</xref></sup> and 18.1% of 602 implants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0194599812451569">34</xref></sup> Hobson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0194599812451569">34</xref></sup> report an overall complication rate of 23.9%, the majority of which were skin infections and soft tissue overgrowth; their revision surgery rate was 12.1% in 602 patients.</p>
<p>The results of these studies would suggest that patients undergoing surgery for a single BAHA can expect a fairly high likelihood of minor complications, which may require surgical management. While none of the studies discussed previously include results for bilateral BAHA implantation, it is reasonable to assume that patients who are considering two BAHAs are more likely to encounter minor complications than those receiving just one.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0194599812451569">
<title>Cost Considerations</title>
<p>None of the articles that met criteria for inclusion in this review reported on the cost of the BAHA. Recently, Colquitt et al conducted a systematic review in which they evaluated the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of BAHA for individuals with bilateral hearing loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812451569">11</xref></sup> They estimated the cost per case to be £17,514 for children and £14,533 for adults for implantation of a single device. The estimated cost of bilateral implantation was not provided but is obviously greater still. A complete analysis of a comparison between the cost of bilateral versus unilateral implantation should also take into consideration potential economic advantages that may result from the additional benefit that bilateral BAHA confers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0194599812451569">
<title>Limitations of this Systematic Review</title>
<p>A total of 11 studies met the criteria for inclusion in this review. However, some results from 3 of the earlier studies were excluded because their subjects were also included in later, larger studies. The data discussed in this review therefore come from a small set of studies originating from a select set of BAHA centers.</p>
<p>Another limitation of this review results from the bias in selection of subjects receiving a second BAHA, especially in the earlier days of bilateral BAHA implantation. In their earlier studies, the Birmingham program lists their criteria for implantation of a second BAHA as follows: symmetrical bone thresholds (pure tone averages within 15 dB HL), previous experience with binaural hearing, professional needs (businessmen, teachers, and nurses), and an appropriate level of motivation (patients requested the second BAHA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812451569">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812451569">22</xref></sup> Bosman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812451569">18</xref></sup> note that the first set of patients included in their study were chosen with relatively strict criteria with respect to the symmetry of bone conduction thresholds, with bone conduction pure-tone averages not differing more than 10 dB and individual thresholds not differing more than 15 dB between cochleae. These narrow criteria likely helped to maximize the benefit that could be obtained from a second BAHA, and therefore likely resulted in a positive selection bias.</p>
<p>Four of the studies had fewer than 10 subjects with bilateral BAHAs; an additional 4 studies had 11 or 12 subjects with bilateral BAHAs. Authors were unable to provide statistical significance of some measures given such small numbers. We attempted to synthesize data from multiple studies to improve the statistical power; heterogeneity of the methodologies precluded meta-analysis.</p>
<p>There were 5 studies that evaluated bilateral BAHA via questionnaire. All of the questionnaires either asked subjects to compare bilateral and unilateral BAHA retrospectively or evaluated bilateral BAHA at one point in time post-implantation with no direct comparison to unilateral BAHA. Ideally, for comparison of unilateral and bilateral BAHA, the questionnaire study should have been carried out prospectively, with assessments at a predetermined interval post-unilateral and bilateral implantation. Subjects varied greatly as to how much time had elapsed after their second BAHA. Also, there was likely some degree of enthusiasm bias; for example, subjects in one study rated the quality of life improvement as greater with the second BAHA than the first<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812451569">22</xref></sup>; one would expect that the greatest change in quality of life would be with the first BAHA, assuming that the patients were previously aided with BCHAs.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Recommendations</title>
<p>The findings of this study can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Advantages and disadvantages of bilateral BAHA compared to unilateral BAHA:</p>
<list id="list1-0194599812451569" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Improved hearing sensitivity in quiet</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Improved speech perception in quiet</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Improved localization/lateralization</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Improvement in patient perception of quality of life and sound quality</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Some patients experienced a deterioration of understanding speech in noise with bilateral BAHA due to loss of the head-shadow advantage for noise to the shadow ear. Patients should be counseled that they may experience difficulty understanding speech when in noisy environments; turning off the BAHA that faces the noise (when signal and noise sources are separated) may be of benefit.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Currently, there is no evidence available for comparison of the financial costs and risk of adverse events of bilateral versus unilateral BAHA.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>It is important to note that subjects varied in age, hearing loss etiology, and previous amplification experience. This shows that benefit from bilateral BAHA does not appear to be greatly limited by any of these variables. However, in some studies, patients were chosen to receive a second BAHA because they met certain criteria (eg, professional needs, symmetric bone thresholds), as discussed previously. For prospective patients who do not meet these criteria, predictions of success cannot be made with confidence.</p>
<p>This review has identified the limited number of studies existing with good quality evidence comparing bilateral and unilateral BAHA. Many of the studies were small and consequently lacked statistical power. Results of some studies had to be excluded from synthesis because their subjects had been included in multiple publications. Additionally, there were few studies that evaluated outcomes of bilateral BAHA implantation in pediatric subjects.</p>
<p>In conducting this review, the authors have identified some aspects of bilateral BAHA outcomes that would benefit from further investigation. Suggested future research questions include the following:</p>
<list id="list2-0194599812451569" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What are the predictors of success with bilateral BAHA? Variables to consider include bone conduction threshold symmetry, age, degree of sensorineural hearing loss, previous binaural listening experience, measures of cognition, motivation, and professional/social requirements.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is there a difference in outcome with sequential compared to simultaneous implantation of bilateral BAHA?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is there a release of masking with the BMLD with bilateral BAHA? If so, what is the effect of bone conduction threshold symmetry, degree of sensorineural hearing loss, or previous binaural listening experience on the release of masking?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What is the rate of adverse outcomes in patients undergoing bilateral BAHA implantation compared to unilateral BAHA implantation?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are the outcomes of bilateral BAHA implantation in children? What are the predictors of success in pediatric patients?</p></list-item></list>
<p>Based on the evidence reviewed in this study, the authors suggest the following recommendations for candidacy criteria for consideration of bilateral BAHA:</p>
<list id="list3-0194599812451569" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Age: any</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Hearing loss: reasonable symmetry between intra-aural bone conduction thresholds; if bone thresholds are quite asymmetric, then bilateral BAHA will likely not confer advantages associated with binaural hearing, such as localization and improved speech perception in noise; however, patients may still benefit from reduction of the head shadow effect</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Etiology of hearing loss: any</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Binaural hearing experience: any.</p></list-item>
