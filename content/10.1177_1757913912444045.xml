<p>Some have argued that there are few topics in the field of health promotion and public health which have engendered as much polemic as that of evidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913912444045">1</xref></sup> In the last two decades there has been innumerable debates amongst the public health academic and practice communities, some of them polarised, covering a wide range of issues linked to evidence based (or evidence informed) practice. One of these debates centres on two linked questions; what counts as evidence and what methods are appropriate in measuring intervention effectiveness?</p>
<p>The evidence based practice enthusiasts highlight the necessity to extract evidence using a positivist orientation and positivistic empirical strategies. This position has resulted in the most serious divergence of views. Public health opponents to the evidence based movement argue that its narrow epistemological assumptions are not appropriate for understanding and measuring interventions targeting the wider determinant of health and that evidence based guidelines to practice are insufficient to deal with the complexity of multi- faceted approaches such as empowerment and participatory community development. Both opponents and proponents of evidence based practice in the social and health improvement field draw on the epistemological, the methodological and the ethical arguments to sustain their point of view.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913912444045">2</xref></sup> The polarisation remains and evidence based practice in these professional fields continues to be contested and fraught with difficulties. As the public health landscape is about to change significantly, this is an apt moment to revisit this subject. The collection of opinion pieces and articles that make up this issue cover a wide range of important evidenced related matters, all of which are crucial as we enter a period where economic expediency is resulting in evidence based practice becoming more paramount.</p>
<p>There are two opinion pieces and a paper which examine the means by which evidence is generated. The first one explores the Global Programme on Health Promotion Effectiveness (GPHE) which for over a decade has been the International Union of Health Promotion and Health Education (IUHPE) flagship programme on evidence based practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913912444045">3</xref></sup> An interesting point to note here is that from the beginning of the GPHE a distinction was made between the notions of evidence and of effectiveness. A key argument is that the real world complexities encountered in health promotion interventions are not able to withstand the rigors of evidence in a scientific sense. Effectiveness on the other hand, is about understanding change, as opposed to the description of causation itself. The fundamental premise here is that some areas of health promotion are difficult to discuss in terms of evidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913912444045">3</xref></sup> The second, an opinion piece on page 111, agrees to some extent with this view. Exploring the issue under methodological challenges, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) regards the public health evidence base as requiring a very broad and methodologically diverse approach and new ways of thinking about the quality of evidence beyond the usual hierarchy. A notable piece of NICE evidence is that when it comes to cost effectiveness, an enduring NICE finding is that public health activity is very good value for money. The importance of cost benefit is addressed in another opinion piece on page 109, where it is argued that in our current environment of economic expediency and radical funding changes, rigorous evaluation of interventions in public health practice is crucial in evidencing effectiveness.</p>
<p>There are three papers which present evidence and evidence based methodologies that are being used to directly inform policy, practice and research. The Cochrane systematic review on universal alcohol misuse programme for children and adolescent demonstrates the importance of the Cochrane collaboration and of systematic review methodology to gathering evidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913912444045">4</xref></sup> Another technique is to draw evidence directly from practice. The challenges of moving beyond practice based research towards building a progressive body of practice based evidence is considered in the context of the creative arts as a public health resource.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757913912444045">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, one area which is often neglected is around evidence that can be used in deciding who should be targeted for professional development. This is discussed alongside issues about training a diverse public health workforce in using evidence to reduce children’s exposure to second hand smoke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757913912444045">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are many important themes that emerge from this special issue. It is clear that evidence based practice is an essential approach for all professionals working to improve health, but that there are certain challenges to this way of working, including the thorny issue of the nature and quality of evidence. The need for resources to develop an evidence base is fundamental and at a time of economic expediency, a lack of resources might prove an obstacle to both generating the evidence and also to translating it into practice. As we move into a new era for public health, evidence of effectiveness will undoubtedly be a core element in funding decisions at all levels, including within voluntary and community organizations (p 113). It will be vital that those in charge of commissioning services take account of some of the complexities highlighted in this issue.</p>
