<abstract>
<p>Biomimetic gelatin (gel)–hydroxyapatite (HA) composites have been prepared for studying hard tissue engineering scaffolds. However, the biocompatibility test of this form of material using these three cell types, which are periodontal ligament (PDL) fibroblast cells, human mesenchymal stromal cells (HMSc) and primary cells from human hip bone (HBc) has never been evaluated. The objective of this article is to prepare and evaluate the biocompatibility of gel–HA crosslinked scaffold for tissue engineering. Two different scaffolds were prepared: preparation (1), 2.5% gel/2.5% HA; preparation (2), 2.5% gel/5% HA. Three cell types including PDL, HMSc, and HBc were used. Assessment of biocompatibility and osteoblastic cellular responses was evaluated using a three-dimensional cell culture method and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). From SEM, it was observed that scaffold (1) exhibits stable porous formation with well-blended and dispersed HA powder. All three cell types were able to proliferate in both scaffolds. The HMSc and HBc got attached to the scaffolds to a significantly higher degree and subsequently proliferated more than PDL. The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities of HMSc and HBc were stronger when cultured in scaffold (S1) than (S2). It was seen that the two scaffold preparations show good biocompatibility with all three cell types tested. The better cellular responses with scaffold (S1) than (S2) might be due to the different structural and morphological characteristics, that is, scaffold (S1) retained more small-sized apatite crystals and a better developed pore configuration than scaffold (S2). Based on these findings, the biomimetically synthesized composite scaffolds have the potential to be used in hard tissue regeneration and tissue engineering fields.</p>

<p>In the era of tissue regeneration and stem cell rehabilitation, increasing demands for the use of artificial materials in the biomedical field are addressed. These may be due to many factors such as the limited accessibility of autografts and rejection associated with allografts. There are many researches focused on the biomimetic synthetic scaffolds, such as biodegradable polymers and bioactive ceramics. These materials have been developed to sustain the wound site and subsequently regenerate new tissues and have proven to be applicable clinically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328210391920">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328210391920">5</xref></sup> In hard tissue applications, a variety of systems have been developed to mimic the specifically organized nanoscale structure of the bone, which consists of collageneous fibers and mineralized apatite nanocrystals. The composites of apatite crystals and natural polymers have been the focus of interest because they can provide the compositional benefits including preservation of the structural and biological functions of the damaged hard tissues and provide properties, which were similar to the natural system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328210391920">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328210391920">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328210391920">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Gelatin, a denatured form of collagen, is expected to be beneficial for hard tissue applications, because it contains a high degree of biological functional groups, and has some potential for applications in tissue scaffolds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328210391920">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328210391920">13</xref></sup> Gelatin is currently used in pharmaceuticals, wound dressings, and adhesives in clinics due to its well biocompatibility, lack of antigenicity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328210391920">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328210391920">13</xref></sup> sufficient plasticity, and hydrogel properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328210391920">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328210391920">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328210391920">14</xref></sup> However, the mechanical properties of gelatin are not satisfactory for hard tissue applications.</p>
<p>Hydroxyapatite (HA) ceramic, being similar to bone mineral in physicochemical properties, is well known for its bioactivity and osteoconductivity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328210391920">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328210391920">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328210391920">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328210391920">16</xref></sup> However, HA is difficult to handle and maintain in the defect sites because of its brittleness and low plasticity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328210391920">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328210391920">18</xref></sup> A composite approach of combining two components, gelatin and HA, has the potential to be an engineered biomaterial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328210391920">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328210391920">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328210391920">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328210391920">25</xref></sup> Thus, the composite design of gelatin and HA is expected to offer improved properties of the scaffold from both biological and mechanical viewpoints. Traditionally, the HA–polymer composites have been produced by dispersing HA powders in the polymer solution. However, the HA powders did not disperse well in the polymer solution or were easily agglomerated, and even settled, which made it difficult to form a controlled structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328210391920">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328210391920">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this study was first to prepare the two preparations of the gel–HA scaffold and assess the biocompatibility of the gel–HA composite with three various cell types, which are human periodontal ligament (PDL) fibroblasts, human mesenchymal stromal cells (HMSc), and primary cells from human hip bone (HBc) in terms of the cellular cytotoxicity, cell attachment, cell proliferation, and osteoblastic cellular responses. In addition, the morphological porous formation of the gel–HA composite scaffolds was addressed.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0885328210391920"><title>Fabrication of gelatin–HA composite scaffolds</title>
<p>The gel–HA composite scaffolds were fabricated by the co-precipitation of HA (011-14882 Apatite HAP, Monoclinic, Wako, Japan) within gelatin solution followed by freeze-drying technique. In this experiment, we prepared the composite scaffolds based on our previous studies which focused on the optimal mixtures between gelatin and HA that can form the best physical and mechanical scaffolds. We fixed the viscous sol, gelatin (Type HMG-BP (10 g), Nippi Gelatin, Japan) into 2.5% (w/w) and varied the two concentrations of HA, which are (S1) 2.5% (w/w) and (S2) 5.0% (w/w). The gelatin sol was prepared in distilled water at 60°C, separately. Solutions of the two concentrations of HA were mixed separately and slowly into gelatin sol at 25°C, then vortexed for 3 min, and deep frozen immediately at −40°C overnight. The HA contents with respect to gelatin and HA were varied at 2.5 and 5.0 wt%. The mixtures of gel–HA were freeze-dried for 8 h. The dried scaffolds were crosslinked in the heat oven at 160°C for 6 h (protocol recommended by the Nippi company).</p>

<sec id="sec4-0885328210391920"><title>Characterization</title>
<p>Comparison of pore structure morphology between the two ingredients of gel–HA was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JSM 5410LV, JEOL, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV after carbon coating.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0885328210391920"><title>Cell culturing</title>
<p>Human PDL fibroblasts, HMSc, and primary cells from HBc were used to assess the cellular responses to the two preparations of the composite scaffolds.</p>
<p>Human PDL fibroblasts were prepared from the explants obtained from non-carious, freshly extracted third molars, or teeth removed for orthodontic reason with informed consent. Briefly, after washing the tooth several times with sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS), the PDL was scraped from the middle third of the root using sterile surgical blade. The tissues were washed again with sterile PBS, cut into small pieces, and plated into 60-mm tissue cultured plates (Nunc, Napervile, IL, USA). Cells from the third to eighth passages were used in this study.</p>
<p>HMSc sponsored by Lonza, Walkersville, USA and HBc sponsored by Dr Weerachai Singhatanadgit) were obtained. Briefly, these primary cells were harvested from the donor's hip bone who obtained bone graft surgery for alveolar ridge augmentation after informed consent. These two kinds of cell were grown in α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM). PDL cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM). All the media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (10% FCS–α-MEM or 10% FCS–DMEM), 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. The cultures were maintained at 37°C in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Media and the supplements were obtained from Gibco BRL (Carlsbad, CA, USA).</p>
<sec id="sec6-0885328210391920"><title>Three-dimensional culture</title>
<p>This method was modified from Zandi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328210391920">27</xref></sup> In brief, the scaffolds were cut into small pieces of approximately 5 × 5 × 5 mm<sup>3</sup>. For each type of the scaffold, three pieces were used; one for SEM study and the other two for MTT assay. The scaffolds were put in a 6-well plate. HMSc, HBc, and PDL were trypsinized, resuspended at 80,000 cells in 100 µL of the media, and put on top of the scaffolds. The cultures were then pre-incubated at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 1 h to allow the droplet of media with cells, to penetrate the scaffolds. Then, the cultures were provided with 1 mL per well of the media with 10% FCS. In a control group, we used the scaffold that was coated with the same density of cells and incubated overnight while, in our studied group, we incubated for 5 days. After that period, photographs were taken and the scaffolds were removed by forceps for further analysis.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0885328210391920"><title>Cellular responses (proliferation, osteoblastic activity, and attachment)</title>
<p>After culturing at each condition for 5 days, the scaffolds were removed and washed with PBS three times, and the viable cells attached to the scaffolds and the cell proliferation were analyzed by MTT assay. Briefly, the scaffolds were removed from a 6-well plate, washed with PBS, and transferred to a new 96-well plate containing 200 µL of 5:1 ratio of media and MTT solution (5 mg/mL). The culture was incubated at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, for a time of 1 h for PDL or 2 h for HMSc and HBc. The scaffolds were then transferred to a new well containing 200 µL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and pipetting up and down several times to allow total color release. The absorption was read at 550 nm. One-way ANOVA–Scheffe statistical analysis was performed.</p>
<p>The functional or osteoblastic activity of the cells on the scaffolds was assessed by measuring the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expressed by the cells after culturing for 14 days. Briefly, the scaffolds were cut into approximately sized 5 × 5 × 1 mm<sup>3</sup>. The cells (HMSc and HBc) were trypsinized and resuspended to a density of 1,400,000 cells/mL of 10% FCS–α-MEM. Fifty microliters of cell suspension (70,000 cells) were gently dropped onto the top of the scaffold. The cells were let to be slowly absorbed into the scaffold for 15 min; then, 500 µL of 10% FCS–α-MEM was added in each well. After 48 h, media were changed to 2.5% FCS–α-MEM with 5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 250 nM of dexamethasone in ethanol, and 50 µg/mL ascorbic acid (osteogenic media). Cells were cultured for 14 days with osteodenic media changed every 2 days. The experiment was done in triplicate. At the end of the experiment, the medium was removed. The cells and the scaffold were washed three times with PBS and then fixed with 70% ethanol for 10 min. Five hundred microliters of BCIP/NBT ALP substrate (Sigma, USA) were added to each well. Photographs were taken to evaluate their ALP expressions on the scaffolds.</p>
<p>The cell attachment and morphology were observed with SEM after fixing the cells with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and dehydrating them in a series of graded ethanols (70%, 90%, and 100%), followed by treating with a hexamethyl disilazane solution twice for 10 min each.</p>

<p>The structure of the two preparations, which are (S1) 2.5% gel/2.5% HA and (S2) 2.5% gel/5% HA composite scaffolds were observed.

<p>The SEM micrographs of cross-sectional patterns of the composite scaffolds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328210391920">Figure 1</xref>) showed that S1 composite formed a well-developed micropore structure with pore size diameter of ∼100–200 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328210391920">Figure 1</xref>(A1) and (A2)).

Moreover, the surface of the porous formation in S1 appeared to be rough, which resulted from the formation of HA crystals throughout the gelatin matrix.

<p>The cell proliferation was analyzed by MTT assay. Among these three cell types, there was no toxicity effect and all three cell types can be grown well in both preparations of composite scaffolds. From the PDL fibroblast cells and HBC cultures, there was the statistically significant difference between the control group and (S1) and (S2) at <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01.

<p>To assess the osteoblastic activity of the cultured cells, the ALP expression was observed after culturing the cells with the composite scaffolds for 14 days. Both HMSc and HBc exhibited stronger ALP levels on the composite scaffold (S1) than (S2).</p>

<p>The biomaterials used for tissue regeneration are now widely established to complete the maximum goals of the clinical treatments. A novel gelatin crosslinked with HA composite has now been developed for the use as scaffolds for bone regeneration.

<p>Recently, several types of biomaterials, which have a variety of porous structures, have been reported to be efficient as scaffold for bone regeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328210391920">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328210391920">17</xref></sup> The gelatin–HA, as one of the organic–inorganic biological composites, was produced in this study to examine its potential for extended applications in hard tissue engineering. When considering that natural bone is composed of collagen fibers and mineralized HA nanocrystals, the gelatin–HA system potentially can be used as a bone scaffold by mimicking the bone structure. In this study, we prepared gelatin/HA composite scaffolds by an emulsification approach. The porous microstructure of this novel scaffold was found to have good micropore forming ability with homogeneously distributed HA crystals throughout the scaffold. As mentioned by the previous study, the level of porosity, pore size distribution, and degree of porous formation of scaffolds can significantly influence the extent of bone growth. In addition, one study stated that the optimum pore size for osteoconduction is 150 µm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328210391920">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328210391920">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328210391920">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328210391920">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The effects of HA particle on the scaffold porosity were as shown in our SEM result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328210391920">Figure 1</xref>); the gelatin–HA composites exhibited a well-developed pore structure, with a pore size of ∼100–200 µm with markedly well precipitation of HA crystals. The mixture of gelatin solution 2.5% w/w with 2.5% HA produced more constant and more homogeneous micropore formation than the mixture with 5% of HA, which created various sizes of smaller pores. Many previous studies reported that the improper proportion of HA crystals in the scaffold can lead to the decrease of the bioconductivity of the crystals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328210391920">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328210391920">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328210391920">27</xref></sup> Moreover, the good mixture between the gelatin and HA crystals can provide the good qualities in the terms of the increasing of their osteoconductivity and mechanical strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328210391920">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328210391920">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328210391920">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328210391920">24</xref></sup> Hence, these evidences support our recent finding that showed different effects of the two preparations of the scaffolds on the three cell types.</p>
<p>From the point of view concerning the cell attachment, it should be noted that the attachment of cells to the composite scaffold in a significantly higher level was attributed not only to the well-constructed pore structure without pore clogging but also to the uniform distribution of the HA crystals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328210391920">28</xref></sup> A more open-spaced pore structure in the composite scaffold can provide a larger space for cell migration and surface areas for cell attachment. Moreover, the suitable spreading of the HA crystals can improve the initial attachment of the cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328210391920">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328210391920">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885328210391920">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another reason is because the initial attachment of the cells is primarily affected by the binding of adhesion molecules and their subsequent mediation between the cells and material surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885328210391920">31</xref></sup> The rough sand and irregular surface of the conventional composites on the micropores, caused by the HA particles, is believed to retard cell attachment and proliferation rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328210391920">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328210391920">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328210391920">33</xref></sup> These effects explain and support our finding that HMSc and HBc grew better and spread out well on scaffold (S1), which has proper surface configurations than (S2).</p>
<p>Regarding the biocompatibility study, proliferation and osteoblastic activity assessed by MTT and ALP assays revealed that our composite scaffold had no-toxicity effect. Results of the MTT assay suggested that our composite scaffolds exhibited an appropriate environment for the loaded cells, which appeared to proliferate well during the cultivation periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328210391920">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, ALP activity of the HMSc and HBc with the composite scaffold preparation (S1) is stronger than with the preparation (S2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328210391920">Figure 3</xref>). This finding suggests that our composite scaffold can facilitate the functional or cellular activities of the bone-derived cells.</p>
<p>SEM micrographs revealed that both HMSc and HBc appeared to spread and occupy throughout the scaffold surface in composite scaffold preparation (S1). In most areas, the cell density appeared to be relatively high and close contact with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328210391920">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328210391920">6</xref>). Hence, these findings showed that our composite scaffolds have no negative effect on the cell attachment and proliferation.</p>

<sec id="sec12-0885328210391920" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In our study, we introduced gelatin–HA composite porous scaffolds which were synthesized by the precipitation of HA crystals within a gelatin matrix. The composite scaffolds had a well-developed pore structure with HA crystals spreading homogeneously throughout the scaffolds. The human periodontal fibroblast, HMSc, and primary cells from hip bone can attach, grow, and proliferate favorably on this scaffold. These findings suggest that the gelatin–HA composite scaffolds obtained biomimetically have high potential to be used as a scaffold for bone tissue engineering.</p>
