<p>Born: Aberdeen, October 1932; Died: Norwich, April 2013</p>
<p>In the late 1960s, in the bustle of the great curriculum reform movement, Barry MacDonald took on the task of devising means to evaluate publicly funded educational programmes in the UK. In this he was a pioneer. From his work he developed Democratic Evaluation, and he became a relentless advocate of citizen rights to information. He was the UK’s leading theorist and practitioner of evaluation and was a founding member of this journal’s Editorial Advisory Board. He published too little, but he earned international respect and exerted great influence on the understanding of evaluation as a political practice.</p>
<p>MacDonald formed a small transatlantic college of evaluation practitioners and theorists who collaborated to establish the field of educational programme evaluation. The research centre he directed throughout the 1980s and 1990s – the <italic>Centre for Applied Research in Education</italic> (CARE) at the University of East Anglia – founded by his equally brilliant colleague and fellow Scot, Lawrence Stenhouse – was one of two such centres (the other in Illinois under Robert Stake’s direction) that led the development. It was midwife to educational programme evaluation, qualitative and case study methods and educational action enquiry. Between 1972 and 2004, the Centre hosted a series of six international, invited seminars entitled <italic>The Cambridge Evaluation Conferences</italic>, which drew together educational evaluators of ‘the new wave’ to lay the foundations for this democratic, responsive practice.</p>
<p>The post-war settlement in Britain saw the rapid expansion of public sectors and the world’s most advanced welfare state. Progressive governments of right and left sought to promote social policy through setting up programmes and interventions in fields as diverse as schooling, criminal justice, health, community development and social services. How did we understand these programmes in terms, not just of their productivity and results, but in terms, also, of their qualities, the experiences of those who peopled them, what they said about the contexts in which they were implemented, their politics. This was the challenge MacDonald took on. Very early on in the emergence of this new discipline he and Stake had the insight that each and every programme was a microcosm of society, saturated with its values, authority systems, aspirations and constraints, arguments and diversity of view – every programme was host to a struggle for control over ideas and new futures. Each programme evaluation came to be seen as a case study of society.</p>
<p>Once understood in these terms, once seen as political sites, each programme raised the question of who had rights to information about it. MacDonald developed Democratic Evaluation arguing that the evaluation of any social programme had the obligation to inform general publics, to balance the rights of privacy of programme people with the rights of the citizen to know. He championed the need for the Whitehall system to have evaluation informing their decision making and to be informed about impact – but he vigorously denied them privileges over that information and insisted that intended impact was only one – sometimes not the major – dimension of a programme’s accomplishments. MacDonald was one of the driving forces behind the development of case-based methodologies to resolve these dilemmas about knowledge rights and how to represent all facets and perspectives in a programme.</p>
<p>He applied Democratic Evaluation and case study to school curriculum development (1968–76) then to a sprawling national programme for computer-assisted learning (1974–78), to a European programme for ‘transition from school to work’ (1979–81), and later to the evaluation of bilingual schooling in the USA (1980–81). In a further insight he realized the power of educational evaluation to reveal the dynamics and to unlock the learning potential of programmes well beyond the formal education system and across the public sector. During the response to Toxteth/Brixton riots, he was invited to sit on a British Home Office Working Party (1983–84) for the reform of policing and was eventually commissioned for what became a five-year programme to evaluate and redevelop national police training, using the same principles of democratic enquiry and development (1984–89). An Under-Secretary at the Home Office declared this to be the only instance of which she knew of cultural change in policing. Many more projects followed adapting democratic evaluation to fields as diverse as criminal justice, nursing education and the performing arts. In the early 1990s he conducted a policy evaluation of the Economic and Social Research Council.</p>
<p>MacDonald saw British political society as overly vulnerable to narrative control and secrecy and little tolerant of pluralism. Evaluation was a means of proliferating the narratives of policy and practice, and he characterized the role of evaluator as a ‘broker’ of information exchange. He challenged those who shape policy to enter into the complex worlds they seek to control. This required new methods based on negotiation, information exchange, minimizing the asymmetries of power and defending evaluator impartiality. He customarily and courageously sought to negotiate the agenda of each and every evaluation he undertook, opening up the scope of evaluation to embrace the dilemmas and challenges faced by people at all levels of a programme.</p>
<p>A particular advocacy of his was that it is not possible to understand innovation without understanding the people in it – the dynamic relation between their values and their interests, their tolerances, hopes and fears and impulses. The first paper he wrote following his proposals for Democratic Evaluation (in 1974) was titled ‘The portrayal of persons as evaluation data’ (in 1976).</p>
<p>Through the 1980s and 1990s MacDonald led a long-term programme of support to educational evaluators in post-Franco Spain urgently embedding democratic procedures and ideals while there was a window of opportunity. He received the highest Honour from the prestigious University of Valladolid where his name is painted on a cloister wall alongside Mario Vargas Llosa. He was a quietly inspiring figure to those who worked with him. Few of the many researchers MacDonald trained and subjected to the most demanding of intellectual regimes left CARE other than to become a Professor in their own right. Under his leadership CARE seeded university departments of education with creative methodologists across the UK. The Centre was a stopping-off point for leading educators and evaluators from across the world.</p>
<p>MacDonald once said – not entirely whimsically – that you could only do evaluation in a country with pubs. For him, programme evaluation was an exercise in civic democracy carried out with intimacy and mutual respect, and with a tolerance for argument. He understood that we all are destined to strive and to fall short of our aspirations – that, in the end, all efforts regress to the routine. He was compassionate of these strivings and dismissive of the over-simplification of ‘success’ and ‘failure’. Like the most faithful of pub-goers, he was steeped in the complexity of exchange.</p>
