<abstract>
<p>Little is known about the experiences and needs of family caregivers of Latino/Hispanic individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) during the early years of recovery. The purpose of this grounded theory study was to describe the experiences and identify the informational, decisional, interpersonal, and resource support needs of family caregivers of newly injured Latino/Hispanic individuals with SCI during the first 2 years after undergoing rehabilitation. “Resolving to go forward” was the core category that emerged from two simultaneous processes of “learning to care for” and “getting through” during the initial years as the primary informal caregiver. Most caregivers felt alone and abandoned after the injured person returned home, and experienced barriers to services and resources primarily because of language issues and economic status. We recommend that researchers develop and evaluate culturally appropriate, informal caregiving models to improve outcomes for both Latino individuals with SCI and their family caregivers.</p>

<body>
<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a sudden, dramatic event that occurs primarily in young men and has lifelong consequences that impact all aspects of life. The sudden onset of a severe disability in a young adult that results in loss of mobility, functional abilities, and bowel and bladder function often translates into long-term, complex caregiving responsibilities for a family member or friend. Little is known about caregiver experiences or their needs during the early recovery period following spinal cord injury, and how these relate to caregiver and patient outcomes. Even less is known about Latino/Hispanic<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1049732312468062">1</xref></sup> spinal cord injury survivors and their caregivers’ needs during the transition from rehabilitation to home. The majority of caregiver research with Latinos has involved older adults or populations with progressive chronic illnesses.</p>
<p>In 2010, Latinos were the largest ethnic minority in the United States, particularly in the more populous states such as California, New York, Florida, and Texas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312468062">United States Census Bureau, 2010</xref>). In south Texas, Latinos suffered one half of new spinal cord injuries, reflecting the population at large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312468062">U.S. Department Of Health and Human Services, 2010</xref>). Although there are few published reports of the experiences and needs of family caregivers of newly injured Latino individuals with SCI, it is anticipated that their experiences and support needs might be unique because of cultural influences such as close family ties, well-defined family roles, and often limited resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312468062">Newman &amp; Reed, 1998</xref>). Thus, the overall goal of this study was to describe the experiences of family caregivers of newly injured Latino SCI survivors during the early recovery period. The specific aims were to (a) describe the experiences of family caregivers of newly injured Latino individuals with SCI during the initial 2 years following rehabilitation, and (b) identify the informational, decisional, interpersonal, and resource support needs of those family caregivers during the first 2 years after rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Nearly 11,000 SCIs occur annually, resulting in devastating consequences including paralysis of the arms and/or legs, loss of the ability to walk, loss of bowel and bladder control, and loss of sexual function. Because of recent health care advances, 65% of persons with SCI now survive their initial injury. Following medical stabilization, most individuals with SCI receive inpatient rehabilitation therapy for several weeks to several months, after which 94% return to their home and community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312468062">National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, 2010</xref>). The vast majority of SCIs occur in young healthy men, necessitating dramatic, lifelong changes in self-care and health care. Because of the impact of managed care, inpatient stays for rehabilitation following SCI have been dramatically reduced, effectively minimizing the time for learning and adjustment by individuals with SCI and their caregivers. Consequently, the patient often returns home without adequate resources, accessibility to the environment, or sources of information and support for self-care and decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312468062">Lucke, Coccia, Goode, &amp; Lucke, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In an ethnographic study of Mexican American men with SCI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312468062">Newman and Reed (1998)</xref> found that the first 4 years were the most difficult in terms of adjustment following SCI. They stated that family, gender, and sex roles in the Mexican American culture are well defined and that strong biases existed against those with disabilities. These cultural norms, as well as loss of independence, contributed to anger, depression, and increased substance abuse during the initial few years postinjury. However, the nuclear and extended families of Mexican American men with SCI are very important to their recovery and rehabilitation (Newman &amp; Reed).</p>
<p>Much of the research on informal caregivers has focused on elderly persons or those with chronic diseases for whom there is a progressive downhill trajectory, such as in Alzheimer’s disease, AIDS, cancer, multiple sclerosis, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312468062">Abraído-Lanza, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312468062">Ayalong, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312468062">Barber &amp; Vega, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312468062">Land &amp; Hudson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312468062">Moody, Morgello, Gerits, &amp; Byrd, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312468062">Wells, Cagle, Marshall, &amp; Hollen, 2009</xref>). Because SCI often occurs in young adults, the caregiver’s remaining lifetime might include providing care such as dressing, feeding, and toileting. In addition, because most individuals with SCI are cognitively intact, dealing with the emotional, psychological, and spiritual consequences of a devastating trauma—including anger, depression, and expressions of suicide—cannot be ignored. Across many research studies, similar issues have emerged for caregivers, the majority of whom are women: isolation, loneliness, depression, change in health status, role overload, and changes in family structure (Abraído-Lanza; Barber &amp; Vega; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312468062">Crist, Garcia-Smith, &amp; Phillips, 2006</xref>; Land &amp; Hudson; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312468062">Mier, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312468062">Wells et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar common themes were revealed in studies with Latino caregivers, but several unique aspects also emerged. In a qualitative study with Puerto Rican family members caring for older adults, investigators reported financial hardships, role strain, difficulties of caregiving, and discord in family relations as major themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312468062">Ramos, 2004</xref>). In addition, the importance of support received from family members and through the church, as well as reluctance to use support services, also emerged. In a longitudinal study comparing Mexican American caregivers with non-Hispanic White caregivers over a period of 1 year, several differences were found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312468062">Phillips &amp; Crist, 2008</xref>). Mexican American caregivers were significantly younger and had a larger family network of support but a smaller network of friends. Mexican American caregivers perceived a greater interaction among their network of support but experienced a greater decline in perceived support over time. Moreover, Mexican Americans perceived worse health outcomes with decreases in support.</p>
<p>Researchers studying family caregivers of people with SCI have suggested a link between caregiver outcomes and family outcomes. Cross-sectional studies have revealed that caregivers of people with SCI reported greater pain and lower vitality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312468062">Blanes, Carmagnani, &amp; Ferreira, 2007</xref>), greater depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312468062">Dreer, Elliott, Shewchuk, Berry, &amp; Rivera, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312468062">Raj, Manigandan, &amp; Jacob, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312468062">Unalan et al., 2007</xref>), less productivity and community integration, and fewer leisure activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312468062">Boschen, Tonack, &amp; Gargaro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312468062">Ellenbogen, Meade, Jackson, &amp; Barrett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312468062">Hui, Elliott, Shewchuk, &amp; Rivera, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312468062">Raj et al., 2006</xref>). In a study comparing perceptions of caregiving and noncaregiving spouses, investigators found that caregiving spouses reported significantly higher depression and feelings of stress and more somatic symptoms than noncaregiving spouses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312468062">Weitzenkamp, Gerhart, Charlifue, Whiteneck, &amp; Savic, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In another study, investigators measured caregivers’ problem-solving abilities and found they had a positive effect on adjustment on the part of the individual with SCI, and an inverse relationship on the presence of pressure sores at 1 year postinjury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312468062">Elliott, Shewchuk, &amp; Richards, 1999</xref>). In qualitative studies, life changes that occurred for family members living with a person with SCI have been described as catastrophic events, after which families go through a period of adjustment and adaptation that can result in a family either getting stronger or breaking down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312468062">Chen &amp; Boore, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312468062">DeSanto-Madeya, 2009</xref>). Researchers have suggested a relationship between caregiving for individuals with a new SCI and health consequences for family caregivers (Chen &amp; Boore; DeSanto-Madeya; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312468062">Elliott et al., 1999</xref>). What contributes to or ameliorates these health consequences for family caregivers is less clear. What is also unknown is whether the caregiving experience is similar or different for Latino caregivers. In this study, we explored the experiences of Latino family caregivers for people with a new SCI.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-1049732312468062">
<title>Design</title>
<p>We used a qualitative, grounded theory approach for this study. We originally obtained institutional review board (IRB) approval to conduct focus groups to explore and describe the experiences of family caregivers of newly injured Latino individuals with SCI within their first 2 years after rehabilitation. We based this approach on the success of focus groups used in previous studies involving sensitive family issues in the Latino population, including SCI, teen sexual behaviors, and intimate partner violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312468062">Brackley &amp; Williams, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312468062">Koniak-Griffin &amp; Lesser, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312468062">Lesser, Oscós-Sánchez, Tello, Cardenas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312468062">Oscós-Sánchez &amp; Lesser, 2007</xref>). After recruitment of study participants began, we realized that family members were reluctant to discuss what was perceived as personal information in a group of people who were unknown to them. Therefore, we subsequently obtained an IRB modification to conduct face-to-face or telephone interviews for data collection.</p>
<p>Following IRB approval, we recruited participants over a period of 1 year from three regional spinal cord injury centers serving south Texas. A written invitation was sent to approximately 160 potential participants throughout south Texas who met the inclusion criteria. Because of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312468062">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1996</xref>) concerns and differences in the initial institutional admission consent forms, letters were sent directly to prospective participants from two SCI centers and directly from the research team at the third center. Potential participants were instructed to contact the research team if they were interested in participating in the study. We were able to follow up by telephone with approximately 60 potential participants from the third SCI center, for whom we had contact information, to determine whether they had questions or needed clarification prior to making a decision regarding study participation. Once informed consent was obtained, a mutually agreeable time was scheduled for the interview.</p>
<p>Purposive sampling yielded 10 self-reported Latino family caregivers from whom informed consent was obtained from two SCI Centers; however, we were unable to schedule an interview with one caregiver. Participants included 2 English/Spanish-speaking, and 7 Spanish-speaking family caregivers who were interviewed within 2 years after their respective family member’s injury. Five caregivers were wives, 3 were mothers, and 1 was a father. Ages ranged from the 30s to the 60s, with a mean age of 48 years. Educational levels ranged from some grade school to some college. Only 1 of the caregivers was working full time outside the home; one family had a paid caregiver around the clock for their son.</p>
<p>Three caregivers had to leave their jobs to provide care; the remaining caregivers were not working or were retired. The majority of caregivers were married. Eight of the caregivers provided care for a family member who was tetraplegic (meaning paralysis of the arms, legs, and trunk of the body below the level of injury to the spinal cord); 1 family member was paraplegic (meaning complete paralysis of the lower half of the body, including both legs). The individuals with SCI ranged in age from 19 to 69 years.</p>
<p>Two researchers and two research assistants comprised the research team. The principal investigator (first author Lucke) is an English-speaking, non-Hispanic White woman who had lived in Texas for 12 years at the time of the study. The research assistant who participated in data collection (Martinez) grew up in Mexico speaking Spanish at home. He had lived in south Texas for the previous 20 years, had received his professional education in English, and is proficient in reading and writing in both English and Spanish. The second research assistant, who assisted with data analysis (Mendez), grew up in south Texas, spoke both Spanish and English at home, and is proficient in reading and writing both Spanish and English. The second researcher (Arévalo-Flechas) was born and raised in Colombia and immigrated to the United States at the age of 20. At the time of the study she had lived in south Texas for 19 years. Her area of research is Latino dementia caregiving.</p>

<sec id="section3-1049732312468062">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>We conducted semistructured interviews with 9 family caregivers of Latino SCI survivors injured within the previous two years. Two interviews were conducted face-to-face, and seven interviews were conducted by telephone at the request of family members because of distance of the families from the researchers. A total of eleven interviews were conducted: nine in-depth interviews and two follow-up interviews. Interview questions were developed from the literature and previous studies. The interviews were cofacilitated by a bilingual, bicultural research assistant (Martinez) and an investigator (Lucke) with expertise in SCI and qualitative research methods.</p>
<p>We recorded the interviews in either English or Spanish, as requested by the study participants. Then each interview was transcribed with identifying information removed. The bilingual, bicultural members of the team conducted a translation and back-translation of the interviews that were in Spanish to capture accurately in English the participants’ intended meanings. The initial translations by the research assistant were then back-translated by the bilingual researcher, compared for meaning accuracy with the taped interviews, and modified accordingly as consensus was reached. The verbatim transcripts of the interviews conducted in English and the translated transcripts of those conducted in Spanish were then used for data analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732312468062">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>We used a grounded theory data analysis approach. Using constant comparative analysis we moved back and forth between the data, the analysis, and the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312468062">Strauss, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312468062">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990</xref>). Interviews were initially coded separately by the first and second authors. Agreement for initial coding among the team was greater than 85% for the categories. Clustering and labeling of codes was accomplished by reaching consensus. We had in-depth discussions in two areas requiring cultural and conceptual equivalence in translation. The resulting substantive theory emerged from immersion in the data and from insights resulting from in-depth discussions among the research team. Follow-up discussions with 2 study participants confirmed these conceptualizations.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Resolving to go forward was the core category that emerged from two simultaneous processes of learning to care for and getting through during the early months as a primary informal caregiver (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312468062">Figure 1</xref>). Despite feeling alone after returning home, often without adequate resources, family members were determined to do the best they could to care for their loved one, often placing their own health at risk. Getting through their new role as caregiver involved learning to deal with the emotional and psychological issues arising from the adjustment to SCI by their family member and by themselves. Inpatient health care professionals provided in-depth teaching and training in preparation for their role as family caregiver. However, necessary equipment, home modifications, and outpatient therapy often could not be obtained once the family member returned home. Language and economic factors were major barriers to accessing appropriate services and health care resources, which greatly influenced the quality of life and often the health of the family caregiver.</p>

<sec id="section6-1049732312468062">
<title>Learning to Care For</title>
<p>Learning to care for their loved one most often began during hospitalization and rehabilitation. Nurses and therapists were instrumental in providing information and instruction, particularly about prevention of complications. The primary focus of instruction was on physical care. On returning home, family caregivers felt completely unprepared for the emotional aspects of recovery they faced. Caregivers also described their struggle with wanting to help their loved one but not wanting to do too much, so their family member could continue to recover. Finally, the most difficult aspect for family caregivers of someone recovering from SCI was not knowing what to expect on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<sec id="section7-1049732312468062">
<title>How to care for</title>
<p>Most participants described spending a great deal of time with their loved one in the hospital and during rehabilitation receiving instruction and training from the nurses and therapists. Initially they learned the basics, such as turning and positioning, then they moved to transfers, and finally they learned more complex care such as catheterization, bowel management, and medication administration. They described watching, getting instruction, and then doing. Finally, they described learning about how to prevent complications such as pneumonia, skin breakdown, and autonomic dysreflexia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1049732312468062">2</xref></sup> One participant perceived that she did not receive any training except for wound care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049732312468062">
<title>Physical care</title>
<p>Learning physical care in the structured rehabilitation setting was very different from providing physical care in the home. While in the inpatient setting, the caregivers learned the nuances of how to care for a person whose abilities had changed. They learned how to provide care to maximize the potential of their spouse or child with SCI, to prevent injury to themselves, and to prevent complications. One participant stated, “He can move his arms. He has strength with his arms, but the thing is he can’t move his fingers; they have no strength. I have to spoon feed him.” Physical care became more difficult after returning home. Often the caregivers did not have the appropriate equipment or were alone in providing the care (including turning and transferring the injured adult). Even when some families had home care services for a period of time after discharge, the perception of the caregivers was that the assistants did not help or even left early, before the care was completed: “We had home health for an hour a day to bathe him and get him up, but they never stayed their time. I ended up doing everything anyway.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732312468062">
<title>Emotional care</title>
<p>Family caregivers described in detail how they learned the physical care for their loved one, but they perceived that no one had prepared them for the emotional aspects of how to deal with SCI after returning home. This included how to help their loved one to get through this difficult time emotionally, not letting them become helpless, learning to say “No,” and how to handle their own emotions. One said, “He’s real nice to you, and to strangers he is the nicest person. But to the family, I think he takes all of his anger out on the family because it’s safe, and we love him.”</p>
<p>Caregivers described being emotionally and physically exhausted. They were unprepared for the angry outbursts and threats of suicide, and did not know how to help their loved one move forward emotionally: “I was terrified and didn’t know what to do . . . how to help him emotionally.” “[You need] to be prepared to keep going . . . to try to help your son or daughter so they don’t become helpless.” Conversely, family caregivers found it hard to deny their loved one anything because of their condition:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s hard to tell your kids no, especially when they are in that situation, because you feel so guilty that you feel you are going to hurt them. You’re not going to hurt them. If they survive all this they will understand what it takes.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732312468062">
<title>Doing too much</title>
<p>Caregivers experienced conflict between providing the best care to their loved one and meeting their own needs or those of other family members. One participant expressed, “The worst caretakers are parents. I’ve learned that. We don’t make good caretakers because a caretaker will go in there and do the job, and parents will do more.” Preventing injury to themselves was a major concern of family caregivers because of the physical demands of the care required. Many family caregivers had to stop working because of the time and physical demands required by their new role:
<disp-quote>
<p>I had to quit my job to take care of him. I began to have anxiety attacks. I started to worry about everything. After taking care of him every day for one year, my health began to show from the wear and tear. I had to have surgery on my knee. Now I have to have surgery on my wrist.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049732312468062">
<title>Knowing what to expect</title>
<p>Family caregivers felt unprepared to deal with inadequate pain management, complications, and side effects: “He started having hallucinations. He was so frightened, I didn’t know what to expect. When he was so frustrated he would cry, and he would get mad and call me names. I didn’t know what to expect.” Hospital and rehabilitation staff were very helpful and supportive with the educational and physical aspects of care. Family caregivers did not feel prepared for making modifications to provide care in their homes, locating resources, or knowing what to do when something unanticipated arose. They felt training in these areas needed to be improved. One participant had this recommendation: “It would be so helpful to have the [experienced] wives help train other wives.”</p>

<p>A second simultaneous process described by participants as “getting through” focused on their role, their feelings, and the adjustments needed throughout the recovery period. Family caregivers experienced a tremendous range and intensity of emotions and struggles during the early recovery period. A period of adjustment occurred after returning home, during which the family had to develop a routine around the needs of the family member with the new SCI. Feelings of being all alone, sadness, and dealing with the difficulties eventually evolved into finding strength through their faith, identifying things that were helpful to them, describing resources that were needed for families and caregivers in this situation, and finally being prepared to move forward. Some of the greatest difficulties for families were language barriers and navigating the health care system.</p>
<sec id="section13-1049732312468062">
<title>Getting a routine</title>
<p>One of the first things caregivers had to deal with when their family member returned home was to develop a routine for all the activities required in caregiving, as well as their other family responsibilities. A few had assistance with care for a period of time from an aide, but even with assistance the majority of the physical and emotional care was provided by the family caregiver:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, we had to get a routine. My husband had to be turned every two hours. I kept him spotless. There was a nurse or a nurse’s aide who came to the house every day. But they did not help him get up. I learned how to do that myself.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Several family caregivers, primarily spouses, had to quit their jobs to care for their family member. This not only reduced the family income but also removed a source of interpersonal support for the caregiver. Other family members did not live close by or were unable to assist during the day. Families often worked out a routine in which they would all get together, usually on the weekends, and sometimes would go out to eat as a family. This was often the only time the person with SCI would get out of the house except for medical appointments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1049732312468062">
<title>Feeling all alone</title>
<p>Women described feeling isolated and alone, having no one to assist physically or emotionally during the day:
<disp-quote>
<p>One feels so alone, and when you need someone most, no one supports you.</p>
<p>I didn’t have anyone. I did it alone. Aside from that, I had a four-month-old baby girl.</p>
<p>I am alone all day long. My body is so tired now but, there’s no alternative, I have to help my son. I am the only one who can help him; well, honestly, all my daughters are married and unfortunately, they can’t help me because they live too far away.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In a situation in which assistance was needed urgently or their family member became sick but not necessarily seriously ill, family caregivers felt their only alternative was to call 911 (for dispatch of community emergency services). Because most of them lived in small towns or in rural areas there often was not a neighbor or family member close by that they could call for assistance on short notice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1049732312468062">
<title>Difficult adjustment</title>
<p>Caregivers talked about the profound difference in their lives after their loved one suffered an SCI. Several caregivers stayed at the hospital most of the time following their family member’s injury. While the family member was in rehabilitation, they visited frequently to learn the care and be there for their loved one. This put a tremendous strain on their family. Once their loved one returned home, the realization that this was not a temporary situation began to emerge, and quite often became overwhelming for the caregiver: “This is how I thought . . . this would only last for a while . . . he was going to get better . . . it was just going to be bad for a while, right?” Participants also struggled with a change in role intertwined with privacy and gender concerns between themselves and their loved one: “It was difficult for me because he’s already a young man. He’s already twenty years old and . . . I had to change him . . . ” [sobbing]. Family caregivers also perceived that their loved one had received differential care. This was often attributed to language, income, insurance, or other factors they felt made caring for their family member more difficult:
<disp-quote>
<p>But since they don’t help us here—they don’t want to help us because . . . they also discriminated against him because he was very big and he’s very heavy. I told them, “He is a human being. Just because he can’t feel you can’t just drag him around.” I said, “He is a human being like you and me. The only difference is that he can’t feel.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1049732312468062">
<title>Sadness</title>
<p>Family caregivers described an overwhelming feeling of sadness that developed during the early months of caring for their loved one:
<disp-quote>
<p>I give thanks to God because I have begun to overcome that, you know. I have had to get used to it, to changing him, to bathing him, it’s a very sad thing for me. He is my youngest son. [crying]</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A sense of loss for the role in the family their loved one played prior to the injury and how that had changed after the injury affected the entire family:
<disp-quote>
<p>This is a life change that is way too difficult, too sad, because life changes from one moment to the next, right? To see your husband, well, when he is fine, working, and, to see him how he is now, it’s a very hard thing, very sad. It’s hard for me, for my children, and for him mainly, because he was such an active man, and now, to see himself like this, it’s a very sad thing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1049732312468062">
<title>Strength through faith</title>
<p>Over the course of time, many participants began to find comfort and strength in their faith. For many participants faith played an important role in coming to terms with what had happened to their loved one and their family as a result of the injury, and they were beginning to move forward with a better understanding of how they would incorporate this experience into their lives:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have cried so much. That was what God wanted, you know, because, well, God is God, and sometimes one is not content with what happens to us, but when God wants things to be a certain way, one has to resign oneself to that. God is the one who gives us the strength to keep going.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants derived the strength to go forward from their faith: “God will give me the strength to continue.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1049732312468062">
<title>Helpful strategies</title>
<p>Family caregivers also found a number of outside sources helpful in getting through this difficult experience, particularly in their respective communities. The rehabilitation team often offered counseling or participation in a support group as a means of support and learning how to cope in this difficult situation. Most participants chose not to participate in these services. In some situations, in which counseling or support groups were not offered through rehabilitation, participants thought they might be helpful. Within their families, humor and laughter often were sought as a way of bringing the family together to get through the experience:
<disp-quote>
<p>Getting the family together. . . . We needed to know about keeping ours and his spirits up. We needed to know [how] to keep his mind occupied. Humor and laughter are so important to help families get through those difficult times.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For one family, a teacher was invaluable in helping with the language and the morass of correspondence required for health care:
<disp-quote>
<p>His teacher was the one who took charge of a lot of things, right, and she’s still helping me with letters and papers that come in English. She has to come and answer them and everything. At home, no one speaks English except for him.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another family caregiver found solace from her Bible study group. Although the focus of the group was not support, she found comfort from an established, known group in her community: “The Bible studies course was a big help. The people there were understanding. Focusing on that helped me get through this.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1049732312468062">
<title>Resources needed</title>
<p>After returning home, many family caregivers found they did not have the appropriate equipment (lift, wheelchair, shower chair, ramp, and so forth) or assistance in the home: “I don’t have a special bathroom for him. My little boy has not had a bath since he got out of the hospital.” One family decided to turn the husband’s workshop into a room for him. It was large enough for a hospital bed and would accommodate multiple family members visiting and gathering at one time. However, this was a compromise arrangement because there was no access to the bathroom, which was located in the main house. Although a few families had an aide in the home for a few weeks initially, family members felt the aide did not assist as planned or left early without providing the necessary care:
<disp-quote>
<p>He is covered by his father’s insurance. Otherwise, we would have had to pay. He [physician] told me that my son needed a lot of therapy. In December, they said the therapy would end during the first two weeks of January. I don’t know if he’s going to receive therapy after that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The second major necessity identified by families was a liaison or knowledgeable person who could assist them in navigating the health care system to address the needs of their loved one. Language was a major barrier for many families because the caregivers spoke little or no English. Because of this language barrier, the caregivers often did not understand the explanations about SCI and what this meant for the long term. They relied on friends and relatives who knew someone with SCI for information, which might not have been accurate or applicable for their family member. The complexity of the health care system coupled with language barriers made it difficult for family caregivers to know where to go for assistance and answers to questions. They often did not know what services they should be receiving or how to ask whether they were eligible for needed services. At a more basic level, they often could not describe what type of assistance or resources they needed. Completing paperwork was also difficult for caregivers. Family caregivers often identified the need to have one person to go to for information or questions, such as a social worker, as one person stated, “to help them in that emotional way . . . give them advice about what they should do, because in my experience I was terrified, and I didn’t know what to do.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1049732312468062">
<title>Preparing to keep going</title>
<p>After exploring the options known to them, family caregivers decided the best thing to do was to keep going, “to prepare ourselves to keep going and try to help your son or daughter, try to encourage them and help them to make progress so that they don’t become helpless, that they keep going and make progress.” Several families had considered and rejected placing their loved one in a nursing home because of the physical and emotional care required:
<disp-quote>
<p>[We] can’t put him in a nursing home; what we have here is meager, it is clean. He would not do well there. This is what God wants. [We] can’t put him in a home; [we] have to deal with it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although not explicitly stated, the underlying meaning was that the care of their loved one needed to occur within the family. This was an implicit obligation for the family, no matter how difficult. A few caregivers considered leaving the situation, which seemed overwhelming—especially the emotional and physical toll it was taking on the caregiver:
<disp-quote>
<p>I thought of leaving him and leaving all of it, you understand, because it was a heavy load. Then I thought about that, but it’s not right either, to leave him. But at the same time, I thought he needed me right now, and maybe I would need him in the future.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1049732312468062">
<title>Facing the Future</title>
<p>After weighing all the options, having discussions with their family member and their family member’s doctor, and realizing the implications for themselves, family caregivers garnered the determination to face the future continuing to be the primary informal care provider for their loved one. This resolve was formed from a blend of love for their family, fear of what the future would bring, sadness for what had been lost, a felt obligation to their loved one and family, and faith that God would take care of them. After experiencing the highs and lows of providing care for a family member with a new SCI, often without the necessary support and resources, family caregivers were determined to go forward. They knew their physical and emotional health might suffer, but they felt this was the best approach for the whole family, particularly for their family member with SCI. Their strong faith and commitment to their family would help them face the future: “Sometimes one is not content with what happens to us, but when God wants things to be a certain way, one has to resign oneself to that. So it is, yes, well, I need to give thanks to God.”</p>

<sec id="section22-1049732312468062" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have described the experiences of Latino caregivers of people with a new SCI during the first 2 years at home. Participants talked about the physical, emotional, spiritual, role, and financial struggles they experienced along the way. They also talked of the benefits of bringing their family closer together at times and the support received from other groups, particularly within their church and community. There are a number of implications from these findings.</p>
<p>Perceptions of worsening health because of fulfilling the caregiving role were common in this group of participants. Even when a paid attendant was available during the day, one caregiver described constant worry and anxiety about his son because of the son’s expressions of despair and thoughts of suicide, as well as the participant’s own fears of future loss for the usual role of grandparent. In addition to the emotional energy required for caregiving, the physical toll on the health of participants was enormous. Back pain, injuries to joints, loss of sleep, fatigue, and exhaustion were commonly expressed. Consistent with other findings about Mexican American caregivers, perceived loss of assistance and resources, particularly physical aid, were associated with self-perceptions of poor health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312468062">Montoro-Rodriguez &amp; Gallagher-Thompson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312468062">Phillips &amp; Crist, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Family caregivers expressed and displayed profound sadness as they described their experiences and those of their family member. All participants became tearful at some point during the interviews. Often during research team meetings, investigators questioned whether depression was also present for some participants. Most of these caregivers were dealing with a complete disruption of their lives as the result of their family member’s injury and subsequent care requirements, along with feelings of isolation and health problems themselves. For the foreseeable future, this would not be changing. We encouraged participants to discuss these feelings with their own or their family member’s care provider.</p>
<p>In other studies, Hispanic caregivers also expressed sadness and denied depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312468062">Pinquart &amp; Sörensen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312468062">Purdy &amp; Arguello, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312468062">Wells et al., 2009</xref>). In studies in which depression was measured, Hispanic caregivers did have depression scores in the moderate to high range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312468062">Land &amp; Hudson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312468062">Mier, 2007</xref>; Wells et al.). Factors that contributed to depressive symptoms were health status, physical symptoms, feelings of role captivity, and loss of self-identify (Land &amp; Hudson; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312468062">Phillips &amp; Crist, 2008</xref>). Latina and Hispanic female caregivers reported greater benefits from caregiving than Whites, but this was thought to be attributable to a complex relationship among family support, family closeness, spirituality, and acculturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312468062">Coon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312468062">Nadeem, Lange, &amp; Miranda, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Many participants felt socially isolated from family members and friends as a result of their caregiving experience. Not only did most of them live in rural areas, but their caregiving responsibilities limited their time for other activities and socialization. Moreover, they perceived that other family members and friends visited less frequently. Because of this isolation, these family caregivers also felt they were left alone to deal with the emotional fallout from their loved ones’ reactions to their SCI. They felt completely unprepared for this aspect of caregiving. They did not know what to expect, what was normal, or how to deal with these emotional reactions. Particularly troubling were expressions of anger and suicidal thoughts by their family member with SCI. Not knowing how to deal with these difficult situations contributed to their distress. Other researchers have found that perceptions of a decreased network of support increase with the duration of the caregiving experience in Mexican American caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312468062">Losada et al., 2006</xref>). Researchers and clinicians will need to explore how we can better prepare family caregivers to deal with the complex emotional aspects of caring for someone with a newly acquired disability.</p>
<p>All of the families interviewed decided to care for their loved one in their home despite experiencing great difficulties and distress. Although they struggled with this decision, participants described the need to care for their family member at home, and only one participant had a full-time paid attendant in the home during the day. Several related factors seemed to contribute to this decision. Participants described a responsibility, a sense of duty, or an obligation to care for their family member at home because their care would be better or they would do better at home than in another setting. This feeling of responsibility was present even when the family caregiver knew his or her own health would suffer from the physical demands of caregiving. A sense of obligation or duty to care for their loved one within their family at home is similar to that described in other studies in Hispanic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312468062">Arévalo-Flechas, 2009</xref>) and Asian cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312468062">Pinquart &amp; Sörensen, 2005</xref>). Out of respect for members of their family (filial piety), members of some Asian cultures have described a duty to care for their family member at home. Mexican American women who were caregivers of cancer patients reflected the cultural equivalent of caregiver burden when also considering the complexities of health status, resources, and acculturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312468062">Wells et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Other researchers studying Mexican American caregivers found a cultural dislike for care outside the home, founded in <italic>familismo</italic> (sense of honor, respect, loyalty to family), which might have a protective effect on perceptions of caregiver burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312468062">Evans, Crogan, Belyea, &amp; Coon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312468062">Losada et al., 2006</xref>), or which might contribute to underreporting of caregiver burden because it is culturally unacceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312468062">Montoro-Rodriguez &amp; Gallagher-Thompson, 2009</xref>). Still others have found that familismo is not specific to Hispanics but cuts across cultures, and might be more related to collective community values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312468062">Schwartz, 2007</xref>). Although some participants in this study did consider nursing home placement at some point, it was rejected as an option based on their obligation to their family. This aspect of resolving to care for their family member at home needs to be explored further, particularly when the family caregivers are older or suffer from health problems themselves. Further study is needed to distinguish the dimension of family support from filial responsibility in relation to Latino caregivers (Losada et al.).</p>
<p>Another positive factor to which participants referred was their faith that God would take care of them and their family. Initially they questioned why God would let this happen to their loved one, but then came to some resolution that God must have a reason and would look after them. Participants described finding strength in their faith and in knowing it would help them get through the situation. Also, participants described a sense of community and support found in their church family. Similarly, others have found that positive religious beliefs had a beneficial effect on coping and diminished the perception of burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312468062">Herrera, Lee, Nanyonjo, Laufman, &amp; Torres-Vigil, 2009</xref>). Yet another explanation is that stronger religious beliefs or spirituality, which are found consistently in ethnic minorities, reinforce the values of family caregiving but do not necessarily improve perceptions of overall well-being by caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312468062">Hebert, Weinstein, Martire, &amp; Schulz, 2006</xref>). Spirituality also might serve as a buffer against the negative psychological outcomes resulting from limited resources and decreased family support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312468062">Gallo, Penedo, Espinosa de los Monteros, &amp; Arguelles, 2009</xref>). The relationship between religion, spiritual beliefs, and culture, and health outcomes of caregivers, needs further theoretical and research exploration.</p>
<p>Consistent with other studies, participants in this study perceived barriers to services and resources because of language and economic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312468062">Ayalong, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312468062">Mier, 2007</xref>). Other studies have demonstrated that significantly higher levels of informal care provided by Mexican Americans are possibly associated with disparities in insurance availability and with language barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312468062">Weiss, González, Kabeto, &amp; Langa, 2005</xref>). Most participants felt supported and part of the team in preparation for their family member’s discharge home. Once they arrived home, however, they felt abandoned and alone. They did not know who to call for questions or guidance, nor were they provided with a contact person who could speak Spanish. Shortly after their arrival home, many participants realized they did not have the equipment or supplies they needed to provide safe care for their loved one in a way that would not jeopardize their own health. Often they brought up these issues or concerns with their family member’s doctor, but did not get answers or were told they should just put their loved one in a nursing home, that it would be better for everyone.</p>
<p>Many of the caregivers also had children or others in the household for whom they provided care. Adding the daily caregiving activities required for someone with an SCI necessitated those who were working to quit their jobs, which dramatically decreased their family income. This contributed to the difficulties and distress experienced by the family caregivers by adding financial worries. Although not stated by participants, we questioned whether having to quit their job contributed to the social isolation they experienced.</p>
<p>Two issues arise related to the perceived lack of resources for these Latino caregivers. From the clinical perspective, the rehabilitation team needs to provide contact information for the patient and family prior to discharge for any questions or concerns that might surface after they return home; for Spanish-speaking families, this needs to include a culturally proficient Spanish-speaking contact. Ideally, the family will have met the contact person prior to discharge and will have an established relationship, because Latino individuals are often reluctant to reach out to ask for help, especially to someone who is unknown to them.</p>
<p>The second aspect that needs further exploration is help-seeking behavior in Latinos. Participants perceived a disparity in resources available to them and also in how they were treated when they sought assistance. Most of the participants did not seek out sources of assistance for a number of reasons—language barriers, not knowing who to contact, having a sense of duty to their family, and lack of financial resources. For other health problems or questions, participants in the study used their family or friends as a resource. Most had no prior exposure to someone with an SCI prior to their family member’s injury. Consequently, they had no previous experience or contact from which to obtain information. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312468062">Arnault (2009)</xref> proposed a midrange theoretical model of cultural determinants of help seeking that is synthesized from multiple disciplines. This cultural model is important in understanding “health promotion strategies and the effective use of health care services by diverse peoples” to reduce and eliminate health disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312468062">Arnault, 2009</xref>, p. 259). The author applies this model to the understanding of help seeking in Asian cultures. Future research could apply this model to Latino caregivers to gain an understanding, improve assessments, and design culturally sensitive interventions to reduce the health consequences of family caregiving.</p>
<sec id="section23-1049732312468062">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Although a large number of potential participants were invited to take part in the study, only 9 family caregivers completed the study. The small sample size was the result of several factors. Implementation of HIPAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312468062">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1996</xref>), which in part addresses security and privacy of health data, required an indirect method of recruitment of family caregivers by two of the study sites. This limited the number of responses from prospective participants. Time and distance were also factors for potential participants. Many stated they did not have time to take part in an interview. Several also indicated that travel was a concern, so the option for telephone interviews was provided, but the possibility remains that interviews might have been richer if conducted face to face. Some prospective participants also expressed concern about possible privacy issues given the topic of the study. Assurances of privacy, anonymity, and confidentiality were provided to all potential participants. Some caregivers might have talked about these personal issues because of the isolation they were experiencing.</p>
<p>Despite the small sample size, study participants were geographically dispersed throughout the southern half of Texas, including far west Texas. Participants were all Latinos, which included bilingual and monolingual Spanish-speaking family caregivers. Although saturation was reached with participants from this study, it is not known whether findings from this study will apply to other segments of the Spanish-speaking population or to people living in areas outside of Texas, where health care delivery might differ. Additionally, since only 1 participant was a man, it is not known whether caregiving experiences would be similar or different for other men who are caregiving fathers or spouses.</p>
<p>Study participants became very emotional during the course of the interviews. For 8 of the 9 participants, this was the first time they were able to share their experiences with someone outside the family. In the face-to-face interviews, we paused the interview and provided time and support. Participants were also given the opportunity to stop the interview; no one elected that option. We did not feel we were able to provide the same level of support and empathy when participants became tearful during the telephone interviews. Although we allowed time, offered support, and provided the option of stopping the interview, these measures did not seem comparable when provided by telephone. It is not known whether the participants in the telephone interviews perceived that the same level of support was provided. Physical presence, eye contact, touch, or a hug when provided in person might be perceived as more supportive by people from a culture in which personal relationships and closeness are highly valued.</p>
<p>Translation and back-translation of the interviews and emerging categories occurred among the research team. There was a great deal of discussion in two areas: the meaning and extent of the sadness experienced by these family caregivers, and the meaning of duty or obligation to care for the family member with an SCI. Because most of the interviews were conducted by telephone, the ability to further explore these two aspects in depth seemed limited. We felt greater clarity and depth of meaning could have been obtained with face-to-face interviews. Further research is needed to elucidate these aspects within the cultural context of Latino caregiving.</p>

<title>Contribution to Knowledge and Future Research</title>
<p>Results from this study further elucidate the complex experiences of caring for a family member at home following an SCI, in particular for Latino caregivers. Research and practice implications for rehabilitation and home care health professionals are presented, particularly related to resource needs of these caregivers, many of whom did not speak English. Complex issues for the caregiver concerning resources, access to health services, and having the best care for their family member are intertwined with issues of the caregiver’s own health, obligations to family, and dealing with the difficulties that arise. Cultural understandings of these issues need continued exploration, especially in light of the mixed research findings, to design clinical and research interventions to meet the multiple, complex needs of Latino family caregivers.</p>
<p>Findings from this study and others point to important policy implications. Similar to what happened in mental health decades ago, a decrease in length of rehabilitation stay has forced the responsibility of caring for people with a new SCI onto family members without adequate resources or preparation. This responsibility comes with a physical and emotional cost to families and caregivers. Although the goal of formal and informal caregivers is to prevent complications and enhance quality of life, without adequate resources these costs are transferred to physical and emotional health sequelae for family caregivers. Future research needs also to focus on the best approaches to follow-up care for patients with SCI and their caregivers, while maintaining or minimizing costs, reducing complications, and improving quality of life for all concerned.</p>
<p>Knowledge gained from this study can be used to develop studies to further understand the complex factors that contribute to the best culturally appropriate informal caregiving model(s) to improve outcomes for Latino persons with SCI and their caregivers. These findings can then be used to develop interventions that can be tested in future research to improve the quality of life and health outcomes for family caregivers.</p>
