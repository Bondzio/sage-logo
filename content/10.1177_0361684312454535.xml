            <p>The purpose of our study was to examine the role that child sexual abuse may play in body surveillance and sexual risk behaviors among undergraduate women. First, a measured variable path analysis was conducted, which assessed the relations among a history of child sexual abuse, body surveillance, and sexual risk behaviors. Furthermore, body shame, sexual self-efficacy, and alexithymia were examined as intervening variables. Second, a multigroup path analysis was conducted comparing the hypothesized models applied to data from 556 ethnically diverse women. Within the overall model, results revealed that a history of child sexual abuse and body surveillance were not related to one another, but both variables were directly related to sexual risk behaviors. Moreover, body shame mediated the relationship between body surveillance and alexithymia, and alexithymia mediated the relationship between body shame and sexual self-efficacy. Child sexual abuse history was related directly with body shame and alexithymia. Results from the multigroup path analysis revealed that the model was invariant between African American and White women, although one difference emerged: body surveillance significantly predicted alexithymia in White, but not African American, women. Furthermore, White, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Hispanic/Latina women demonstrated more body shame than African American women, and White women endorsed higher levels of sexual self-efficacy than African American and Asian/Pacific Islander women. Counseling interventions that seek to decrease alexithymic symptoms, body surveillance, and body shame, while also increasing sexual self-efficacy, seem especially warranted.</p>

      <p>Sexual abuse is a widespread and pervasive epidemic that largely affects young girls and women. Approximately one in three American women will experience child sexual abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0361684312454535">Briere &amp; Elliot, 2003</xref>). The psychosocial ramifications of sexual abuse are staggering, and one of the potential consequences is increased sexual risk behaviors (e.g., sexual acts without condoms or under the influence of alcohol or drugs; indiscriminate sexual activity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0361684312454535">Messman-Moore, Coates, Gaffey, &amp; Johnson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0361684312454535">Randolph &amp; Mosack, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0361684312454535">Sikkema, Hansen, Meade, Kochman, &amp; Fox, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0361684312454535">Steel &amp; Herlitz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0361684312454535">van Roode, Dickson, Herbison, &amp; Paul, 2009</xref>). For example, in a longitudinal study that assessed the effects of childhood sexual abuse on adult sexual functioning, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0361684312454535">van Roode et al. (2009)</xref> found that women who experienced child sexual abuse were more likely to have higher numbers of sexual partners, unintended pregnancies, and sexually transmitted infections. They found that sexual risk behaviors were particularly elevated during the life course between 18 and 21 years of age, suggesting that women may be at greater risk during the traditional college years. Child sexual abuse and sexual risk behaviors affect diverse groups of women and have been observed to place White, Latina American, and African American women at greater risk of having multiple sexual partners, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0361684312454535">Wyatt et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
      <p>However, extant studies are equivocal, suggesting that the relationship between sexual abuse and sexual risk behaviors may be direct, indirect, or even nonsignificant. For example, a mediational study found that sexual abuse was associated with greater injected drug use, which was then positively correlated with increased sexual risk behaviors among urban American Indian women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0361684312454535">Simoni, Sehgal, &amp; Walters, 2004</xref>). Another study documented that various forms of trauma, including sexual abuse, were associated with impaired perception of risk behavior (i.e., cognitive difficulties in discerning what constitutes risk behavior), which in turn predicted various risk behaviors, such as substance use and unsafe sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0361684312454535">Smith, Davis, &amp; Fricker-Elhai, 2004</xref>). Littleton, Breitkopf, and Berenson’s (2007) survey of a multiethnic sample of women, aged 18–40, linked sexual risk behaviors with physical, but not with sexual, abuse, and a second study also failed to find a significant relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0361684312454535">Myers et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, further research is needed to understand the relationship between a history of child sexual abuse and sexual risk behaviors.</p>

         <title>Potential Mediators of Abuse History With Sexual Risk</title>
         <p>One important mediating variable may be self-objectification. Objectification theory posits that women exist within a sociocultural context where they are viewed and treated as sexual objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684312454535">Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997</xref>). Child sexual abuse may be viewed as an extreme manifestation of sexual objectification experiences, whereby girls and young women are sexually violated and reduced to their bodies and sexual functioning by others who seek to gain power, control, and sexual satisfaction. Experiences of being sexually objectified by others may then become internalized so that women themselves come to view and treat themselves as sexual objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0361684312454535">Carr &amp; Szymanski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0361684312454535">Hill &amp; Fischer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0361684312454535">Steer &amp; Tiggemann, 2008</xref>)—a process termed self-objectification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684312454535">Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997</xref>). One manifestation of this self-objectification is body surveillance, that is, the physical inspection and evaluation of one’s own body. Although there are numerous studies examining body surveillance, the majority has examined how more routine, commonplace, and persistent experiences of being sexually objectified (e.g., exposure to the objectifying gaze and sexualized media representations) are associated with body surveillance. Research is needed to determine whether more extreme experiences of being sexually objectified, such as being the victim of childhood sexual abuse, are associated with a chronic sense of self-objectification (expressed as body surveillance) and subsequent sexual risk behaviors among women. Thus, we expect that body surveillance will mediate the relationship between child sexual abuse history and sexual risk behaviors.</p>
         <p>Although no known study to date has examined a direct relationship between body surveillance and sexual risk behaviors, one might surmise that if an individual perceives herself or himself as a sexual object, then she or he may engage in more sexually risky behaviors. In other words, the more a woman views and treats herself as a sexual object, the less agency and efficacy (e.g., drawing boundaries, insisting on the use of sexual protection) she may experience in sexual encounters. In turn, she may place herself at greater risk by engaging in unsafe sexual behaviors with partners. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0361684312454535">Wolfe (1997)</xref>, in her book <italic>Promiscuities, </italic>described a complex socialization process in terms of how cultural messages shape women’s sexuality. She argued that women are both encouraged to be sexually available and to objectify themselves and discouraged from negotiating and expressing sexual agency and boundaries. Certainly, such messages regarding women’s sexuality may contribute to a sexualized view of one’s self, which may be associated with increased sexual risk behaviors. However, as Wolfe indicated, viewing one’s self as a sexual object may reduce one’s sexual self-efficacy, which in turn may increase sexual risk. Thus, although self-objectification (expressed as body surveillance) and sexual risk behaviors may be directly related, sexual self-efficacy may at least partially mediate this relationship.</p>
         <p>Sexual self-efficacy is the belief in one’s ability to assert herself or himself during sexual encounters. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0361684312454535">Hirschman, Impett, and Schooler (2006)</xref> found that adolescents who self-objectified were less likely to communicate with their partners about the use of sexual protection. Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0361684312454535">Impett, Schooler, and Tolman (2006)</xref> found that body objectification and the inability to be authentic in romantic relationships were related to decreased sexual self-efficacy, which in turn was associated with less contraceptive and prophylactic use during sexual activity among adolescent women. Furthermore, research has suggested that a history of child sexual abuse is associated with difficulties discussing sexuality and negotiating the use of contraceptive and prophylactic devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0361684312454535">Hovsepian, Blais, Manseau, Otis, &amp; Girard, 2010</xref>). Thus, we predict that sexual self-efficacy will at least partially mediate the relationship between body surveillance and sexual risk behaviors and the relationship between childhood sexual abuse and sexual risk behaviors.</p>
         <p>In addition to sexual self-efficacy, both child sexual abuse history and body surveillance may be associated with symptoms of alexithymia. Alexithymia, which literally means “no words for mood” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0361684312454535">Sifneos, 1973</xref>), is generally conceptualized as cognitive and affective difficulties with identifying and describing emotions, distinguishing between emotional and bodily sensations, and introspective thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0361684312454535">Taylor, Bagby, &amp; Parker, 1991</xref>). Individuals with alexithymia tend to have difficulty reflecting upon and regulating their emotional experiences. In turn, they tend to communicate their emotions ineffectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0361684312454535">Taylor, 2000</xref>).</p>
         <p>A plethora of research has found that child sexual abuse history is associated with higher rates of alexithymia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0361684312454535">Berenbaum, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0361684312454535">Scher &amp; Twaite, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0361684312454535">Zeitlin, McNally, &amp; Cassiday, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0361684312454535">Zlotnick et al., 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0361684312454535">Berenbaum (1996)</xref> explored the relationships among childhood abuse, alexithymia, and personality disorders and found that survivors of childhood abuse were more likely to exhibit alexithymic symptoms than their nonabused counterparts. Scholars have suggested that alexithymic symptoms may represent an attempt to cope with painful emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0361684312454535">Hund &amp; Espelage, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0361684312454535">Scher &amp; Twaite, 1999</xref>) or may be a biological response induced by overwhelming amounts of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0361684312454535">Schwartz &amp; Gay, 1996</xref>), which may be caused by a history of child sexual abuse. Indeed, research has found that child sexual abuse severity is associated with avoidant coping, which was conceptualized as emotional disengagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0361684312454535">Fortier et al., 2009</xref>), and a desire to avoid painful emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0361684312454535">Ligiéro, Fassinger, McCauley, Moore, &amp; Lyytinen, 2009</xref>).Thus, we predict that child sexual abuse history will positively correlate with symptoms of alexithymia.</p>
         <p>In addition to child sexual abuse history, body surveillance may positively correlate with alexithymic symptoms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684312454535">Fredrickson and Roberts (1997)</xref> asserted that body surveillance may result in fewer perceptual resources to gauge internal responses, resulting in a constriction of inner experience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0361684312454535">Muehlenkamp and Saris-Baglama (2002)</xref> explored the relationship between self-objectification and alexithymia. Specifically, these researchers observed that self-objectification, measured via body surveillance and body shame, was associated with more alexithymic symptoms. In addition, alexithymic symptoms were related to increased depression, restrictive eating, and bulimic symptoms. Consistent with prior research, we hypothesize that body surveillance will positively relate to symptoms of alexithymia.</p>
         <p>Experiences of childhood sexual abuse and body surveillance appear to alter not only women’s internal emotional experiences (e.g., alexithymia) and sexual self-efficacy but also their feelings and beliefs about their bodies as well. Research has revealed a strong relationship between child sexual abuse history and body shame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0361684312454535">Andrews, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0361684312454535">Logio, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0361684312454535">Tripp &amp; Petrie, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0361684312454535">Whealin &amp; Jackson, 2002</xref>), as well as between body surveillance and body shame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0361684312454535">Calogero, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0361684312454535">Calogero, Davis, &amp; Thompson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0361684312454535">Moradi, Dirks, &amp; Matteson, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0361684312454535">Whealin and Jackson (2002)</xref> observed that unwanted childhood sexual attention was associated with increased body shame. Moreover, according to objectification theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684312454535">Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997</xref>), the act of surveying one’s body may result in feelings of shame regarding one’s body if she or he feels as though he or she does not meet cultural standards of beauty. The experiences of child sexual abuse history and body surveillance may alter women’s relationships with their bodies, contributing to increased body dissatisfaction and shame. Thus, we predict that both childhood sexual abuse history and body surveillance will positively correlate with body shame.</p>
         <p>As indicated, it is likely that both a history of child sexual abuse and body surveillance will be positively associated with body shame. However, we also predict that body shame may partially mediate the relationships between child sexual abuse history and alexithymia and between body surveillance and alexithymia. Research has revealed a correlation between body image disturbances and alexithymic symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0361684312454535">De Berardis et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684312454535">Augustus-Horvath and Tylka (2009)</xref> found that body shame mediated the relationship between body surveillance and interoceptive awareness (i.e., difficulties distinguishing physiological and emotional states). Although somewhat different concepts, interoceptive awareness and alexithymia share conceptual overlap because both measure difficulties with identifying and describing internal states. Taken together, these results suggest that body shame, perhaps resulting from both a history of child sexual abuse and body surveillance, may also be associated with increased alexithymic symptoms.</p>

            <title>Cultural Variance</title>
            <p>Scholars have posited that ethnic minority women may be at greater risk of experiencing sexual abuse than White women due to racist and sexist images and messages that devalue Women of Color and reduce them to their sexual functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0361684312454535">Root, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0361684312454535">Wyatt, 1985</xref>). However, research regarding prevalence rates of sexual abuse among diverse groups of women has revealed a lack of empirical support that ethnic minority women are at a greater risk of experiencing child sexual abuse than White women. For example, among a multiethnic sample of African American, European American, Hispanic American, and Asian American college women, African American women were more likely to experience child sexual abuse than women in the other ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0361684312454535">Ullman &amp; Filipas, 2005</xref>). In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0361684312454535">Wyatt (1985)</xref> found no difference in child sexual abuse experiences between African American and White women.</p>
            <p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0361684312454535">Wyatt (2009)</xref> suggested that African American women may be at greater risk of engaging in sexual risk behaviors due to their significant history of domination and oppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0361684312454535">hooks, 1981</xref>) and hence potentially muted assertiveness in sexual encounters. Research has found that African American women tend to engage in sexual activity at earlier ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0361684312454535">Taylor-Seehafer &amp; Rew, 2000</xref>) and are less likely to utilize contraceptive devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0361684312454535">Wyatt et al., 2000</xref>) than White or Hispanic women, suggesting that African American women may be at greater risk of engaging in sexual risk behaviors. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0361684312454535">Moreno, El-Bassel, and Morrill (2007)</xref> found that African American women were more likely than Latina American women to have five or more sexual partners within their lifetime (as well as two or more partners in the previous year), to perceive their sexual partners as sexually risky, and to have a history of sexually transmitted infections. In addition, in a multiethnic sample (African American, Chinese, Filipino, Other Asian/Pacific Islander, Latino/Latina, and European American) of adolescents, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0361684312454535">Faryna and Morales (2000)</xref> found that being of African American descent was the strongest predictor for engagement in sexual activity. In contrast to findings indicating that African American women may be at higher risk of sexual risk behaviors than other ethnic groups, other research has found that race is not an independent predictor of sexual risk behaviors or HIV status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0361684312454535">Wyatt et al., 2002</xref>), and in fact, social class may be a stronger predictor of HIV risk behaviors than race or other demographic variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0361684312454535">Ickovics et al., 2002</xref>). Given these mixed findings, further research is warranted to investigate potential ethnic differences in sexual risk behaviors.</p>
            <p>To date, most research on objectification theory has been conducted with samples of predominantly White, undergraduate women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0361684312454535">Heimerdinger-Edwards, Vogel, &amp; Hammer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0361684312454535">Moradi &amp; Huang, 2008</xref>). Thus, there is need to expand objectification theory to Women of Color. Research has found that for African American women, the relationship between appearance esteem and drive for thinness is stronger when self-worth is contingent upon weight and when closely identifying with other ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0361684312454535">Sabik, Cole, &amp; Ward, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0361684312454535">Fitzsimmons and Bardone-Cone (2011)</xref> found that White college women endorsed higher levels of body shame and body dissatisfaction than African American women, whereas no differences emerged between White and African American women in levels of body surveillance and trait anxiety. Their finding regarding body shame is consistent with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0361684312454535">Colabianchi, Ievers-Landis, &amp; Borawski, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0361684312454535">Falconer &amp; Neville, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0361684312454535">Gordon, Castro, Sitnikov, &amp; Holm-Denoma, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0361684312454535">Littleton et al., 2007</xref>); however, other researchers have found higher levels of body surveillance among White than African American women (Breitkopf, Littleton, &amp; Berenson, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0361684312454535">Hebl, King, &amp; Lin, 2004</xref>). Prior research has suggested that White women endorse higher levels of body shame and body surveillance than African American women; however, among both groups of women, body surveillance predicted body shame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0361684312454535">Buchanan, Fischer, Tokar, &amp; Yoder, 2008</xref>).</p>

            <title>Proposed Model</title>
            <p>The purpose of our study is 2-fold: (a) to develop and test a theoretical model that examines how prior experiences of child sexual abuse may contribute to sexual risk behaviors as mediated through body surveillance, sexual self-efficacy, alexithymia, and body shame among our overall multiethnic sample and (b) to examine how this model may vary between two targeted groups of women: African American and White. For the first goal, we predict that child sexual abuse history will directly relate to sexual risk behaviors, although body surveillance will partially mediate this relationship (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0361684312454535">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, we predicted that a history of child sexual abuse and body surveillance will be associated with body shame, alexithymia, and decreased sexual self-efficacy. We also expect that decreased sexual self-efficacy will partially mediate the relationships between child sexual abuse history and sexual risk behaviors, as well as between body surveillance and sexual risk behaviors. Finally, we predict that body shame will partially mediate the relationships between child sexual abuse history and alexithymia and between body surveillance and alexithymia. For the second goal, based on discrepant research, we predict that the paths in the model will be similar for both African American and White women (i.e., we project support for the null hypothesis).</p>

            <title>Participants</title>
            <p>A total of 556 undergraduate women enrolled in a U.S. Southeastern regional public university participated in our study. Their mean age was 20.22 (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.53; range = 18–56), and they were ethnically diverse (239 African American/African American; 171 White; 52 Asian/Pacific Islander; 39 Multiracial; 37 Hispanic/Latina; 9 Middle Eastern; 5 East Indian; 2 Native American; 1 Other West Indian; and 1 did not respond). Given the large subsamples of African American and White women, we conducted our general analyses with both the full sample and separately for the African American and White subsamples. Participants largely identified as heterosexual (518 straight/heterosexual; 27 bisexual; 4 lesbian/gay; 4 did not provide an answer; 2 pan-sexual/omni-sexual; and 1 questioning). Participants’ grade levels were 251 first-year students; 150 sophomores; 98 juniors; 54 seniors; and 3 did not respond. The majority (95%) of participants were single (295 single; 221 single, but in a monogamous dating relationship; 11 single, but in a nonmonogamous dating relationship, 26 married/partnered; 2 separated from partner/spouse; and 1 divorced).</p>

            <title>Procedure and Materials</title>
            <p>Our online survey was approved by the university’s Institutional Review Board. Participants were recruited through a departmental subject pool for course credit. Responses were voluntary and anonymous and, given the sensitive nature of this topic, participants were provided with a list of low-cost mental health and physical health referrals both before beginning the survey and after its completion. The six scales that composed the survey were given in the following order: child sexual abuse history, body surveillance, body shame, sexual risk behaviors, sexual self-efficacy, and alexithymia. Coefficient αs for all study variables can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0361684312454535">Table 1</xref>, both for the full sample and separately for African American and White women.</p>

               <p>Sexual risk behaviors were measured by the Sexual Risk scale (SRS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0361684312454535">Turchik &amp; Garske, 2009</xref>). Within this measure, sexual risk taking behaviors are defined as behaviors that may lead to unintended pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0361684312454535">Turchik &amp; Garske, 2009</xref>). The SRS is a 23-item measure, designed to assess for sexual risk behaviors among college students within the past 6 months. An example is “How many partners have you had sex with?” Although we used a total SRS score, the SRS is composed of five factors: sexual risk taking with uncommitted partners, risky sexual acts, impulsive sexual behaviors, intent to engage in risky sexual behaviors, and risky anal sex acts. As scoring procedures suggested, items were coded into five categories ranging from 0 (<italic>very minimal risk</italic>) to 4 (<italic>high risk</italic>). Per authors’ recommendation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0361684312454535">Turchik &amp; Garske, 2009</xref>), responses to questions regarding prior sexual partners were coded 0 (<italic>no partners</italic>), 1 (<italic>1–2 partners</italic>), 2 (<italic>3–4 partners</italic>), 3 (<italic>5–9 partners</italic>), and 4 (<italic>10 or more partners</italic>). For items assessing the frequency of certain behaviors (e.g., vaginal sex without a condom), responses were coded 0 (<italic>0 times</italic>), 1 (<italic>1–3 times</italic>), 2 (<italic>4–14 times</italic>), 3 (<italic>15–50 times</italic>), and 4 (<italic>51 or more times</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0361684312454535">Turchik &amp; Garske, 2009</xref>).

The SRS has demonstrated internal consistency (α = .88), test–retest reliability over a 2-week period (<italic>r </italic>= .93), convergent (SRS correlated with scales of sexual inhibition, sexual excitation, impulsive sensation seeking, substance use, and sexual desire), and concurrent validity (sexual risk taking over 6 months related to more health consequences), and appears resistant to effects of social desirability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0361684312454535">Turchik &amp; Garske, 2009</xref>).</p>

               <title>Sexual self-efficacy</title>
               <p>Levinson’s (1986) Contraceptive Self-Efficacy scale (CSE) was utilized in order to assesses “the strengths of a girl’s conviction that she can act upon her own sexual needs in a relationship, such as enjoying sex, refusing unwanted sex, and insisting on the use of protection” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0361684312454535">Impett et al., 2006</xref>, p. 136). Although the title of this measure indicates that it measures contraceptive self-efficacy specifically, this scale, in fact, assesses sexual self-efficacy broadly. For example, the CSE, comprising 15 questions, consists of four factors (conscious acceptance of sexual activity by planning for it, assumption of responsibility for the direction of sexual activity and for using contraception, assertiveness in preventing sexual intercourse in an involved situation, and strong feelings of sexual arousal), indicating that it is a broader measure that assesses more than just contraceptive self-efficacy. The CSE has been used with college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684312454535">Heinrich, 1993</xref>), clinical, and school samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0361684312454535">Levinson, Wan, &amp; Beamer, 1998</xref>). Although the CSE consists of four factors, we calculated a total score. Participants rated themselves on a 1 (<italic>not at all true of me</italic>) to 5 (<italic>completely true of me</italic>) scale. An example item is “When I am with a sexual/romantic partner, I feel that I can always be responsible for what happens sexually with him/her.” Responses were totaled whereby higher scores indicate higher levels of sexual self-efficacy, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0361684312454535">Levinson (1986)</xref>. Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0361684312454535">Impett et al.

Modifications to the measure were also made in order to avoid heterosexual bias, whereby the term <italic>boyfriend</italic> was changed to <italic>sexual partner</italic>. The overall CSE has demonstrated adequate internal consistency (α = .73) and predictive validity (i.e., predicted contraceptive behavior) among several samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0361684312454535">Levinson, 1986</xref>).</p>

Twelve participants were removed because they were missing more than 20% of the data. Of these 12, three participants appeared to start the survey, but dropped out after they completed the sexual abuse measure. Eight participants were excluded because they did not meet research criteria (e.g., were not 18 or did not identify as female). Thus, a total of 20 participants were removed. Within the remaining data, some missing data points remained on individual items. Although missing values were minimal, multiple imputations were conducted (i.e., five imputations) utilizing SPSS 18.0. Five iterations of the data set were provided by SPSS 18.0, and we used the fifth iteration to conduct our analyses. Multiple imputation procedures replace missing scores with a value based upon means and variances within the entire sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0361684312454535">Kline, 2005</xref>).</p>
            <p>Research has suggested that age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0361684312454535">Szymanski &amp; Henning, 2007</xref>) and ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0361684312454535">Mitchell &amp; Mazzeo, 2009</xref>) may significantly relate to the variables under investigation. Results revealed that age (α adjusted .05/7 = .007) was significantly correlated with alexithymia (<italic>r </italic>= −.16, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001) and sexual risk behaviors (<italic>r </italic>= .14, <italic>p </italic>= .001). A multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted with the variables under investigation (i.e., childhood sexual abuse, body surveillance, body shame, alexithymia, sexual self-efficacy, and sexual risk behaviors) as the dependent variables and race/ethnicity as the independent variable (i.e., Asian/Pacific Islander, African American, White, Hispanic/Latina, and Multiracial), while controlling for age. Due to unequal sized groups, Pillai’s Trace criterion was utilized to determine effects, and indeed, results revealed an overall main effect for race/ethnicity, <italic>F</italic>(8, 538) = 3.14, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001, Box’s<italic> M</italic> = 144.58, <italic>p </italic>&gt; .05, η<italic>p</italic>

Results revealed that 36 participants were needed in each group to make comparisons, with an effect size of .30, power = .95, and α level of .05. Tukey’s HSD post hoc tests (α adjusted .05/6 = .008) revealed a significant effect for body shame, <italic>F</italic>(8, 538) = 4.90, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001, η<italic>p</italic>
               <sup>2</sup>= .07, power = 1, whereby White women (<italic>M </italic>= 3.19, <italic>SD </italic>= 1.19) endorsed more body shame than African American women (<italic>M </italic>= 2.59, <italic>SD </italic>= 1.19); Asian/Pacific Islander women (<italic>M </italic>= 3.23, <italic>SD </italic>= .17) endorsed more than African American women (<italic>M </italic>= 2.60, <italic>SD </italic>= .08); and Hispanic/Latina women (<italic>M </italic>= 3.19, <italic>SD </italic>= .22) endorsed higher levels of body shame than African American women. Moreover, a significant effect was observed for sexual self-efficacy, <italic>F</italic>(8, 538) = 3.31, <italic>p </italic>= .001, η<italic>p</italic>
               <sup>2 </sup>= .05, power = .98), whereby White women endorsed greater sexual self-efficacy (<italic>M </italic>= 74.12, <italic>SD </italic>= .77) than both Asian/Pacific Islander women (<italic>M </italic>= 66.97, <italic>SD </italic>= 1.37) and African American women (<italic>M </italic>= 70.55, <italic>SD </italic>= .64).</p>

            <p>Means, standard deviations, and partial correlations (controlling for age and adjusting α to control for Type I error [.05/7 = .007]) for the observed variables are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0361684312454535">Table 1</xref>. Partial correlations were conducted within the overall sample (i.e., including all racial/ethnic groups), as well as with African American and White participants separately. Data revealed a nearly nonexistent relationship between a history of child sexual abuse and body surveillance within the overall sample, as well as with African American and White samples. Moreover, sexual self-efficacy and body shame were negatively correlated within the overall sample and among African American women, but not among White women; again, suggesting potential racial/ethnic differences in the relations between these variables, although differences in statistical significance should be interpreted in light of different sample sizes and associated statistical power. All other variables were correlated in the expected directions.</p>
            <p>Next, a path analysis with observed variables was conducted in order to test the hypothesized relationships among the variables of interest. Version 8.80 of LISREL (Linear Structural Relationships) for Microsoft Windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0361684312454535">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 2006</xref>) was used to conduct the path analysis. In order to assess data-to-model fit (i.e., extent to which the data are an adequate fit to the theoretical model), a variety of fit indices were examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0361684312454535">Kline, 2005</xref>). Scholars generally agree that nonsignificant χ<sup>2</sup> values, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) &lt; .05, Normed Fit Index (NFI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and Goodness-of-Fit Index (GFI) scores &gt; .95; and a 90% confidence interval (CI) of RMSEA &lt; .05 are indicative of goodness of fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0361684312454535">Kline, 2005</xref>).</p>
            <p>The theoretical model that included all participants was tested and results indicated that the data did not fit the model well, χ<sup>2</sup>(4) = 81.15, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001; RMSEA = .19; 90% CI for RMSEA = [.15, .22]; CFI = .77; NFI = .77; GFI = .95; and SRMR = .08. Given that the data did not provide an adequate fit to the model, modification indices provided by Lagrange multipliers were consulted in order to determine if adding a path would improve data-to-model fit. Because consulting modification indices result in a data-driven model, only paths that appear conceptually valid were added.</p>
            <p>Modification indices suggested adding a direct path from alexithymia to sexual self-efficacy. Although a somewhat different construct from self-efficacy, extant research suggests that alexithymia may negatively affect self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0361684312454535">Dentale, San Martini, De Coro, &amp; Di Pomponio, 2010</xref>). Whereas self-efficacy is a person’s belief in her own capabilities to meet goals, self-esteem is a marker of an individual’s sense of personal worth. However, research has found that these two constructs are highly related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0361684312454535">Lightsey, Burke, Ervin, Henderson, &amp; Yee, 2006</xref>). Presently, no known research has investigated the relationship between sexual self-efficacy and alexithymia; however, it is likely that cognitive difficulties associated with acknowledging, identifying, describing, and regulating one’s emotions may result in a lower perceived ability to communicate one’s sexual needs and preferences. The addition of this path resulted in an excellent data to model fit, χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 5.89, <italic>p </italic>= .12; RMSEA = .04; 90% CI for RMSEA = [0, .09]; CFI = .99; NFI = .98; GFI = .99; and SRMR = .02. Chi-square significance tests were then conducted comparing the nested models (i.e., original model with modified model). Results revealed that the two models were significantly different from one another, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 556) = 71.12, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001, and therefore the modified model was favored (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0361684312454535">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

            <p>The multigroup comparison was conducted using LISREL 8.80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0361684312454535">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 2006</xref>). Prior to conducting the analysis, both groups were examined separately. Data revealed that the White women’s data were an excellent fit to the model, χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 1.29, <italic>p </italic>= .73; RMSEA = 0; 90% CI for RMSEA = [0, .09]; CFI = 1; NFI = .99; GFI = .99; and SRMR = .01. For African American women, data were also an excellent fit to the model, χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 3.78, <italic>p </italic>= .29; RMSEA = .03; 90% CI for RMSEA = [0, .12]; CFI = .99; NFI = .98; GFI = .99; and SRMR = .02.</p>
            <p>Concluding that the model fit both groups well, we then tested an unconstrained model whereby parameters were allowed to vary across groups. The unconstrained data were an excellent fit to the model, χ<sup>2</sup>(6) = 5.07, <italic>p </italic>= .53; RMSEA = 0; 90% CI for RMSEA = [0, .08]; CFI = 1; NFI = .98; GFI = .99; and SRMR = .02. Of interest, the path from body surveillance to alexithymia was significant for White women, but not for African American women. Next, a constrained model was tested, whereby parallel paths across the two groups were made equivalent. Results revealed an excellent data-to-model fit, χ<sup>2</sup>(18) = 11.66, <italic>p </italic>= .86; RMSEA = 0; 90% CI for RMSEA = [0, .03]; CFI = 1; NFI = .96; GFI = .99; and SRMR = .03. Modification indices were then consulted in order to see if allowing a path to differ between groups would result in a significant improvement in data-to-model fit; modification indices did not suggest releasing a path. Chi-square significance tests controlling for age were then conducted comparing the unconstrained and constrained model. Results revealed a nonsignificant χ<sup>2</sup> difference, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(12) = 6.59, <italic>p </italic>= .36, indicating that the hypothesized relations did not differ significantly between groups (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0361684312454535">Figure 3</xref> for a visual representation of the unconstrained and constrained models).</p>

            <p>In order to examine significant indirect effects, bootstrap procedures were utilized with 5,000 bootstrap samples from the data to compute bias-corrected 95% CIs for indirect effects; if the CIs include zero, then the indirect links are not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0361684312454535">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008</xref>). Bootstrapping procedures were used with the constrained model, as well as with the unconstrained models including African American and White participants. When testing multiple indirect effects, we controlled for age and the additional variables in the model to partial these out as covariates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0361684312454535">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008</xref>). In the constrained model, results revealed that body surveillance did not mediate the relationship between child sexual abuse and sexual risk behaviors (β = 0 × .07 = 0; CI = [−.09, .02]), and sexual self-efficacy did not significantly mediate the relationship between child sexual abuse and sexual risk behaviors (β = .02 × −.04 = −.0008; CI = [−.14, .02]), or the relationship between body surveillance and sexual risk behaviors (β = −.05 × −.04 = .002; CI = [−.09, .48]). Body shame partially mediated the relationship between child sexual abuse history and alexithymia (β = .13 ×.32 = .04; CI [.01, .21]) and fully mediated the relationship between body surveillance and alexithymia (β = .48 ×.32 = .15; CI [1.27, 2.36]). Although not hypothesized initially, alexithymia partially mediated the relationship between body surveillance and sexual self-efficacy (β = .11 × −.41 = −.05; CI [−1.23, −.46]), and partially mediated the relationship between body shame and sexual self-efficacy (β = .31 × −.38 = −.12; CI [−1.43, −.71]). In addition, alexithymia did not significantly mediate the relationship between child sexual abuse and sexual self-efficacy (β = .13 × −.41 = −.05; CI [−.43, .03]), and sexual self-efficacy did not mediate the relationship between alexithymia and sexual risk behaviors (β = −.41 × −.04 = .02; CI [−.04, .11]).</p>
            <p>For the subsample of African American women, data revealed that body shame fully mediated the relationship between body surveillance and alexithymia (β = 46 × .36 = .17; CI [1.21, 2.80]), and alexithymia significantly mediated the relationship between body shame and sexual self-efficacy (β = .36 × −.37 = −.13; CI [−1.82, −.60]). All other pathways were not significantly mediated. For the subsample of White women, body shame significantly mediated the relationship between body surveillance and alexithymia (β = .53 ×.27 = .14; CI [.85, 2.96]), whereas alexithymia significantly mediated the relationship between body surveillance and sexual self-efficacy (β = 20 × −.47 = −.09; CI [−2.41, −.84] and between body shame and sexual self-efficacy (β = .27 × −.47 = −.13; CI [−2.22, −.88]).

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>The purpose of our study was to delineate a model that explained how childhood sexual abuse may contribute to sexual risk behaviors among undergraduate women by including body surveillance, body shame, alexithymia, and sexual self-efficacy as potential mediating variables. Furthermore, given the large number of African American and White women in our sample, as well as research suggesting that these two groups of women may have different experiences with body image and sexual risk behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0361684312454535">Breitkopf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0361684312454535">Colabianchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0361684312454535">Wyatt et al., 2002</xref>, 2009), our model was compared across these two groups of women.</p>
         <p>We hypothesized that body surveillance would partially mediate the relationship between a history of child sexual abuse and sexual risk behaviors; however, our results did not support this hypothesis. Rather, both child sexual abuse history and body surveillance were directly associated with increased sexual risk behaviors within the overall sample, but not within either the African American or White subsamples. This point suggests that there may not have been adequate power within the White and African American subsamples. The finding that there was no relationship between child sexual abuse history and body surveillance was surprising, given that many survivors of child sexual abuse express body image concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0361684312454535">Murray, MacDonald, &amp; Fox, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0361684312454535">Williams &amp; Gleaves, 2003</xref>). It is possible that body surveillance may result from more routine, persistent experiences, such as “cat calls,” the objectifying gaze, and sexualized media representations of women’s bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0361684312454535">Calogero, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0361684312454535">Kozee &amp; Tylka, 2006</xref>) that are not specific to women with a history of childhood sexual abuse. In addition, our finding that body surveillance is directly associated with increased sexual risk behaviors elucidates the harmful effects of internalizing sexualized views and perceptions of women. This finding expands objectification theory, pointing to an important health concern faced by women who exhibit persistent body surveillance.</p>
         <p>An alternative reason for the nonsignificant relationship between childhood sexual abuse and body surveillance may be that a history of child sexual abuse may result in dissociation from the body, as opposed to bodily preoccupation (i.e., body surveillance). Indeed, our data revealed that child sexual abuse history is directly related to alexithymic symptoms, which confirms prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0361684312454535">Fortier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0361684312454535">Hund &amp; Espelage, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0361684312454535">Scher &amp; Twaite, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0361684312454535">Zlotnick et al., 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0361684312454535">Cole and Putnam (1992)</xref> suggested that deficits in identifying and verbalizing one’s emotions could result from the interruption in self-regulation processes caused by abuse. Moreover, alexithymia may occur as a result of overwhelming stress that triggers a numbing response, contributing to feelings of depersonalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0361684312454535">Schwartz &amp; Gay, 1996</xref>). Alexithymic symptoms may be conceptualized as a means of coping with painful affect; that is, in response to painful emotions, an individual may detach from her or his emotional states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0361684312454535">Hund &amp; Espelage, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0361684312454535">Ligiéro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0361684312454535">Scher &amp; Twaite, 1999</xref>).</p>
         <p>Although child sexual abuse history was directly associated with alexithymic symptoms, body shame partially mediated this relationship. This finding is somewhat surprising, given that no relationship was found between body surveillance and a history of child sexual abuse. Body surveillance represents a behavioral inspection of the body, whereas body shame is indicative of painful and shameful feelings regarding the body. To the abuse survivor, the body may represent a mechanism of abuse, which may certainly contribute to feelings of pain, shame, and disgust regarding the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0361684312454535">Young, 1992</xref>). In an effort to cope with this affective response, abuse survivors may disconnect from their internal states, perhaps making it difficult to verbalize and ascertain their thoughts and feelings.</p>
         <p>Our results also demonstrate that body shame fully mediated the relationship between body surveillance and alexithymic symptoms. These findings confirm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684312454535">Fredrickson and Roberts (1997)</xref> assertions and prior research that suggest that internalizing the objectifier’s views of the female body may result in body shame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0361684312454535">Calogero, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0361684312454535">Calogero et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0361684312454535">Moradi et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684312454535">Fredrickson and Roberts (1997)</xref> asserted that body surveillance may decrease internal awareness of one’s internal states. This finding, in particular, confirms prior research that demonstrated that self-objectification (measured by both body surveillance and body shame) was related to increased alexithymia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0361684312454535">Muehlenkamp &amp; Saris-Baglama, 2002</xref>).</p>
         <p>Our data did not provide a good fit to the initial hypothesized model. The addition of the path from alexithymia to sexual self-efficacy significantly improved data-to-model fit, highlighting the importance of this pathway. In other words, difficulties with emotion regulation, identification, and expression were associated with decreased sexual self-efficacy. Although no known research to date has investigated this relationship, the relationship between these two variables conceptually makes sense within an objectification framework. It is likely that diminished awareness of one’s internal emotional states results in difficulty finding women’s voice in sexual and/or romantic relationships or encounters. Certainly, emotional recognition and expression must precede asserting and expressing one’s self when engaged in sexual activity. Again, our data reveal that one’s beliefs, experiences, and feelings about the body are associated with a distancing from one’s emotional states, which may then make it difficult for women to express themselves during sexual encounters.</p>
         <p>The relationship between sexual self-efficacy and sexual risk behaviors was not significant. This finding is peculiar, given prior research suggesting a relationship between sexual self-efficacy and contraceptive use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0361684312454535">Levinson et al., 1998</xref>). One reason for this finding may be due to the way that we measured sexual risk. Prior studies have examined fewer types of sexual risk behaviors, such as number of sexual partners and/or contraceptive and condom use. The Sexual Risk Survey, however, measures a comprehensive collection of risk behaviors (sexual risk taking with uncommitted partners, risky sexual acts, impulsive sexual behaviors, intent to engage in risky sexual behaviors, and risky anal sex acts). It may be that many of these questions did not apply to women within our study. For example, impulsive sexual behaviors, intent to engage in sexual behaviors, and risky anal sex acts are sexual risk behaviors more commonly observed among men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0361684312454535">Turchik &amp; Garske, 2009</xref>). Future research may wish to delineate what forms of sexual risk behaviors are associated with decreased sexual self-efficacy. In addition, the lower reliability of the CSE scale in the present sample may have attenuated the relationship between sexual self-efficacy and sexual risk behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0361684312454535">Levinson, 1986</xref>).</p>

            <title>Between-Group Differences and Cultural Invariance</title>
            <p>Data from our study also revealed a number of findings related to ethnic/racial background that are important to consider. Preliminary analyses suggested that White, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Hispanic/Latina women report more body shame than African American women. These findings are consistent with prior research which suggests that African American women may report less body shame than White women, in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0361684312454535">Breitkopf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0361684312454535">Colabianchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0361684312454535">Falconer &amp; Neville, 2000</xref>). The differences in level of body shame may be due to differing cultural standards of beauty. Scholars have asserted that cultural standards that value shapeliness over the thin ideal have protected African American women from developing body image disturbances and eating disordered behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0361684312454535">Breitkopf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0361684312454535">Gordon et al., 2010</xref>); however, when dominant White standards of beauty are internalized, Women of Color may also experience body image concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0361684312454535">Gilbert, Crump, Madhere, &amp; Schutz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0361684312454535">Rogers Wood &amp; Petrie, 2010</xref>).

Future research may wish to investigate the role of internalization of sociocultural standards of beauty within an objectification framework, while considering the role this may play in Women of Color’s experiences with body image.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, our results demonstrated that White women had higher levels of sexual self-efficacy than Asian/Pacific Islander and African American women. These findings are consistent with prior research suggesting that Asian women may be less likely to use contraceptive devices than other ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0361684312454535">Magoun Moreno, 2000</xref>). This finding may reflect an internalization of racist imagery that depicts Asian women as passive and subservient (e.g., geisha, China doll; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0361684312454535">Chin, 2007</xref>). Moreover, these findings confirm Wyatt’s (2009) assertions that a history of domination and oppression may make it difficult for African American women to embrace their sexual agency and negotiate safe sexual practices within romantic and/or sexual encounters. Thus, future research may examine the links among internalized racism, sexual self-efficacy, and body objectification among Women of Color.</p>
            <p>The multigroup comparison of the hypothesized path model revealed additional findings that are important to keep in mind when working with diverse groups of women. The unconstrained model, meaning that all paths were free to differ between African American and White women, revealed that the data were a good fit to the model for both groups of women. However, the pathway from body surveillance to alexithymia was significant only for White women. Indeed, the larger effect size for White women suggests that there is a stronger relationship between body surveillance for White (<italic>r </italic>= .20) than for African American (<italic>r </italic>= .05) women. For the African American subsample, body shame fully mediated the relationship between body surveillance and alexithymia. These findings suggest that, for White women, but not for African American women, the behavioral act of surveying one’s body is associated with diminished awareness and expression of emotional states. However, for African American women, the behavioral act of surveying one’s body appears correlated with the affective experience of body shame, and this emotion appears to be linked to a desire to disconnect from one’s internal emotional states. Thus, counselors and mental health professionals may wish to pay attention to the roles that body surveillance and body shame play in the development of alexithymic symptoms for African American women. Despite this difference, the constrained data were an excellent fit to the model, suggesting that releasing this pathway to vary across groups would not result in a significant improvement in data-to-model fit. Thus, the model was largely invariant across groups, suggesting similar processes for both African American and White women.</p>

            <title>Strengths, Limitations, and Areas for Future Research</title>
            <p>There are several notable strengths and limitations of our study. In terms of strengths, our study conceptualized child sexual abuse history as a sexual objectification experience. Although scholars have acknowledged that sexual abuse is a form of sexual objectification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684312454535">Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0361684312454535">Hill &amp; Fischer, 2008</xref>), no known study to date has assessed whether a history of child sexual abuse may be associated with body surveillance. An additional strength is the diverse sample represented within the study. Most research on objectification theory has been conducted primarily with White women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0361684312454535">Heimerdinger-Edwards et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0361684312454535">Szymanski, Moffitt, &amp; Carr, 2011</xref>). Therefore, our study adds to the literature because of the inclusion of a large number of Women of Color, mainly African American women.</p>
            <p>Although our study investigated a history of child sexual abuse as a direct sexual objectification experience, it did not include other forms of sexual objectification experiences (e.g., adult sexual abuse, sexual harassment, media representations, objectifying gaze) or abuse experiences (e.g., emotional, physical). Future research may investigate the interaction or combined effects of various sexual objectification experiences on women’s psychological well-being. Another limitation is that our study relied upon a convenience sample of undergraduate women. The overall mean score on the CTQSAS was 7.29, indicating that many participants did not experience child sexual abuse. Approximately 300 participants reported never having experienced childhood sexual abuse (score of 5), whereas others had (score of 6 and above; 46%). Thus, the severe range restriction is a limitation of our study. Among the subscale items, the most frequently endorsed item (40%) was “When I was growing up, someone touched me in a sexual way, or tried to make me touch them.” Therefore, sexual abuse scores in our sample likely reflect a type of sexual abuse that involves inappropriate sexual touching. Despite the range restriction, these percentages are comparable to other studies examining rates of sexual abuse among women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0361684312454535">Balsam, Lehavot, Beadnell, &amp; Circo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0361684312454535">Gould et al., 1994</xref>). Future research, however, may seek to extend our model to a population limited to sexual abuse survivors in order to provide greater clarity regarding the ways that a history of child sexual abuse affects women’s health behavior.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, measurement items were not counterbalanced or presented in randomized fashion. Specifically, participants were first presented with the sexual abuse subscale of the CTQ. Thus, due to the sensitive nature of this topic, participants may have struggled to answer subsequent questions. Despite this possibility, only three participants dropped out after beginning the survey. Furthermore, the lack of counterbalancing may have altered the ways that participants chose to respond to items, which may have influenced the results of our study. In addition, our results suggest that in the overall model there was a direct relationship between body surveillance and sexual risk behaviors, but when this relationship was tested among the African American and White subsamples it was not significant. This finding suggests that there may not have been adequate power within each subsample to detect significance in this relationship.</p>
            <p>Our study variables were strategically placed in our model based upon prior research and theory. However, path analyses rely upon correlational data, and therefore causality cannot be definitively stated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0361684312454535">Kline, 2005</xref>). Thus, there is a need for more longitudinal studies that investigate the effects of childhood sexual abuse upon women’s experiences of self-objectification and body surveillance.</p>

            <title>Practice Implications</title>
            <p>Psychologists and mental health professionals may help clients build insight into how the sociocultural context contributes to sexual objectification (in its various forms) of women, thereby reducing self-blame among clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0361684312454535">Ancis &amp; Jongsma, 2007</xref>). By underscoring the sociocultural context, psychologists and mental health professionals may help their clients understand how sexualized messages may become internalized and then correspond to body shame. Moreover, psychologists and mental health professionals may help their clients understand how child sexual abuse history and self-body surveillance may be associated with increased sexual risk behaviors.</p>
            <p>Interventions aimed at helping clients develop various coping skills that mitigate body-based shame appear important. For example, research suggests that mind/body practices such as yoga and Pilates help improve body satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0361684312454535">Dittmann &amp; Freedman, 2009</xref>) and lower rates of self-objectification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0361684312454535">Daubenmier, 2005</xref>). Psychologists and mental health professionals may also help their clients understand how body shame is associated with more alexithymic symptoms, and how such symptoms may affect clients’ sexual behaviors and practices via decreased sexual self-efficacy. That is, the experience of alexithymia may result in women feeling less assertive in utilizing contraception, in initiating sexual activity, and in having control or a sense of voice in sexual relationships. Interventions aimed at assisting women to identify and verbalize their emotional and physiological experiences seem particularly warranted. Moreover, interventions aimed at encouraging women to negotiate sexual boundaries, preferences, and desires may ultimately foster women’s sexual agency within relationships. Psychologists and mental health professionals should also be mindful that the relationship between body shame and sexual self-efficacy may be particularly important to explore among women. Furthermore, therapists may wish to assess women’s sexual agency within sexual and/or romantic relationships, as well as factors that may contribute to difficulties asserting and expressing one’s self in sexual encounters.</p>

            <title>Conclusion</title>
            <p>Child sexual abuse is an epidemic that greatly affects young girls, and the associated consequences may continue long into adulthood. We were interested in assessing the relationship between child sexual abuse history and sexual risk behaviors, while uncovering the psychological processes that impact this form of risk taking behavior among women, by examining the mediating roles of body surveillance, body shame, alexithymia, and decreased sexual self-efficacy. Specifically, within an objectification theory framework, we conceptualized child sexual abuse as an extreme form of sexual objectification. We were especially interested in the mediating role that body surveillance (an indicator of self-objectification) may play in the relationship between child sexual abuse history and later sexual risk behaviors. Although our findings suggested that this relationship was not significant, they uncovered a number of harmful effects that occur as a result of a history of child sexual abuse and body surveillance. These findings indicate the need to consider these variables—and the relationships among them—in order to empower women in their psychological awareness, emotional expression, and sexual decision making.</p>
