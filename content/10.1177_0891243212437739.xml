<p>In the past 30 years, the literature on paid and unpaid care has grown into an interdisciplinary conversation about <italic>who</italic> carries out care work, <italic>where</italic> it takes place (inside or outside the home; domestically or globally), and whether or not the work is fairly compensated and valued by society. More recently, we have seen an explosion in the number of case studies of <italic>paid</italic> care workers, including home care aides, therapists, nursing home aides, teachers, social workers, nannies, and child care workers. With each study, we learn more about the inequalities associated with paid care and the ways workers manage the physical and relational demands of caring for others.</p>
<p>Despite the contributions of scholars of both paid and unpaid care, the subfield lacks a historical long view. With the exception of Nakano Glenn’s (1992) seminal work on the racial division of reproductive labor, we know little about the way care work—specifically paid care work—changes over time and how the inequalities of race and gender associated with caregiving vary by historical moment. Given this gap, Mignon Duffy’s <italic>Making Care Count: A Century of Gender, Race and Paid Care Work</italic> is an important and much needed addition to research on care. Using U.S. census data from 1900 to 2007, Duffy provides an engaging, meticulous historical account of paid care work since the turn of the twentieth century. More than a description of historical trends, Duffy’s book challenges some of the truisms of the care work literature, while showing that the inequalities associated with caring are as variable as they are persistent.</p>
<p>Duffy begins by reviewing two “stories about care” that pervade contemporary scholarship. The first suggests that the contemporary care crisis is fueled, in part, by the outsourcing of care from families to the market. This marketization argument is proffered by feminist thinkers and conservative pundits alike, who suggest that the decline of the modern family leaves the care of dependent others to paid strangers who do the work in lieu of loved ones. Closely tied to this first story of outsourcing is the second, one that Duffy dubs the “serfdom saved the women’s movement” frame. This story posits that white women have gained greater power in the paid labor market over the past 50 years by offloading responsibility for care to women of color. Both stories, according to Duffy, simplify the transformation of care over the past century and are “not grounded in historical and contemporary evidence” (p. 5). Through her careful historical analysis, Duffy shows how dominant stories of care are inadequate if scholars are to understand how inequality is reproduced in the context of care.</p>
<p>One of the most important “take home” points of Duffy’s book is the distinction between nurturant and non-nurturant care. The literature on care work generally focuses on nurturant care, labor that involves intimate and face-to-face relationships with dependents (childcare, nursing, teaching, etc.). Of equal importance is nonnurturant care, which is the labor that “undergirds nurturant care but may not be relational at all—the work of housekeepers, hospital laundry operatives, nursing home cafeteria workers, and health-care orderlies” (p. 6). Nearly 67 percent of nurturant care workers are U.S.-born whites, whereas only 50 percent of nonnurturant laborers fit this demographic. Nonnurturant jobs outside the home are also fairly evenly distributed between men and women, a fact given very little attention in the existing care work literature. Why does this matter? Duffy explains that non-nurturant care is the “underbelly” of nurturant care; the former props up and sustains the latter. More importantly, status and rewards are unevenly distributed depending on whether one is a nurturant or nonnurturant caregiver. Borrowing from Dorothy Roberts’ conceptualization, Duffy argues that nurturant care is “spiritual labor” that is afforded higher status because of its association with moral purity and altruism. In contrast, nonnurturant care is “menial” labor that is relatively stigmatized and considered “dirty.” Not surprisingly, white women historically have carried out the spiritual labor of nurturant care, whereas their numbers are significantly fewer in nonnurturant, menial occupations. As Duffy points out, if researchers are to understand the inequalities associated with paid care work, it is important that the spectrum of work defined as care be broadened to include the “dirty” nonnurturant jobs carried out disproportionately by men and women of color.</p>
<p><italic>Making Care Count</italic> challenges long-held assumptions about nurturant care work as inherently relational by walking us through the evolution of several caring occupations, including teaching and psychology/psychotherapy. Many nurturant jobs have become relational only as they have become feminized. This gendering of work might lead one to believe that relationality is an obvious source of inequality for women when it comes to care work, and there is ample evidence to support this assertion. But as Duffy reminds us, relationality is used to create and sustain inequalities tied to reproductive labor, at the same time that it is often strategically invoked by certain care workers (especially nonnurturant laborers like housekeepers or hospital food workers) who draw attention to their relational skills as a way of conferring value to their work. It is refreshing to read a book that confronts the complexity of relational work head on, without vilifying or romanticizing it.</p>
<p>Duffy’s book is a must-read for scholars and students of care work, emotions, gender, work/occupations, and racial/ethnic inequality. <italic>Making Care Count</italic> will be recognized as part of the canon of care work scholarship and without a doubt will be cited frequently by care work researchers who want and need the historical analysis Duffy provides.</p>
