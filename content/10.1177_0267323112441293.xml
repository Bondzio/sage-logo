<p>Until about three years ago media research publications with a European theme and even more so, a European outlook, were few and far in between. Long after the Television Without Frontiers Directive was adopted in 1989, it was still common to view media markets as irrevocably national, determined by national supply, regulation and consumption. Failures to establish cross-border media, continuing differences between national media markets and audiences’ observable preference for ‘local’ content were highlighted much more than what was coming to be shared across European borders. Visible transnational features were interpreted as merely structural, others dismissed as exceptions. Even cross-border research mostly reaffirmed the national outlook on the media. Comparative research but also compilations of European media identified and stressed differences between national media markets rather than their commonalities. For two decades after the Directive came into power and while media markets were undergoing sustained processes of globalization, the dominant research paradigm was still national; there was no fundamental revision in either outlook or methodology. But this is finally changing.</p>
<p>In the last few years, a growing number of books have been published concerned with European media policy and media markets (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267323112441293">Keller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267323112441293">Pauwels et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267323112441293">Rooke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267323112441293">Terzis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267323112441293">Trappel et al., 2010</xref>), political discourse and the European public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267323112441293">Bondebjerg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267323112441293">Gripsrud and Weibull, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267323112441293">Koopmans and Statham, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267323112441293">Triandafyllidou et al., 2009</xref>) and media representations and European identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267323112441293">Sukosd and Jakubowicz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267323112441293">Uricchio, 2009</xref>). Also a sign of the new research paradigm, in recent years most academic publishers have launched European and global media and communications series.</p>
<p>Among this now soundly establishing field, two veteran scholars of European communications policy and early exceptions to the rule, Stylianos Papathanassopoulos and Ralph Negrine, have used their great expertise to publish a comprehensive account of European communications policy. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267323112441293">Rooke (2009)</xref>, another pro-European, they opt for a European outlook rather than the traditional (national) comparative approach, tackling a range of related, complex issues, including the processes of Europeanization and convergence, the possibility of truly European media, the contestable existence and the form of a European public sphere and the possibility of an emerging European identity. While differences between national markets are acknowledged and raised throughout the book, the focus is on similarities, on common problems and opportunities.</p>
<p>Apart from the refreshing pan-European perspective and the ambitious and successful attempt to cover the various related themes in one book, a strong point of this publication is the breadth of both the media and the timescale covered, all supported by a wealth of data, examples and sources. Part I of the book sums up the political economy of the media in Europe, looking at the structures of the old and the new media. It is in this section in particular that the vast knowledge of the authors shows. The historical account of the political economy of the media is succinct and informative, something not easy to achieve given the scale of media and legislative documents the authors cover. Moreover, Papathanassopoulos and Negrine have to be commended for including new media, like IPTV, mobile TV, online news and other digital services, for which Chapter 3 provides an illuminating and up-to-date overview.</p>
<p>After having set the context with some key structural developments, Part II focuses on the Europeanization of the media in Europe, looking at policy on media ownership, public service broadcasting and other concerns of audiovisual policy, the media sector where the EU has been most active. In line with the cultural concerns of the book, a whole chapter is dedicated to content production and regulation, and there is also a valuable chapter on media consumption. Like in Part I, there is a wealth of data here, drawn from a wide range of public institutions and industry research bodies. A few things would have improved this part in my opinion, though. For one, the many interesting statistics could have been used more meticulously. More accurate headings for the tables and graphs would have been helpful, as would have been more detailed information at times on where and how data were collated. Some commenting on the reliability or comparability of data would also have been welcome, so as not to leave readers with the wrong impression that all numerical data are objective, easy to collate and to compare. Similarly, no indication is given of the dearth of data in certain areas, something I would consider important for those interested or involved in policy. One outcome of lack of data, at least from the key public institutions, shows in the omission here of the significant achievement of several European countries in regard to format trade. The UK has been the number one exporter of formats globally for years now, surpassing the US by far. The Netherlands have been second in ranking, and other European countries, too, have had notable commercial successes. On the other hand, light entertainment, a genre that has grown substantially during the last decade both in quantity and in its significance for broadcasters across Europe, remains unacknowledged and hence unquestioned. Few data exist on these changes. Most light entertainment programmes are based on international formats, and though nationally produced, are hence shared across Europe. Should we see them as contributing to the emergence of a European public sphere and a European identity? Or, from a national policy perspective, are they ‘good enough’ domestic content? Finally, as in Part I, the agency focus is on official, government policy-makers; industry lobbying and the enormous commercial drive to Europeanize and globalize the media are not given sufficient recognition in my view.</p>
<p>The third and last part of the book tackles the controversial issue of Europe as a cultural and political project. Addressing public communication and representation, the authors explore debates about the role of the media in the formation of a European public sphere and a European identity. Throughout, they nicely highlight differences in both expectations and in the assessment of what has been achieved thus far, making for a valuable overview of arguments and opinions in the field. Researchers concerned with media and identity specifically will probably wish that Chapter 8 was a little more advanced theoretically. Nevertheless, the overview provided of debates and research from around Europe makes for interesting reading and should be seen as a valuable introduction to the field.</p>
<p>Overall, Papathanassopoulos and Negrine do well in situating their European focus within broader processes of globalization in the media. By arguing that ‘the process of Europeanization and of European integration can be seen as an extension of the globalization debate’ (p. 10) the authors not only make a crucial point but also highlight important connections between Europeanization and globalization, between global, regional and national media processes. The reader is offered a rare pan-European and pro-European perspective that at the same time does not fail to acknowledge and address the significance of both national and global influences.</p>
<p>To conclude, Papathanassopoulos and Negrine’s book is commendable for its breadth and wealth of information. Fulfilling their laudable and ambitious aim to provide a synthesis of the development of the European media, a European public sphere and European identity, the authors offer a succinct historical account of the structures and dynamics of the media in Europe and an excellent overview of debates and academic research on the emergence of a European public sphere and European identity. As to the above criticism, it has to be recognized that breadth always comes at the cost of some detail. The book is well structured, well written and accessible, with differences in interpretation and opinion nicely highlighted. As such it is a highly valuable and recommendable text for students and others looking for an introduction and an overview of European media and debates surrounding it.</p>
